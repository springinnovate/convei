TI  - An assessment on oil spill trajectory prediction: Case study on oil spill off Ennore Port
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) tanker and a chemical tanker collided two nautical miles off Ennore port on 28 January, 2017. Around 196.4 metric tons (MT) of Heavy Furnace Oil (HFO) was spilled and drifted towards the shore. Oil spill drift advisory and prediction was made by Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) using General National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME), an oil spill trajectory model. The trajectory model was forced with analysed and forecasted ocean currents from Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) based on Modular Ocean Model 4p1 (GM4p1). It was found that spread of HFO obtained from oil spill trajectory model GNOME, has matched well with the observed spread from Sentinel-1A satellite dataset. However, the spread of the HFO was underestimated by the trajectory model, when forced with forecasted GM4p1 currents. Additional ground truth observation from Indian Coast Guard also corroborates this finding.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-2A data for pasture biomass monitoring using a physically based radiative transfer model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A large proportion of the global land surface is covered by pasture. The advent of the Sentinel satellites program provides free datasets with good spatiotemporal resolution that can be a valuable source of information for monitoring pasture resources. We combined optical remote sensing data (proximal hyperspectral and Sentinel 2A) with a radiative transfer model (PROSAIL) to estimate leaf Area Index (LAI), and biomass, in a dairy farming context. Three sites in Southern England were used: two pasture farms that differed in pasture type and management, and a set of small agronomy trial plots with different mixtures of grasses, legumes and herbs, as well as pure perennial ryegrass. The proximal and satellite spectral data were used to retrieve LAI via PROSAIL model inversion, which were compared against field observations of LAI. The potential of bands of Sentinel 2A that corresponded with a 10 m resolution was studied by convolving narrow spectral bands (from a handheld hyperspectral sensor) into Sentinel 2A bands (10 m). Retrieved LAI, using these spectrally resampled S2A data, compared well with measured LAI, for all sites, even for those with mixed species cover (although retrieved LAI was somewhat overestimated for pasture mixtures with high LAI). This proved the suitability of 10 m Sentinel 2A spectral bands for capturing LAI dynamics for different types of pastures. We also found that inclusion of 20 m bands in the inversion scheme did not lead to any further improvement in retrieved LAI. Sentinel 2A image based retrieval yielded good agreement with LAI measurements obtained for a typical perennial ryegrass based pasture farm. LAI retrieved in this way was used to create biomass maps (that correspond to indirect biomass measurements by Rising Plate Meter (RPM)), for mixed-species paddocks for a farm for which limited field data were available. These maps compared moderately well with farmer-collected RPM measurements for this farm. We propose that estimates of paddock-averaged and within-paddock variability of biomass are more reliably obtained from a combined Sentinel 2A-PROSAIL approach, rather than by manual RPM measurements. The physically based radiative transfer model inversion approach outperformed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index based retrieval method, and does not require site specific calibrations of the inversion scheme.

TI  - Local-Regional Metastases and Mortality After Sentinel Biopsy and Complete Dissection of Axillary Lymph Nodes in Patients with Early Invasive Breast Cancer.
T2  - Materia socio-medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current, standard procedure for evaluation of axillary lymph node pathological (PH) status has been sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). To demonstrate the long-term validity of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using the radioactive isotope only Technetium 99m albumin-colloid (Tc99m) we compared the loco-regional recurrence and mortality of breast cancer patients with negative SLNB without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (SLNB group) to that of lymph node-positive patients undergoing ALND (ALND group).AIM: The aim of our study is to evaluate the results of long-term monitoring of patients with early invasive breast cancer in which the radio-actively guided axillary SLN biopsy and complete ALND were studied, with special emphasis on local-regional recurrence and mortality.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a total of 63 patients with T1-2early invasive breast cancer diagnosed at Clinic for general and abdominal surgery, Clinical Center University of Sarajevo (CCUS) between 2004 and 2007, with follow-up till 2013, retrospectively, who met the criteria for inclusion. Preoperative peritumorous injection of radioactive isotope (Tc99m albumin-colloid) is done on the Clinic for Endocrine and Nuclear Medicine-CCUS. Intra and postoperative pathohistological (PH)examination of SLN node (or nodes) and PH examination of lymph nodes after complete ALND was done at the Clinic for Clinical Pathology and Cytology-CCUS. Statistical evaluation was done by statistical program MedCalc Statistical Software, version 18.10. Depending on the given variables were used: mean, standard deviation, median values, 95% CI for median value, Chi-square test, D'Agostino-Pearson test, Kaplan-Maier curve of survival. Defined level of significance was p<0,05.RESULTS: The SLNB group consisted of 33 SLN-negative women and ALND group consisted of 30 axillary lymph node-positive women. The sentinel node identification rate was 100%. In the SLNB group no patients has developed axillary recurrence during the follow-up. The mortality rate in the SLNB group was equivalent to that in the ALND group.CONCLUSIONS: The SLN biopsy conducted with only a radioactive isotope TC 99m have the same results as loco-regional recurrence and mortality as well as the complete ALND method and may be the method of choice for the treatment of axillary in breast cancer patients and the clinically negative axillary lymph node (or nodules) with the notion that patients should be micro metastases given special attention during long-term monitoring.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>1</sub> concentrations from MODIS over Yangtze River Delta of China during 2014-2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to the space-borne estimation of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m), the investigation of PM (<= 1 mu m) remains less intensive and thus unclear. Here we estimated four years (2014-2017) of ground-level PM1 concentrations from MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) in attempt to gain a better understanding of much finer particles. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, with a relatively dense ground-based PM1 station network, was selected as the study area. The geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model simultaneously accounting for spatial and temporal variability existing within various predictors was constructed. Validation of satellite-estimated PM(1 )against ground-measured PM1 yields a high consistence, significant improvement over previous work (R-2 = 0.74 VS 0.59, RMSE = 13.02 mu g/m(3) VS 22.5 mu g/m(3)). This suggests the PM1 estimates from GTWR model are reliable and robust enough to obtain large-scale fine particle contents. The population exposure of air pollution in the YRD region, therefore, has been analyzed by calculating population-weighted mean PM1 concentrations, which reaches as high as 37.22 mu g/m(3). Further analysis indicates that near half the people live in locations with high-level PM1 concentration (> 35 mu g/m(3)), which has profounding implication for improving our understanding of human exposure to fine aerosol particles.

TI  - Field Evaluation of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Platform for the Detection of <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i> Infection in <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i> Snails
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Schistosoma infection in snails can be monitored by microscopy or indirectly by sentinel mice. As both these approaches can miss infections, more sensitive tests are needed, particularly in low-level transmission settings. In this study, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique, designed to detect a specific 28S ribosomal Schistosoma japonicum (Sj28S) gene with high sensitivity, was compared to microscopy using snail samples from 51 areas endemic for schistosomiasis in five Chinese provinces. In addition, the results were compared with those from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by adding DNA sequencing as a reference. The testing of pooled snail samples with the LAMP assay showed that a dilution factor of 1/50, i.e., one infected snail plus 49 non-infected ones, would still result in a positive reaction after the recommended number of amplification cycles. Testing a total of 232 pooled samples, emanating from 4006 snail specimens, showed a rate of infection of 6.5%, while traditional microscopy found only 0.4% positive samples in the same materials. Parallel PCR analysis confirmed the diagnostic accuracy of the LAMP assay, with DNA sequencing even giving LAMP a slight lead. Microscopy and the LAMP test were carried out at local schistosomiasis-control stations, demonstrating that the potential of the latter assay to serve as a point-of-care (POC) test with results available within 60-90 min, while the more complicated PCR test had to be carried out at the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases (NIPD) in Shanghai, China. In conclusion, LAMP was found to be clearly superior to microscopy and as good as, or better than, PCR. As it can be used under field conditions and requires less time than other techniques, LAMP testing would improve and accelerate schistosomiasis control.

TI  - Retrieval of Similar Evolution Patterns from Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Technological evolution in the remote sensing domain has allowed the acquisition of large archives of satellite image time series (SITS) for Earth Observation. In this context, the need to interpret Earth Observation image time series is continuously increasing and the extraction of information from these archives has become difficult without adequate tools. In this paper, we propose a fast and effective two-step technique for the retrieval of spatio-temporal patterns that are similar to a given query. The method is based on a query-by-example procedure whose inputs are evolution patterns provided by the end-user and outputs are other similar spatio-temporal patterns. The comparison between the temporal sequences and the queries is performed using the Dynamic Time Warping alignment method, whereas the separation between similar and non-similar patterns is determined via Expectation-Maximization. The experiments, which are assessed on both short and long SITS, prove the effectiveness of the proposed SITS retrieval method for different application scenarios. For the short SITS, we considered two application scenarios, namely the construction of two accumulation lakes and flooding caused by heavy rain. For the long SITS, we used a database formed of 88 Landsat images, and we showed that the proposed method is able to retrieve similar patterns of land cover and land use.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of High Resolution WorldView-3 Imagery for Estimating Yield of Mango
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-harvest yield estimation of mango fruit is important for the optimization of inputs and other resources on the farm. Current industry practice of visual counting the fruit on a small number of trees for yield forecasting can be highly inaccurate due to the spatial variability, especially if the trees selected do not represent the entire crop. Therefore, this study evaluated the potential of high resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery to estimate yield of mango by integrating both geometric (tree crown area) and optical (spectral vegetation indices) data using artificial neural network (ANN) model. WV3 images were acquired in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 growing seasons at the early fruit stage from three orchards in Acacia Hills region, Northern Territory, Australia. Stratified sampling technique (SST) was applied to select 18 trees from each orchard and subsequently ground truthed for yield (kg center dot tree(-1)) and fruit number per tree. For each sampled tree, spectral reflectance data and tree crown area (TCA) was extracted from WV3 imagery. The TCA was identified as the most important predictor of both fruit yield (kg center dot tree(-1)) and fruit number, followed by NDVI red-edge band when all trees from three orchards in two growing seasons were combined. The results of all sampled trees from three orchards in two growing seasons using ANN model produced a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.68 for total fruit yield (kg center dot tree(-1)) and fruit number respectively), which suggest that the model can be obtained to predict yield on a regional level. On orchard level also the ANN model produced a high correlation when both growing seasons were combined. However, the model developed in one season could not be applied in another season due to the influence of seasonal variation and canopy condition. Using the relationship derived from the measured yield parameters against combined VIs and TCA data, the total fruit yield (tha(-1)) and fruit number were estimated for each orchard, produced 7% under estimation to less than 1% over estimation. The accuracy of the findings showed the potential of WV3 imagery to better predict the yield parameters than the current practice across the mango industry as well as to quantify lost yield as a result of delayed harvest.

TI  - Hydrologic model predictability improves with spatially explicit calibration using remotely sensed evapotranspiration and biophysical parameters
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A hydrologic model, calibrated using only streamflow data, can produce acceptable streamflow simulation at the watershed outlet yet unrealistic representations of water balance across the landscape. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of multi-objective calibration using remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) and gaged streamflow data to spatially improve the water balance. However, methodological clarity on how to "best" integrate ET data and model parameters in multi-objective model calibration to improve simulations is lacking. To address these limitations, we assessed how a spatially explicit, distributed calibration approach that uses (1) remotely sensed ET data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and (2) frequently overlooked biophysical parameters can improve the overall predictability of two key components of the water balance: streamflow and ET at different locations throughout the watershed. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), previously modified to represent hydrologic transport and filling-spilling of landscape depressions, in a large watershed of the Prairie Pothole Region, United States. We employed a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments to isolate the effects (on streamflow and simulated ET) of integrating biophysical parameters and spatially explicit remotely sensed ET data into model calibration. Results suggest that the inclusion of biophysical parameters involving vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms tend to increase model accuracy. Furthermore, we found that using a lumped, versus a spatially explicit, approach for integrating ET into model calibration produces a sub-optimal model state with no potential improvement in model performance across large spatial scales. However, when we utilized the same MODIS ET datasets but calibrated each sub-basin in the spatially explicit approach, water yield prediction uncertainty decreased, including a distinct improvement in the temporal and spatial accuracy of simulated ET and streamflow. This further resulted in a more realistic simulation of vegetation growth when compared to MODIS Leaf-Area Index data. These findings afford critical insights into the efficient integration of remotely sensed "big data" into hydrologic modeling and associated watershed management decisions. Our approach can be generalized and potentially replicated using other hydrologic models and remotely sensed data resources - and in different geophysical settings of the globe.

TI  - Eco-Hydrological Footprint of a River Basin in Western Ghats
T2  - YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Eco-Hydrological footprint of a river basin refers to the hydrologic regime for sustaining vital ecological functions considering the appropriation of water by biotic components (including humans). It provides crucial information about the ecological status of a river, while addressing the divergence from natural conditions of the actual hydrological regime. Thus, this highlights the implicit relationship of hydrologic regime in meeting the demand of the biota. Unplanned developmental activities have altered the catchment integrity which has threatened the regional water security due to the conversion of perennial streams to seasonal ones. This has necessitated prudent catchment management strategies to maintain the ecological water requirements so as to maintain the aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity and to sustain water resources. The skewed strategies oriented mainly towards societal benefits have led to large-scale degradation of the landscape. Large-scale alterations of the landscape structure have led to erosion in the ecosystem supportive capacity that plays a major role in sustaining the hydrological regime. Insights of eco-hydrological footprint in the catchment would aid in formulating policies to sustain the hydrologic regime and natural resources. The current study focuses on the assessment of the eco-hydrological footprint in the Kali River of central Western Ghats, Karnataka. Land use dynamics assessment using the temporal remote sensing data of four decades reveal decline of evergreen forest cover from 61.8 percent to 37.5 percent in the Kali river basin between 1973-2016. Computation of eco-hydrological indices shows that the sub-catchments in the Ghats with higher proportion of forest cover with native species has a better eco-hydrological index as against the plain. This highlights the vital ecological function of a catchment in sustaining the hydrologic regime when covered with the vegetation of native species. The presence of perennial streams in sub-catchment dominated by native vegetation compared to the seasonal streams in the catchment dominated by anthropogenic activities with monoculture plantations. Eco-Hydrological Status/Hydrological footprint reflected similar results as that of the eco hydrological index demonstrating the role of forests in maintaining the hydrological regime. Inter annual water budgeting across sub basins showed that the Ghats and Coastal areas are sustainable with perennial waters in the river as against the plains in the east which showed deficit of resource indicating water stress.

TI  - A satellite stand-alone procedure for deriving net radiation by using SEVIRI and MODIS products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a new stand-alone satellite approach for the estimation of net surface radiation (R-n) has been implemented and validated for the Italian territory. The method uses the MODIS and MSG-SEVIRI time series products and it is independent of the use of ancillary data (i.e. ground measurements). A database of daily measurements of R-n, provided by 9 stations of the FLUXNET network, was used to validate the method in different ecological scenarios in the period 2010-12.The R-n modelled by the proposed approach and the corresponding FLUXNET measurements were in good agreement, with RMSE and R-2 of 19.8 Wm(-2) and 0.87, respectively, at 8-days scale, and 23.3 Wm(-2) and 0.92, respectively, at daily scale.Therefore, the proposed approach can be considered effective for the estimation of spatial and temporal variability of R-n, which is a key variable related to the management of water resources, agriculture, ecology and climate change.

TI  - A data mining approach for global burned area mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global burned are algorithms provide valuable information for climate modellers since fire disturbance is responsible of a significant part of the emissions and their related impact on humans. The aim of this work is to explore how four different classification algorithms, widely used in remote sensing, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN) and a well-known decision tree algorithm (C5.0), for classifying burned areas at global scale through a data mining methodology using 2008 MODIS data. A training database consisting of burned and unburned pixels was created from 130 Landsat scenes. The resulting database was highly unbalanced with the burned class representing less than one percent of the total. Therefore, the ability of the algorithms to cope with this problem was evaluated.Attribute selection was performed using three filters to remove potential noise and to reduce the dimensionality of the data: Random Forest, entropy-based filter, and logistic regression. Eight out of fifty-two attributes were selected, most of them related to the temporal difference of the reflectance of the bands. Models were trained using an 80% of the database following a ten-fold approach to reduce possible overfitting and to select the optimum parameters.Finally, the performance of the algorithms was evaluated over six different regions using official statistics where they were available and benchmark burned area products, namely MCD45 (V5.1) and MCD64 (V6). Compared to official statistics, the best agreement was obtained by MCD64 (OE = 0.15, CE = 0.29) followed by RF (OE = 0.27, CE = 0.21). For the remaining three areas (Angola, Sudan and South Africa), RF (OE = 0.47, CE = 0.45) yielded the best results when compared to the reference data. NN and SVM showed the worst performance with omission and commission error reaching 0.81 and 0.17 respectively. SVM and NN showed higher sensitivity to unbalanced datasets, as in the case of burned area, with a clear bias towards the majority class. On the other hand, tree based algorithms are more robust to this issue given their own mechanisms to deal with big and unbalanced databases.

TI  - Improving the Performance of 3-D Radiative Transfer Model FLIGHT to Simulate Optical Properties of a Tree-Grass Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 3-D Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) FLIGHT can represent scattering in open forest or savannas featuring underlying bare soils. However, FLIGHT might not be suitable for multilayered tree-grass ecosystems (TGE), where a grass understory can dominate the reflectance factor (RF) dynamics due to strong seasonal variability and low tree fractional cover. To address this issue, we coupled FLIGHT with the 1-D RTM PROSAIL. The model is evaluated against spectral observations of proximal and remote sensing sensors: the ASD Fieldspec((R)) 3 spectroradiometer, the Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2. We tested the capability of both PROSAIL and PROSAIL+FLIGHT to reproduce the variability of different phenological stages determined by 16-year time series analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI). Then, we combined concomitant observations of biophysical variables and RF to test the capability of the models to reproduce observed RF. PROSAIL achieved a Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) between 6% to 32% at proximal sensing scale. PROSAIL+FLIGHT RRMSE ranged between 7% to 31% at remote sensing scales. RRMSE increased in periods when large fractions of standing dead material mixed with emergent green grasses especially in autumn; suggesting that the model cannot represent the spectral features of this material. PROSAIL+FLIGHT improves RF simulation especially in summer and at mid-high view angles.

TI  - Comparison of the GPM IMERG Final Precipitation Product to RADOLAN Weather Radar Data over the Topographically and Climatically Diverse Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation measurements provide crucial information for hydrometeorological applications. In regions where typical precipitation measurement gauges are sparse, gridded products aim to provide alternative data sources. This study examines the performance of NASA's Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (IMERG, GPM) satellite precipitation dataset in capturing the spatio-temporal variability of weather events compared to the German weather radar dataset RADOLAN RW. Besides quantity, also timing of rainfall is of very high importance when modeling or monitoring the hydrologic cycle. Therefore, detection metrics are evaluated along with standard statistical measures to test both datasets. Using indices like probability of detection allows a binary evaluation showing the basic categorical accordance of the radar and satellite data. Furthermore, a pixel-by-pixel comparison is performed to assess the ability to represent the spatial variability of rainfall and precipitation quantity. All calculations are additionally carried out for seasonal subsets of the data to assess potentially different behavior due to differences in precipitation schemes. The results indicate significant differences between the datasets. Overall, GPM IMERG overestimates the quantity of precipitation compared to RADOLAN, especially in the winter season. Moreover, shortcomings in detection performance arise in this season with significant erroneously-detected, yet also missed precipitation events compared to the weather radar data. Additionally, along secondary mountain ranges and the Alps, topographically-induced precipitation is not represented in GPM data, which generally shows a lack of spatial variability in rainfall and snowfall estimates due to lower resolution.

TI  - Emerging Role of IL-4-Induced Gene 1 as a Prognostic Biomarker Affecting the Local T-Cell Response in Human Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have emphasized the importance of immune composition of the melanoma microenvironment for clinical outcome. The contribution of IL4I1, a phenylalanine oxidase with immunoregulatory functions, has not been yet explored. Here we studied a primary cutaneous melanoma series from stage I-III patients to investigate the association between in situ IL4I1 expression and clinical parameters or tumor-infiltrating T-cell subsets. IL4I1 was detected in 87% of tumors and was mainly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages and very rare FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells. The proportion of IL4I1(+) cells was higher in patients with an ulcerated melanoma or with a positive sentinel lymph node and tended to correlate with a rapid relapse and shorter overall survival. This proportion also correlated positively with the presence of regulatory T cells and negatively with the presence of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells. The location of IL4I1(+) cells may also be relevant to predict prognosis, because their presence near tumor cells was associated with sentinel lymph node invasion and higher melanoma stage. Collectively, our data show that IL4I1(+) cells shape the T-cell compartment and are associated with a higher risk of poor outcome in melanoma, supporting a key role for IL4I1 in immune evasion.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Regional Apparent Thermal Inertia and Gravity for Mapping Different Rock Types in Parts of Banswara, Rajasthan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, utility of satellite derived Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) and residual gravity data have been analyzed for delineating the major rock types of Aravalli Supergroup. Density is a common contributing factor responsible for ATI and gravity variations of rock types. In addition to density, thermal inertia is also controlled by specific heat and thermal conductivity. In the present study, MODIS (Moderate resolution imaging spectrometer) day and consecutive night time land surface temperature (LST), albedo data have been processed to derive ATI image for the study area. On the other hand, Bouguer gravity generated from EIGEN6C4 gravity model data is processed to derive the residual gravity over the study area. It has been observed that ATI values of different rock types are influenced by the variations in weathering pattern and forest cover developed over the rock in addition to the thermophysical parameters of rocks. Forest cover and agricultural activity are responsible for shifting the ATI values to higher side for any rocks due to evapotranspiration; which is responsible for reducing day and night land surface temperature difference. ATI pixels( collected from large rock pavements) of different rocks can however, be used to discriminate them from each other. Conjugate analysis of residual gravity and ATI has been proved useful to discriminate different rock types of spatially well distributed rock exposures. It is found that ATI and gravity values are well correlated for the spatially large surface exposures of rocks. In regional scale, low frequency changes of ATI broadly matches with the changes observed on the corresponding spatial profiles of residual gravity with some localized variations. This is due to the fact that shallow surface gravity anomaly is cumulative effect of vertical and horizontal variations of density in contrast to ATI which is more sensitive to near surface density, conductivity and specific heat variations of rocks. Moreover, high frequency variations imprinted on regional ATI spatial profiles are due to the cumulative effect of complex thermophysical properties of surface elements (weathering residuum, surface moisture variations) density variation and intrinsic thermophysical properties of rocks measured at regional scale. High frequency changes of ATI do not correspond well with residual gravity variation.

TI  - Does grazing cause land degradation? Evidence from the sandy <i>Ferlo</i> in Northern Senegal
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been widely asserted that a high grazing pressure has led to a reduction in vegetation production at decadal time scales, implying land degradation, in African drylands, and in the Sahel in particular. We test this hypothesis by analyzing spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation production in the northwestern Ferlo in Senegal. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) patterns, here used to represent vegetation production, were determined on the basis of Earth observation MODIS and PROBA-V data. Furthermore, woody cover was assessed by very high spatial resolution (VHR) imagery. Because livestock is concentrated around deep wells in the dry season for watering, while for management they concentrate daily around pastoral family settlements or camps all year round, we studied the dependence of NDVI on distance from deep wells and camps. Locations of wells and camps were determined by visual inspection of VHR images. We found that ` inverse grazing gradients,' defined as decreasing NDVI/ production with increasing distance, dominated both around wells and camps. Further, we found neither decrease nor increase in woody cover with distance to wells. Both positive and negative trends in wet season NDVI over the period 2000-2016 were identified within the study area, yet temporal trends were predominantly positive in proximity to deep wells. Around pastoral camps, positive NDVI trends were generally elevated relative to the regional average. The results question the validity of claims that high grazing pressure causes land degradation at the landscape scale, yet they show that grazing does lead to substantial spatial redistribution of vegetation production.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Approach for Mapping the Development of Ancient Water Management in the Near East
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel approach that uses remote sensing to record and reconstruct traces of ancient water management throughout the whole region of Northern Mesopotamia, an area where modern agriculture and warfare has had a severe impact on the survival of archaeological remains and their visibility in modern satellite imagery. However, analysis and interpretation of declassified stereoscopic spy satellite data from the 1960s and early 1970s revealed traces of ancient water management systems. We processed satellite imagery to facilitate image interpretation and used photogrammetry to reconstruct hydraulic pathways. Our results represent the first comprehensive map of water management features across the entirety of Northern Mesopotamia for the period ca. 1200 BC to AD 1500. In particular, this shows that irrigation was widespread throughout the region in the Early Islamic period, including within the zone traditionally regarded as rain-fed. However, we found that a high proportion of the ancient canal systems had been damaged or destroyed by 20th century changes to agricultural practices and land use. Given this, there is an urgent need to record these rapidly vanishing water management systems that were an integral part of the ancient agricultural landscape and that underpinned powerful states.

TI  - Evaluation of Three-Hourly TMPA Rainfall Products Using Telemetric Rain Gauge Observations at Lai Nullah Basin in Islamabad, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods which occur due to heavy rainfall in hilly and semi-hilly areas may prove deleterious when they hit urban centers. The prediction of such localized and heterogeneous phenomena is a challenge due to a scarcity of in-situ rainfall. A possible solution is the utilization of satellite-based precipitation products. The current study evaluates the efficacy of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) three-hourly products, i.e., 3B42 near-real-time (3B42RT) and 3B42 research version (3B42V7) at a sub-daily time scale. Various categorical indices have been used to assess the capability of products in the detection of rain/no-rain. Hourly rain rates are assessed by employing the most commonly used statistical measures, such as correlation coefficients (CC), mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Further, a diurnal analysis is performed to authenticate TMPA's performance in specific hours of the day. In general, the results show the good capability of both TMPA products in the detection of rain/no-rain events in all seasons except winter. Specifically, 3B42V7 performed better than 3B42RT. Moreover, both products detect a high number of rainy days falsely in light rain ranges. Regarding rainfall measurements, TMPA products exhibit an overall underestimation. Seasonally, 3B42V7 underestimates rainfall in monsoon and post-monsoon, and overestimates in winter and pre-monsoon. 3B42RT, on the other hand, underestimates rainfall in all seasons. A greater MBE and RMSE are found with both TMPA rain measurements in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Overall, a weak correlation and high MBE between the TMPA (3B42RT, 3B42V7) and reference gauge hourly rain rates are found at a three-hourly time scale (CC = 0.41, 0.38, MBE = -0.92, -0.70). The correlation is significant at decadal (CC = 0.79, 0.77) and monthly (CC = 0.91, 0.90) timescales. Furthermore, diurnal rainfall analysis indicates low credibility of 3B42RT to detect flash flooding. Within the parameters of this study, we conclude that the TMPA products are not the best choice at a three-hourly time scale in hilly/semi-hilly areas of Pakistan. However, both products can be used at daily, yet more reliably above daily, time scales, with 3B42V7 preferable due to its consistency.

TI  - Mapping Forest Cover in Northeast China from Chinese HJ-1 Satellite Data Using an Object-Based Algorithm
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plays a significant role in the global carbon budget and ecological processes. The precise mapping of forest cover can help significantly reduce uncertainties in the estimation of terrestrial carbon balance. A reliable and operational method is necessary for a rapid regional forest mapping. In this study, the goal relies on mapping forest and subcategories in Northeast China through the use of high spatio-temporal resolution HJ-1 imagery and time series vegetation indices within the context of an object-based image analysis and decision tree classification. Multi-temporal HJ-1 images obtained in a single year provide an opportunity to acquire phenology information. By analyzing the difference of spectral and phenology information between forest and non-forest, forest subcategories, decision trees using threshold values were finally proposed. The resultant forest map has a high overall accuracy of 0.91 +/- 0.01 with a 95% confidence interval, based on the validation using ground truth data from field surveys. The forest map extracted from HJ-1 imagery was compared with two existing global land cover datasets: GlobCover 2009 and MCD12Q1 2009. The HJ-1-based forest area is larger than that of MCD12Q1 and GlobCover and more closely resembles the national statistics data on forest area, which accounts for more than 40% of the total area of the Northeast China. The spatial disagreement primarily occurs in the northern part of the Daxing'an Mountains, Sanjiang Plain and the southwestern part of the Songliao Plain. The compared result also indicated that the forest subcategories information from global land cover products may introduce large uncertainties for ecological modeling and these should be cautiously used in various ecological models. Given the higher spatial and temporal resolution, HJ-1-based forest products could be very useful as input to biogeochemical models (particularly carbon cycle models) that require accurate and updated estimates of forest area and type.

TI  - Urbanization Impacts on Vegetation Phenology in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization can affect the ecological processes, local climate and human health in urban areas by changing the vegetation phenology. In the past 20 years, China has experienced rapid urbanization. Thus, it is imperative to understand the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology in China. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology at the national and climate zone scales using remotely sensed data. We found that the start of the growing season (SOS) was advanced by approximately 2.4 days (P < 0.01), and the end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed by approximately 0.7 days (P < 0.01) in the urban areas compared to the rural areas. As a result, the growing season length (GSL) was extended by approximately 3.1 days (P < 0.01). The difference in the SOS and GSL between the urban and rural areas increased from 2001 to 2014, with an annual rate of 0.2 days (R-2 = 0.39, P < 0.05) and 0.2 days (R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.05), respectively. We also found that the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology varied among different vegetation types at the national and climate zone levels (P < 0.05). The SOS was negatively correlated with land surface temperature (LST), with a correlation coefficient of -0.24 (P < 0.01), and EOS and GSL were positively correlated with LST, with correlation coefficients of 0.56 and 0.44 (P < 0.01), respectively. The improved understanding of the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology from this study will be of great help for policy-makers in terms of developing relevant strategies to mitigate the negative environmental effects of urbanization in China.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of aerosol characteristics in Iran using remotely sensed datasets
T2  - POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is the first attempt to examine temporal and spatial characteristics of aerosol properties and classify their modes over Iran. The data used in this study include the records of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE) from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Aerosol Index (AI) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), obtained from 2005 to 2015. The high concentration of AOD and AI values (representing high-high cluster) have been observed in the southwest and east regions, while their low concentrations (representing low-low cluster) have been found in the high mountainous areas. Based on AE values, Iran has been divided into three distinct regions, including fine, mixture, and coarse aerosol modes in each season. Results show that the maximum/minimum area under fine aerosols mode has occurred in the autumn, covering an area of 84.15% and in the spring, covering an area of 40.5%. In the case of coarse mode, the maximum/minimum area has been found in the spring, covered area=53.5% /in the Autumn covered area=12. 5%. The different aerosol modes regions strongly coincide with the topographical structure. To analyze the relation between aerosol properties and topography, Aerosol Properties Index (API) has been developed by combining OMI and MODIS datasets. API is a simple indicator, capable of showing the degree of aerosol coarseness in each pixel. There is a negative correlation between API and topography over the studied region, meaning that aerosol concentrations are high in the lowlands, but low in the highlands. However, this relation differs in various geographic regions, as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model shows a higher determination coefficient in all seasons, in comparison to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

TI  - Biomass burning and carbon monoxide patterns in Brazil during the extreme drought years of 2005, 2010, and 2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 21st century, severe droughts associated with climate change will increase biomass burning (BB) in Brazil caused by the human activities. Recent droughts, especially in 2005, 2010, and 2015, caused strong socioeconomic and environmental impacts. The 2015 drought considered the most severe since 1901, surpassed the 2005 and 2010 events in respect to area and duration. Herein, based on satellite data, the 2005, 2010 and 2015 drought impacts on wildfire episodes and carbon monoxide (CO) variability during the dry and the dry-to-wet transition seasons were examined. The BB occurrences in the dry season were fewer during 2015 than during 2005 (-44%) and 2010 (-47%). Contrasting, the BB events in the dry-to-wet transition season, were higher during 2015 than during 2005 (+192%) and 2010 (+332%). The BB outbreaks were concentrated in the southern and southwestern Amazon during 2005, in the Cerrado region during 2010, and mainly in the central and northern Amazon during 2015, an area normally with few fires. The CO concentration showed positive variations (up to +30%) occurred in the southern Amazon and central Brazil during the 2005 and 2010 dry seasons, and north of 20 degrees S during the 2015 -2016 dry-to-wet transition season. The BB outbreaks and the CO emissions showed a considerable spatiotemporal variability among the droughts of 2005, 2010, and 2016, first of them driven by local conditions in the tropical North Atlantic (TNA), characterized by warm than normal sea surface waters and the other two by the El Nino occurrences.

TI  - How relevant are local climate zones and urban climate zones for urban climate research? Dijon (France) as a case study
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several typologies of urban surface properties have been proposed, in recent years, for urban heat island studies and climate modeling. Some were specifically developed for cities and urban climate issues, like the Urban Climate Zones, and the more recent Local Climate Zones. The initial objective of this paper is to evaluate the capacity of these two typologies to identify thermal environments in and around cities, and to determine which typology best captures the daily spatio-temporal patterns of surface and urban canopy heat islands. To simulate urban climate with a model, LULC data based on a given typology are required. To avoid circularity, we combined the Corine Land Cover database, with data for the whole of Europe, and the BD TOPO database, for France, to form a new tool, CLC_USGS, which we used as input for the WRF limited-area model, with a 150-m grid resolution. The capacity of each typology to identify coherent thermal zones was estimated for Dijon, a medium-sized French city, during a three-week heat wave, over a 24-hour period, in conditions favorable to urban heat island development. The comparison was based on hourly air temperatures directly output from the WRF model, those obtained from the purpose-built MUSTARDijon 47-sensor meteorological network, and NDVI values and land surface temperatures estimated from Landsat images for 11 July 2015 at 1030 UTC. Typical diurnal variations and spatial contrasts of surface and air temperatures were identified in both simulations and observations. As both typologies show significant capacity for identifying thermally coherent intra-urban areas, this study suggests that they could both be useful for urban climate applications. The typology that is most generally applicable in worldwide contexts is Local Climate Zones.

Popular techniques for water body extraction like those based on the normalized difference water index (NDWI) require reflectance information in the green and near-infrared (NIR) bands of the light spectrum. Moreover, some commonly used approaches may perform differently according to the spatial resolution of the images. In this regard, mathematical morphological (MM) techniques for image processing have been employed for spatial feature extraction as they preserve edges and shapes. This study proposes a flexible MM driven approach which is very effective for the extraction of water bodies from several satellite images with different spatial resolution. MM provides effective tools for processing image objects based on size and shape and is particularly adapted for water bodies that have typically specific spatial characteristics. In greater details, the proposed extraction algorithm preserves the actual size and shape of the water bodies since it is based on morphological operators based on geodesic reconstruction. Moreover, the choice of the filter size (called structural element (SE) in MM) in the proposed algorithm is done dynamically allowing one to retain the most precise results from different set of inputs images of different spatial resolution and swath. The availability of more than one spectral band of satellite imagery is not necessary for the proposed algorithm as it utilizes only a single band for its computation. This makes it convenient to apply in single band imageries obtained from satellites such as Cartosat thereby making the proposed approach effective over commonly used methods. The accuracy assessment was carried out and compared with the maximum likelihood (ML) classifier and methods based on spectral indices. In all the five test datasets, extraction accuracy of the proposed MM approach was significantly higher than that of spectral indices and ML methods. The results drawn from visual and qualitative assessments indicated its capability and efficiency in water body extraction from different satellite images.

TI  - Environmental conditions and herbivore biomass determine coral reef benthic community composition: implications for quantitative baselines
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our ability to understand natural constraints on coral reef benthic communities requires quantitative assessment of the relative strengths of abiotic and biotic processes across large spatial scales. Here, we combine underwater images, visual censuses and remote sensing data for 1566 sites across 34 islands spanning the central-western Pacific Ocean, to empirically assess the relative roles of abiotic and grazing processes in determining the prevalence of calcifying organisms and fleshy algae on coral reefs. We used regression trees to identify the major predictors of benthic composition and to test whether anthropogenic stress at inhabited islands decouples natural relationships. We show that sea surface temperature, wave energy, oceanic productivity and aragonite saturation strongly influence benthic community composition; overlooking these factors may bias expectations of calcified reef states. Maintenance of grazing biomass above a relatively low threshold (10-20kgha(-1)) may also prevent transitions to algal-dominated states, providing a tangible management target for rebuilding overexploited herbivore populations. Biophysical relationships did not decouple at inhabited islands, indicating that abiotic influences remain important macroscale processes, even at chronically disturbed reefs. However, spatial autocorrelation among inhabited reefs was substantial and exceeded abiotic and grazing influences, suggesting that natural constraints on reef benthos were superseded by unmeasured anthropogenic impacts. Evidence of strong abiotic influences on reef benthic communities underscores their importance in specifying quantitative targets for coral reef management and restoration that are realistic within the context of local conditions.

TI  - Is arctic greening consistent with the ecology of tundra? Lessons from an ecologically informed mass balance model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has been implicated in the widespread 'greening' of the arctic in recent decades. However, differences in arctic greening patterns among satellite platforms and recent reports of decreased rate of greening or of browning have made attributing arctic greening trends to a warming climate challenging. Here, we compared MODIS greening trends to those predicted by the coupled carbon and nitrogen model (CCaN); a mass balance carbon and nitrogen model that was driven by MODIS surface temperature and climate. CCaN was parameterized using model-data fusion, where model predictions were ecologically constrained with historical ecological ground and satellite based data. Wefound that, at long temporal and large spatial scales, MODIS greening trends were consistent with ecological and biogeochemical data from arctic tundra. However, at smaller spatial scales, observations and CCaN greening trends differed in the location, extent, and magnitude of greening. CCaN was unable to capture the high rates of MODIS greening in northern wetlands, and the patchy MODIS browning in the southern portion of the North Slope. This model-data disagreement points to disturbance and its legacy impacts on land cover as an important mechanism for understanding greening trends on the North Slope of Alaska.

TI  - 2015-2016 Seasonal Variations of Backscattering from Natural Coverage in the Moscow Region Based on Radar Data from the Sentinel 1A Satellite
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we discuss the time series of the coefficient of backscattering from forest cover and unused land in the Moscow region based on 29 C-band sessions of the Sentinel 1A satellite over a one-year period from March 10, 2015 to March 4, 2016. The data were interpreted using the MIMICS model of the change in the permittivity of the elements of the forest cover and the model of the change in the permittivity of the soil. The seasonal features of the change in backscattering from the forest using two polarizations of VV and VH are shown for the Losinyi Ostrov forest. A strong positive correlation was found between values of the backscattering coefficient of the forest and values of air temperature. Using the MIMICS model, we were also able to relate the annual changes in the backscattering coefficient of the forest to changes in the permittivity of the trees dependent on temperature. The soil moisture content of unused land in the vicinity of Fryazino, Moscow Region was estimated based on the radar data for 2015-2016. Data on soil moisture can be extracted using a single equation of Dubois et al., 1995 for consistent polarization and regression of Rao et al., 2003 under a number of conditions. The time series of the values of the equivalent water layer for the studied field is shown for the snow period.

TI  - Prevalence and risk indicators of peri-implant diseases in Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To evaluate the prevalence of peri-implant diseases in Spain, as well as the associated risk indicators. Material and Methods This is a cross-sectional study using a network of sentinel dentists, who randomly selected 10 patients with implants (placed, at least, 5 years before), which were clinically and radiographically evaluated. Case definitions were established for peri-implant mucositis [bleeding on probing (BOP) and no bone level >= 2 mm] and peri-implantitis (BOP plus bone level >= 2 mm). Potential predictor variables, at univariate and multivariate levels, were explored by means of binary logistic regression. Results A total of 49 sentinel dentists provided complete data from 474 implants in 275 patients. At implant level, prevalences for peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis were 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22-32) and 20% (95% CI: 15-24), respectively, with 17% of implants (14-21) with bone level >= 2 mm without BOP. At patient level, prevalences were 27% (22-32), 24% (19-29) and 18% (13-22), respectively. In the multiple regression analysis, statistically significant associations for peri-implantitis (p < 0.10) were found for gender, peri-implant supportive therapy, implant location, diameter and surface, type of prosthesis and access to interproximal hygiene. Conclusions In this representative subject sample across Spain, the prevalence of peri-implant diseases was high (51%).

TI  - Long-term oncological outcomes of patients with negative sentinel lymph node in vulvar cancer. Comparative study with conventional lymphadenectomy
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to compare oncological outcomes and morbidity in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer with negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy vs negative inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL). Material and methods Results Study with retrospectively collected data in patients with squamous cell vulvar carcinomas <= 4 cm without suspected inguinofemoral lymph node metastases. Only patients with negative nodes after histopathology procedure were followed. Patients who underwent only SLN were compared with patients who underwent IFL +/- SLN to compare recurrences, survival rates and morbidity. Ninety-three patients were eligible for follow up: 42 with negative SLN and 51 with negative IFL +/- SLN. The median follow-up period was 60.4 months (range 6.7-160.7). The rate of isolated first groin recurrence was 4.8% in patients with negative SLN and 2.0% in patients with negative IFL +/- SLN (P = 0.587) and the rates of first isolated local recurrence were 28.6% and 31.4%, respectively (P = 0.823). Only 1 patient (2.4%) in the group of negative SLN had distant recurrence. The disease-specific survival rate at 5 years was 83.3% in the negative SLN group and 92.2% in the negative IFL +/- SLN group (P = 0.214). We observed a higher rate of wound breakdown and infection after IFL than SLN biopsy (17.6% vs 10.6%; P = 0.020) and lymphedema (33.3% vs 0%; P < 0.001). Conclusions We report in the same population of patients with early-stage vulvar cancer that SLN biopsy does not have significantly higher rates of groin recurrences or lower survival rates compared with IFL. Moreover, the SLN procedure has less morbidity, which should encourage gynecologists to abandon IFL.

TI  - RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COTTON PRODUCTIVITY AND VARIABILITY OF NDVI OBTAINED BY LANDSAT IMAGES
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of satellite images has generated a large number of regional and global studies on vegetation mapping. Such studies have related the growth parameters, nutrient status, physiological responses, and water resources to the yield of agricultural crops or native vegetation. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is associated with parameters of growth and yield with readings at several moments of the crop cycle. The objective of this work was to correlate the yield and variability of the NDVI in cotton fields by analyzing Landsat satellite images acquired over nine growing seasons. The study involved the analysis of 101 cotton production fields located in West-Central Brazil. One Landsat image was used during each crop cycle, and the average yield was computed based on total fiber harvested at each field. The fiber yield ranged from 393 to 2,030 kg ha(-1,) and its correlation with NDVI was 0.37. The coefficient of variation (CV) had a negative correlation with yield, approximating -58.1 kg ha(-1) for every one percent increment of the CV. The CV explained the yield variability over the cotton fields more accurately than the average absolute NDVI value.

TI  - Split-Window Algorithm for Retrieval of Land Surface Temperature Using Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a vital role in global climate change, radiation budgets, heat balance, vegetation, snowmelt, glacier hydrology, and geo-biophysical processes. It is, therefore, essential to determine LST precisely over large areas. With advancements in remote sensing, LST can now be estimated. In this study, a critical appraisal of various LST inversion algorithms is presented. These algorithms include mono-window (MW), split-window (SW), dual-angle (DA), single-channel (SC), and Sabmao method. The main objective is to derive an SW algorithm to retrieve LST from Landsat 8 satellite data and demonstrate the application to the Beas River basin in India. Located within the Himalayan range, the study area is characterized by heterogeneity and rugged terrain with areas covered by snow and glacier. The satellite imagery is a product of the Optical Land Imager (OLI) with a spatial resolution of 30 m and a thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) having a spatial resolution of 100 m. The SW algorithm requires spectral radiance and emissivity from two bands of the TIRS as input for the estimation of LST. The spectral radiance has been estimated using the TIRS bands 10 and 11. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the threshold technique of OLI bands (2 to 5) have been used to derive the emissivity. The estimates of LST from the TIRS and OLI bands using the SW algorithm are found to be accurate and close to the in situ air temperature measurements and the LST values obtained from the MW algorithm. Results obtained show that the values of LST are high in the barren/rocky areas and low in the snow/glacier areas. The study reveals that the LST estimates from SW and MW algorithms are linearly transferable with negligible loss of accuracy. The LST estimates from the SW algorithm differs at most by up to 5 degrees C with the measured air temperature.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on mangrove mapping at the Liong River Bengkalis Riau Province was very limited, therefore the spatial data availability of mangrove in Liong River is also very limited. The use of satellite remote sensing to map mangrove has become widespread as it can provide accurate, effecient, and repeatable assessments. The purposed of this study was to map mangrove at the community level using sentinel 2B imagery based on object-based classification method (OBIA) and it compared pixel-based classification at Liong River, Bengkalis, Riau Provinc. This study was used support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The scheme classification use is that land cover and mangrove community. The classification data of land cover was collected using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and community mangrove was using transect data of 2013. The result of land cover classification and community mangrove indicated that object-based classification technique was better than pixel-based classification. The highest an overall accuracy of land cover is 78.7% versus 70.9%, whereas mangrove community is 76.6 versus 75.0%. Approximately 7.8% increase in accuracy can be achieved by object-based method of classification for land cover and 1.6% for mangrove community.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Land Use/Land Cover and Its Effects on Surface Urban Heat Island Using Landsat Data: A Case Study of Metropolitan City Tehran (1988-2018)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article summarized the spatiotemporal pattern of land use/land cover (LU/LC) and urban heat island (UHI) dynamics in the Metropolitan city of Tehran between 1988 and 2018. The study showed dynamics of each LU/LC class and their role in influencing the UHI. The impervious surface area expanded by 286.04 (48.27% of total land) and vegetated land was depleted by 42.06 km(2) (7.10% of total land) during the period of 1988-2018. The mean land surface temperature (LST) has enlarged by approximately 2-3 degrees C at the city center and 5-7 degrees C at the periphery between 1988 and 2018 based on the urban-rural gradient analysis. The lower mean LST was experienced by vegetation land (VL) and water body (WB) by approximately 4-5 degrees C and 5-7 degrees C, respectively, and the higher mean LST by open land (OL) by 7-11 degrees C than other LU/LC classes at all time-points during the time period, 1988-2018. The magnitude of mean LST was calculated based on the main LU/LC categories, where impervious land (IL) recorded the higher temperature difference compared to vegetation land (VL) and water bodies (WB). However, open land (OL) recorded the highest mean LST differences with all the other LU/LC categories. In addition to that, there was an overall negative correlation between LST and the normal difference vegetation index (NDVI). By contrast, there was an overall positive correlation between LST and the normal difference built-up index (NDBI). This article, executed through three decadal change analyses from 1988 to 2018 at 10-year intervals, has made a significant contribution to delineating the long records of change dynamics and could have a great influence on policy making to foster environmental sustainability.

TI  - Richness, Community Structure, and Diurnal Activity of Species of Ants along a Disturbance Gradient at El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, Tamaulipas, Mexico
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of environmental variability on species richness, community structure, and daytime activity of ants along a disturbance gradient was examined at El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The study site was delimited by LANDSAT satellite images. Ants were evaluated using pitfall traps from 0800 to 1800 every hour for four consecutive days in August 2016. In total, 1190 individuals of 20 species and seven subfamilies were obtained. Six species responded positively to the disturbed environment during the morning, with variation between assessment days. The daytime activity of ant species was variable during the day along the disturbance gradient. Solenopsis geminata was the species that showed the most activity during most of the day in the study. Abundance of species differed between most environments each hour. The total variation explained by the first two axes of the relationship analysis of species abundance and environmental attributes was 83% (Axis 1: Temperature and humidity = 64%, Axis 2: Rocks = 19%). S. geminata and Forelius pruinosus were the species that responded significantly to the variables evaluated. The results suggested that environmental variability along a disturbance gradient determines the establishment of the niche and the diurnal activity profile of each species throughout the day and between days.

TI  - Comparison of built-up area maps produced within the global human settlement framework
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The validation of built-up areas derived from different sensors is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of the consistency and interoperability between them. This article presents the methodology and results of an inter-sensor comparison of built-up area data derived from Landsat, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and SPOT5/SPOT6. The assessment was performed for 13 cities across the world for which cartographic reference building footprints were available. Several validation approaches were used: cumulative built-up curve analysis, pixel-by-pixel performance metrics, and regression analysis. The results indicate that Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 contribute greatly to improved built-up area detection compared to Landsat, within the global human settlement framework. However, Sentinel-2 tends to show high omission errors while Landsat tends to have the lowest omission error. The built-up area obtained from SPOT5/SPOT6 shows high consistency with the reference data for all European cities, and hence can potentially be considered as a reference dataset for wall-to-wall validation in Europe.

TI  - Enteric Fever Cases in the Two Largest Pediatric Hospitals of Bangladesh: 2013-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Enteric fever predominantly affects children in low- and middle-income countries. This study examines the burden of enteric fever at the 2 pediatric hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh and assesses their capacity for inclusion in a prospective cohort study to support enteric fever prevention and control.Methods. A descriptive study of enteric fever was conducted among children admitted in 2013-2014 to inpatient departments of Dhaka Shishu and Shishu Shashthya Foundation Hospitals, sentinel hospitals of the World Health Organization-supported Invasive Bacterial Vaccine Preventable Disease surveillance platform.Results. Of 15917 children with blood specimens received by laboratories, 2.8% (443 of 15917) were culture positive for significant bacterial growth. Sixty-three percent (279 of 443) of these isolates were confirmed as the cases of enteric fever (241 Salmonella Typhi and 38 Salmonella Paratyphi A). In addition, 1591 children had suspected enteric fever. Overall, 3.6% (1870 of 51923) were laboratory confirmed or suspected enteric fever cases (55% male, median age 2 years, 86% from Dhaka district, median hospital stay 5 days).Conclusions. The burden of enteric fever among inpatients at 2 pediatric hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh is substantial. Therefore, inclusion of these hospitals in a prospective cohort study will be useful for the generation of credible disease burden estimates of enteric fever in Bangladesh.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Neuroendocrine carcinoma(NEC)is a rare disease. We report a case of NEC encountered in the general hospital without a breast department. The patient was a 69-year-old woman. She had received breast cancer screening and a mass on her left breast was found. Mammography revealed an ill-defined mass. Ultrasonography showed a low echoic mass, 11mm in diameter, on the A area of her left breast. A core needle biopsy of the breast tumor(A area)led to a diagnosis of an invasive ductal carcinoma, positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, but negative for HER2/neu. The Ki-67 positive cell index was 5%. We then examined her whole body and diagnosed her with T1N0M0, Stage Ⅰ. She underwent muscle-preserving mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathological diagnosis from the resected surgical specimen was invasive ductal carcinoma(NEC), positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, but negative for HER2/neu. The Ki-67 positive cell index was 5%. The surgical margins were negative, and no metastasis was found in the sentinel lymph node. She was administered endocrine therapy as adjuvant therapy. Two years postoperatively, she was well without metastases.

TI  - Health Consequences of an Armed Conflict in Zamboanga, Philippines Using a Syndromic Surveillance Database
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zamboanga armed conflict was a 19-day long encounter in the Philippines in 2013 that displaced 119,000 people from their homes. This study describes the health consequences of this complex emergency in different age groups, time periods, and health facilities using data from Surveillance in Post Extreme Emergencies and Disasters (SPEED). This is a descriptive study of the SPEED database spanning 196 days of observation post-disaster and 1065 SPEED reports from 49 health facilities. Evacuation centers and village health centers, both primary care facilities, had the highest number of consults. Common infections and noncommunicable diseases were the most common reasons for consultations, namely, acute respiratory infections, fever, watery diarrhea, skin disease, and hypertension. Infections can be associated with environmental conditions in displaced populations, while hypertension has a high prevalence in the country and implies long-term care. Conflict-related injuries and deaths were not frequently observed due to the volatile situation that influenced health-seeking behavior as well as possible reporting gaps. In conclusion, in complex emergencies, as in natural disasters, wherein early alert and warning for potential outbreaks is crucial, SPEED can assist decision makers on response and recovery interventions. Linkages between SPEED and other surveillance and reporting systems need to be explored.

TI  - Classification of Ocean Surface Slicks in Simulated Hybrid-Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we consider hybrid-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of ocean surface slicks, and hypothesize that we can design a system that is able to discriminate between mineral oil, plant oil, and clean sea. We focus particularly on challenges related to data set shift between the training and test data. In SAR images of ocean surfaces, data set shift is typically caused by the variation of wind level and incident angles that directly impact the backscatter intensities. We evaluate several classifiers, domain adaptation strategies, and multilooking strategies. Hybrid-polarimetric SAR data are simulated from the Radarsat-2 quad-pol images. The proposed methodology was trained using five different Radarsat-2 quad-pol images that cover slicks of known types, and tested on 10 different Radarsat-2 quad-pol images covering various ocean surface slicks. The results show that we were able, to a large degree, to classify the type of various surface slicks. The average classification accuracy obtained from cross-validation on the training data was 91%. The results also show that we were able to correctly classify surface slick in new test images, even if the wind, surface, and acquisition conditions were different from the training images. We conclude that hybrid polarity is an attractive mode for future enhanced SAR-based oil spill monitoring; however, to fully exploit the imaging mode, single-look complex images are necessary.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Environmental Sensitivity to Desertification in Sidi Abdel-Rahman Area, Northern West Coast of Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - THIS STUDY presents the assessment and mapping of the environmentally sensitive areas (ESA) to desertification in Sidi-Abdel Rahman area, Northern West Coast of Egypt using MEDALUS model. The desertification indices in Sidi-Abdel Rahman area were identified based on remote sensing data, Geographic information Systems (GIS), and field survey data. These indices were soil quality index, climate quality index, vegetation quality index, erosion quality index, land management quality index, and social quality index. The results of the current study for sensitivity to desertification showed that 20.62% of the whole region (8510 ha) is medium-fragile sensitive to desertification, 43.36% (17893 ha) is high-fragile sensitive to desertification, 35.35% (14586 ha) is low-critical sensitive to desertification, and 0.66% (274 ha) is medium-critical to desertification. In general, the total area is classified as fragile (F3) and thus insensibly susceptible to desertification. Sidi-Abdel Rahman area is sensitive to desertification owing to low vegetation cover, soil quality, mismanagement, climate condition, wind, and water erosion.

TI  - Large-scale mapping of iron oxide and hydroxide minerals of Zefreh porphyry copper deposit, using Worldview-3 VNIR data in the Northeastern Isfahan, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrimination of iron oxide and hydroxide mineral assemblages is a key factor in porphyry copper exploration. This paper investigates the ability of the Worldview-3 VNIR data in mapping iron oxide / hydroxide minerals associated with the porphyry copper mineralization. The study area is situated in the central part of the Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc, northeastern Isfahan, Iran, which hosts a number of important porphyry copper deposits. The copper mineralization is related to the porphyry intrusive complex that ranges in composition from diorite to granodiorite. Bands 2,3,4,5, and 8 of this satellite were used to enhance the pixels containing target minerals and to mask the effects of vegetation on these pixels. The best results in terms of mapping and discriminating target materials were acquired by the band math and the matched filtering (MF) methods. The MF output results enhanced pixels with the highest fractions of the target minerals. The field investigations, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and microscopic studies showed that the distribution pattern of target minerals correspond well to ground criteria and gossan caps associated with the porphyry copper mineralization. It was concluded that Worldview-3 has the efficient spectral bands in VNIR region, which could be proposed for the iron oxide / hydroxide mineral mapping.

TI  - Quad-PolSAR data classification using modified random forest algorithms to map halophytic plants in arid areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, fully polarized SAR (PolSAR) data are exploited to characterize halophyte plants in lakeside saline wetland environments thanks to their different scattering properties. To this aim, several polarization signatures and morphological profiles (MPs) are used as inputs to the proposed "random MS model forest" (RM5MF) and "classification via random forest regression" (CVRFR) classifiers. The experimental results show that parameters such as pedestal height (PH), as well as 3D co-polarization and cross-polarization signature plots, are more suited than biomass index (BMI), volume scattering index (VSI), and canopy scattering index (CSI) to map halophytic plants in arid environments. When we compare the suitability of PolSAR features using RM5MF, random forest (RaF), and other five popular attribute selection approaches, all the results uniformly show that span, MPs and entropy are the most valuable features, while PH and BMI are more valuable than CSI, VSI and the radar forest degradation index (RFDI). Additionally, the diagonal elements of the coherency matrix are more valuable than are the off-diagonal elements, and double-bounce, odd-bounce and wire elements are more valuable than helix bounce and volume bounce. The study results are obtained from Po1SAR L-band quad-polarimetric high-sensitivity stripmap data over two study regions by comparing RM5MF and CVRFR with more traditional algorithms (support vector machine (SVM), RaF, rotation forest (RoF), and MultiBoostAB). The RMSMF model achieves the highest accuracy value in the study regions. However, due to the binary splitting criteria in the M5 model tree, it is more computationally intensive than all the others. In contrast, the CVRFR model consumes much less time-approximately 10 times less than RMSMF, and 5 times less than RoF-but still achieves better (3%-8%) classification accuracy than SVM or RoF, and its results are comparable (less than 1% difference) to those by RaF.

TI  - The role of positional errors while interpolating soil organic carbon contents using satellite imagery
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasingly, soil surveys make use of a combination of legacy data, ancillary data and new field data. While combining the different sources of information, positional errors can play a large role. For example, the spatial discrepancy between remote sensing images and field data can depend on many factors, including the positioning accuracy of ground-based observations. The accuracy of GPS receivers for the territory of Russia is approximately 3-10m. The aim of the study was to estimate the impact of sampling positioning accuracy on the relationship between soil organic carbon content and the infrared channel of the WorldView-2 satellite image and for mapping soil organic carbon contents in an agricultural field in the territory of the Bryansk Opolje (Russia). Intensive sampling of the topsoil took place. The positional accuracy was also measured and used to perturb the locations of the samples. The data were used to study: (i) the relationships between soil organic carbon and infrared reflectance, (ii) the variation in soil organic carbon through five different interpolation techniques, and (iii) the fraction of the fields with low soil organic matter contents. The study showed that the positional inaccuracies can have an important impact. The standardized methods to estimate the positional accuracy, perturb the locations and evaluate its impact seems to be an easy way to explore the quality of data.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of evapotranspiration and crop water requirement from space
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) algorithm very well captures the spatio-temporal Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) variability, which is relevant to compute Crop Water Requirement (CWR) of commercial farms during the dry season. Considering this, a study was conducted in the arid and semi-arid parts of middle Awash in Ethiopia using reflectance and radiance satellite datasets of both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat's Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The SEBS model e derived AET was compared with the CWR computed from ground (observed) meteorological datasets. The results revealed that the amount of AET over the study area was dependent on temperature, surface radiative property, moisture content and crop development stage. The AET derived from satellite datasets was strongly related to the ground computed CWR over the irrigated sugarcane and cotton fields. The study revealed that the technique could be of great help during irrigation management, water conservation and allocation. Hence, we recommend decision makers of the commercial farms to further explore the use of this technique to properly manage and schedule their irrigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - An approach for prediction of shoreline with spatial uncertainty mapping (SLiP-SUM)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study puts forward a semi-automatic shoreline detection and future prediction with spatial uncertainty algorithm called the SUP-SUM (Shore Line Prediction with Spatial Uncertainty Mapping), which has five main steps: (1) preprocessing of data sets (i.e. aerial photos and/or satellite images), (2) extraction or delineation of the existing shorelines with snake algorithm, 3) prediction of the future shorelines using linear regression, (4) preparation of the spatial uncertainty mapping using cokriging, and (5) producing possible shoreline with spatial uncertainty. The proposed approach was tested on the coast of Kumluca, a dynamic coastal area in Turkey, and future shoreline predictions were made for 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2035 based on remotely sensed data (aerial photos and WorldView-2 images) acquired between 1971 and 2014. A cokriging interpolation technique was adopted that takes into account both estimation errors and the spatial resolution of the source data sets for the mapping of spatial uncertainty. The results indicate that the maximum and minimum annual changes of shoreline were -2.29 m/yr (transgression) in the west-central part of the study area, and + 0.36 m/yr (regression) in the east part. The general trend of the future shoreline regime was transgressional, and the mean uncertainty values along the predicted shorelines for 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2035 were 6.78 m, 2.02 m, 6.76 m and 7.06 m, respectively.

TI  - Identification of iron in Earth analogues of Martian phyllosilicates using visible reflectance spectroscopy: Spectral derivatives and color parameters
T2  - APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A range of phyllosilicate compositions have been detected spectroscopically on Mars, but the largest fraction by far corresponds to clay minerals rich in Fe and Mg. Given that most of our understanding of Martian clays comes from remote sensing data, it is critically important to explore the details of how compositional variation affects spectral features of phyllosilicates. The greatest efforts have focused so far on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Recently, ambiguities have been detected in the NIR spectra of 2:1 phyllosilicates with intermediate Fe-Mg content that preclude mineral and chemical discrimination. Such ambiguities highlight the relevance of exploring the visible spectral range as a complementary tool to characterize Martian phyllosilicates precisely. This article reports the investigation of laboratory reflectance spectra (330-800 nm) from 34 Earth analogues of Martian phyllosilicates with a wide range of Mg-Fe composition, including nontronite, celadonite and saponite end-members, as well as interstratified glauconite-nontronite, talc-nontronite, and talc-saponite. The spectra indicated the presence of Fe(III) by absorption modulations and a decrease in total reflectance, especially in samples with tetrahedral Fe(III). Absorption bands at 370 and 420 nm were diagnostic of octahedrically and tetrahedrally coordinated Fe(III), respectively. Band amplitudes in the second derivative of the Kubelka-Munk function correlated positively with Fe(III) content (R-2 > 0.8). Standard color analyses of the visible reflectance spectra under the CIE illuminant D65 indicated that the CIELAB color parameter a*(10) was positively correlated with tetrahedral Fe(III), b*(10) was positively correlated with octahedral Fe(III), and L*(10) was negatively correlated with Fe(III) in both structural sites. Because Fe(II) was in relatively low amount, it did not provide clear spectral evidence. Multiple regression models using the amplitude of the diagnostic absorption bands predicted well absolute Fe content in the phyllosilicates (R-2 = 0.89) and the ratio Fe/(Fe + Mg + Al) (R-2 = 0.84). CIELAB color parameters improved the prediction of total Fe (R-2 = 0.92) and the ratio Fe/(Fe + Mg + Al) (R-2 = 0.93). Application of these analyses to Martian data has challenges set by Fe oxide dust coating and spatial and spectral resolution. However, these results mark an avenue to develop testable tools using visible-wavelength spectral data from both satellite and lander probes to help establishing Fe content and mineral identification of Martian phyllosilicates.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuzzy logic has applications in various fields, but has special meaning for remote sensing. Fuzzy logic allows partial membership, a very important property in the field of remote sensing, since partial membership is translated closely to the problem of mixed pixels. The aim of this research is to apply fuzzy logic classification algorithm to map benthic habitat in SPOT 7 and Sentinel 2A satellite imagery, test its accuracy level and compare fuzzy logic classification algorithm with maximum likelihood. Field data retrieval located in Karang Lebar and Karang Congkak, Kepulauan Seribu on 6 December until 10 December 2017. The overall accuracy test results show that fuzzy logic algorithm still has a good accuracy level compared to the maximum likelihood algorithm. Differences in pixel size (spatial resolution) of satellite imagery also affect accuracy results, where SPOT 7 satellite imagery has greater accuracy then Sentinel 2A.

TI  - Building Laboratory-Based Arbovirus Sentinel Surveillance Capacity During an Ongoing Dengue Outbreak, Burkina Faso, 2017
T2  - HEALTH SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In West Africa, identification of nonmalarial acute febrile illness (AFI) etiologic pathogens is challenging, given limited epidemiologic surveillance and laboratory testing, including for AFI caused by arboviruses. Consequently, public health action to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks is constrained, as experienced during dengue outbreaks in several African countries. We describe the successful implementation of laboratory-based arbovirus sentinel surveillance during a dengue outbreak in Burkina Faso during fall 2017. We describe implementation, surveillance methods, and associated costs of enhanced surveillance during an outbreak response as an effort to build capacity to better understand the burden of disease caused by arboviruses in Burkina Faso. The system improved on existing routine surveillance through an improved case report form, systematic testing of specimens, and linking patient information with laboratory results through a data management system. Lessons learned will improve arbovirus surveillance in Burkina Faso and will contribute to enhancing global health security in the region. Elements critical to the success of this intervention include responding to a specific and urgent request by the government of Burkina Faso and building on existing systems and infrastructure already supported by CDC's global health security program.

TI  - Burned-Area Detection in Amazonian Environments Using Standardized Time Series Per Pixel in MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires associated with the expansion of cattle ranching and agriculture have become a problem in the Amazon biome, causing severe environmental damages. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used in fire monitoring on the extensive Amazon forest, but accurate automated fire detection needs improvements. The popular Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64 product still has high omission errors in the region. This research aimed to evaluate MODIS time series spectral indices for mapping burned areas in the municipality of Novo Progresso (State of Para) and to determine their accuracy in the different types of land use/land cover during the period 2000-2014. The burned area mapping from 8-day composite products, compared the following data: near-infrared (NIR) band; spectral indices (Burnt Area Index (BAIM), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), Mid Infrared Burn Index (MIRBI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), variation of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)); and the seasonal difference of spectral indices. Moreover, we compared the time series normalization methods per pixel (zero-mean normalization and Z-score) and the seasonal difference between consecutive years. Threshold-value determination for the fire occurrences was obtained from the comparison of MODIS series with visual image classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data using the overall accuracy. The best result considered the following factors: NIR band and zero-mean normalization, obtaining the overall accuracy of 98.99%, commission errors of 32.41%, and omission errors of 31.64%. The proposed method presented better results in burned area detection in the natural fields (Campinarana) with an overall accuracy value of 99.25%, commission errors of 9.71%, and omission errors of 27.60%, as well as pasture, with overall accuracy value of 99.19%, commission errors of 27.60%, and omission errors of 34.76%. Forest areas had a lower accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 98.62%, commission errors of 23.40%, and omission errors of 49.62%. The best performance of the burned area detection in the pastures is relevant because the deforested areas are responsible for more than 70% of fire events. The results of the proposed method were better than the burned area products (MCD45, MCD64, and FIRE-CCI), but still presented limitations in the identification of burn events in the savanna formations and secondary vegetation.

TI  - Scarce population genetic differentiation but substantial spatiotemporal phenotypic variation of water-use efficiency in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> at its western distribution range
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water and carbon fluxes in forests are largely related to leaf gas exchange physiology varying across spatiotemporal scales and modulated by plant responses to environmental cues. We quantified the relevance of genetic and phenotypic variation of intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi, ratio of net photosynthesis to stomatal conductance of water) in Pinus sylvestris L. growing in the Iberian Peninsula as inferred from tree-ring carbon isotopes. Inter-population genetic variation, evaluated in a provenance trial comprising Spanish and German populations, was low and relevant only at continental scale. In contrast, phenotypic variation, evaluated in natural stands (at spatial level) and by tree-ring chronologies (at temporal inter-annual level), was important and ten- and threefold larger than the population genetic variance, respectively. These results points to preponderance of plastic responses dominating variability in WUEi for this species. Spatial phenotypic variation in WUEi correlated negatively with soil depth (r=-0.66; p<0.01), while temporal phenotypic variation was mainly driven by summer precipitation. At the spatial level, WUEi could be scaled-up to ecosystem-level WUE derived from remote sensing data by accounting for soil water-holding capacity (r=0.63; p<0.01). This outcome demonstrates a direct influence of the variation of leaf-level WUEi on ecosystem water and carbon balance differentiation. Our findings highlight the contrasting importance of genetic variation (negligible) and plastic responses in WUEi (large, with changes of up to 33% among sites) on determining carbon and water budgets at stand and ecosystem scales in a widespread conifer such as Pinus sylvestris.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Wildlife Tuberculosis Based on a Serologic Survey Using Dried Blood Spots, Portugal
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the spatial epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in wildlife in a multihost system. We surveyed bovine TB in Portugal by serologic analysis of elutes of dried blood spots obtained from hunted wild boar. We modeled spatial disease risk by using areal generalized linear mixed models with conditional autoregressive priors. Antibodies against Mycobaterium bovis were detected in 2.4% (95% CI 1.5%-3.8%) of 678 wild boar in 2 geographic clusters, and the predicted risk fits well with independent reports of M. bovis culture. Results show that elutes are an almost perfect substitute for serum (Cohen unweighted kappa = 0.818), indicating that serologic tests coupled with dried blood spots are an effective strategy for large-scale bovine TB surveys, using wild boar as sentinel species. Results also show that bovine TB is an emerging wildlife disease and stress the need to prevent further geographic spread and prevalence increase.

TI  - Neotectonic activity of the Bomdila Fault in northeastern India from geomorphological evidences using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major geological structures across the Brahmaputra valley, which stretches from the Eastern Himalayas up to the Naga Hills, is the Bomdila Fault. Parts of the courses of the rivers - the Brahmaputra, Dhansiri (south-S), Bargang and many others - are aligned along this structure. The influence of this structure on the courses of these rivers has been studied in detail using topographic maps, satellite data and field evidences. The signatures obtained such as: (a) an unusually linear course of the lower part of the Dhansiri (S) river from Golaghat up to Dhansirimukh, (b) the abandonment of the westerly course of the earlier Dhansiri (S) river (flowing through Kaziranga) towards the present NW direction by avulsion, (c) knick bends in the MBT-MCT and Naga Thrust of Belt of Schuppen, (d) a linear 15 m high topographic scarp on the left bank of the Dhansiri (S) near Numaligarh and (e) an anomalous SE-NW trending course of the Brahmaputra from Dhansirimukh up to Hartamuli along with the parts of the rivers Buroi and Bargang on the north in the same trend infers the influence of a fault-type structure. Since all these linear segments of the rivers align along the NW-SE trending Bomdila Fault, it infers the influence of the later on the courses of these rivers. The neotectonic activity along this fault might have caused the linear high scarp and abandonment of earlier river courses.

TI  - Special Features in Expressing the 'Homeland' Concept in the Yakut Heroic Epic Olonkho
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Presently, the study of epic texts is undergoing one of the most significant stages of its development, i.e., a theoretical basis is being created and established. The theoretical category of epic studies is being thoroughly revisited from the point of view of its objectiveness, its ontological and specific nature, as well as its functionality and importance in the field of epic studies in general.Due to the growing interest in the humanities among scholars in the modern academic research society, the 21st century is unfolding in an essentially new research environment, which needs to be revisited and analyzed. The necessity to study the existing status of the topic under discussion is first of all justified by the fact that it encompasses a process of qualitative changes in the epic text representations, epic texts being a subject of humanitarian, historical and cultural studies; this is one of the key aspects in the epic studies as a whole and in the study of Yakut heroic epic olonkho in particular.In the process of its establishment in the oral folklore tradition, the Yakut heroic epic olonkho underwent a process of transformation from a heroic epic to a philosophical and didactical one. The "multi-layer" content of the Yakut olonkho, which includes in itself the archaic and worldview components of the Yakut peoples' culture, is a unique source for the historic and typological renewal of the various examples of traditional art, which is obliquely depicted in the epic texts.Currently, a large scope of historical and graphical materials, literature on the study of the worldview depicted in the Yakut olonkho is easily accessible. The study of the world creation in the Yakut olonkho about the Middle World, and the native land in particular, where the bogatyr lives, is one of the main categories in theoretical epic studies.The present article describes distinctive features in the depiction of the main character's homeland in Yakut epic olonkho in the context of a comparative study. By distinguishing its unique features in the image depiction of the main character's homeland, the role that the latter plays in the Yakut olonkho, we provide ourselves with an opportunity to reconstruct a traditional world representation, which would allow to achieve a better understanding of the outlook that the Yakut people had about themselves and the world in the ancient times.

TI  - Multi-Image Robust Alignment of Medium-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes an automatic multi-image robust alignment (MIRA) procedure able to simultaneously co-register a time series of medium-resolution satellite images in a bundle block adjustment (BBA) fashion. Instead of the direct co-registration of each image with respect to a reference master' image on the basis of corresponding features, MIRA also considers those tie points that may be not be shared with the master, but they only connect the other images (slaves') among them. In a first stage, tie points are automatically extracted by using pairwise feature-based matching based on the SURF operator. In a second stage, such extracted features are re-ordered to find corresponding tie points visible on multiple image pairs. A master' image is then selected with the only purpose to establish the datum of the final image alignment and to instantiate the computation of approximate registration parameters. All the available information obtained so far is fed into a least-squares BBA to estimate the unknowns, which include the registration parameters and the coordinates of tie points re-projected in the master' image space. The analysis of inner and outer reliability of the observations is applied to assess whether the residual blunders may be located using data snooping, and to evaluate the influence of undetected outliers on the final registration results. Three experiments with simulated datasets and one example consisting of eleven Landsat-5/TM images are reported and discussed. In the case of real data, results have been positively checked against the ones obtained by using alternative procedures (BBA with manual measurements and slave-to-master' registration based on automatically extracted tie points). These experiments have confirmed the correctness of the MIRA approach and have highlighted the potential of the inner control on the final quality of the solution that may come from the reliability analysis.

TI  - Characterisation of Functional-Trait Dynamics at High Spatial Resolution in a Mediterranean Forest from Sentinel-2 and Ground-Truth Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterisation of functional-trait dynamics of vegetation from remotely sensed data complements the structural characterisation of ecosystems. In this study we characterised for the first time the spatial heterogeneity of the intra-annual dynamics of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) as a functional trait of the vegetation in Prades Mediterranean forest in Catalonia, Spain. FAPAR was derived from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on the Sentinel-2 satellite and validated by comparison with the ground measurements acquired in June 2017 at the annual peak of vegetation activity. The validation results showed that most of points were distributed along the 1:1 line, with no bias nor scattering: R-2 = 0.93, p < 0.05; with a root mean square error of 0.03 FAPAR (4.3%). We classified the study area into nine vegetation groups with different dynamics of FAPAR using a methodology that is objective and repeatable over time. This functional classification based on the annual magnitude (FAPAR-M) and the seasonality (FAPAR-CV) from the data on one year (2016-2017) complements structural classifications. The internal heterogeneity of the FAPAR dynamics in each land-cover type is attributed to the environmental and to the specific species composition variability. A spatial autoregressive (SAR) model for the main type of land cover, evergreen holm oak forest (Quercus ilex), indicated that topographic aspect, slope, height, and the topographic aspect x slope interaction accounted for most of the spatial heterogeneity of the functional trait FAPAR-M, thus improving our understanding of the explanatory factors of the annual absorption of photosynthetically active radiation by the vegetation canopy for this ecosystem.

TI  - Intraoperative sentinel node imaging versus SPECT/CT in oral cancer - A blinded comparison
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is gaining popularity as a staging tool in oral cancer. Protocol mandates radiotracer injection and pre-operative imaging (LSG +/- SPECT/CT) in the nuclear medicine department. This approach limits application to accessible tumours and to centres with nuclear medicine. New technology, freehand single photon emission computed tomography (fhSPECT), has proved a useful adjunct in intraoperative imaging and localisation of sentinel nodes. This study investigates fhSPECT as an alternative to traditional imaging, an approach that would widen the remit of SNB.Methods: Fifty consecutive cT1-T2 NO oral cancer patients received radiotracer followed by lympho-scintigraphy and SPECT/CT. Surgery was undertaken using fhSPECT by a surgeon blinded to pre-operative imaging. Prior to biopsy completion, results of pre-operative imaging were reviewed and any additional nodes removed. The accuracy of LSG, SPECT/CT and fhSPECT were compared.Results: Nineteen patients had positive sentinel nodes. Disease free survival for sentinel node positive versus negative was significant (p < 0.005).All modalities missed positive nodes in at least one patient. The false negative rate for lympho-scintigraphy, SPECT/CT and fhSPECT was 26.3%, 15.8% and 53% respectively.Discussion: These data show a surgeon naive to the results of traditional pre-operative sentinel node imaging can use fhSPECr in the operating theatre to accurately locate sentinel nodes in oral cancer. Freehand SPECT showed excellent sensitivity and a low false negative rate offering the possibility of a streamlined intraoperative sentinel node protocol.

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover Changes in the Hinterland of Barranquilla (Colombia) Using Landsat Imagery and Logistic Regression
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Barranquilla is known as a dynamically growing city in the Colombian Caribbean. Urbanisation induces land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the city and its hinterland affecting the region's climate and biodiversity. This paper aims to identify the trends of land use and land cover changes in the hinterland of Barranquilla corresponding to 13 municipalities in the north of the Department Atlantico. Landsat TM/ETM/OLI imagery from 1985 to 2017 was used to map and analyse the spatio-temporal development of land use and land cover changes. During the investigation period, the settlement areas grew by approximately 50% (from 103.3 to 153.6 km(2)), while areas with woody vegetation cover experienced dynamic changes and increased in size since 2001. Peri-urban and rural areas were characterized by highly dynamic changes, particularly regarding clearing and recovery of vegetated areas. Regression analyses were performed to identify the impact factors of detected vegetation cover changes. Computed logistic regression models included 20 independent variables, such as relief, climate, soil, proximity characteristics and socio-economic data. The results of this study may act as a basis to enable researchers and decision-makers to focus on the most important signals of systematic landscape transformations and on the conservation of ecosystems and the services they provide.

TI  - Analyzing land use change to identify migration corridors of African elephants (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>) in the Kenyan-Tanzanian borderlands
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextEast African ecosystems are characterized by the migrations of large herbivores that are highly vulnerable to the recent development of anthropogenic land use change.ObjectivesWe analyzed land cover changes in the Kenyan-Tanzanian borderlands of the greater Amboseli ecosystem to evaluate landscape connectivity using African elephants as an indicator species.MethodsWe used multi-temporal Landsat imagery and a post classification approach to monitor land cover changes over a 43-year period. GIS based methods were accompanied by a literature review for spatial data on land cover changes and elephant migrations.ResultsLand cover changed considerably between 1975 and 2017. Wood- and bushlands declined by 16.3% while open grasslands increased throughout the study region (+10.3%). Agricultural expansion was observed (+12.2%) occupying important wildlife habitats and narrowing migration corridors. This development has led to the isolation of Nairobi National Park which was previously part of a large contiguous ecosystem. Eight migration corridors were identified of which only one is formally protected. Two others are almost completely blocked by agriculture and three are expected to become endangered under continuing land use changes.ConclusionsLandscape connectivity is still viable for this ecosystem (except for Nairobi National Park). However, the current situation is very fragile as anthropogenic land use changes are threatening most of the identified large mammal migration corridors. Sustainable land use planning with regard to important wildlife habitats and connecting corridors is a crucial task for further conservation work to safeguard a viable future for wildlife populations in the Kenyan-Tanzanian borderlands.

TI  - Integration of Satellite Data with High Resolution Ratio: Improvement of Spectral Quality with Preserving Spatial Details
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Commonly used image fusion techniques generally produce good results for images obtained from the same sensor, with a standard ratio of spatial resolution (1: 4). However, an atypical high ratio of resolution reduces the effectiveness of fusion methods resulting in a decrease in the spectral or spatial quality of the sharpened image. An important issue is the development of a method that allows for maintaining simultaneous high spatial and spectral quality. The authors propose to strengthen the pan-sharpening methods through prior modification of the panchromatic image. Local statistics of the differences between the original panchromatic image and the intensity of the multispectral image are used to detect spatial details. The Euler's number and the distance of each pixel from the nearest pixel classified as a spatial detail determine the weight of the information collected from each integrated image. The research was carried out for several pan-sharpening methods and for data sets with different levels of spectral matching. The proposed solution allows for a greater improvement in the quality of spectral fusion, while being able to identify the same spatial details for most pan-sharpening methods and is mainly dedicated to Intensity-Hue-Saturation based methods for which the following improvements in spectral quality were achieved: about 30% for the urbanized area and about 15% for the non-urbanized area.

TI  - Remote monitoring to predict bridge scour failure using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) stacking techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Scour is the removal of ground material in water bodies due to environmental changes in water flow. It particularly occurs at bridge piers and the holes formed can make bridges susceptible to collapse. The most common cause of bridge collapse is due to scour occurring during flooding, some failures causing loss of life and most resulting in significant transport disruption and economic loss. Consequently, failure of bridges due to scour is of great concern to bridge asset owners, and is currently very difficult to predict since conventional assessment methods foresee very resource-demanding monitoring efforts in situ. This paper presents evidence of how InSAR techniques can be used to monitor bridges at risk of scour, using Tadcaster Bridge, England, as a case study. Tadcaster Bridge suffered a partial collapse due to river scour on the evening of December 29th, 2015 following a period of severe rainfall and flooding. 48 TerraSAR-X scenes over the bridge from the two-year period prior to the collapse are analysed using the small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) approach. The study highlights a distinct movement in the region of the bridge where the collapse occurred prior to the actual event. This precursor to failure observed in the data over a month before actual collapse suggests the possible use of InSAR as a means of an early warning system in structural health monitoring of bridges at risk of scour.

The aim of this study was to detect the virus that causes ARI hospitalized cases in three sentinel surveillance hospitals of severe ARI. Laboratory testing of 30 nasal and throat swab specimens from ARI hospitalized cases at Deli Serdang Hospital, Wonosari Hospital and Kanudjoso Djati Hospital during August - September 2016. Laboratory testing were carried out at the Virology Laboratory of the Center for Biomedical Research and Development and Basic Health Technology. This research is a preliminary study using Fast-Track Diagnostics multiplex Real-time RT-PCR to detect 21 viruses. The viruses that have been detected are Human Metapneumovirus (21.2%), Human Parainfluenza Virus 1 (12.1%), Influenza B (6.1%), Human Coronavirus-OC43 (6.1%), Human CoronavirusNL63 (6.1%), Human Parainfluenza Virus 2 (3.0%), Human Rhinovirus (3.0%), and Human Adenovirus (3.0%). Of the 17 samples that tested positive for viruses, 14 of them were single cases of infection while the other three were cases of co-infection between Human Coronavirus-NL63 and Human Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human Metapneumovirus with Human Coronavirus-OC43, and Human Adenovirus with Human Rhinovirus. The most detected virus from ARI hospitalized cases are the Human Metapneumovirus.

TI  - Evaluating and modeling the spatiotemporal pattern of regional-scale salinized land expansion in highly sensitive shoreline landscape of southeastern Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking an area of about 2.3x10(4) km(2) of southeastern Iran, this study aims to detect and predict regional-scale salt-affected lands. Three sets of Landsat images, each set containing 4 images for 1986, 2000, and 2015 were acquired as the main source of data. Radiometric, atmospheric and cutline blending methods were used to improve the quality of images and help better classify salinized land areas under the support vector machine method. A set of landscape metrics was also employed to detect the spatial pattern of salinized land expansion from 1986 to 2015. Four factors including distance to sea, distance to sea water channels, slope, and elevation were identified as the main contributing factors to land salinization. These factors were then integrated using the multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) procedure to generate land sensitivity map to salinization and also to calibrate the cellular-automata (CA) Markov chain (CA-Markov) model for simulation of salt-affected lands up to 2030, 2040 and 2050. The results of this study showed a dramatic dispersive expansion of salinized land from 7.7 % to 12.7% of the total study area from 1986 to 2015. The majority of areas prone to salinization and the highest sensitivity of land to salinization was found to be in the southeastern parts of the region. The result of the MCE-informed CA-Markov model revealed that 20.3% of the study area is likely to be converted to salinized lands by 2050. The findings of this research provided a view of the magnitude and direction of salinized land expansion in a past-to-future time period which should be considered in future land development strategies.

TI  - Mapping red edge-based vegetation health indicators using Landsat TM data for Australian native vegetation cover
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The usefulness of red edge bands, and vegetation indices based on red edge bands, for vegetation health monitoring has already been demonstrated. There are some satellites such as WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 acquiring images in red edge band data; while, the former data can be expensive and often lack consistent global coverage, the latter does not have a long term archive and consequently cannot be used for a long term time series analysis. This study tests the ability to predict red edge band and red edge-based vegetation indices through freely available Landsat Thematic Mapper data for an Australian Eucalyptus-dominated vegetation cover within and around a mine site. Two modelling strategies including multiple-linear regression as a linear approach and random forests as a non-linear approach were used. The results showed that it is possible to generate red edge derivatives using the Landsat Thematic Mapper data with less than 10% error using both linear and non-linear methods; however, the linear method resulted in higher estimation accuracies than non-linear methods.

TI  - Seasonal differences in climatic controls of vegetation growth in the Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Region of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Launched in 2002, the Beiing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project (BTSSCP) is an ecological restoration project intended to prevent desertification in China. Evidence from multiple sources has confirmed increases in vegetation growth in the BTSSCP region since the initiation of this project. Precipitation and essential climate variable-soil moisture (ECV-SM) conditions are typically considered to be the main drivers of vegetation growth in this region. Although many studies have investigated the inter-annual variations of vegetation growth, few concerns have been focused on the annual and seasonal variations of vegetation growth and their climatic drivers, which are crucial for understanding the relationships among the climate, vegetation, and human activities at the regional scale. Based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from MODIS and the corresponding climatic data, we explored the responses of vegetation growth to climatic factors at annual and seasonal scales in the BTSSCP region during the period 2000-2014. Over the study region as a whole, NDVI generally increased from 2000 to 2014, at a rate of 0.002/a. Vegetation growth is stimulated mainly by the elevated temperature in spring, whereas precipitation is the leading driver of summer greening. In autumn, positive effects of both temperature and precipitation on vegetation growth were observed. The warming in spring promotes vegetation growth but reduces ECV-SM. Summer greening has a strong cooling effect on land surface temperature. These results indicate that the ecological and environmental consequences of ecological restoration projects should be comprehensively evaluated.

TI  - Qualitative Dynamics of Suspended Particulate Matter in the Changjiang Estuary from Geostationary Ocean Color Images: An Empirical, Regional Modeling Approach
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Changjiang Estuary is characterized by a high concentration of significant diurnal dynamics. With a higher temporal resolution (eight images obtained per day), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) was selected as the primary remote sensor for the dynamics monitoring in this paper, instead of other satellite sensor working in polar orbit. Based on the characteristics of the field spectra measured in the estuary, an empirical model was established with the band ratio of R(rs)745 divided by R(rs)490 and proven effective in Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) estimation (R-2 = 0.9376, RMSE = 89.32 mg/L). While, Validation results showed that the model performed better in coastal turbid waters than offshore clear waters with higher chlorophyll-a concentration, stressing the importance of partitioning SPM into its major components and doing separate analysis. The hourly observations from GOCI showed that the diurnal variation magnitudes exhibited clear regional characteristics, with a maximum in the turbidity belt near the mouth and a minimum in the offshore deeper areas. In addition, comparing the monthly averaged SPM distribution with the amount of sediment discharged into the estuary, the variation in estuarine turbidity maximum zone is more likely contributed by the sediments resuspended from the sea bed that has already accumulated in the estuarine delta.

TI  - Reconstruction of Remotely Sensed Snow Albedo for Quality Improvements Based on a Combination of Forward and Retrieval Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow albedo plays an important role in the global climate system. There are notable missing data and error uncertainties in the current remote sensing snow albedo products that are attributed to the limits of remote-sensing technology. Due to the uncertainties of meteorological factors and the differences in various forward model simulation methods, snow albedo forward simulations also have considerable uncertainties. This paper suggests a long-time-series reconstruction of snow albedo utilizing a forward radiation-transferring model and a remote-sensing retrieval model together with multisource remotely sensed data and meteorological data. The key to this paper is to estimate snow information for areas lacking data utilizing a forward model for snow albedo with clear physical mechanisms. The estimated snow information can be used as reliable data for snow albedo reconstructions. The results indicate that the long time series of snow albedo data obtained by coupling the snow albedo retrieval model and forward simulation model is highly accurate. The mean absolute error, root mean square error, Pearson's correlation coefficient (R), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the observed and reconstructed snow albedos are 0.11, 0.14, 0.79, and 0.69, respectively. The reconstructed snow albedo data are underestimated by only 11% relative to the in situ snow surface albedo measurements. In the alpine mountain regions, the proposed method has a simulation accuracy that is 6% greater than that of the MOD10A1 SAD. This paper provides an effective reconstruction solution that improves the accuracy of estimations of snow albedo and fills gaps in the data.

TI  - CFAR-Based Adaptive PolSAR Speckle Filter
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The patch-based polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) nonlocal means (NLM) speckle filters are efficacious in noise suppression and detail preservation, but are computationally inefficient. The objective of this paper is to develop a filter that provides better noise suppression and edge preservation along with reduced computational complexity for PolSAR applications. In this paper, the patch-based NLM adaptive speckle filter based on constant false alarm rate (CFAR) edge detector is proposed. The CFAR-based edge detector is used to generate a map that classifies the data into three regions: homogeneous, heterogeneous, and strong edge dominant regions. The proposed speckle filter adapts itself suitably based on the heterogeneity of the region using classified regions as a mask. The performance of proposed filtering technique is evaluated on 1-look simulated (generated by Monte Carlo simulation), 1-look RADARSAT-2, and 4-look AIRSAR data. The performance evaluation is done based on the extent of noise reduction measured by equivalent number of looks, edge preservation degree, bias in estimation, polarimetric structure preservation, and visual appearance. The performance of the proposed filtering technique is found to be better than the state-of-the-art speckle filtering techniques like refined Lee, NLM pretest, and NL-SAR. The order of computational complexity of the proposed filter is found to be better than the pretest or NL-SAR filters.

TI  - MAPPING THE SLAVIC WORLD IN <i>THE DIARY OF A WRITER</i> BY F.M. DOSTOEVSKY
T2  - RUSIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the Slavic world as a political construct, when the Slavic idea was considered by FM. Dostoevsky as central to the mapping of Europe and as the leading force of the future world. Basing on the subjectivist interpretation of the worlds of imagination and concepts, the author emphsises Dostoevsky's unique communicative model in his book The Diary of a Writer. With its unprecedented audience coverage and style, based on the extrapolation of internal experience, it had a great impact on the worldview of contemporaries. The article deals with the foundation of Dostoevsky's Slavic world mapping as the opposition of the nascent "Slavic idea" to the two preceding ones - the "Catholic" (France) and the "Protestant" (Germany). The author demonstrates the evolution of these ideas in the modern world.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing for Water Resources Management: Potential for Supporting Sustainable Development in Data-Poor Regions
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Water resources management (WRM) for sustainable development presents many challenges in areas with sparse in situ monitoring networks. The exponential growth of satellite based information over the past decade provides unprecedented opportunities to support and improve WRM. Furthermore, traditional barriers to the access and usage of satellite data are lowering as technological innovations provide opportunities to manage and deliver this wealth of information to a wider audience. We review data needs for WRM and the role that satellite remote sensing can play to fill gaps and enhance WRM, focusing on the Latin American and Caribbean as an example of a region with potential to further develop its resources and mitigate the impacts of hydrological hazards. We review the state-of-the-art for relevant variables, current satellite missions, and products, how they are being used currently by national agencies across the Latin American and Caribbean region, and the challenges to improving their utility. We discuss the potential of recently launched, upcoming, and proposed missions that are likely to further enhance and transform assessment and monitoring of water resources. Ongoing challenges of accuracy, sampling, and continuity still need to be addressed, and further challenges related to the massive amounts of new data need to be overcome to best leverage the utility of satellite based information for improving WRM.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of Aboveground Biomass under Different Terrain Conditions
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass is a key biophysical parameter used to estimate carbon storage and forest productivity. Spatially-explicit estimation of biomass provides invaluable information for carbon stock calculation and scientific forest management. Nevertheless, there still exists large uncertainty concerning the relationship between biomass and influential factors. In this study, aboveground biomass (AGB) was estimated using the random forest algorithm based on remote sensing imagery (Landsat) and field data for three regions with different topographic conditions in Zhejiang Province, China. AGB distribution and change combined with stratified terrain classifications were analyzed to investigate the relations between AGB and topography conditions. The results indicated that AGB in three regions increased from 2010 to 2015 and the magnitude of growth varied with elevation, slope, and aspect. In the basin region, slope had a greater influence on AGB, and we attributed this negative AGB-elevation relationship to ecological forest construction. In the mountain area, terrain features, especially elevation, showed significant relations with AGB. Moreover, AGB and its growth showed positive relations with elevation and slope. In the island region, slope also played a relatively more important role in explaining the relationship. These results demonstrate that AGB varies with terrain conditions and its change is a consequence of interactions between the natural environment and anthropogenic behavior, implying that biomass retrieval based on Landsat imagery could provide considerable important information related to regional heterogeneity investigations.

TI  - Multi-sensor airborne and satellite data for upscaling tree number information in a structurally complex eucalypt forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on the number and density of trees is important for conservation and sustainable use of forest resources. In this respect, remote sensing technology is a reliable tool for deriving timely and fine-scale information on forest inventory attributes. However, to better predict and understand the functioning of the forest, fine-scale measures of tree number and density must be extrapolated to the forest plot or stand levels through upscaling. In this study, we compared and combined three sources of remotely sensed data, including low point density airborne laser scans (ALS), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and very-high resolution WorldView-2 imagery to upscale the total number of trees to the plot level in a structurally complex eucalypt forest using random forest regression. We used information on number of trees previously derived from high point density ALS as training data for a random forest regressor and field inventory data for validation. Overall, our modelled estimates resulted in significant fits (p < 0.05) with goodness-of-fit (R-2) of 0.61, but systematically underestimated tree numbers. The ALS predictor variables (e.g. canopy cover and height) were the best for estimating tree numbers (R-2 = 0.48, nRMSE = 61%), as compared to WorldView-2 and SAR predictor variables (R-2 < 0.35). Overall, the combined use of WorldView-2, MS and SAR predictors for estimating tree numbers showed substantial improvement in R-2 of up to 0.13 as compared to their individual use. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using low point density ALS, SAR and WorldView-2 imagery to upscale high point density ALS derived tree numbers at the plot level in a structurally complex eucalypt forest.

TI  - Absorbing Aerosol Sensor on Gao-Fen 5B satellite
T2  - ADVANCED OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Absorbing Aerosol Sensor (AAS) will be launched aboard the GaoFen-5B satellite in China. The main purpose of AAS is to monitor absorbing aerosols by measuring the solar backscatter radiation. AAS is an ultraviolet-visible imaging spectrometer that uses a single charge coupled device to capture both the spectrum and the cross-track direction with a 114 degrees wide swath. The large field of view enables daily global coverage with 4-km spatial resolution. The spectral range of the instrument extends from 340 to 550 nm with spectral resolution (full width at half maximum) of 2 nm. This paper provides details of the instrument design, including system design, optical design, and mechanical design, as well as detector and calibration unit on orbit. The numerous simulations show that all design results satisfy the specification and vibration requirements of the instrument.

TI  - The Spatio-Temporal Evolution of River Island Based on Landsat Satellite Imagery, Hydrodynamic Numerical Simulation and Observed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A river island is a shaped sediment accumulation body with its top above the water's surface in crooked or branching streams. In this paper, four river islands in Yangzhong City in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were studied. The spatio-temporal evolution information of the islands was quantitatively extracted using the threshold value method, binarization model, and cluster analysis, based on Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) images of the Landsat satellite series from 1985 to 2015. The variation mechanism and influencing factors were analyzed using an unstructured-grid, Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) hydrodynamic numerical simulation, as well as the water-sediment data measured by hydrological stations. The annual average total area of these islands was 251,224.46 m(2) during 1985-2015, and the total area first increased during 1985-2000 and decreased later during 2000-2015. Generally, the total area increased during these 30 years. Taipingzhou island had the largest area and the biggest changing rate, Xishadao island had the smallest area, and Zhongxinsha island had the smallest changing rate. The river islands' area change was influenced by river runoff, sediment discharge, and precipitation, and sediment discharge proved to be the most significant natural factor in island evolution. River island evolution was also found to be affected by both runoff and oceanic tide. The difference in flow-field caused silting up in the Leigongdao Island and the head of Taipingzhou Island, and a serious reduction in the middle and tail of Taipingzhou Island. The method used in this paper has good applicability to river islands in other rivers around the world.

TI  - Geo-detection of factors controlling spatial patterns of heavy metals in urban topsoil using multi-source data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal contamination has become a serious and widespread problem in urban environment. Understanding its controlling factors is vital for the identification, prevention, and remediation of pollution sources. This study aimed to identify the factors controlling heavy metal accumulation in urban topsoil using the geodetector method and multiple data sources. Environmental factors including geology, relief (elevation, slope, and aspect), and organism (land-use and vegetation) were extracted from a geological thematic map, digital elevation model, and time-series of Landsat images, respectively. Then, the power of determinant (q) was calculated using geodetector to measure the affinity between the environmental factors and arsenic (As) and lead (Pb). Geology was the dominant factor for As distribution in the this study area; it explained 38% of the spatial variation in As, and nonlinear enhancements were observed for the interactions between geology and elevation (q = 0.50) and slope (q = 0.49). Land-use and vegetation bi-enhanced each other and explained 39% of the spatial variation in Pb. These results indicated that geology and relief were the factors controlling the spatial distribution of As, and organism factors, especially anthropogenic activities, were the factors controlling the spatial distribution of Pb in the study area. As was derived from weathering transportation, and deposition processes of original bedrock and subsequent pedogenesis, and anthropogenic activity was the most likely source of Pb contamination in urban topsoil in Shenzhen. Moreover, geodetector provided evidence to explore the factors controlling spatial patterns of heavy metals in soils. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tree species classification using plant functional traits from LiDAR and hyperspectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant functional traits have been extensively used to describe, rank and discriminate species according to their variability between species in classical plant taxonomy. However, the utility of plant functional traits for tree species classification from remote sensing data in natural forests has not been clearly established. In this study, we integrated three selected plant functional traits (i.e. equivalent water thickness (Cw), leaf mass per area (Cm) and leaf chlorophyll (Cab)) retrieved from hyperspectral data with hyperspectral derived spectral features and airborne LiDAR derived metrics for mapping five tree species in a natural forest in Germany. Our results showed that when plant functional traits were combined with spectral features and LiDAR metrics, an overall accuracy of 83.7% was obtained, which was statistically significantly higher than using LiDAR (65.1%) or hyperspectral (69.3%) data alone. The results of our study demonstrate that plant functional traits retrieved from hyperspectral data using radiative transfer models can be used in conjunction with hyperspectral features and LiDAR metrics to further improve individual tree species classification in a mixed temperate forest.

TI  - Using biomarkers to address the impacts of pollution on limpets (<i>Patella depressa</i>) and their mechanisms to cope with stress
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Contaminant discharges, derived from human activities, are major concerns as they exert a continuous ecological pressure on aquatic systems, causing in fact cascading community effects. Although with associated ecological and fitness costs, physiological and biochemical defense mechanisms may restore the organism's internal balance. Several studies have pointed biomarkers as tools to assess contamination levels, and also to understand potential mechanisms to cope with stress. In the present study, the fitness costs of limpets Patella depressa located in two different contaminated sites and when transplanted into a different common environment - with no known historical contamination - were assessed through the measurement of oxidative stress, energy metabolism responses, and fatty acid profile changes. Integrated biomarker response index (IBR) revealed differences in responses between organisms of the different origin sites, with greater antioxidant and detoxification activities in the site with the higher contamination life-history (higher IBR index). Moreover, different abilities of this species to deal with the new environmental condition were also observed. After the transplant, and despite the differences in the initial profiles, response patterns became similar between both populations (similar IBR index), with organisms from the less contaminated site suffering a higher impact with a demarked increase in their detoxification and antioxidant defenses, as well as higher changes on fatty acid abundance/composition. Through an integrated biomarker profile analysis in a transplant context, this work provides a distinct insight on the mechanisms of response and tolerance to environmental stress, and fitness costs of this potential sentinel marine species in the context of environmental contamination changes.

TI  - Small inner marsh area delimitation using remote sensing spectral indexes and decision tree method in southern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vast small inner marsh (SIM) areas have been lost in the past few decades through the conversion to agricultural, urban and industrial lands. The remaining marshes face several threats such as drainage for agriculture, construction of roads and port facilities, waste disposal, among others. This study integrates 17 remote sensing spectral indexes and decision tree (DT) method to map SIM areas using Sentinel 2A images from Summer and Winter seasons. Our results showed that remote sensing indexes, although not developed specifically for wetland delimitation, presented satisfactory results in order to classify these ecosystems. The indexes that showed to be more useful for marshes classification by DT techniques in the study area were NDTI, BI, NDPI and BI_2, with 25.9%, 17.7%, 11.1% and 0.8%, respectively. In general, the Proportion Correct (PC) found was 95.9% and 77.9% for the Summer and Winter images respectively. We hypothetize that this significant PC variation is related to the rice-planting period in the Summer and/or to the water level oscillation period in the Winter. For future studies, we recommend the use of active remote sensors (e.g., radar) and soil maps in addition to the remote sensing spectral indexes in order to obtain better results in the delimitation of small inner marsh areas.

TI  - Combination Technique Is Superior to Dye Alone in Identification of the Sentinel Lymph Node in Male Breast Cancer
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the main method in staging the axilla. There are insufficient data available regarding the accuracy of an SLN biopsy in male breast cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of dye and radiotracer would improve the detection rate of SLNs versus dye alone in male breast cancer patients. From February 2009 to January 2012, our SLN biopsy database was retrospectively reviewed to identify male breast cancer cases. Of the 890 SLN procedures contained in the database, 10 male breast cancer patients were identified. Patient age, body mass index, SLN biopsy technique, SLN identification, number of SLN excised, and pathology reports were reviewed. Mean age was 57.2 (34-85) years with a mean tumor size was 2.2 (1.0-4.0) cm. SLN detection ratios were two in four with blue dye and six in six with the combination technique. Overall, SLNs were identified in 8 of the 10 patients. SLN biopsy is applicable in male breast cancer cases. The addition of a radiotracer to the dye in SLN biopsy increases the detection rate of sentinel nodes in male breast cancer patients.

TI  - Hypsometric Analysis Using Microwave Satellite Data and GIS of Naina-Gorma River Basin (Rewa district, Madhya Pradesh, India)
T2  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding about the stages of geomorphic evolution and geological development of any river catchment and its proneness to erosional process is important for managing the water resources and loss of sediment. Hence, this work is focused on identification of the growth stage of Naina-Gorma river basin and its sub-basins. Hypsometric curve (HC) and hypsometric integral (HI) have been estimated using microwave satellite data in the geographical information system (GIS) environment. The result shows that the HI value ranges from 0.36 to 0.89, indicating youth to mature stage of geomorphic development for river basin and its 15 sub-basins. Therefore, the sub-basins which are at youth age stage of geomorphic development are of high susceptibility to medium to complex denudational processes, erosion, channel erosion, and mass movement activity. This mass movement is due to variation in tectonic activity, rejuvenation processes, and lithology of the area. It helps to measure watershed health, represent the form, its evolution, and morphology of river basin. The results of the statistical analysis suggest that positive statistical relationship exists between the area and the hypsometric integral groups of the 15 sub-basins. It also plays an important role in explaining the dynamics of surface and subsurface water runoff generation. The results of the study have been validated through field visits and surveys. The findings of the work would help in construction and adoption of appropriate soil and water conservation measures in the rain-fed river system to retard the soil erosion and conservation of water.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of the Characteristics of Active Fires in the Boreal Forests of Eurasia and North America Based on Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of the detection data on active fires from the MODIS satellite instrument in the 2000-2016 period an analysis of the characteristics of forest fires in the boreal zones of Eurasia and North America was carried out. The total number of the forest fires in the boreal zone is dominated by the fires in Northern Eurasia. At the same time, the intensity of the North American forest fires is higher on average than the intensity of the Eurasian forest fires. Along with some tendency to a reduction of the annual number of boreal fires, there are tendencies towards an increase in the intensity of the average forest fire, which are statistically significant for the North American region and for the boreal zone as a whole. The regional features of the long-term characteristics and the seasonal dependence of forest fires, as well as the regional peculiarities of the interannual variations of the fire level in the boreal forests, were discussed. A comparative analysis of the results of detection of fires by MODIS and VIIRS satellite instruments was carried out.

TI  - Analysis of Approaches to the Systematization of Thematic Tasks Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematization of thematic tasks that are solved using remote sensing data (RSD) is one of the ways to improve the effectiveness of the practical application of the results of space activities. Different approaches to the selection of priorities and thematic areas for the use of RSD are shown based on the example of separate world and Russian space monitoring programs. The results of the analysis of the considered approaches make it possible to identify a number of principles for constructing an integrated information platform whose purpose is to formulate a strategy and determine the prospects for the development of domestic remote monitoring programs in the first approximation. Current tendencies in remote sensing show that the content of such a platform goes beyond the sectoral, instrumental, regional, and other classifications. The development of a comprehensive classifier of thematic tasks can be the first step for implementing such a platform.

TI  - The Application of Freely-Available Satellite Imagery for Informing and Complementing Archaeological Fieldwork in the "Black Desert" of North-Eastern Jordan
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in the availability of very high-resolution satellite imagery through platforms like GoogleEarth (Google, Santa Clara County, CA, USA) and Bing Maps (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) have greatly opened up the possibilities of their use by researchers. This paper focusses on the exclusive use of free remote sensing data by the Western Harra Survey (WHS), an archaeological project investigating the arid "Black Desert" of north-eastern Jordan, a largely impenetrable landscape densely strewn with basalt blocks. The systematic analysis of such data by conducting a holistic satellite survey prior to the commencement of fieldwork allowed for the precise planning of ground surveys, with advanced knowledge of which sites were vehicle-accessible and how to efficiently visit a stratified sample of different site types. By subsequently correlating the obtained ground data with this analysis, it was possible to create a typological seriation of the site forms known as "wheels", determine that at least two-thirds of sites are within 500 m of valleys or mudflats (highlighting these features roles as access routes and resource clusters) and identify numerous anthropogenic paths cleared through the basalt for site access and long-distance travel. These results offer new insights into this underrepresented region and allow for supra-regional comparisons with better investigated areas by a method that is rapid and cost-effective.

TI  - Sentinel lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer using near infrared fluorescence from indocyanine green combined with technetium-99m-nanocolloid
T2  - LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveSentinel diagnostic in cervical cancer is performed using Technetium-99m-nanocolloid as a radioactive marker with or without patent blue. In the last years, indocyanine green has been evaluated for sentinel diagnostic in different tumor entities. Indocyanine green is a fluorescent molecule which emits a light signal in the near infrared band after excitation. Our study aims to evaluate indocyanine green compared to the gold standard Tc-99m-nanocolloid.Materials and MethodsWe included patients with early cervical cancer up to FIGO stage IIA with clinically node-negative pelvic sites and the indication for nodal staging in this prospective trial. Sentinel diagnostic was carried out using Tc-99m-nanocolloid, indocyanine green and patent blue. We examined each pelvic site for light signals from the near infrared band, for radioactivity and for blue staining. A sentinel lymph node was defined as a Tc-99m-nanocolloid positive lymph node. All sentinel lymph nodes and all additional blue or fluorescent lymph nodes were excised and tested; then sent to histologic examination.ResultsThirty-three patients were included in which we found 211 Tc-99m-nanocolloid-positive sentinel lymph nodes in 66 pelvic sites. Two hundred and seven of these lymph nodes were positive for indocyanine green, too, giving a sensitivity of 98.1% (95%CI 94.9-99.4%) compared to Tc-99m-nanocolloid. One hundred and sixty additional lymph nodes showed indocyanine green fluorescence but no Tc-99m-positivity, so that the sensitivity was 79.6% (95%CI 76.6-82.3%). In one patient, a pelvic site was only identified to be tumor infiltrated due to an ICG-positive, but Tc-99m-negative lymph node.ConclusionOur results show that indocyanine green is a promising approach for pelvic sentinel identification in cervical cancer. ICG has a similar sensitivity as radioactive Tc-99m-nanocolloid and may enhance both patient safety and surgeons' comfort. Lasers Surg. Med. 50:994-1001, 2018. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Assessment of atmospheric correction methods for Sentinel-2 images in Mediterranean landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction of optical satellite imagery is an essential pre-processing for modelling biophysical variables, multi-temporal analysis, and digital classification processes. Sentinel-2 products available for users are distributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) as Top Of Atmosphere reflectance values in cartographic geometry (Level-1C product). In order to obtain Bottom Of Atmosphere reflectance images (Level-2A product) derived from this Level-1C products, ESA provides the SEN2COR module, which is implemented in the Sentinel Application Platform. Alternatively, ESA recently distributes Level-2A products processed by SEN2COR with a default configuration. On the other hand, the conversion from Level-1C to Level-2A product can be generated using alternative atmospheric correction methods, such as MAJA, 6S, or iCOR. In this context, this paper aims to evaluate the quality of Level-2A products obtained through different methods in Mediterranean shrub and grasslands by comparing data obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery with field spectrometry data. For that purpose, six plots with different land covers (asphalt, grass, shrub, pasture, and bare soil) were analyzed, by using synchronous imagery to fieldwork (from July to September 2016). The results suggest the suitability of the applied atmospheric corrections, with coefficients of determination higher than 0.90 and root mean square error lower than 0.04 achieving a relative error in bottom of atmosphere reflectance of only 2-3%. Nevertheless, minor differences were observed between the four tested methods, with slightly varying results depending on the spectral band and land cover.

TI  - Pre-harvest Sugarcane Yield Estimation Using UAV-Based RGB Images and Ground Observation
T2  - SUGAR TECH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane supply can vary according to the cultivation area, climatic condition, and disease. Although there are several scientific simulation models for sugarcane yield estimation, they are not widely and efficiently used due to a large number of data requirements. The success of yield estimation using remote sensing and aerial observation was limited due to the insufficient spatial requirement and spectral requirement. This study introduces a technique to use UAV-acquired RGB images coupled with ground information for reliable and fast estimation of sugarcane yield for two popular varieties (KK3 and UT12) in Thailand. The first challenge was to discriminate sugarcane and non-sugarcane pixels in the images. For this purpose, both object-based image analysis (OBIA) and pixel-based image analysis techniques were investigated. The results revealed that OBIA technique (GLCM) could determine sugarcane pixels with 92 and 96% accuracy while pixel-based ExG method had accuracy of 84 and 88% for both the varieties. After identification of sugarcane pixels, the numbers of stalks, average height, and weight data were collected from 30 random sample points (size of 2mx2m) from each variety. Using natural break method sampling, classes were created based on pixel value and number of stalks. The yield was finally estimated from sugarcane pixels using ground data and compared with harvested yield of both varieties. The object-based method produced the best result followed by pixel-based and traditional technique to estimate the yield. The very high spatial resolution of UAV image and advanced image classification of OBIA demonstrate significant potential for the farmers and related industries to predict yield before harvest.

TI  - Evaluation of Recent Magma Activity of Sierra Negra Volcano, Galapagos Using SAR Remote Sensing
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of subtle ground deformation of volcanoes plays an important role in evaluating the risk and possibility of volcanic eruptions. Ground-fixed observation equipment is difficult to maintain and cost-inefficient. In contrast, satellite remote sensing can regularly monitor at low cost. In this paper, following the study of Chadwick et al. (2006), which applied the interferometric SAR (InSAR) technique to the Sierra Negra volcano, Galapagos. In order to investigate the deformation of the volcano before 2005 eruption, the recent activities of this volcano were analyzed using Sentinel-1, the latest SAR satellite. We obtained the descending mode Sentinel-1A SAR data from January 2017 to January 2018, applied the Persistent Scatter InSAR, and estimated the depth and expansion quantity of magma in recent years through the Mogi model. As a result, it was confirmed that the activity pattern of volcano prior to the eruption in June 2018 was similar to the pattern before the eruption in 2005 and was successful in estimating the depth and expansion amount. The results of this study suggest that satellite SAR can characterize the activity patterns of volcano and can be possibly used for early monitoring of volcanic eruption.

TI  - Spatial and Quantitative Comparison of Topographically Derived Different Classification Algorithms Using AWiFS Data over Himalayas, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the significant increase in research on spatial information is observed. Classification or clustering is one of the well-known methods in spatial data analysis. Traditionally, classifiers are generally based on per-pixel approaches and are not utilizing the spatial information within pixel, called mixels which is an important source of information to image classification. There are two foremost reasons behind the existence of mixels: (a) coarse or low spatial resolution of sensor and (b) topographic effects that recorded on optical satellite imagery due to differential terrain illuminations over rugged areas such as Himalayas. In the present study, different classification algorithms have been implemented to drive the impact of topography on them. Among various available, three algorithms for the mapping of snow cover region over north Indian Himalayas (India) are compared: (a) maximum likelihood classification (MLC) as supervised classifier; (b) k-mean clustering as unsupervised classifier; and (c) linear spectral mixing model (LSMM) as soft classifier. These algorithms have been implemented on AWiFS multispectral data, and analysis was carried out. The classification accuracy is estimated by the error matrices, and LSMM achieved higher accuracy (84.5-88.5%) as compared to MLC (81-84%) and k-mean (74-81%). The results highlight that topographically derived classifiers achieved better accuracy in mapping as compared to simple classifiers. The study has many applications in snow hydrology, glaciology and climatology of mountain topography.

TI  - Spectral Mixture Analysis as a Unified Framework for the Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study illustrates a unified, physically-based framework for mapping landscape parameters of evapotranspiration (ET) using spectral mixture analysis (SMA). The framework integrates two widely used approaches by relating radiometric surface temperature to subpixel fractions of substrate (S), vegetation (V), and dark (D) spectral endmembers (EMs). Spatial and temporal variations in these spectral endmember fractions reflect process-driven variations in soil moisture, vegetation phenology, and illumination. Using all available Landsat 8 scenes from the peak growing season in the agriculturally diverse Sacramento Valley of northern California, we characterize the spatiotemporal relationships between each of the S, V, D land cover fractions and apparent brightness temperature (T) using bivariate distributions in the ET parameter spaces. The dark fraction scales inversely with shortwave broadband albedo ( < -0.98), and show a multilinear relationship to T. Substrate fraction estimates show a consistent ( approximate to 0.7 to 0.9) linear relationship to T. The vegetation fraction showed the expected triangular relationship to T. However, the bivariate distribution of V and T shows more distinct clustering than the distributions of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based proxies and T. Following the Triangle Method, the V fraction is used with T to compute the spatial maps of the ET fraction (EF; the ratio of the actual total ET to the net radiation) and moisture availability (Mo; the ratio of the actual soil surface evaporation to potential ET at the soil surface). EF and Mo estimates derived from the V fraction distinguish among rice growth stages, and between rice and non-rice agriculture, more clearly than those derived from transformed NDVI proxies. Met station-based reference ET & soil temperatures also track vegetation fraction-based estimates of EF & Mo more closely than do NDVI-based estimates of EF & Mo. The proposed approach using S, V, D land cover fractions in conjunction with T (SVD+T) provides a physically-based conceptual framework that unifies two widely-used approaches by simultaneously mapping the effects of albedo and vegetation abundance on the surface temperature field. The additional information provided by the third (Substrate) fraction suggests a potential avenue for ET model improvement by providing an explicit observational constraint on the exposed soil fraction and its moisture-modulated brightness. The structures of the T, EF & Mo vs SVD feature spaces are complementary and that can be interpreted in the context of physical variables that scale linearly and that can be represented directly in process models. Using the structure of the feature spaces to represent the spatiotemporal trajectory of crop phenology is possible in agricultural settings, because variations in the timing of planting and irrigation result in continuous trajectories in the physical parameter spaces that are represented by the feature spaces. The linear scaling properties of the SMA fraction estimates from meter to kilometer scales also facilitate the vicarious validation of ET estimates using multiple resolutions of imagery.

The 2010 MODIS MOD09 and MYD09 8-day reflectance data was processed into monthly NDVI maps with the Time Series Product Tool software package and then used to classify regionally common forest and agricultural LULC types. Dry season circa 2010 Landsat top of atmosphere reflectance mosaics were classified to map locally common LULC types. Unsupervised ISODATA clustering was used to derive most LULC classifications. MODIS and Landsat classifications were combined with GIS methods to derive final 250-m LULC maps for Sub-basins (SBs) 1-8 of the LMB. The SB 7 LULC map with 14 classes was assessed for accuracy. This assessment compared random locations for sampled types on the SB 7 LULC map to geospatial reference data such as Landsat RGBs, MODIS NDVI phenologic profiles, high resolution satellite data, and Mekong River Commission data (e.g., crop calendars). The SB 7 LULC map showed an overall agreement to reference data of similar to 81%. By grouping three deciduous forest classes into one, the overall agreement improved to similar to 87%. The project enabled updated regional LULC maps that included more detailed agriculture LULC types. LULC maps were supplied to project partners to improve use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool for modeling hydrology and water use, plus enhance LMB water and disaster management in a region vulnerable to flooding, droughts, and anthropogenic change as part of basin planning and assessment.

TI  - Modelling LiDAR derived tree canopy height from Landsat TM, ETM plus and OLI satellite imagery-A machine learning approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding ecological changes in native vegetation communities often requires information over long time periods (multiple decades). Tropical cyclones can have a major impact on woody vegetation structure across northern Australia, however understanding the impacts on woody vegetation structure is limited. Woody vegetation structural attributes such as height are used in ecological studies to identify long term changes and trends. LiDAR has been used to measure woody vegetation structure, however LiDAR datasets cover relatively small areas and historical coverage is restricted, limiting the use of this technology for monitoring long-term change. The Landsat archive spans multiple decades and is suitable for regional/continental assessment. Advances in predictive modelling using machine learning algorithms have enabled complex relationships between dependent and independent variables to be identified. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model to estimate woody vegetation height from Landsat imagery to assist in understanding change through space and time. A LiDAR canopy height model was produced covering a range of vegetation communities in northern Australia (Darwin region) for use as the dependent variable. A random forest regression model was developed to predict mean LiDAR canopy height (30 m spatial resolution) from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM). Validation of the random forest model was undertaken on independent data (n = 30,500) resulting in an overall R-2 = 0.53, RMSE of 2.8 m. Assessment of the RMSE within four broad vegetation communities ranged from 2.5 to 3.7 m with the two dominant communities in the study area Mangrove forests and Eucalyptus communities recording an RMSE value of 2.9 m and 2.5 m respectively. The model was also applied to Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) resulting in an R-2 of 0.49, RMSE of 2.8 m. The model was then applied to all cloud free Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery (106/69 path/row) available between the months April, May and June for 1987 to 2016 to produce annual estimates (29 years) of canopy height. A number of time traces were produced to illustrate tree canopy height through time in the Darwin region which was severely impacted by cyclone (hurricane) Tracy on the 25th December 1974.

TI  - Combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for improved land use and land cover mapping of monsoon regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover maps can support our understanding of coupled human-environment systems and provide important information for environmental modeling and water resource management. Satellite data are a valuable source for land use and land cover mapping. However, cloud-free or weather independent data are necessary to map cloud-prone regions. This particularly applies to monsoon regions such as the Chennai basin, located in the north of Tamil Nadu and the south of Andhra Pradesh, India, which is influenced by the South Asian Monsoon and has abundant cloud cover, throughout the monsoon season. The Basin is characterized by small-scale agriculture with multiple cropping seasons and the rapidly developing metropolitan area of Chennai. This study aims to generate a land use and land cover map of the Chennai Basin for the cropping season of Rabi 2015/16 and to assess the influence of combining the new ESA Copernicus satellites Sentinel-1 and -2 on classification accuracies. A Random Forest based wrapper approach was applied to select the most relevant radar (Sentinel-1) images for the combination with the optical (Sentinel-2) data. Area proportion weighted accuracy with 95% confidence interval were estimated for the Random Forest models, which differentiated 13 land cover classes. The highest overall accuracy of 91.53% +/- 0.89 pp was achieved with a combination of 1 Sentinel-2 and 8 Sentinel-1 scenes. This is an improvement of 5.68 pp over a classification with Sentinel-2 data only. An addition of further Sentinel-1 scenes showed no improvement in overall accuracy. The strongest improvement in class-specific accuracy was achieved for paddy fields. This study shows for the first time how land use and land cover classifications in cloud-prone monsoon regions with small-scale agriculture and multiple cropping patterns can be improved by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Trend Analysis of Las Vegas Land Cover and Temperature Using Remote Sensing
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Las Vegas urban area expanded rapidly during the last two decades. In order to understand the impacts on the environment, it is imperative that the rate and type of urban expansion is determined. Remote sensing is an efficient and effective way to study spatial change in urban areas and Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) is a valuable technique to retrieve subpixel landcover information from remote sensing images. In this research, urban growth trends in Las Vegas are studied over the 1990 to 2010 period using images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). The SMA model of TM pixels is calibrated using high resolution NAIP classified image. The trends of land cover change are related to the land surface temperature trends derived from TM thermal infrared images. The results show that the rate of change of various land covers followed a linear trend in Las Vegas. The largest increase occurred in residential buildings followed by roads and commercial buildings. Some increase in vegetation cover in the form of tree cover and open spaces (grass) is also seen and there is a gradual decrease in barren land and bladed ground. Trend analysis of temperature shows a reduction over the new development areas with increased vegetation cover especially, in the form of golf courses and parks. This research provides a useful insight about the role of vegetation in ameliorating temperature rise in arid urban areas.

TI  - Iron Regulation: Macrophages in Control
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Macrophages are sentinel cells of the innate immune system and have important functions in development, tissue homeostasis, and immunity. These phylogenetically ancient cells also developed a variety of mechanisms to control erythropoiesis and the handling of iron. Red pulp macrophages in the spleen, Kupffer cells in the liver, and central nurse macrophages in the bone marrow ensure a coordinated metabolism of iron to support erythropoiesis. Phagocytosis of senescent red blood cells by macrophages in the spleen and the liver provide a continuous delivery of recycled iron under steady-state conditions and during anemic stress. Central nurse macrophages in the bone marrow utilize this iron and provide a cellular scaffold and niche to promote differentiation of erythroblasts. This review focuses on the role of the distinct macrophage populations that contribute to efficient iron metabolism and highlight important cellular and systemic mechanisms involved in iron-regulating processes.

TI  - Modelling End-of-Season Soil Salinity in Irrigated Agriculture Through Multi-temporal Optical Remote Sensing, Environmental Parameters, and In Situ Information
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information of soil salinity levels enables for remediation actions in long-term operating irrigation systems with malfunctioning drainage and shallow groundwater (GW), as they are widespread throughout the Aral Sea Basin (ASB). Multi-temporal Landsat 5 data combined with GW levels and potentials, elevation and relative topographic position, and soil (clay content) parameters, were used for modelling bulk electromagnetic induction (EMI) at the end of the irrigation season. Random forest (RF) regressionwas applied to predict in situ observations of 2008-2011 which originated from a cotton research station in Uzbekistan. Validation, i.e. median statistics from 100 RF runs with a holdout of each 20% of the samples, revealed that mono-temporal (R-2: 0.1-0.18, RMSE: 16.7-24.9mSm(-1)) underperformed multi-temporal RS data (R-2: 0.29-0.45; RMSE: 15.1-20.9mSm(-1)). Combinations of multi-temporal RS data with environmental parameters achieved highest accuracies (R-2: 0.36-0.50, RMSE: 13.2-19.9mSm(-1)). Beside RS data recorded at the initial peaks of the major irrigation phases, terrain and GW parameters turned out to be important variables for the model. RF preferred neither raw data nor spectral indices known to be suitable for detecting soil salinity. Unexplained variance components result from missing environmental variables, but also from processes not considered in the data. A calibration of the EMI for electrical conductivity and the standard soil salinity classification returned an overall accuracy of 76-83% for the period 2008-2011. The presented indirect approach together with the in situ calibration of the EMI data can support an accurate mapping of soil salinity at the end of the season, at least in the type of irrigation systems found in the ASB.

TI  - Hyperspectral Mixed Denoising via Spectral Difference-Induced Total Variation and Low-Rank Approximation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploration of multiple priors on observed signals has been demonstrated to be one of the effective ways for recovering underlying signals. In this paper, a new spectral difference-induced total variation and low-rank approximation (termed SDTVLA) method is proposed for hyperspectral mixed denoising. Spectral difference transform, which projects data into spectral difference space (SDS), has been proven to be powerful at changing the structures of noises (especially for sparse noise with a specific pattern, e.g., stripes or dead lines present at the same position in a series of bands) in an original hyperspectral image (HSI), thus allowing low-rank techniques to get rid of mixed noises more efficiently without treating them as low-rank features. In addition, because the neighboring pixels are highly correlated and the spectra of homogeneous objects in a hyperspectral scene are always in the same low-dimensional manifold, we are inspired to combine total variation and the nuclear norm to simultaneously exploit the local piecewise smoothness and global low rankness in SDS for mixed noise reduction of HSI. Finally, the alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to effectively solve the SDTVLA model. Extensive experiments on three simulated and two real HSI datasets demonstrate that, in terms of quantitative metrics (i.e., the mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (MPSNR), the mean structural similarity index (MSSIM) and the mean spectral angle (MSA)), the proposed SDTVLA method is, on average, 1.5 dB higher MPSNR values than the competitive methods as well as performing better in terms of visual effect.

TI  - Estimation of Actual Evapotranspiration in a Semiarid Region Based on GRACE Gravity Satellite DataA Case Study in Loess Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Jointly influenced by natural factors and artificial protection measures in recent years, the vegetation coverage of the Loess Plateau has significantly increased. However, extensive vegetation recovery can result in massive water consumption and a severe soil water deficit, which poses a great threat to the sustainable development of the regional ecological system. Maintaining the balance between precipitation and water consumption is an important foundation of ecological security in the Loess Plateau. Based on this, the present study used the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) gravity satellite data to simulate the annual actual water consumption from 2003 to 2014 and to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of the regional precipitation and the actual evapotranspiration (AET). This study also applied the newly developed rainwater utilization potential index (IRUP) to quantify the sustainability of the water balance in the Loess Plateau. The spatial-temporal patterns of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and AET from 2003 to 2014 in the Loess Plateau were all analyzed in this study. Based on the results, the annual average precipitation (AAP) and AET in the entire Loess Plateau had significant increasing trends. The analysis of the spatial distribution reveals that the AET was decreasing from the southeast to the northwest in the Loess Plateau. However, the average values of potential evapotranspiration did not obviously change. Based on the estimated AET result, it was determined that the average IRUP had an increasing trend. The increase in the IRUP is due to an increased rate of precipitation that is statistically higher than that of the AET. Consequently, the Loess Plateau experienced a wetting trend during the period of 2003-2014, especially after the Grain for Green project was implemented. The results in this paper were proven by using three different depths of ERA-Interim (a global atmospheric reanalysis product created by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) soil water content data from the same period and the observed runoff data from 18 different hydrological sites. Consequently, it seems that the vegetation could maintain a sustainable growth with the implementation of the Grain for Green Project.

TI  - Desert vegetation-habitat complexes mapping using Gaofen-1 WFV (wide field of view) time series images in Minqin County, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Feedbacks between vegetation and associated habitats play a crucial role in the arid and semi-arid dryland ecosystem for maintaining the stability and sustainability. Due to the high spatial and temporal heterogeneous sparse vegetation with the associated habitats in dryland system, it is a challenge to map their interactions and feedbacks for environment management and policy decision. This paper attempted to develop an algorithm using endmembers (EMs) fraction series unmixed from Gaofen-1 (GF-1) WFV (wide field of view) finer time series images for mapping desert vegetation-habitat complexes as vegetation function groups with associated habitat. The time series of EMs, including green vegetation (GV)., sand land (SL), saline land (SA), dark surface (DA) at 16 m subpixel level, derived from Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA), were combined to obtain classification knowledge describing the interactions and feedbacks between vegetation and habitat, and organized with decision tree (DT). According to the similarity of the interactions and feedbacks in the desert vegetation-habitat complexes, this paper further identified their potential of assessing the status of ecosystems (i.e., land degradation). The results show that the finer time series of EMs with satisfied spatial resolution can discern the sparse vegetation and the associated habitats with an overall accuracy of 83.91%, and help understanding degradation processes (i.e., sandification and local salinization) in the study area.

TI  - Ocean Wind Retrieval Models for RADARSAT Constellation Mission Compact Polarimetry SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose two new ocean wind retrieval models for right circular-vertical (RV) and right circular-horizontal (RH) polarizations respectively from the compact-polarimetry (CP) mode of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), which is scheduled to be launched in 2019. For compact RV-polarization (right circular transmit and vertical receive), we build the wind retrieval model (denoted CoVe-Pol model) by employing the geophysical model function (GMF) framework and a sensitivity analysis. For compact RH polarization (right circular transmit and horizontal receive), we build the wind retrieval model (denoted the CoHo-Pol model) by using a quadratic function to describe the relationship between wind speed and RH-polarized normalized radar cross-sections (NRCSs) along with radar incidence angles. The parameters of the two retrieval models are derived from a database including wind vectors measured by in situ National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys and simulated RV- and RH-polarized NRCSs and incidence angles. The RV- and RH-polarized NRCSs are generated by a RCM simulator using C-band RADARSAT-2 quad-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Our results show that the two new RCM CP models, CoVe-Pol and CoHo-POL, can provide efficient methodologies for wind retrieval.

TI  - Statistical and Hydrological Evaluations of Multi-Satellite Precipitation Products over Fujiang River Basin in Humid Southeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the paper is to evaluate the quality and hydrological utility of four popular satellite precipitation products, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product (3B42V7), near real-time product (3B42RT), and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHing technique (CMORPH) satellite-gauge merged product (CMORPH BLD) and bias-corrected product (CMORPH CRT) over Fujiang River basin, China. First, we provided a statistical assessment of the four precipitation products at multiple spatiotemporal scales. The results show that: (1) all the products except 3B42RT capture the spatial pattern of annual precipitation fairly well; (2) in general, CMORPH BLD benefits from the application of the probability density function-optimal interpolation (PDF-OI) gauge adjustment algorithm and performs best among all the products with Pearson correlation coefficients (CC) of 0.84 and 0.94, equitable threat score (ETS) of 0.56 and 0.63 in grid and basin scales, respectively, followed by 3B42V7 and CMORPH CRT; whereas 3B42RT performs worst across all the metrics; (3) according to the occurrence frequencies of rainfall, satellite estimates mainly fall into the bin of 0-1 mm/day and tend to underestimate light precipitation. In addition, the performance of all the products in warm season is much better than in cold season in both grid and basin scales. Subsequently, a physically based distributed model is established to further evaluate the hydrological utility of different precipitation products. The results reveal that: (1) the errors in precipitation products mainly propagate into hydrological simulations, resulting in the best hydrological performance in CMORPH BLD in both daily and monthly scales after recalibrating the model, while 3B42RT shows limited skills in reproducing the daily observed hydrograph; (2) after recalibrating the model with the respective satellite data, significant improvements are observed for all the products; (3) CMORPH BLD no longer shows its superiority during near-real-time monitoring of floods. There is still a great challenge for the application of current satellite-based estimates into local flood monitoring. This study could be used as guidance for choosing alternative satellite precipitation products for hydrological applications in a local community, particularly in basins in which rainfall gauges are scarce.

TI  - An Improved Boosting Learning Saliency Method for Built-Up Areas Extraction in Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up areas extraction from satellite images is an important aspect of urban planning and land use; however, this remains a challenging task when using optical satellite images. Existing methods may be limited because of the complex background. In this paper, an improved boosting learning saliency method for built-up area extraction from Sentinel-2 images is proposed. First, the optimal band combination for extracting such areas from Sentinel-2 data is determined; then, a coarse saliency map is generated, based on multiple cues and the geodesic weighted Bayesian (GWB) model, that provides training samples for a strong model; a refined saliency map is subsequently obtained using the strong model. Furthermore, cuboid cellular automata (CCA) is used to integrate multiscale saliency maps for improving the refined saliency map. Then, coarse and refined saliency maps are synthesized to create a final saliency map. Finally, the fractional-order Darwinian particle swarm optimization algorithm (FODPSO) is employed to extract the built-up areas from the final saliency result. Cities in five different types of ecosystems in China (desert, coastal, riverside, valley, and plain) are used to evaluate the proposed method. Analyses of results and comparative analyses with other methods suggest that the proposed method is robust, with good accuracy.

TI  - A Novel Tilt Correction Technique for Irradiance Sensors and Spectrometers On-Board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In unstable atmospheric conditions, using on-board irradiance sensors is one of the only robust methods to convert unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based optical remote sensing data to reflectance factors. Normally, such sensors experience significant errors due to tilting of the UAV, if not installed on a stabilizing gimbal. Unfortunately, such gimbals of sufficient accuracy are heavy, cumbersome, and cannot be installed on all UAV platforms. In this paper, we present the FGI Aerial Image Reference System (FGI AIRS) developed at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI) and a novel method for optical and mathematical tilt correction of the irradiance measurements. The FGI AIRS is a sensor unit for UAVs that provides the irradiance spectrum, Real Time Kinematic (RTK)/Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) GNSS position, and orientation for the attached cameras. The FGI AIRS processes the reference data in real time for each acquired image and can send it to an on-board or on-cloud processing unit. The novel correction method is based on three RGB photodiodes that are tilted 10 degrees in opposite directions. These photodiodes sample the irradiance readings at different sensor tilts, from which reading of a virtual horizontal irradiance sensor is calculated. The FGI AIRS was tested, and the method was shown to allow on-board measurement of irradiance at an accuracy better than +/- 0.8% at UAV tilts up to 10 degrees and +/- 1.2% at tilts up to 15 degrees. In addition, the accuracy of FGI AIRS to produce reflectance-factor-calibrated aerial images was compared against the traditional methods. In the unstable weather conditions of the experiment, both the FGI AIRS and the on-ground spectrometer were able to produce radiometrically accurate and visually pleasing orthomosaics, while the reflectance reference panels and the on-board irradiance sensor without stabilization or tilt correction both failed to do so. The authors recommend the implementation of the proposed tilt correction method in all future UAV irradiance sensors if they are not to be installed on a gimbal.

CC had reduced flow in Hyulsa River which is the main source of water for local community and due to reducing trend of average precipitation of 0.52 mm/year, and increased evapotranspiration from the agriculture fields due to rising average temperature trend of 0.07 degrees C/year. This research had attempted to analyze the impact of CC on reduction of soil moisture on cropping and range land, and find out the best community based adaptation (CBA) measures on existing agricultural system in the sustainable manner. The supply and demand analysis of water using CROPWAT model showed that the water availability on Hyulsa River would not be sufficient for irrigation. The remote sensing analysis of landsat images depicted that land coverage of negative class of normal difference vegetative index (NDVI) and low temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) class would be increased and decreased, respectively. Therefore, it proved that vegetation was decreased due to decreasing soil moisture and increased drought in range land where animals were grazed. The demand and supply analysis of Dhye Khola (main source of water for purposed resettle location) showed that the available water would be sufficient for abstracting water even for next 50 years time period. Therefore, this research concluded that it was better to relocate the whole community to Chawale-Thangchung, as the best CBA measure against the adverse impact of CC.

TI  - Overall and cause-specific mortality in the Sentinel system: A power analysis
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Mortality data within the Sentinel Death Tables remain generally uncharacterized. Assessment of mortality data within Sentinel will help inform its utility for medical product safety studies. Methods To determine if Sentinel contains sufficient all-cause and cause-specific mortality events to power postmarketing safety studies. We calculated crude rates of all-cause mortality and suicide and proportional mortality from suicide from 2004 to 2012 in seven Sentinel data partners. Results were stratified by data partner, sex, age group, and calendar year and compared with national estimates from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research. We performed sample size estimations for all-cause mortality and 10 leading causes of death. Results We observed 479 694 deaths, including 5811 suicides, during 68 million person-years of follow-up. Pooled mean death and suicide rates in the data partners were 710 and 8.6 per 100 000 person-years, respectively (vs 810 and 11.8 nationally). The mean proportional mortality from suicide among the data partners was 1.2%, compared with 1.5% nationally. National trends of decreasing overall mortality and increasing proportional mortality for suicide were reflected within Sentinel. We estimated that detecting hazard ratios of 1.25 and 3 would require 16 442 and 460 exposed patients, respectively, for overall mortality, and 1.3 million and 37 411, respectively, for suicide. Conclusions This was the first study to investigate mortality data in the Sentinel death tables. We found that all-cause mortality appeared well powered for use as a safety outcome and cause-specific mortality outcomes may be adequately powered in certain circumstances. Further investigation into the quality of the Sentinel death data is needed.

TI  - Clinical one health: A novel healthcare solution for underserved communities
T2  - ONE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited access to healthcare is a symptom of poverty worldwide. In Knights Landing, California, USA, an economically underserved, agricultural community, advocates recognized that integration of human and animal healthcare could provide a less intimidating gateway to services and facilitate assessments of individuals' health, not just in moments in time, but within the context of the complex interactions with other humans, animals, and their encompassing environment. Humans and animals share diseases resulting from common exposure to environmental pollutants and disease hosts and lack of adequate nutrition. Thus, a One Health-based clinic was established using an interdisciplinary approach to individual and community health. Interprofessional proximity allows veterinarians and physicians to help each other develop the full community-health picture, allowing sentinel cases to come to the forefront. With a collaborative One Health approach and clinicians adaptable to the changing needs of the population, the provision of community-centered healthcare has become more tenable.

TI  - Glacier Changes between 1976 and 2015 in the Source Area of the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River, Myanmar
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ayeyarwady River in Myanmar is one of the largest rivers in Southeast Asia. It is predominantly fed by monsoonal precipitation and, to a lower extent, by meltwater from glaciers located in the Himalaya mountains. Information about the glaciers in its headwater region and glacier changes is scarce. Glaciers, in general, are highly important for the hydrological system and are contributing to river flow, therefore playing a key role in water availability, especially in catchments with (semi-) arid downstream areas as is in parts of Myanmar. This study investigated 130 glaciers in the Ayeyarwady headwaters by analyzing satellite images from Landsat missions between 1976 and 2015. The results of the glacier area and volume change analyses indicate that the glaciers are experiencing unprecedented losses. Over the 39 years, the glaciers lost up to 54.3 +/- 7.64% of their area and 60.09 +/- 1.56% of their mass and volume. The highest losses occurred in the period 2002-2015, which corresponds to increasing global and local warming. This development will probably have a strong influence on the glaciers' storage function and will affect the local river runoff in the headwater region.

TI  - Estimating the Water Turbidity in the Selenga River and Adjacent Waters of Lake Baikal Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the DN/reflectance values of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI, and U-K-DMC2 SLIM-6-22 imagery and the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) in the water was determined on the basis of field turbidity measurements in 2011 and 2013. The determination coefficient R-2 for all of the relationships exceeds 0.84, indicating their high reliability. The average deviation of the calculated values from in-situ measurements varies from 2 to 7 mg/L (from 11 to 29% of the range of values). The most accurate model was obtained for the 2013 data, when the field turbidity measurements were most numerous (approximately 100). The concentration of suspended matter in the waters of Lake Baikal was mapped taking the effect of different penetration depths for solar radiation of different wavelengths into account. We also tested the applicability of imagery of Landsat and UK-DMC2 satellites for mapping the turbidity in the branches of the Selenga Delta and compared the results with the results of processing of high spatial resolution imagery of SPOT 6 NAOMI and experimental hyperspectral images of the ULM Headwall taken in the framework of the Leman-Baikal project.

TI  - Minimally Invasive Dorsal Cheilectomy of the First Metatarsal: A Cadaveric Study
T2  - FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Minimally invasive dorsal cheilectomy (MIDC) for hallus rigidus is gaining in popularity. The optimal position for the stab incision for MIDC is dorsomedial to allow an ergonomic sweeping movement of the burr, potentially putting the dorsomedial cutaneous nerve (DMCN) to the hallux at risk. We aimed to quantify the risk of using this minimally invasive technique with a cadaveric study. Methods: A total of 13 fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens amputated below the knee were obtained for this study. After the procedure, the specimens were dissected, and structures were inspected for damage. Results: The DMCN to the hallux was cut completely in 2 specimens (15%). All the extensor hallucis longus tendons were intact, although in 1 specimen, the tendon showed some fraying on the underside of the tendon. The average distance of the stab incision from the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint was 17.7 (range, 10-23) mm. The relationship of the DMCN to the stab incision was variable. The average distance of the DMCN to the incision was 3.8 (range, 0-7) mm. The danger zone for damaging the DMCN was at one-third the length of the first metatarsal proximal to the first MTP joint. Conclusion: The DMCN has been well studied by several authors and has a variable course. This nerve was damaged in 15% of our specimens following MIDC.

TI  - Moon, Inc.: The New Zealand Model of Granting Legal Personality to Natural Resources Applied to Space
T2  - NEW SPACE-THE JOURNAL OF SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a groundbreaking new model for the management of natural resources, introduced into New Zealand (NZ) law in line with the worldview of the indigenous Maori. The article goes on to analyze the model through the lens of the theory of Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom and her design principles for managing common-pool resources. Building on this analysis, the article envisages a scenario of applying model under the NZ Act-adapted using Ostrom's theory-to the moon and other space resources and to space habitats. Considering the unsettledness of the debate on the exploitation of space resources and retreat to national arrangements, the article examines whether the model under the NZ Act holds promise for a widely agreed, efficient, and equitable regime for managing space resources and whether it could also be extended to the governance of space habitats. A product of two legal traditions-the common law and that of the indigenous Maori-the NZ Te Urewera Act 2014 is the first statute in the Western legal tradition to grant legal personality to a natural resource-a natural park-and establishes it as something like a common-law corporation. In addition, the Act sets out the usage rights and establishes institutions. The article concludes that the NZ Act satisfies most of Ostrom's design principles and has potential for success. The article therefore continues with an intellectual exercise, applying the model to the moon and other space resources and to space habitats, and tries to appraise the outcome of such an application. However, the article is not necessarily a call to implement the model under the NZ Act to outer space, but rather to consider alternative governance models for space-based governance.

TI  - Assimilation of coastal and open sea biogeochemical data to improve phytoplankton simulation in the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical features, induced by local dynamics and terrestrial and atmospheric inputs in shelf seas, are challenging issues for the implementation of data assimilation in these areas. The objective of this study is to integrate satellite ocean-colour observations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical model in order to improve the spatiotemporal descriptions of chlorophyll and other biogeochemical variables in the Mediterranean shelf seas. We adopted a specifically developed three-dimensional variational data assimilation scheme for the assimilation of satellite chlorophyll data. The non-homogeneous vertical component, the non-uniform and direction-dependent horizontal component of the background error covariance are the key features of the upgraded three-dimensional variational data assimilation scheme for shelf seas. The application of the new assimilation scheme significantly improves chlorophyll estimates in shelf seas, particularly in the representation of their spatial and temporal variability. Based on these results, we provide an estimate of the annual primary production of the Mediterranean basin.

TI  - Vegetation phenology in Greenland and links to cryospheric change
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent greening of vegetation across the Arctic is associated with warming temperatures, hydrologic change and shorter snow-covered periods. Here we investigated trends for a subset of arctic vegetation on the island of Greenland. Vegetation in Greenland is unique due to its close proximity to the Greenland Ice Sheet and its proportionally large connection to the Greenlandic population through the hunting of grazing animals. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not longer snow-free periods (SFPs) were causing Greenlandic vegetation to dry out and become less productive. If vegetation was drying out, a subsequent aim of the study was to determine how widespread the drying was across Greenland. We utilized a 15-year time-series obtained by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to analyze the Greenland vegetation by deriving descriptors corresponding with the SFP, the number of cumulative growing degree-days and the time-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. While the productivity of most vegetated areas increased in response to longer growing periods, there were localized regions that exhibited signs consistent with the drying hypothesis. In these areas, vegetation productivity decreased in response to longer SFPs and more accumulated growing degree-days.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of Climate Change and Human Activities on Streamflow in a Semi-Arid Watershed with the Budyko Equation Incorporating Dynamic Vegetation Information
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding hydrological responses to climate change and land use and land cover change (LULCC) is important for water resource planning and management, especially for water-limited areas. The annual streamflow of the Wuding River Watershed (WRW), the largest sediment source of the Yellow River in China, has decreased significantly over the past 50 years at a rate of 5.2 mm/decade. Using the Budyko equation, this study investigated this decrease with the contributions from climate change and LULCC caused by human activities, which have intensified since 1999 due to China's Grain for Green Project (GFGP). The Budyko parameter that represents watershed characteristics was more reasonably configured and derived to improve the performance of the Budyko equation. Vegetation changes were included in the Budyko equation to further improve its simulations, and these changes showed a significant upward trend due to the GFGP based on satellite data. An improved decomposition method based on the Budyko equation was used to quantitatively separate the impact of climate change from that of LULCC on the streamflow in the WRW. Our results show that climate change generated a dominant effect on the streamflow and decreased it by 72.4% in the WRW. This climatic effect can be further explained with the drying trend of the Palmer Severity Drought Index, which was calculated based only on climate change information for the WRW. In the meantime, although human activities in this watershed have been very intense, especially since 1999, vegetation cover increase contributed a 27.6% decline to the streamflow, which played a secondary role in affecting hydrological processes in the WRW.

TI  - Validation and Comparison of MODIS C6.1 and C6 Aerosol Products over Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Products (APs) have provided long-term and wide-spatial-coverage aerosol optical properties across the globe, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD). However, the performance of the latest Collection 6.1 (C6.1) of MODIS APs is still unclear over urban areas that feature complex surface characteristics and aerosol models. The aim of this study was to validate and compare the performance of the MODIS C6.1 and C6 APs (MxD04, x = O for Terra, x = Y for Aqua) over Beijing, China. The results of the Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms were validated against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based observations at local sites. The retrieval uncertainties and accuracies were evaluated using the expected error (EE: +/- 0.05 + 15%) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). It was found that the MODIS C6.1 DT products performed better than the C6 DT products, with a greater percentage (by about 13%-14%) of the retrievals falling within the EE. However, the DT retrievals collected from two collections were significantly overestimated in the Beijing region, with more than 64% and 48% of the samples falling above the EE for the Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. The MODIS C6.1 DB products performed similarly to the C6 DB products, with 70%-73% of the retrievals matching within the EE and estimation uncertainties. Moreover, the DB algorithm performed much better than DT algorithm over urban areas, especially in winter where abundant missing pixels were found in DT products. To investigate the effects of factors on AOD retrievals, the variability in the assumed surface reflectance and the main optical properties applied in DT and DB algorithms are also analyzed.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Open Source Digital Elevation Models with Multi-Scale Fusion and a Slope Position-Based Linear Regression Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing need to monitor changes in the surface of the Earth requires a high-quality, accessible Digital Elevation Model (DEM) dataset, whose development has become a challenge in the field of Earth-related research. The purpose of this paper is to improve the overall accuracy of public domain DEMs by data fusion. Multi-scale decomposition is an important analytical method in data fusion. Three multi-scale decomposition methodsthe wavelet transform (WT), bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD), and nonlinear adaptive multi-scale decomposition (N-AMD)are applied to the 1-arc-second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Global digital elevation model (SRTM-1 DEM) and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D30 m digital surface model (AW3D30 DSM) in China. Of these, the WT and BEMD are popular image fusion methods. A new approach for DEM fusion is developed using N-AMD (which is originally invented to remove the cycle from sunspots). Subsequently, a window-based rule is proposed for the fusion of corresponding frequency components obtained by these methods. Quantitative results show that N-AMD is more suitable for multi-scale fusion of multi-source DEMs, taking the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) global land surface altimetry data as a reference. The fused DEMs offer significant improvements of 29.6% and 19.3% in RMSE at a mountainous site, and 27.4% and 15.5% over a low-relief region, compared to the SRTM-1 and AW3D30, respectively. Furthermore, a slope position-based linear regression method is developed to calibrate the fused DEM for different slope position classes, by investigating the distribution of the fused DEM error with topography. The results indicate that the accuracy of the DEM calibrated by this method is improved by 16% and 13.6%, compared to the fused DEM in the mountainous region and low-relief region, respectively, proving that it is a practical and simple means of further increasing the accuracy of the fused DEM.

TI  - Deformation Related to an <i>M</i> &lt; 5 Earthquake Sequence on Xiangyang Lake-Burog Co Fault in Central Xizang, China, Observed by Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface deformation associated with M < 5 earthquakes is rarely observed. Using Sentinel-1 data collected from 2014 to 2017, we measured the surface deformation from a cluster of M < 5 earthquakes occurring in August 2016 on the Xiangyang Lake-Burog Co fault in central Xizang, China, observing a maximum subsidence of similar to 1 cm in the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) direction over an similar to 8 x 10 km(2) area. We calculated the coseismic slip along the fault by applying an inversion to the geodetic dataset. The observed deformation is equivalent to the concentrated slip that could occur at depths of 4-12 km during one M-w similar to 5.2 earthquake and is comparable to the total slip that occurred during the earthquake sequence. We therefore propose that earthquakes in this sequence occurred in neighboring patches on the same fault plane and that the surface deformation we observed reflects the cumulative displacements caused by all earthquakes. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the seismic sequence may have occurred at greater depth or in distributed areas and not displaced the surface but triggered an aseismic slip event, which has been observed in a few subduction zones and fast-slipping active faults.

TI  - An Optical Algorithm to Estimate Downwelling Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient in the Red Sea
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An optical algorithm is developed for the retrieval of the downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d (490) in the Red Sea using a comprehensive hydrolight simulated data set (N = 5000). We found a robust relationship between the K-d (490) and the ratio of remote sensing reflectance R-rs(443)/R-rs(555), with an excellent determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.999) and a low root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.00033). The performance of the developed algorithm is evaluated with in situ data collected in the Red Sea by comparing obatined model output with existing empirical (NASA, Morel et al., Zhang and Fell, Tiwari and Shanmugam) and semianalytical (Lee et al.) algorithms. On the used in situ data from the Red Sea, the new algorithm shows good retrievals of K-d (490) with a low bias, and a low RMSE compared to that of the existing algorithms. For satellite application, we applied our algorithm to selected MODIS-Aqua images acquired over the Red Sea, which captured spatial features of phytoplankton blooms and physical processes (e.g., cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations) in the Red Sea. The new algorithm has the potential to improve our understanding of water transparency and photosynthetic processes that rely on the availability of solar radiation.

TI  - Prospective study of sentinel lymph node mapping for endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for endometrial cancer, using radioisotope and indocyanine green (ICG) injections. Methods Results A prospective study was conducted between April 1, 2014, and December 27, 2017, among women with endometrial cancer, excluding those with suspected peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastasis, at a University hospital in Kagoshima, Japan. Patients with low-risk endometrial cancer underwent pelvic SLN mapping using uterine cervix radioisotope injections; intermediate/high-risk patients underwent pelvic SLN with/without intraoperative para-aortic SLN mapping with ICG subserosal injections. Primary endpoints were estimated detection rates, sensitivity, and negative predict values (NPV) of SLN mapping. Of 113 patients evaluated, comprehensive pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed after SLN detection in all patients; additional para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed in 38 (34%) patients. The detection rates for pelvic SLN (>= 1), bilateral pelvic SLN, and para-aortic SLN (>= 1) were 96%, 80%, and 55%, respectively. Pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastasis were found in (10%) (12/113) and 18% (6/33) patients, respectively. Isolated para-aortic lymph node metastasis was not observed. In pelvic SLN analysis, sensitivity was 91% and NPV was 99%. In para-aortic SLN analysis, sensitivity and NPV were 100%. Conclusion SLN biopsy may be useful to avoid comprehensive pelvic lymphadenectomy in low-risk patients. In high-risk patients, SLN mapping revealed high detection rates, sensitivity, and NPV, including those for para-aortic SLN.

TI  - Risk factors for lymphatic complications following lymphadenectomy in patients with cervical cancer
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of lymphatic complications following pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLA) in patients with cervical cancer.Methods: A retrospective study of 169 cervical cancer patients was conducted. Lower extremity lymphedema (LEL) was diagnosed using the International Society of Lymphology guidelines, and pelvic lymphocele (PL) was evaluated using trans-vaginal ultrasonography and computed tomography.Results: The median patient age was 46 years (range: 22-74) and median body mass index was 21.7 kg/m(2) (range: 15.7-37.1). The median number of lymph nodes (LNs) removed was 27 (range: 22-74); 94 (55.6%) patients underwent circumflex iliac node (CIN) dissection; 39 (23.1%) patients received adjuvant chemotherapy; and 81 (47.9%) patients received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. There were 28 (16.6%) and 32 (18.9%) occurrences of LEL and PL, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of LNs removed (odds ratio [OR]: 3.37; 95% CI: 1.43-8.54; P = 0.0053) and CIN removal (OR: 3.92; 95% CI: 1.55-11.4; P = 0.0033) were independent risk factors for LEL; however, no risk factors were significantly associated with PL.Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that CIN removal and the number of LNs removed were significant risk factors for LEL in patients with cervical cancer. However, we did not identify any significant risk factors for PL in this study. We instead speculate that LN dissection itself causes PL. We suggest that establishment of comprehensive PLA without CIN dissection, or use of the sentinel lymph node concept, will prevent the occurrence of lymphatic complications in cervical cancer patients.

TI  - Evaluation and Hydrological Validation of GPM Precipitation Products over the Nanliu River Basin, Beibu Gulf
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Adequate and high-quality precipitation estimates, from spaceborne precipitation radars, are necessary for a variety of applications in hydrology. In this study, we investigated the performance of two Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) products, against gauge observations over a small river basin, the Beibu Gulfthe Nanliu River basin, and evaluated their capability of streamflow simulation, based on a conceptual watershed model from April 2014 to December 2016. The results showed that both IMERG_Cal and IMERG_Uncal could roughly capture the spatial patterns of precipitation with slight over/underestimation (Relative Bias (RB) values of 6.5% and -5.5%, respectively) at a basin scale. At grid-cell scales, two IMERG products got an RB of -23.3% to 18.9%, Correlation Coefficient (CC) of 0.521 to 0.744, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 11.3 to 17.5 mm. There were some considerable errors in heavy precipitation events, and the IMERG significantly overestimated the amounts of these extreme events. The two IMERG products showed a higher accuracy and lower error rate, when detecting the light precipitation. IMERG-driven simulation had a better quality when the model was calibrated with satellite data rather than with rain gauge data. This analysis implied that IMERG products have potential in hydrological applications, in this region, and need further improvement in algorithms.

TI  - Essentially Grounded Non-Naturalism and Normative Supervenience
T2  - TOPOI-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-naturalism-roughly the view that normative properties and facts are sui generis and incompatible with a purely scientific worldview-faces a difficult challenge with regard to explaining why it is that the normative features of things supervene on their natural features. More specifically: non-naturalists have trouble explaining the necessitation relations, whatever they are, that hold between the natural and the normative. My focus is on Stephanie Leary's recent response to the challenge, which offers an attempted non-naturalism-friendly explanation for the supervenience of the normative on the natural by appealing to hybrid properties, the essences of which link them to both natural and sui generis normative properties in suitable ways. I argue that despite its ingenuity, Leary's solution fails. This is so, I claim, because there are no hybrid properties of the sort that her suggestion appeals to. If non-naturalists are to deal with the supervenience challenge, they will have to find another way of doing so.

TI  - Five-vortex spot patterns generated by diffraction of azimuthally X-shaped beam from a fork-shaped grating
T2  - OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - By theoretical and experimental methods it is demonstrated how a beam whose amplitude profile is X-modulated in azimuthal direction, with central dark non-vortex core, can be transformed into an array of five-vortex spot patterns. This beam undergoes Fraunhofer diffraction by a fork-shaped grating with integer topological charge (TC) p. The results show an interesting phenomenon: while the incident beam is without topological charge, in the output array of spots a five-vortex modulation on the higher-diffraction-order patterns is evident. It consists of a central vortex (whose value and sign of its TC depend on the diffraction order m) and four "satellite'' vortices situated in the apices of a rotated square (whose signs depend on the diffraction order of the spot m, in which they are nested). An exception is made in the case when the product of the diffraction order and the fork-shaped grating TC is equal to two; Then, the central vortex is absent, but, the four ''satellite'' vortices are present. The interference patterns of the diffracted wave field and a slightly inclined plane wave are obtained experimentally and numerically, confirming the presence of the vortices predicted by the theory and registering the value and sign of their TCs.

TI  - Detection of convective systems through surface wind gust estimation based on Sentinel-1 images: A new approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convective system (CS) tracking and identification are mainly based on the analyses of brightness temperature and precipitation. Few studies reported about the detection of CSs through surface wind gust estimation due to CS downdraft reaching sea surface. Based on high-resolution Sentinel-1 images, this study proposes the detection of CS signatures through an enhancement of surface wind magnitude in the vicinity of CSs. The CMOD5.N and Sapp's model (CMOD-like function) are used for the retrieval of surface wind speed from VV-pol and HH-pol images, respectively. Based on numerous cases, the study presents the retrieved winds from two representative Sentinel-1 images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico, on which several types of CS effect on sea surface (i.e., round form, convection line) are detected. Wind gust produced by the downdraft associated to these CSs exceeds 20-25 m/s. In order to verify whether the detected wind gust is associated to CSs, moderate/heavy precipitation extracted from the Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) images is used as an additional assessment.

It will appear that the resulting teleological account of the world history does not interfere with the traditional explanations provided by the empirical sciences and that it is a consequence of the teleology inbuilt in the correlation between transcendental subjectivity and the world. The conclusion is reached by analyzing some of Husserl's text concerning the transcendental role of embodiment and normality.

TI  - Investigation of the meteorological effects of urbanization in recent decades: A case study of major cities in Pearl River Delta
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the evolution of the climatological effects of urbanization in the major cities of the Pearl River Delta region of China during the summer season. Land use data representing the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are obtained by classifying the land use from collected Landsat images. This classification standard follows the guidelines of land use classification from the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT). Before the model simulation, the WUDAPT land use categorization was remapped according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) land use classification. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was then applied under the same initial and boundary conditions with respect to different land use data. Spatial comparison and statistical analysis reveal a general increase in temperature (approximately 1 degrees C) and heat index (2 degrees C at night) and a deceleration of wind speed over time (around 0.5 ms(-1)) when compared with the 1990s. These impacts are due to urbanization. Moreover, simulation shows that the sensible heat flux is increased, whereas the latent heat flux is decreased because there was less vegetation and more impervious surfaces. These findings can let planners and governors have a quantitative understanding about the impact of urbanization on local climatic conditions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal fires are one of the most common and serious geohazards in most coal producing countries in the world. Monitoring their spatio-temporal changes plays an important role in controlling and preventing the effects of coal fires, and their environmental impact. In this study, the spatio-temporal changes of underground coal fires in Khanh Hoa coal field (North-East of Viet Nam) were analyzed using Landsat time-series data during the 2008-2016 period. Based on land surface temperatures retrieved from Landsat thermal data, underground coal fires related to thermal anomalies were identified using the MEDIAN+1.5xIQR (IQR: Interquartile range) threshold technique. The locations of underground coal fires were validated using a coal fire map produced by the field survey data and cross-validated using the daytime ASTER thermal infrared imagery. Based on the fires extracted from seven Landsat thermal imageries, the spatiotemporal changes of underground coal fire areas were analyzed. The results showed that the thermalanomalous zones have been correlated with known coal fires. Cross-validation of coal fires using ASTER TIR data showed a high consistency of 79.3%. The largest coal fire area of 184.6 hectares was detected in 2010, followed by 2014 (181.1 hectares) and 2016 (178.5 hectares). The smaller coal fire areas were extracted with areas of 133.6 and 152.5 hectares in 2011 and 2009 respectively. Underground coal fires were mainly detected in the northern and southern part, and tend to spread to north-west of the coal field.

TI  - 'MY FATHER'S BLACK LASSO'. THE ROAD FROM ANCESTORS TO DESCENDANTS IN THE ALTAI CULTURE
T2  - SIBERIAN HISTORICAL RESEARCH-SIBIRSKIE ISTORICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article undertakes to explore the Altai people's conceptions of the time-space continuum through their views on the road / path as a focal point of communication channels between the human world and the world of non-human beings. The article draws on the author's field materials collected in the Republic of Altai from 1986 to 2018. In addition, various other sources are used, including materials on the linguistics and folklore of the Altaians. Three aspects of the Altai people's worldview are reflected on: 1) the road as a concept features communications within both space and time; the road connects the worlds of ancestors and descendants and separates them according to particular periods of time during which the culture prescribes that the living and the dead, human beings and other beings should be active; 2) not only real, both old and new roads, but also elements can serve as a road for ancestors, for example, an unusually long-lasting whirlwind connecting the sky and the earth can be seen as ancestors' road; and 3) even today the Altai people continue to practice sacral rites and rituals dedicated to correcting one's path, treating it as life in general and as a concrete life path; neglecting the cultural norms, which prescribe that man in the lunar-solar world should be active when the sun is out and in the period from the new moon to the full moon, entails sanctions understood as punishment by the ancestors executed as either a one-off act through an obstacle in one's path or as a continuous effect when one becomes deprived of the right fate - the one that has no bad luck but brings happiness and self-realisation.

TI  - Influences of the Kuroshio on Interisland Remote Connectivity of Corals Across the Nansei Archipelago in the East China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the preservation and protection of coral habitats along the Nansei Archipelago in the East China Sea, a submesoscale eddy-resolving synoptic ocean model was developed based on the Regional Oceanic Modeling System coupled with a 3-D Lagrangian particle tracking model. Millions of neutrally buoyant particles representing coral spawn and larvae were released from 19 major islands and one lagoon every spring from 2012 to 2015. The model results were compared to satellite data, in situ observation, and surface drifters to confirm reasonable agreement. The connectivity matrix across the archipelago was quantified using Lagrangian probability density functions of the modeled particle displacement. Most particles remained near the release areas, while some traveled long distances by the northeastward drifting Kuroshio, leading to notable interisland coral transport across the archipelago that promotes interisland connectivity. A possible mechanism was examined by analyzing the transition from coastal to pelagic transport of the particles released from the Yaeyama Islands, the southernmost area of the archipelago. The Kuroshio trapped the particles released from the northern coast of the islands with considerable temporal variability in the entrainment rate. By contrast, particles released from the southern coast are markedly affected by the eastward current around the release sites, which significantly reduces their entrainment in the Kuroshio and, thus, long-distance transport. Some entrained particles were expelled abruptly from the Kuroshio, trapped by the southwestward drifting Kuroshio Counter Current developed between the Kuroshio and the archipelago, and subsequently transported eastward to the islands.Plain Language Summary For the preservation and protection of coral habitats along the Nansei Archipelago in the East China Sea, we conducted 3-D tracking of particles mimicking coral spawn and larvae released from shallow seas around the islands across the Nansei Archipelago, based on a numerical 3-D ocean circulation model, Regional Oceanic Modeling System. Although the released corals were mostly transported short distances and settled down near the release sites, a moderate amount was entrained in the northeastward drifting Kuroshio Current developed in similar to 150km west of the islands. The entrained particles could be conveyed northeastward for similar to 1,000km, leading to interisland population connections. However, the entrainment rate largely depended on locations of the releases and variability in local oceanic currents upon the releases. Furthermore, some entrained particles were expelled abruptly from the Kuroshio, trapped by the southwestward drifting Kuroshio Counter Current developed between the Kuroshio and the archipelago, and subsequently transported eastward to the islands. These findings can be directly utilized in policy-making for the effective design management of marine protected areas.

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover Change and Its Impact on Changes in Soil Erosion Risk in Nepal
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change is a critical driver for enhancing the soil erosion risk in Nepal. Loss of the topsoil has a direct and indirect effect on human life and livelihoods. The present study provides an assessment of the decadal land use and land cover (LULC) change and consequent changes in the distribution of soil erosion risk for the years, 1990, 2000, and 2010, for the entire country of Nepal. The study attempted to understand how different land cover types change over the three decades and how it has changed the distribution of soil erosion risks in Nepal that would help in the development of soil conservation priority. The land cover maps were produced using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) using Landsat images. Soil erosion patterns were assessed using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) with the land cover as the input. The study shows that the forest cover is the most dominant land cover in Nepal that comprises about 6,200,000 ha forest cover. The estimated annual erosion was 129.30 million tons in 1990 and 110.53 million tons in 2010. The assessment of soil erosion dynamics was presented at the national, provincial, and district level. District wise analysis revealed that Gulmi, Parbat, Syangja, and the Tanahu district require priority for soil conservation.

TI  - Indocyanine green can stand alone in detecting sentinel lymph nodes in cervical cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The effectiveness of indocyanine green (ICG) dye for detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in cervical cancer compared with other tracers is unknown. This study aimed to assess the validity of ICG dye in detecting SLNs in cervical cancer preoperatively. Methods We performed a literature search for identifying eligible articles from PubMed database using the search terms "cervical cancer", "sentinel lymph node", "indocyanine green", "blue dyes", "human serum albumin", and "technetium-99 radiocolloid". We performed a meta-analysis. Comparison of the overall, bilateral, and unilateral detection rates of the different tracers was the primary goal. Comparison of the false-negative rate among the tracers was the secondary goal. Results Only eight retrospective studies including 661 patients were included. ICG versus combinations of three other tracers showed significantly higher bilateral and unilateral detection rates, but no difference in the overall rate of detecting SLNs. ICG had a higher bilateral detection rate than blue dye and technetium-99. Absorbing human serum albumin into ICG as a lymphatic tracer did not show a difference in detection rate compared with ICG alone. Conclusions ICG is superior and better than other tracers, and absorbing human serum albumin as a lymphatic tracer is not required in patients with cervical cancer.

TI  - Maspin mRNA expression in sentinel lymph nodes predicts non-SLN metastasis in breast cancer patients with SLN metastasis
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Maspin is known to be a tumour suppressor protein, but its prognostic significance in breast cancer patients is controversial. There is no report focusing on maspin expression in metastatic carcinoma of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs); we thus investigated maspin mRNA expression in SLNs using the remaining specimens after the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay. Methods and results Ninety-three breast cancer patients with SLNs metastasis detected by the OSNA assay were enrolled. All patients experienced additional axillary lymph nodes (LNs) dissection and all dissected LNs were examined histopathologically. Maspin mRNA expression in SLNs was detected in 49.5% (46 of 93) and was correlated significantly with the presence of non-SLN metastasis (P < 0.0001) and >= 4 LN metastases (P = 0.029). In a multivariate logistic analysis, maspin mRNA expression in SLNs (P = 0.0015) had the most significant effect on predicting non-SLN metastasis, followed by pathological tumour size (P = 0.0039) and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.009). The status of maspin mRNA expression in SLNs was correlated significantly with that of maspin protein expression in the primary carcinoma (P < 0.0001). Conclusions This is the first study, to our knowledge, demonstrating that maspin mRNA expression in SLNs is an independent predictor of non-SLN metastasis and the presence of >= 4 LN metastases in breast cancer patients with SLN metastasis. The investigation of maspin mRNA expression in SLNs using the remaining specimens after the OSNA assay may be useful for predicting the further progression of metastatic carcinoma in breast cancer patients with SLNs metastasis.

TI  - Axillary metastasis in clinically node-negative breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EGYPTIAN NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of work: This study investigates the factors related to metastasis detection in a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) in patients without clinical axillary involvement.Patients and methods: The medical records of patients who underwent an SLN biopsy after diagnosis with early-stage breast cancer were evaluated retrospectively. The study sample included 64 patients divided into two groups according to the histopathological examination of the SLN biopsy: Group I (positive for axillary metastasis) and Group II (negative for axillary metastasis).Results: The frequency of lymphovascular invasion was significantly higher in Group I (57%) than in Group II (13%) (p = 0.003). The progesterone receptor status (p = 0.036), tumor T-stage(p = 0,047), and Ki-67 index differed significantly (p = 0.045) between the two groups. While in univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion, T-stage and KI-67 index were significant, in multivariate analysis only lymphovascular invasion was found to be significant. No significant differences were found in terms of estrogen receptor and HER2 considering tumor invasion type, histologic grade, vascular invasion, neural invasion, multifocality or bilaterality, hormone receptor status, menopause status, total number of lymph nodes, presence of non-sentinel lymph nodes and the number of SLNs in the groups (p > 0.05).Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that lymphovascular invasion is associated with axillary metastasis, based on an SLN biopsy.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing Data in Decision Support Systems for Transportation Asset Management
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the research summarized in this manuscript is two-fold: to develop and make available a set of novel analysis tools, fully integrated in ArcGIS, that leverages the rich information provided by satellite-based remote sensing data to detect and characterize geohazards of interest to the transportation community; and to provide a modern web-based decision support system (DSS) in which these novel analysis products can be seamlessly integrated with existing datasets. Specifically, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and its derivatives are employed in this work. Each tool is designed to target a specific asset of interest to the transportation community: sinkhole detection, bridge differential settlement detection, slope stability assessment, and pavement distress evaluation. Furthermore, to allow interested parties to test the introduction of remote sensing data into their decision-making process without requiring the full integration with existing workflows, a modern web-based DSS is introduced. Thanks to the large coverage and the high update frequencies offered by satellite-based remote sensing data, datasets augmented with these new products can offer a near real-time overview of the network status and lead to better support in decisions about resources allocation, existing infrastructure monitoring, new infrastructure planning, and post-construction assessment.

TI  - Ground Deformation and Source Geometry of the 30 October 2016 M<sub>w</sub> 6.5 Norcia Earthquake (Central Italy) Investigated Through Seismological Data, DInSAR Measurements, and Numerical Modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the M-w 6.5 Norcia (Central Italy) earthquake by exploiting seismological data, DInSAR measurements, and a numerical modelling approach. In particular, we first retrieve the vertical component (uplift and subsidence) of the displacements affecting the hangingwall and the footwall blocks of the seismogenic faults identified, at depth, through the hypocenters distribution analysis. To do this, we combine the DInSAR measurements obtained from coseismic SAR data pairs collected by the ALOS-2 sensor from ascending and descending orbits. The achieved vertical deformation map displays three main deformation patterns: (i) a major subsidence that reaches the maximum value of about 98 cm near the epicentral zones nearby the town of Norcia; (ii) two smaller uplift lobes that affect both the hangingwall (reaching maximum values of about 14 cm) and the footwall blocks (reaching maximum values of about 10 cm). Starting from this evidence, we compute the rock volumes affected by uplift and subsidence phenomena, highlighting that those involved by the retrieved subsidence are characterized by significantly higher deformation values than those affected by uplift (about 14 times). In order to provide a possible interpretation of this volumetric asymmetry, we extend our analysis by applying a 2D numerical modelling approach based on the finite element method, implemented in a structural-mechanic framework, and exploiting the available geological and seismological data, and the ground deformation measurements retrieved from the multi-orbit ALOS-2 DInSAR analysis. In this case, we consider two different scenarios: the first one based on a single SW-dipping fault, the latter on a main SW-dipping fault and an antithetic zone. In this context, the model characterized by the occurrence of an antithetic zone presents the retrieved best fit coseismic surface deformation pattern. This result allows us to interpret the subsidence and uplift phenomena caused by the M-w 6.5 Norcia earthquake as the result of the gravitational sliding of the hangingwall along the main fault plane and the frictional force acting in the opposite direction, consistently with the double couple fault plane mechanism.

TI  - Born to be Wise: a population registry data linkage protocol to assess the impact of modifiable early-life environmental exposures on the health and development of children
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Deficiencies in childhood development is a major global issue and inequalities are large. The influence of environmental exposures on childhood development is currently insufficiently explored. This project will analyse the impact of various modifiable early life environmental exposures on different dimensions of childhood development.Methods Born to be Wise will study a Canadian cohort of approximately 34 000 children who have completed an early development test at the age of 5. Land use regression models of air pollution and spatially defined noise models will be linked to geocoded data on early development to analyse any harmful effects of these exposures. The potentially beneficial effect on early development of early life exposure to natural environments, as measured by fine-grained remote sensing data and various land use indexes, will also be explored. The project will use data linkages and analyse overall and age-specific impact, including variability depending on cumulative exposure by assigning time-weighted exposure estimates and by studying subsamples who have changed residence and exposure. Potentially moderating effects of natural environments on air pollution or noise exposures will be studied by mediation analyses. A matched case-control design will be applied to study moderating effects of natural environments on the association between low socioeconomic status and early development. The main statistical approach will be mixed effects models, applying a specific software to deal with multilevel random effects of nested data. Extensive confounding control will be achieved by including data on a range of detailed health and sociodemographic variables.Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been ethically approved by the Behavioural Research Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia. The findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scholarly conferences. Through stakeholder engagement, the results will also reach policy and a broader audience.

TI  - MULTITEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF PLANT COVERAGE OF PIQUIA SEALING PROJECT IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF MARABA-PA
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to quantify, on a multitemporal scale, the vegetation cover in hectares (ha), at the Piquia Settlement Project, located in the municipality of Maraba, Para, for the periods of 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2015. It was verified the variation of the amount of vegetation present in the area by means of the use of soil classes, through supervised classification with the software SPRING 5.4.3, and sought to relate the dynamics of vegetation changes during the period studied with the bibliographic reference and official data. The relevance of the study is related to the fact that the settlements are an important point of current national agrarian policy and several studies raise serious questions regarding the environmental preservation, mainly of the maintenance of the vegetation cover. In this way, remote sensing was chosen as an analysis tool because it could provide images of different periods. The images Thematic Mapper (TM), coupled to the Landsat 5 satellite and the Operational Land Imager (OLI), coupled with the Landsat 8 satellite, were used. The results showed that for 2003 the vegetation cover in the settlement was 734,94 ha, representing 22,08% of the total area of the settlement, in 2006 there was a reduction to 655,38 ha of the vegetation cover, equivalent to 19,69% of the area, for 2009, the vegetation cover was 727,82 ha, equivalent to 21,87% of the area of the settlement, and finally, to 2015, once again the vegetation cover increased of the area, totaling 1.016,10 ha, which is equivalent to 30% of the settlement area. The changes during the period of the study analysis were correlated with changes in land use and occupation by settlers, both in the village and in the lots, which are significantly led to change the model created in the design of the organs concerning environmental issues in the settlements in the Amazon region.

TI  - A comparative assessment of land suitability evaluation methods for agricultural land use planning at village level
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Defining the relationship between soil characteristics and crop requirements must be the first step in planning future agriculture land use. The aim of the present study is to identify the constraints and potentials of major soils in a block of Telangana, India and evaluate them for crop suitability and propose agricultural land use plans (ALUP) at village level. Using IRS P6 LISS IV, Cartosat-I and DEM data, we identified and mapped six soil series through detailed soil survey. Soils varied in depth (< 25 to > 150 cm), texture, water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, pH, organic carbon and other inherent properties. We compared parametric, Stone index and multi-criteria land suitability evaluation (MC-LSE) methods for evaluating land suitability for pigeon pea, maize, cotton, groundnut and rice. The land suitability index (LSI) by the three methods varied for three soil series, but for one series, the methods produced similar results for cotton, maize and pigeon pea. The correlation of LSI with crop yield showed that MC-LSE performed better than other two methods. After analysing the LSE results, existing cropping pattern, potential and adaptability of alternate options through participatory interaction with farmers, ALUP for 19 villages of the study area were developed. Moreover, we also discuss the challenges and opportunities in proposing and implementing ALUP in India. The results of the present study will be helpful for farm managers for making the best use of soils based on their suitability. However, to demonstrate the applicability, practicability, and most importantly, the sustainability of proposed ALUP, coordinated implementation strategies are necessary.

TI  - Fluorescence-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Detection Rate and Diagnostic Accuracy
T2  - ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is currently the standard surgical procedure for lymph node staging in patients with early stage breast cancer. It is performed using different techniques, such as the injection of vital dyes and I or radioisotopes and, more recently, guided by fluorescence using Indocyanine green. The aim of this study is to assess the detection rate of sentinel lymph node using Indocyanine green in breast cancer patients according to factors related to the patient and the tumor.Material and Methods: Retrospective study of a random sample of patients with breast cancer, treated and followed at Centro Hospitalar Sao Joao, in Porto, between 2012 and 2016.Results: Indocyanine green detection rate was over 90% and its diagnostic accuracy was similar to other methods described in the presence of metastatic involvement of lymph nodes.Discussion: There was no statistically significant difference between the three methods in the detection rates in subgroups of older women, with normal weight and in those who underwent previous surgery in breast or axilla or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.Conclusion: Indocyanine green is a potential alternative method to other sentinel lymph node screening techniques, appearing as a future option for breast cancer centers with no nuclear medicine department. However, it is essential to carry out further research in order to define the ideal patients' profile that maximizes the method's effectiveness.

TI  - Utility of Preoperative Staging of Ipsilateral Axilla with Ultrasound and Guided Needle Aspiration in Early-Stage Breast CancerCurrent Indian Scenario
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical assessment of the axilla, especially in early-stage breast cancer, can have a high degree of inaccuracy with over-staging curtailing the use of sentinel node biopsy. Imaging of axilla, using ultrasound +/- guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can help in better staging. In this study, we aim to compare physical examination and ultrasound of axilla and FNAC and assess their accuracy in preoperative staging of axilla. This was a prospective observational study. Patients with biopsy-proven invasive early-stage breast carcinoma, consenting to be part of the study, underwent ultrasound (US) of ipsilateral axilla with guided FNAC, when indicated and underwent surgery which included complete axillary dissection. Postoperative histopathology was compared to preoperative US and guided cytology (if done), to correlate the latter's efficacy in detecting positive axillary nodes. Clinically, 96% of patients had palpable axillary nodes, though of doubtful significance. On US axilla, 62% had suspicious nodes (guided FNAC was performed). Sensitivity and specificity of US axilla was 90.9% and 60.7%, with sensitivity reaching 100% in patients with >1 node positive, while that of US + FNAC was 85.7 and 100% respectively. Although all US nodal parameters studied showed positive correlation with final nodal pathology (p<0.005), loss of fatty hilum was the best predictor of metastatic nodal disease. Preoperative ultrasound of ipsilateral axilla +/- FNAC helps in better preoperative staging of axilla. Its routine use can help reduce the false positivity of clinical examination and help in avoiding unnecessary axillary dissection and also in better selection of patients for sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - Desertification and ecosystem services supply: The case of the Arid Chaco of South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - New integrated perspectives are increasingly needed to bridge the gap between biophysical and ecosystem services' based assessments of desertification. For a vast area of the dry Chaco region we sought to: (1) assess the spatial extent of four syndromes of vegetation change, associated with human or climatic drivers and (2) estimate and compare the supply of ecosystem services among these syndromes. We used a remote sensing approach based on the growing season -October to March- normalized difference vegetation index from MODIS, and climatological datasets from 2003 to 2013 to estimate: i) precipitation use efficiency, ii) precipitation marginal response, iii) the temporal trends of the residuals from the normalized difference vegetation index - annual precipitation linear relationship, and iv) the ecosystem services provision index. We diagnosed vegetation syndromes based on the difference between actual and reference sites' precipitation use efficiency and precipitation marginal response. Negative residuals trends were interpreted as vegetation changes driven by inadequate human management. The ecosystem services provision index assumes that ecosystem services supply varies positively with primary production and a negatively with its seasonal variability.Our results showed that, 9.1% of the observed area belonged to the vegetation improvement syndrome - positive Delta precipitation use efficiency and Delta precipitation marginal response - while 3.4% were classified as vegetation cover reduction -negative Delta precipitation use efficiency and Delta precipitation marginal response. In turn, 10.5% and 2% of the study area fell within the increment in herbaceous vegetation -negative Delta precipitation use efficiency and positive Delta precipitation marginal response - and woody encroachment syndromes - positive precipitation use efficiency and negative precipitation marginal response - respectively. Human management did not have a uniform impact as all 4 syndromes displayed positive and negative residuals trends. Contrary to our expectations, there was no apparent association between vegetation syndromes and the supply of ecosystem services as estimated by the ecosystem services provision index. This study serves as a prototype to remotely assess ecosystem properties indicative of different vegetation syndromes and the associated supply of ecosystem services in dryland regions.

TI  - Correlation of Bioimpedance Spectroscopy with Risk Factors for the Development of Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We reviewed serial bioimpedance measurements in order to quantify the relationship between changes in these scores and a patient's risk for developing breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Methods and Results: From April 2010 through November 2016, 505 patients were prospectively evaluated using bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS/L-Dex). Patients received preoperative and postoperative L-Dex measurements and were categorized based upon risk for BCRL with respect to axillary staging procedure, radiation use, taxane use, and body mass index (BMI). L-Dex change was associated with the type and number of BCRL risk factors. Both axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and regional nodal irradiation (RNI) were associated with a greater change in L-Dex (p < 0.001), although elevated BMI was not associated. The median, maximal change in L-Dex for patients treated with ALND, RNI, and taxanes was 16.7 versus 5.2 for ALND alone and 3.7 for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone (p = 0.016). In a model using all four risk factors to predict the maximal change in L-Dex, ALND and RNI remained significantly associated with maximum change (p < 0.05). The time required to reach maximal change in L-Dex was shorter in patients treated with ALND or RNI (the time for 25% of patients achieving an L-Dex >= 7 was 4.3 months for ALND, RNI, and taxanes patients versus 30.8 months for SLNB-alone patients). Conclusions: Risk factors for development of BCRL were associated with both the magnitude and timing of change in L-Dex scores. These findings demonstrate the utility of serial L-Dex measurements in providing an objective assessment of a patient's lymphedema status and the value of L-Dex serial measurements to assist in monitoring patients for the development of BCRL. This supports the clinical utilization of serial L-Dex scores to follow patients at risk for BCRL.

TI  - Female masculinization and reproductive success in <i>Cnesterodon decemmaculatus</i> (Jenyns, 1842) (Cyprinodontiforme: Poeciliidae) under anthropogenic impact
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic organisms are exposed to a myriad of chemical compounds, with particular concerns focused on endocrine disruptors. Growing scientific evidence indicates that these compounds interfere with normal endocrine function and could affect the reproductive system of humans and wildlife. We analyzed the proportion of masculinized females, defined by elongation and fusion of the anal fin rays, and the extent of masculinization, masculinization index, defined by anal fin length divided by the standard length, of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus resident to areas of agricultural and urban-industrial activities in the Arroyo Colorado basin. Additionally, a bioassay was carried out to assess the potential effects of masculinization on reproductive success, measured as the number of viable progenies, using pregnant females from the site downstream of the urban-industrial zone. Masculinized females were observed in all sampling sites, particularly downstream of the urban-industrial area, where over 80% of females presented abnormal sexual characteristics and the highest masculinization index was registered. In the laboratory, masculinized adult females showed male mating behavior, and survival of their progeny was lower than those of normal females. To our knowledge, this is the first report of endocrine disruption in field-collected C. decemmaculatus, and the first evaluation of the reproductive success of masculinized females. Finally, our results support C. decemmaculatus as an excellent sentinel species due to its wide distribution, easy culture in laboratory conditions, and its potential capability to respond to sources of pollution, particularly endocrine disruptors.

TI  - Investigation on Perceptron Learning for Water Region Estimation Using Large-Scale Multispectral Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification and investigation of temporal changes are considered to be common applications of remote sensing. Water/non-water region estimation is one of the most fundamental classification tasks, analyzing the occurrence of water on the Earth's surface. However, common remote sensing practices such as thresholding, spectral analysis, and statistical approaches are not sufficient to produce a globally adaptable water classification. The aim of this study is to develop a formula with automatically derived tuning parameters using perceptron neural networks for water/non-water region estimation, which we call the Perceptron-DerivedWater Formula (PDWF), using Landsat-8 images. Water/non-water region estimates derived from PDWF were compared with three different approaches-Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Automatic Water Extraction Index (AWEI), and Deep Convolutional Neural Network-using various case studies. Our proposed method outperforms all three approaches, showing a significant improvement in water/non-water region estimation. PDWF performance is consistently better even in cases of challenging conditions such as low reflectance due to hill shadows, building-shadows, and dark soils. Moreover, our study implemented a sunglint correction to adapt water/non-water region estimation over sunglint-affected pixels.

TI  - Quaternion-Based Sparse Model for Pan-Sharpening of IRS Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers the pan-sharpening problem of the IRS satellite images from the perspective of vector sparse representation model using quaternion matrix analysis. It selects the sparse basis in quaternion space, which uniformly transforms the color channels into an orthogonal color space. Moreover, the proposed quaternion model for pan-sharpening is more efficient than the conventional sparse model as the hyper-complex representation of color channels conserves the interrelationship among the chromatic channels. This paper also proposes a quaternion forward-backward pursuit algorithm that preserves the inherent chromatic structures in terms of spatial and spectral details during the vector reconstruction. The experimental result validates the efficacy of the proposed quaternion model and shows its potential as a powerful pan-sharpening tool for IRS data even for cloudy multispectral data.

TI  - Quasi-Decadal Variations of Lower Stratosphere Meteorological Parameters and Total Ozone Global Fields Based on Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of an analysis of the phase relationships between the variations of solar activity (SA) with periods ranging from 8 to 13 years and the quasi-decadal variations (QDVs) of zonally and globally average values of total ozone (TO), and some parameters of the lower stratosphere at 50 and 100GPa based on the NCEP-NCAR and satellite data. Analysis of the temporal and spatial variability of meteorological parameters and TO has been performed by Fourier, correlation and composite analysis for the period from 1979 to 2015 in the 90 degrees S- 90 degrees N latitudinal belt. The TO spectra have basic oscillations with periods of 116-140 months at all latitudes. The oscillations with periods of 87-96 months are also observed at the high southern latitudes. Significant oscillations of temperature and geopotential height with periods ranging from 95 to 102 and from 127 to 148 months are observed in the 90 degrees S- 55 degrees N latitudinal belt. The oscillations of the meridional and zonal wind velocity have periods within intervals of 85-100 and 120-150months; their significance varies with altitude. The maxima of the TO QDVs advance the SA maxima by 20 months at the middle and high north latitudes and lag behind by 21 months at the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. The lag between the SA and TO variations reverses its sign at 35 degrees-40 degrees S. On average, the phase of the QDVs of temperature and geopotential height within the 90 degrees S-55 degrees N latitudinal belt lags behind the SA variations approximately by one year and half a year, respectively. The phase relationships between the meridional and zonal wind variations and the 11-year SA cycle vary considerably with time and latitude. The quasi-decadal variations of the globally average TO values coincide with the SA variations.

TI  - LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HIV BIOLOGICAL- BEHAVIORAL SURVEYS OF KEY POPULATIONS IN THE CARIBBEAN
T2  - AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Caribbean region, HIV prevalence is high among key population (KP) groups, such as sex workers and men who have sex with men. However, there is a lack of high-quality, population-level data estimating HIV prevalence and population sizes of KPs. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has funded and completed five bio-behavioral surveillance (BBS) surveys using respondent-driven sampling methodology to target KP in the English-speaking Caribbean region. We describe the experience of implementing bio-behavioral surveys in the Caribbean region and document the context, processes, successes, and challenges, and make recommendations for future survey implementation. Successes include the provision of estimates of nationally representative HIV data and KP size estimates to improve HIV programming and provision of tools for routinization of BBS. Challenges include small KP sizes, the legal context, and the cost and speed of implementation. Future bio-behavioral surveys should include well-planned formative assessments and stakeholder involvement.

TI  - <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in Hungary: an overview of recent and historical occurrence
T2  - ACTA HERPETOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a fungal pathogen which causes the emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis. Bd presents low host specificity and threatens amphibians worldwide, thus systematic inventory is the key in order to detect and mitigate the effects of the disease. Extensive data collection was conducted in Hungary in 2009-2015 from fourteen different areas. Combined data - recent field sampling on sixteen taxa and the examination of archived Bombina spp. specimens - from 1360 individuals were analysed with qPCR. Two sentinel taxa, Bombina variegata and the members of the Pelophylax esculentus complex were marked to monitor the occurrence of Bd in two core areas (Bakony Mts and Hortobagy National Park, respectively) of sampling. Climatic variables were also examined in core areas to test their effect on prevalence and infection intensity. Among the sixteen sampled amphibian taxa seven tested positive for Bd and the overall prevalence in Hungary was 7.46%. Among the ethanol-fixed Bombina spp. individuals Bd was not detected. In the first core area (Bakony Mts) the overall prevalence in B. variegata was 10.32% and juvenile individuals showed significantly higher prevalence than adults. On the other hand there was a significant negative relationship between infection prevalence and monthly mean air temperature. Finally, in the other core area (Hortobagy National Park) the overall prevalence in P. esculentus complex was 13.00%, and no differences were found in prevalence or infection intensity between sexes, sampling years or age classes.

TI  - Local adjustments of image spatial resolution to optimize large-area mapping in the era of big data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 has opened a new era for the remote sensing community where 10-m imagery is freely available with a 5-day revisit frequency and a systematic global coverage. Having both frequent and detailed observations across large geographic areas are ideal characteristics that can potentially revolutionize applications such as crop mapping and monitoring. However, such large volumes of high-resolution data pose challenges to users in terms of problem complexity, computational resources and processing time, beckoning the increasingly relevant question: at which resolution should this imagery be processed? Here, we develop a methodology to characterize resolution-dependent errors in cropland mapping and explore their behavior when we move across spatial scales and landscapes, taking special care to include the effects of the instrument's Point Spread Function (PSF). Results show how local upscaling of 10-m imagery, e.g., from Sentinel-2, to 30 m mitigates most the adverse effects generated by the PSF when comparing it to native 30-m imagery, e.g., from Landsat-8. Extending this logic, we demonstrate for two nationwide cases how maps can be calculated showing the optimal spatial resolution that keeps resolution-dependent errors below a user-defined threshold. Based on these maps, we estimate that 31% of Belgium and 59% of South Africa could be processed at 20 m instead of 10 m, while keeping the increase of resolution-dependent errors below 3%. These local resolution adjustments lead to a reduction in data volume and processing time by 23% and 44%, respectively.

T2  - DIALOG-A JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A reframing of an understanding of death using indigenous religious concepts rooted in an African and a Hindu religious worldview is suggested in this article. Using her personal experiences, the author suggests that reclaiming and reframing the concept of death in terms of freedom, as held by the Order of the Sisters of the Good Death in the Candomble religious community of Brazil; representing death in terms of "letting go of ego" as personified by the Hindu Goddess Kali; and seeing death as black and beautiful and of energy as Kali, might be helpful for African Americans. Noting that death and the accompanying hurt and pain of death might move one to action, the need for death rituals is also suggested as a way for the community to begin the healing process, to be reconnected and to be "re-membered."

TI  - Landsat time series analysis of fractional plant cover changes on abandoned energy development sites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil and natural gas development in the western United States has increased substantially in recent decades as technological advances like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made extraction more commercially viable. Oil and gas pads are often developed for production, and then capped, reclaimed, and left to recover when no longer productive. Understanding the rates, controls, and degree of recovery of these reclaimed well sites to a state similar to pre-development conditions is critical for energy development and land management decision processes. Here we use a multi-decadal time series of satellite imagery (Landsat 5, 1984-2011) to assess vegetation regrowth on 365 abandoned well pads located across the Colorado Plateau in Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. We developed high-frequency time series of the Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) for each well pad using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. BFAST time-series models were used to fit temporal trends, identifying when vegetation was cleared from the site and the magnitudes and rates of vegetation change after abandonment. The time series metrics are used to calculate the relative fractional vegetation cover (RFVC) of each pad, a measure of post-abandonment vegetation cover relative to pre-drilling condition. Mean and median RFVC were 36% (s.d. 33%) and 26%, respectively, five years after abandonment, with one third of well pads having RFVC greater than 50%. Statistical analyses suggest that much of the high vegetation cover is associated with weedy invasive annual species such as cheatgrass (Brotnus tectorum) and Russian thistle (Salsola spp.). Climate conditions and the year of abandonment also play a role, with increased cover in later years associated with a wetter period. Non-linear change at many pads suggests longer recovery times than would be estimated by linear extrapolation. New techniques implemented here address a complex response of cover change to soils, management, and climate over time, and can be extended to the operational monitoring of energy development across large areas.

TI  - Sea-Level Change Over the China Sea and Its Vicinity Derived from 25-Year T/P Series Altimeter Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of sea-level change in the China Sea and its vicinity are studied by combining TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 altimeter data. First, the sea-surface height is computed by using monthly data via collinear adjustment, regional selection, and crossover adjustment. The sea-level anomaly (SLA) from October 1992 to July 2017 is calculated based on the difference that is obtained by the value derived from the inverse distance weighting method to interpolate the CNES_CLS15 model value at a normal point. By analyzing the satellite data at the same time in orbit, three mean bias groups over the China Sea and its vicinity are obtained: the difference between T/P and Jason-1 is -11.76cm, the difference between Jason-1 and Jason-2 is 9.6cm, and the difference between Jason-2 and Jason-3 is 2.42cm. To establish an SLA series for 25years in the study area, the SLAs are corrected. Mean rate of sea-level rise of the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea of 4.87mm/a, 2.68mm/a, 2.88mm/a, and 4.67mm/a, respectively, is found by analyzing the series of SLAs.

TI  - ADS-BI: Compressed Indexing of ADS-B Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of ADS-B, a satellite-based aircraft tracking technology, and the increasing installation of ADS-B receiver stations around the globe eases the tracking of aircraft, compared with traditional solutions using secondary radar. Given the large scale of ADS-B implementation and the high frequency of data collection, storing and managing ADS-B induced data has become increasingly difficult: The worldwide ADS-B data easily aggregates to several hundreds of terabyte per year, depending on the spatial coverage and temporal resolution. Standard data management solutions do not work well for ADS-B data, since they either require a large uncompressed index structure or cannot he queried efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel compressed index structure for managing ADS-B data, called ADS-BI The essential building blocks are spatio-temporal reference partitioning, reordering, and compression. On top of the partitioned, compressed representation, metadata is stored effectively, and exploited during query answering for typical ATM related task such as trajectory adherence evaluation, as well as complexity and safety metrics assessment by only accessing parts of the compressed data as necessary. Our novel index structure is evaluated on worldwide ADS-B data for a week in November 2016. For comparison, we implemented ten standard compression/indexing methods. The experiments reveal that none of these traditional methods can target the sweet spot between a small storage and efficient query answering. Our novel technique provides fast query answering at smallest storage costs. This paper contributes toward efficient handling of the increasing amount of traffic data in air traffic management, and eventually, toward more efficient and safer air transportation.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel-2 MSI Spectral Band Reflectances for Estimating Fractional Vegetation Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an essential parameter for characterizing the land surface vegetation conditions and plays an important role in earth surface process simulations and global change studies. The Sentinel-2 missions carrying multi-spectral instrument (MSI) sensors with 13 multispectral bands are potentially useful for estimating FVC. However, the performance of these bands for FVC estimation is unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the performance of Sentinel-2 MSI spectral band reflectances on FVC estimation. The samples, including the Sentinel-2 MSI canopy reflectances and corresponding FVC values, were simulated using the PROSPECT + SAIL radiative transfer model under different conditions, and random forest regression (RFR) method was then used to develop FVC estimation models and assess the performance of various band reflectances for FVC estimation. These models were finally evaluated using field survey data. The results indicate that the three most important bands of Sentinel-2 MSI data for FVC estimation are band 4 (Red), band 12 (SWIR2) and band 8a (NIR2). FVC estimation using these bands has a comparable accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.085) with that using all bands (RMSE = 0.090). The results also demonstrate that band 12 had a better performance for FVC estimation than the green band (RMSE = 0.097). However, the newly added red-edge bands, with low scores in the RFR model, have little significance for improving FVC estimation accuracy compared with the Red, NIR2 and SWIR2 bands.

TI  - A Stellar Imaging Error Correction Method Based on an Ellipsoid Model: Taking Ziyuan 3-02 Satellite Data Analysis as an Example
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stellar point image coordinates are one of the important observations needed for high-precision space attitude measurement with a star sensor. High-coupling imaging errors occur under dynamic imaging conditions. Using the results of preliminary star point extraction from star sensor imaging data combined with a superimposed time series, we analyze the relative motion and trajectory based on the star point image, establish an image error ellipsoid fitting model based on the elliptical orbit of a satellite platform, and achieve geometric error correction of a star sensors' image star point using multi-parameter screening of the ambiguous solutions of intersection of the elliptic equations. The simulation data showed that the accuracy of the correction error of this method reached 89.8%, and every star point coordinate required 0.259 s to calculate, on average. In addition, it was applied to real data from the satellite Ziyuan 3-02 to carry out the correction of the star points. The experiment shows that the mean of attitude quaternion errors for all its components was reduced by 52.3%. Our results show that the estimation parameters of dynamic imaging errors can effectively compensate for the star point image observation value and improve the accuracy of attitude calculation.

TI  - Analysis of the long-term high-resolution infrared radiation sounder land surface temperature against ground measurements during 1980-2009 in the Poyang Lake basin, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays an essential role in the energy exchanges between land and atmosphere. It reflects the changes of available terrestrial energy in the context of global warming, and thus can serve as an indicator of regional climate change. The recently developed HIRS (High-resolution infrared radiation sounder onboard NOAA satellites) LST product is among the longest LST records. We have analysed the HIRS LST against ground measurements from 66 stations in the Poyang Lake basin, China, considering the temporal variations at daily and interannual time scales during 1980-2009. The error metrics of correlation coefficient, Bias and unbiased Root Mean Square Deviation (ubRMSD) are used, together with the long-term linear trends. The two data sets have considerable agreement with respect to daily variations. Their correlation coefficients are higher than 0.95 for all stations; and those for daily anomalies range from 0.73 to 0.85 across the basin. The Bias and the ubRMSD have indicated that the HIRS data have generally underestimated the LST across the basin, mainly because of its large underestimation of the occurrences of temperature higher than 35 degrees C. Nevertheless, the HIRS LST has largely overestimated the occurrences of summer days with temperature ranging 20-30 degrees C. The Bias and the ubRMSD appear to be smaller in the cropped plains and much larger in the afforested mountain areas. As for the interannual variations, the HIRS LST shows highest correlations with ground measurement in spring; they are lowest in summer, possibly due to the interference of monsoonal precipitation. Both the HIRS LST and ground measurements show significant increasing trends with similar patterns in spring and winter. However, the long-term trends are significantly overestimated across the basin in summer, but underestimated in autumn in the HIRS LST data.

TI  - Concentrations of Multiple Phytoplankton Pigments in the Global Oceans Obtained from Satellite Ocean Color Measurements with MERIS
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing of chlorophyll a concentration from ocean color satellites has been an essential variable quantifying phytoplankton in the past decades, yet estimation of accessory pigments from ocean color remote sensing data has remained largely elusive. In this study, we validated the concentrations of multiple pigments (Cpigs) retrieved from in situ and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) measured remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) in the global oceans. A multi-pigment inversion model (MuPI) was used to semi-analytically retrieve Cpigs from R-rs(lambda). With a set of globally optimized parameters, the accuracy of the retrievals obtained with MuPI is quite promising. Compared with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measurements near Bermuda, the concentrations of chlorophyll a, b, c ([Ch1-a], [Ch1-b], [Ch1-c])photoprotective carotenoids ([PPC]), and photosynthetic carotenoids ([PSC1) can be retrieved from MERIS data with a mean unbiased absolute percentage difference of 38%, 78%, 65%, 36%, and 47%, respectively. The advantage of the MuPI approach is the simultaneous retrievals of [Ch1-a] and the accessory pigments [Ch1-b], [Ch1-c], [PPC], [PSC] from MERIS R-rs(lambda) based on a closure between the input and output R-rs(lambda) spectra. These results can greatly expand scientific studies of ocean biology and biogeochemistry of the global oceans that are not possible when the only available information is [Ch1-a].

TI  - Enhancing spectral unmixing by considering the point spread function effect
T2  - SPATIAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 4th International Conference on Spatial Statistics - One World - One Health
CL  - Lancaster Univ, Lancaster, ENGLAND
AB  - The point spread function (PSF) effect exists ubiquitously in real remotely sensed data and such that the observed pixel signal is not only determined by the land cover within its own spatial coverage but also by that within neighboring pixels. The PSF, thus, imposes a fundamental limit on the amount of information captured in remotely sensed images and it introduces great uncertainty in the widely applied, inverse goal of spectral unmixing. Until now, spectral unmixing has erroneously been performed by assuming that the pixel signal is affected only by the land cover within the pixel, that is, ignoring the PSF. In this paper, a new method is proposed to account for the PSF effect within spectral unmixing to produce more accurate predictions of land cover proportions. Based on the mechanism of the PSF effect, the mathematical relation between the coarse proportion and sub-pixel proportions in a local window was deduced. Area-to-point kriging (ATPK) was then proposed to find a solution for the inverse prediction problem of estimating the sub-pixel proportions from the original coarse proportions. The subpixel proportions were finally upscaled using an ideal square wave response to produce the enhanced proportions. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated using two datasets. The proposed method has great potential for wide application since spectral unmixing is an extremely common approach in remote sensing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrated Approach for Lithological Classification Using ASTER Imagery in a Shallowly Covered Region-The Eastern Yanshan Mountain of China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studied the applicability of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data for lithological classification in the shallowly covered Eastern Yanshan Mountain of Eastern China. The interpreted objects include quartz sandstone, carbonate rock, gneiss, and an-desite. An integrated approach was employed to process the remote sensing data: First, the matched filtering method, accompanied by the ASTER library and imagery spectra as reference, was used to enhance the targeted information, namely the remotely visible (typical) rock outcrops. As the andesite is frequently weathered to iron-rich minerals in the field, so the high-resolution SPOT6 3/1 image, instead of the ASTER image, was used to locate the outcrops. Second, the fractal digital number-frequency algorithm was developed to preliminarily extract the lithology anomaly patches; and the obtained geological anomalies were generalized into three types: anomalies related to outcrops, anomalies caused by different forms of the same lithology, and random noise. Third, digital elevation model derived slope masks, in combination with the spatial intersection operation, was used to eliminate the pseudo-outcrop anomalies and noise. Finally, the accuracy assessment was conducted by referencing the local rock-outcrop database, and the misclassification rates for quartz sandstone, carbonate rock, gneiss, and andesite are 8.9%, 12.5%, 23%, and 48.3%, respectively. This study has contributed a useful case study for remote-sensing lithology mapping in shallowly covered areas, and the proposed method should have a great potential to be applied to many similar cases.

TI  - Different radiation techniques to deliver therapeutic dose to the axilla in patients with sentinel lymph node-positive breast cancer: Doses, techniques challenges and clinical considerations
T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. - To evaluate the coverage of different levels of axillary lymph nodes and organs at risk according to the field design of AMAROS study (levels breast tangents with supraclavicular and infraclavicular fields (levels II-III-IV) and high tangent fields to the breast after breast-conserving surgery.Materials and methods. - We delineated the axillary lymph nodes levels I-IV in 34 patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph nodes biopsy. Field design according to AMAROS study levels I-IV in patients without axillary dissection - as well as irradiation of levels II-IV used in N+ patients after axillary dissection, and also high tangent fields was simulated. Mean dose levels and volumes covered by 95% or 80% isodoses were evaluated. Doses to ipsilateral lung, heart and brachial plexus were compared. Paired t test was used.Results. - AMAROS study and levels II-IV plans delivered therapeutic dose to high axilla (levels II-IV), but the high tangent fields showed inefficacy to cover these volumes, P<0.001). In terms of organs at risk, especially, ipsilateral lung, AMAROS study plan was found to significantly increase the volume receiving at least 10 Gy (I-IV:46.8%, II-IV: 39%), but also the volume receiving at least 20 Gy (I-IV: 39.3%, II-IV: 31.3%), and V-30Gy (I-IV: 34.2% vs II-IV: 26.1%), as well as the mean dose (I-IV: 18.6 Gy, II-IV: 15.2 GY, P<0.001).Conclusions. - The omission of axillary dissection and the axilla irradiation need is associated with high dose irradiation of the lungs, and with higher toxicity. The indication of axillary dissection or irradiation of low axilla could be individualized in relation with individual comorbidities and factors of risk.

TI  - Mapping Root-Zone Soil Moisture Using a Temperature-Vegetation Triangle Approach with an Unmanned Aerial System: Incorporating Surface Roughness from Structure from Motion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution root-zone soil moisture (SM) maps are important for understanding the spatial variability of water availability in agriculture, ecosystems research and water resources management. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can flexibly monitor land surfaces with thermal and optical imagery at very high spatial resolution (meter level, VHR) for most weather conditions. We modified the temperature-vegetation triangle approach to transfer it from satellite to UAS remote sensing. To consider the effects of the limited coverage of UAS mapping, theoretical dry/wet edges were introduced. The new method was tested on a bioenergy willow short rotation coppice site during growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. We demonstrated that by incorporating surface roughness parameters from the structure-from-motion in the interpretation of the measured land surface-atmosphere temperature gradients, the estimates of SM significantly improved. The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured SM increased from not significant to 0.69 and the root mean square deviation decreased from 0.045 m(3).m(-3) to 0.025 m(3).m(-3) when considering temporal dynamics of surface roughness in the approach. The estimated SM correlated better with in-situ root-zone SM (15-30 cm) than with surface SM (0-5 cm) which is an important advantage over alternative remote sensing methods to estimate SM. The optimal spatial resolution of the triangle approach was found to be around 1.5 m, i.e. similar to the length scale of tree-crowns. This study highlights the importance of considering the 3-D fine scale canopy structure, when addressing the links between surface temperature and SM patterns via surface energy balances. Our methodology can be applied to operationally monitor VHR root-zone SM from UAS in agricultural and natural ecosystems.

TI  - New methods for improving the remote sensing estimation of soil organic matter content (SOMC) in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to improve the potential of Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) hyperspectral and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data in predicting soil organic matter content (SOMC) in the bare topsoil of the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in northwest China. The results indicated that the correlation of coefficients (R) between SOMCs and hyperspectral data processed by fractional derivative were significant at the 0.01 level; the number of wave bands increased initially and then decreased when the order increased. The correlation of coefficient peak appeared at the 1.2 order with a value of 0.52. The correlation of coefficients (R) between SOMCs and the optimal remote sensing indexes (the ratio index, RI; difference index, DI; and the normalized difference index, NDI) of peaked at the 1.2 order, with correlation of coefficients (R) values of 0.81, 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. Six SOMC estimation models were created by means of a single band and optimal remote sensing indexes using Gray Relational Analysis-BP Neural Network (GRA-BPNN). This study found that the optimal model was a 1.2 order derivative model, where the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was 3.26 g/kg, the highest was 0.92, and the residual prediction deviation (RPD) was 2.26. To complete the high accuracy retrieval of SOMCs, based on Landsat OLI operational land images data, more 'hidden' information from the Landsat OLI images were obtained by employing the subsection of spectral band method and the fractional derivative algorithm. Accuracy of the SOMC map was attained by the optimal model of the ground hyperspectral data and the Landsat OLI data, which had low RMSE values of 4.21 g/kg and 4.16 g/kg, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the SOMC can be estimated and retrieved using a fractional derivative algorithm, the subsection of spectral band method, and the optimal remote sensing index.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclone (TCs) rapid intensification (RI) often results in large forecast errors and it is among the most significant challenges facing operational TCs forecasting centers. In this study, Hato (2017) and Vicente (2012) were selected that have the most significant features happened in the South China Sea in the past 20 years. Based on Fengyun-2 (FY-2) geostationary meteorological satellite high-temporal resolution data, an algorithm for characterizing the cloud in TCs vertical motion signal was developed, which was combinated with vertical wind shear and inner dynamic information. And the authors investigate the interaction between the cloud vertical motion and RI. The results show that the process of RI like the seesaw, with the convection intensity increased and decreased, better organized TCs internal structure was proved TC intensity change with the maximum value of the cloud vertical motion gathered in the core area of the typhoon. The continuous increase of cloud ascending motion within 0 similar to 50 km was the most significant contribution to RI, and sudden changes had happened within 1 similar to 2 h. The findings corroborate previous RI study results while providing additional insights into internal structure in TC, also it provides references for TC monitoring and future study work.

TI  - Inference of an Optimal Ice Particle Model through Latitudinal Analysis of MISR and MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inference of ice cloud properties from remote sensing data depends on the assumed forward ice particle model, as they are used in the radiative transfer simulations that are part of the retrieval process. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (MC6) ice cloud property retrievals are produced in conjunction with a single-habit ice particle model with a fixed degree of ice particle surface roughness (the MC6 model). In this study, we examine the MC6 model and five other ice models with either smoother or rougher surface textures to determine an optimal model to reproduce the angular variation of the radiation field sampled by the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) as a function of latitude. The spherical albedo difference (SAD) method is used to infer an optimal ice particle model. The method is applied to collocated MISR and MODIS data over ocean for clouds with temperatures 233 K during December solstice from 2012-2015. The range of solar zenith angles covered by the MISR cameras is broader at the solstices than at other times of the year, with fewer scattering angles associated with sun glint during the December solstice than the June solstice. The results suggest a latitudinal dependence in an optimal ice particle model, and an additional dependence on the solar zenith angle (SZA) at the time of the observations. The MC6 model is one of the most optimal models on the global scale. In further analysis, the results are filtered by a cloud heterogeneity index to investigate cloudy scenarios that are less susceptible to potential 3D effects. Compared to results for global data, the consistency between measurements and a given model can be distinguished in both the tropics and extra-tropics. The SAD analysis suggests that the optimal model for thick homogeneous clouds corresponds to more roughened ice particles in the tropics than in the extra-tropics. While the MC6 model is one of the models most consistent with the global data, it may not be the most optimal model for the tropics.

TI  - Patterns of land change and their potential impacts on land surface temperature change in Yangon, Myanmar
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used remote sensing imagery to characterize land use/cover patterns and to derive land surface temperature (LST) of Greater Yangon, the largest urban agglomeration in Myanmar, to provide insights into the association between land use/cover and seasonal, daytime, and nighttime LST change. Analysis of Landsat images from 1987 to 2015 showed urban expansion radiating from the city center and along prominent rivers, with major increases in built-up land (6.4%) and grassland (10.1%) and consequent decline in agricultural land (17%). Examination of MODIS LST showed that agricultural land was warmer than the city core during daytime in hot seasons, while in cold seasons, the city core was warmer than its rural surroundings during both daytime and nighttime. Correlation analysis revealed stronger association between built-up land and nighttime LST from 2000 to 2015, suggesting an increased surface urban heat island effect. Furthermore, this study highlighted two main differences from prior work on the influences of land use/cover on LST. First, the predominant land use/cover type that had great overall impact on LST was agricultural land, marked by its statistically significant correlation coefficients across all time periods of analysis. Such finding emphasized the influence of agriculture and related practices on the atmosphere and climate system. Second, the temporal analysis of LST highlighted a stronger and more complicated role water played because of its negative correlations with daytime LST and positive correlations with nighttime LST. The findings of this study underscored more complex effects of land use/cover on the spatial and temporal variations of LST in Yangon, compared to prior work that generally reported high LST in the urban areas. These insights improve the understanding of the land change consequences on the temporal dynamics of LST and can support sustainable land use planning for the better well-being of the inhabitants in Greater Yangon.

TI  - Integration of cloud top heights retrieved from FY-2 meteorological satellite, radiosonde, and ground-based millimeter wavelength cloud radar observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top height (CTH) is an important parameter monitored in atmospheric observations, which has a significant impact on weather prediction, climate models, and flight services. CTH is typically obtained via three ways, namely, satellite, radiosonde, and ground-based radar, with their corresponding strengths and weaknesses. Traditionally, many studies have focused on independent comparison and analysis of CTHs retrieved from different observations. The researches on how to improve the reliability of the CTH by integrating multiple cloud measurements are rare in the literature despite the significance of this strategy to practical meteorological forecast and disaster prevention improvement. An integration technique of different CTHs retrieved from Fengyun 2 (FY-2) meteorological satellite, radiosonde, and ground-based millimeter wavelength cloud radar observations by using Bayesian decision theory is proposed in this study. A dataset is collected in Beijing, China for 12 months from June 2015 to May 2016 to validate the integration effect. Experimental results show that the integration observations improve the accuracy of single observations. Integration observations are more closely correlated with "true" CTH observations than the single observations. These all show the effectiveness of the proposed multiple source data integration strategy.

TI  - High prevalence of syndromic disorders in patients with non-isolated central precocious puberty
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Non-idiopathic CPP is caused by acquired or congenital hypothalamic lesions visible on MRI or is associated with various complex genetic and/or syndromic disorders. This study investigated the different types and prevalence of non-isolated CPP phenotypes.Design and Methods: This observational cohort study included all patients identified as having non-idiopathic CPP in the database of a single academic pediatric care center over a period of 11.5 years. Patients were classified on the basis of MRI findings for the CNS as having either hypothalamic lesions or complex syndromic phenotypes without structural lesions of the hypothalamus.Results: In total, 63 consecutive children (42 girls and 21 boys) with non-isolated CPP were identified. Diverse diseases were detected, and the hypothalamic lesions visible on MRI (n=28, 45% of cases) included hamartomas (n=17; either isolated or with an associated syndromic phenotype), optic gliomas (n=8; with or without neurofibromatosis type 1), malformations (n=3) with interhypothalamic adhesions (n=2; isolated or associated with syndromic CNS midline abnormalities, such as optic nerve hypoplasia, ectopic posterior pituitary) or arachnoid cysts (n=1). The patients with non-structural hypothalamic lesions (n=35, 55% of cases) had narcolepsy (n=9), RASopathies (n=4), encephalopathy or autism spectrum disorders with or without chromosomal abnormalities (n=15) and other complex syndromic disorders (n=7).Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a large proportion (55%) of patients with non-isolated probable non-idiopathic CPP may have complex disorders without structural hypothalamic lesions on MRI. Future studies should explore the pathophysiological relevance of the mechanisms underlying CPP in these disorders.

TI  - Drying drives decline in muskrat population in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical and anecdotal reports suggest that muskrat are in decline across NorthAmerica, including in the Peace-Athabasca Delta ('Delta'), Canada, one of the largest inland deltas in the world and part of a World Heritage Sitewith 'in Danger' status pending. Muskrat are a key ecological indicator in the Delta. Weinvestigate whether the large-scale loss of critical habitat over the past half-century could be driving a decline in muskrat abundance in the Delta. To do this, we use the Landsat record (1972-2017) to construct a 46 year record of inundation, and compare changes in the extent of critical habitat to the survey record for muskrat (1970-2016) over this 5500 km(2) region. Results showthat the declines in critical habitat and muskrat numbers in the Delta are synchronous: similar to 1450 km(2) of temporarily inundated regions that support critical habitat have diminished by similar to 10 km(2) yr(-1) over the past 46 years, while the muskrat population density (houses/km(2)) has also declined and is significantly related to critical habitat area (km(2)) (R-2 = 0.60, P = 0.0001). These findings have implications for the Delta, a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in part for its role as a habitat for nearly 200 species of birds, many ofwhich rely on the aquatic habitat considered here. Our results further suggest that the loss ofwetland habitat is a primary driver of the decline of muskrat across the species' native range.

TI  - Satellite Image Based Characterization for Monitoring Urbanization and Land Cover Change
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORKED AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface processes have become a great concern in the context of global change and increased natural hazards all over the world. In this paper, dynamic characteristics of land cover changes have been investigated over a period of about three and half decades (1972-2016). This study focuses on the temporally evolving geo-environmental characteristics of Dhaka (Capital City) in Bangladesh. The analysis has been performed in a platform of Geographical Information System (GIS) configured with Remote Sensing (RS) system and ground-based RS measurement facilities. Radiometric analyses of multi-sensor time series satellite data followed by a process of spectral characterization have been performed. Special focus has been made on biophysical properties of surface features, geo-environmental configuration, land physiography, properties of vegetation and co-existing surface features. Earth Resources Data Analysis System (ERDAS) Imagine Image Processing Software and ArcGIS software have been utilized. It appears that both energy and water regimes have been affected particularly across the outer end of the side encroaching the city. In general, the outer side of the city consists of low land areas that is used to drain out water and to hold run-off water from the city. Feature-based analysis of satellite-derived radiative signal demonstrates dependencies on biophysical characteristics of surface features in response to human intervention under demographic pressure. Important class categories, particularly, built-up areas, crop land, water bodies have been studied to figure out the zones experiencing unplanned human interventions due to recent urban growth. This generalized pattern of urban growth appears to be a useful finding for urban planning and policy for the government of Bangladesh. Finally, it is evident that integration of space-based RS technology with GIS provide better platform to perform such activities. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

TI  - Advanced satellite radar interferometry for deformation monitoring and infrastructure control in open-cast mines and oil/gas fields
T2  - INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We focus on the use of advanced multi-temporal interferometry (MTI) for mapping and monitoring of ground deformations caused by open-cast mining and hydrocarbon production. We also show how MTI can be exploited to monitor the stability of infrastructure in adjacent areas. Open-cast mines represent a good target for MTI, because they are (1) often very large (from few to tens of km(2)); (2) free of or covered by sparse vegetation; (3) require long-term regular monitoring. The operational deformation monitoring via MTI can now rely on free of charge medium-resolution Sentinel-1 data, consistently and regularly acquired by the European Space Agency (ESA) since 2014. To illustrate the application potential of MTI based on Sentinel-1 data, we present the case study of the Belchatow mine (Poland), one of the largest open-cast mines in Europe. We stress that thanks to wide-area coverage; space-borne MTI represents a cost-effective approach to monitoring ground/slope instability hazards in large open pits, as well as the stability of the associated engineering structures and facilities. On-land oil and gas fields are also often huge and ground deformations induced by their exploitations can be profitably targeted by MTI. This is illustrated through an example of MTI application from the Middle East that relies on high-resolution (3m) radar data. The example highlights the possibility of obtaining extremely dense (spatially continuous) information, which is important for monitoring complex ground deformations caused by oil field exploitation.

TI  - Regional-scale back-analysis using TRIGRS: an approach to advance landslide hazard modeling and prediction in sparse data regions
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides in Kerala, India, have been shown to be preceded not only by critical rainfall over a short period but also a much longer period of elevated pore pressure. Such rainfall-triggered landslides are difficult to monitor due to a lack of adequate data on the locations of failures and precipitation. Here, a method is presented using Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-based Regional Slope stability (TRIGRS) as a tool to model the relationship between critical rainfall and antecedent pore pressure as they relate to slope stability, which can be useful for hazard assessment in sparse data regions. This is demonstrated by parameterizing the model with a combination of regional data sources, remote sensing, and temporal back-analysis based on two known failure events (June 2004 and July 2007). Ranges of possible geotechnical and hydraulic parameters were obtained from various local and regional sources, and soil thickness was modeled as a function of slope angle. Rainfall was estimated using satellite microwave radiometry data. For back-analysis, combinations of cohesion, friction angle, and water table depth were then tested in TRIGRS using trial and error until the predicted and observed failure times coincided for the two failure events. While the spatial prediction accuracy of the model is low and multiple solution sets are expected to exist, the results confirm that information regarding the critical pre-failure conditions and stability changes over time can be derived despite data-poor circumstances. Future studies can be undertaken extending this method to characterize many parameter combinations and incorporate more failure cases to develop probabilistic early-warning thresholds.

TI  - The role of inguinal lymph node dissection in men with urethral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Urethral squamous cell cancer is a rare disease with limited clinical recommendations regarding management of the inguinal lymph nodes. Despite the similarities to penile cancer in terms of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histology and lymphatic drainage, there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against a prophylactic inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) in patients with clinically negative groins and a primary tumor stage of Tlb or higher. The objective of the study was to identify the rate of prophylactic inguinal lymph node dissection, node positive rate, and overall survival in patients with clinical T1 to T4 stage. The patients were separated into clinical N stage and the rates of node positivity were compared. We hypothesize that the node positivity rate would be similar to that observed in penile cancer of similar clinical T and N stage and provide evidence for prophylactic inguinal lymph node dissection in urethral squamous cancer. We also sought to determine the value of ILND in clinically node positive (cN+) and clinically node negative (cN) patients.Methods: The National Cancer Database was queried for all cases of primary urethral cancer in men from 2004 to 2014. Patients with other cancer diagnoses, metastasis, nonsquamous histology, female patients, and patients with a history of radiation therapy were excluded. Male patients with urethral squamous cell cancer of the anterior urethra with T1 or higher T stage were included in this study. All-cause mortality was compared using multivariable Cox regression controlling for covariates.Results: The study included 725 men with urethral SCC with T1 or higher clinical T stage. The median age was 63 years (33-83 inter quartile range). Of the 725 men, 536 men did not receive an ILND and 189 (26%) underwent ILND. Patients who received LND had significantly higher clinical T and clinical N stage. There was no difference in age, sex, or histology between those with ILND versus no ILND. In patients with T1 to T4 and clinical NO, the ILND rate was 21.8% (89/396). The lymph node positive rate in patients with NO and T1 to T4 primary tumor was 9%. In patients with clinically node positive disease (N1/N2), the overall ILND rate was 76%. The lymph node positive rate for patients with clinical nodal disease was 84%. On multivariable analysis cox regression, lymph node positivity was associated with worse overall survival when controlling for T stage, clinical N stage, and age (HR 1.56, 95% 1.3-1.9, P = 0.000). On multivariable analysis after controlling for T stage, sex, and age, having an ILND was associated with improved OS in patients with clinical N1 or N2 disease (HR 0.46, 95% 0.28-0.78 P = 0.002).Conclusion: The node positivity rate in patients with T1 to T4 and NO is 9%, much lower than reported in penile cancer with a high-risk primary tumor but clinically negative groins. This argues against routine prophylactic inguinal ILND in patients with urethral SCC who are clinically NO, perhaps suggesting different biological behavior of urethral SCC compared to penile SCC. Performing a lymph node dissection in patients with clinically N1 or N2 disease is associated with improved OS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A Co-Wife for the Cow: Gender Dimensions of Land Change and Livelihood Shift among Loita Maasai of Southern Kenya
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gender dimensions are fundamental to human/environment systems. I use gender to investigate land change in a forested area of conservation concern in the pastoral rangelands of Kenya Maasailand. Mixed methods reveal a narrative arc from the mid-1970s culminating in a transformation of land, livelihood, and culture by 2014. Empirical findings expand current understandings of livelihood shift in Maasailand to include gender dimensions critical to livelihood success. Remotely sensed satellite data and qualitative evidence expose simplistic narratives about environmental conditions in Loita Forest and Maasai women's social status. I argue that gender deserves more attention in land-change studies because of its linkages to resource utilization and drivers of forest decline around the world.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of NLCD 2011 impervious cover data for the Chesapeake Bay region, USA
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) contains three eras (2001, 2006, 2011) of percentage urban impervious cover (%IC) at the native pixel size (30 m- x -30 m) of the Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite. These data are potentially valuable to environmental managers and stakeholders because of the utility of %IC as an indicator of watershed and aquatic condition, but lack an accuracy assessment because of the absence of suitable reference data. Recently developed 1 m(2) land cover data for the Chesapeake Bay region makes it possible to assess NLCD %IC accuracy for a 262,000 km(2) region based on a census rather than a sample of reference data. We report agreement between the two %IC datasets for watersheds and the riparian zones within watersheds and four additional square units. The areas of the six assessment units were 40 ha cell, 433 ha (riparian mean), 2756 ha cell, 5626 ha cell, 8569 ha (watershed mean) and 22,500 ha cell. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Mean Deviation (MD) were about 1.5% and -1.5%, respectively, for each of the assessment units except for the riparian unit, for which MAD and MD were 0.88 and 0.62, respectively. NLCD reliably reproduced %IC from the 1 m(2) data with a small, consistent tendency for underestimation. Results were sensitive to assessment unit choice. The results for the four largest assessment units had very similar regression parameters, R-2 values, and bias patterns. Results for the riparian assessment were different from those for the watershed unit and the other three larger units. MAD was about 50% less for the riparian zones than it was for the watersheds, the direction of bias was less consistent, and NLCD %IC was uniformly higher than 1 m(2) %IC in urbanized riparian zones. For the smallest unit, bias patterns were more similar to the riparian unit and regression results were more similar to the four larger units. MAD and MD were also sensitive to the amount of urbanization, increasing as NLCD %IC increased. The low overall bias and positive relationship between bias and urbanization suggest that the benefits of obtaining 1 m(2) IC data outside of urban areas may not outweigh the costs of obtaining such data.

TI  - Development of a solar irradiance dataset for Oahu, Hawai'i
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar power as an alternative energy source in Hawai'i has grown in recent years [1], with increasing amounts of photovoltaic panels found statewide. Power resource management and grid stability require that the variability in irradiance, hence, solar power coming into the electric grid be understood. The aim of this study is to produce an irradiance dataset for Oahu, Hawai'i, containing temporal and spatial variability, so it can be used in modeling power generation.Images from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite are used to estimate surface irradiance within the Heliosat method and are validated against ground-based pyranometer measurements. The diurnal cycle was then removed to assess the accuracy of the Heliosat method in estimating atmospheric attenuation. Lastly, the irradiance data was converted into DC power to consider the dataset in terms of power generation.The irradiance dataset produced has RMSE values of 15-30% depending on location, with correction for viewing angle discrepancies found to improve the performance. Variability on sub hourly, diurnal, monthly and yearly time scales are found within the dataset, as well as events such as an El Nino year, a La Nina year and Kona lows, together with a spatial distribution consistent with previous research.

T2  - QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo examine participation in paid work, unpaid work and activities 12 months after a sentinel (initial) injury, and to determine the impact of sustaining a subsequent injury (SI) on these participation outcomes.MethodsParticipants were recruited to the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study following an Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC; New Zealand's no-fault injury insurer) entitlement claim injury. Outcomes were whether participants reported reduced paid work hours, reduced unpaid work (e.g. housework, gardening) or reduced activities (e.g. socialising, leisure pursuits) at 12 months compared to before the sentinel injury event. SIs were ACC claims of any type. Using multivariable models, characteristics of SIs were examined as potential predictors of reduced participation.ResultsAt 12 months, 30% had reduced paid work hours, 12% had reduced unpaid work and 25% had reduced activities. Sustaining a SI predicted reduced paid work (RR 1.5; 95% CI 1.2, 1.8), but not unpaid work or activities. Participants who had sustained intracranial SIs were at highest risk of reduced paid work (RR 3.2, 95% CI 1.9, 5.2). Those sustaining SIs at work were less likely to have reduced paid work (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6, 1.0) than those with only non-work SIs. Participants sustaining assaultive SIs had higher risk of reduced unpaid work (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0, 6.8).ConclusionsReduced participation is prevalent after a substantive sentinel injury, and sustaining a SI impacts on return to paid work. Identification of SI characteristics that put people at high risk of participation restriction may be useful for focusing on rehabilitative attention.

TI  - On the relationship between coral δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and Caribbean climate
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A coral (Orbicella faveolata) delta C-13 isotope ratio record off the southwest coast of Puerto Rico is used to indicate regional ocean-atmosphere conditions over the 20th century. The coral delta C-13 record is correlated positively with North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) and local evaporation. Spatial correlation maps show a broad area of influence by SST, sea-level pressure and evaporation to the northeast of Puerto Rico. The composite maps reflect a strengthening of the North Atlantic anticyclone and east Pacific counter-currents during years of enhanced coral growth. The coral delta C-13 record presented here corresponds with a local cloud cover increase of similar to 10% in parallel with a 0.5 degrees C rise of local SST since 1900. Environmental conditions tend to lead coral growth in a knock-on effect as seen in local SST, cloud cover and evaporation data. The coral community may thus be a sentinel of both multi-year fluctuations and centennial trends in Central Caribbean climate.

TI  - Evaluating the current evidence to support therapeutic mammoplasty or breast-conserving surgery as an alternative to mastectomy in the treatment of multifocal and multicentric breast cancers
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - The oncological safety of treating multiple ipsilateral breast cancers (MIBCs) with types of breast conserving surgery (BCS) compared to mastectomy remains uncertain. This is predicated on the absence of any randomised controlled trials or high-quality protocol defined prospective cohort studies. A single recently published systematic review by the first author, reports its summarised results in this review. Fundamentally the important question is the evaluation of clinical safety following BCS compared to mastectomy for treating MIBC, which is reported in only six studies. Consequently, current evidence doesn't support the latest St Gallen consensus suggesting the possibility of using BCS to treat all MIBC. There is minimal comparative outcomes data on multicentric (MC) cancers compared to multifocal (MF) cancers comparing BCS or mastectomy. There is also poor evidence of clinical outcomes following therapeutic mammoplasty (TM) for MIBC compared to mastectomy. The potential recommendation of two potential radiotherapy boosts to separate lumpectomy sites following BCS for MC cancers remains a novel treatment concept whose feasibility will be evaluated in the forthcoming NIHR funded randomised feasibility trial called MIAMI. This is a world first attempt to assess the feasibility of a randomised trial design alongside the on-going Alliance registry study (ACOSOG, American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z11102) in the USA, in which there is no comparative evaluation of mastectomy outcomes. The MIAMI trial aims to assess the clinical safety of multiple lumpectomies combined with TM compared to the standard of mastectomy in MIBC stratified by MF or MC cancers. There is limited evidence on the impacts of intertumoral heterogeneity relating to breast cancer subtypes in relation to individualised treatments and recommendations for types of breast surgery. Recent studies have highlighted the potential contributions of stromal epigenetic changes that are currently poorly understood regarding their contributions to either clinical unifocal or MF cancers.

TI  - Coupling of Precipitation and Cloud Structures in Oceanic Extratropical Cyclones to Large-Scale Moisture Flux Convergence
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation (from TMPA) and cloud structures (from MODIS) in extratropical cyclones (ETCs) are modulated by phases of large-scale moisture flux convergence (from MERRA-2) in the sectors of ETCs, which are studied in a new coordinate system with directions of both surface warm fronts (WFs) and surface cold fronts (CFs) fixed. The phase of moisture flux convergence is described by moisture dynamical convergence Q(cnvg) and moisture advection Q(advt). Precipitation and occurrence frequencies of deep convective clouds are sensitive to changes in Q(cnvg), while moisture tendency is sensitive to changes in Q(advt). Increasing Q(cnvg) and Q(advt) during the advance of the WF is associated with increasing occurrences of both deep convective and high-level stratiform clouds. A rapid decrease in Q(advt) with a relatively steady Q(cnvg) during the advance of the CF is associated with high-level cloud distribution weighting toward deep convective clouds. Behind the CF (cold sector or area with polar air intrusion), the moisture flux is divergent with abundant low- and midlevel clouds. From deepening to decaying stages, the pre-WF and WF sectors experience high-level clouds shifting to more convective and less stratiform because of decreasing Q(advt) with relatively steady Q(cnvg), and the CF experiences shifting from high-level to midlevel clouds. Sectors of moisture flux divergence are less influenced by cyclone evolution. Surface evaporation is the largest in the cold sector and the CF during the deepening stage. Deepening cyclones are more efficient in poleward transport of water vapor.

TI  - Variance components and animal rankings for milk yield and fat yield in a multibreed dairy cattle population using genomic-polygenic, genomic and polygenic models
T2  - Agriculture and Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - The variance ratios were estimated and animal rankings of genomic-polygenic (GP), genomic (G) and polygenic (P) models were compared for milk yield (MY) and fat yield (FY) in a Thai multibreed dairy cattle population. The dataset contained monthly records of MY and FY from 600 first-lactation cows from 56 farms in Central Thailand. The mixed model contained herd-year-season, Holstein fraction, heterozygosity of the cow and age at first calving as fixed effects (all models). Random effects were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; GP and G models), animal polygenic (GP and P models) and the residual. The GP heritability estimates were higher for MY (0.38) and FY (0.41) than for the P model (0.28 for MY and 0.30 for FY). The fractions of the additive genetic variance explained by the SNP markers were 50% for MY and 48% for FY. Rank correlations between GP and G were the highest for both MY and FY (0.99; p < 0.01). Rank correlations between G and P were the lowest for MY (0.89; p < 0.01) and FY (0.73; p < 0.01). SNPs from the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler Low-Density (GGP-LD) 9k BeadChip not only accounted for a sizeable fraction of the additive genomic variance for MY and FY, but also yielded animal genomic estimated breeding values (EBV) whose rankings were highly correlated with the rankings of both genomic-polygenic and polygenic EBV. These results indicated that GGP-LD 9k and likely higher density genotyping chips would help improve the accuracy of prediction and selection in Central Thailand.

TI  - Sea Surface Temperature Retrieval from the First Korean Geostationary Satellite COMS Data: Validation and Error Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Korea's first geostationary satellite, the "Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite" (COMS), has been operating since 2010. The Meteorological Imager (MI), an sensor on-board the COMS, has observed sea-surface radiances for the estimation of sea surface temperature (SST) in the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean. To derive the SST coefficients of COMS, quality-controlled surface drifting buoy data were collected for the period of April 2011 to March 2015. A collocation procedure between COMS/MI data and the surface drifter data produced a matchup database for 4 years from 2011 to 2015. The coefficients for the COMS/MI SST were derived by applying appropriate algorithms, i.e., the Multi-channel SST (MCSST) and Non-linear SST (NLSST) algorithms, for daytime and nighttime data using a regression method. Validation results suggest the possibility of the continuous use of the coefficients as representative SST coefficients of COMS. The estimated SSTs near the edge of a full disk with high satellite zenith angles over 60 degrees revealed relatively large errors compared to drifter temperatures. Most of NLSST formulations exhibited overestimation of SSTs at low SSTs (<10 degrees C). This study suggests an approach by which SST can be measured accurately in order to contribute to tracking climate change.

TI  - Effect of breast reconstruction modality on the development of postmastectomy shoulder morbidity
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of breast reconstruction modality on the incidence of shoulder morbidity.Methods: Breast cancer patients who underwent immediate reconstructions using three modalities, namely, tissue expander-implant, latissimus dorsi (LD) pedicled flap, and deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap, from 2008 to 2013 were examined. The cumulative incidence of shoulder morbidity was compared among the reconstruction modalities, and risk factor analysis was performed using multivariable analysis.Results: A total of 430 reconstructions (223 expander-implant, 44 LD flap, and 163 DIEP flap) in 420 patients were analyzed in this study. Shoulder morbidity developed in 95 patients (22.1%) and was most common in the LD group (43.2%) followed by the expander-implant (23.8%) and the DIEP (14.1%) groups over a mean follow-up of 52 (range: 24-120) months. The multivariable analysis showed that the expander-implant (odds ratio (OR) 2.15, p = 0.010) and the LD flap (OR 6.27, p < 0001) were significant risk factors for shoulder morbidity, compared to the DIEP flap. Old age (p = 0.041), presence of tumor-positive lymph nodes (p = 0.014), and receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for the development of shoulder morbidity. Early rehabilitation within 2 postoperative-months reduced the risk of sustained shoulder morbidity.

TI  - A Long Time-Series Radiometric Normalization Method for Landsat Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric normalization attempts to normalize the radiomimetic distortion caused by non-land surface-related factors, for example, different atmospheric conditions at image acquisition time and sensor factors, and to improve the radiometric consistency between remote sensing images. Using a remote sensing image and a reference image as a pair is a traditional method of performing radiometric normalization. However, when applied to the radiometric normalization of long time-series of images, this method has two deficiencies: first, different pseudo-invariant features (PIFs)-radiometric characteristics of which do not change with time-are extracted in different pairs of images; and second, when processing an image based on a reference, we can minimize the residual between them, but the residual between temporally adjacent images may induce steep increases and decreases, which may conceal the information contained in the time-series indicators, such as vegetative index. To overcome these two problems, we propose an optimization strategy for radiometric normalization of long time-series of remote sensing images. First, the time-series gray-scale values for a pixel in the near-infrared band are sorted in ascending order and segmented into different parts. Second, the outliers and inliers of the time-series observation are determined using a modified Inflexion Based Cloud Detection (IBCD) method. Third, the variation amplitudes of the PIFs are smaller than for vegetation but larger than for water, and accordingly the PIFs are identified. Last, a novel optimization strategy aimed at minimizing the correction residual between the image to be processed and the images processed previously is adopted to determine the radiometric normalization sequence. Time-series images from the Thematic Mapper onboard Landsat 5 for Hangzhou City are selected for the experiments, and the results suggest that our method can effectively eliminate the radiometric distortion and preserve the variation of vegetation in the time-series of images. Smoother time-series profiles of gray-scale values and uniform root mean square error distributions can be obtained compared with those of the traditional method, which indicates that our method can obtain better radiometric consistency and normalization performance.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment on MODIS (V006), GLASS and MuSyQ Land-Surface Albedo Products: A Case Study in the Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed accuracies of MCD43A3, Global Land-Surface Satellite (GLASS) and forthcoming Multi-source Data Synergized Quantitative Remote Sensing Production system (MuSyQ) albedos using ground observations and Huan Jing (HJ) data over the Heihe River Basin. MCD43A3 and MuSyQ albedos show similar high accuracies with identical root mean square errors (RMSE). Nevertheless, MuSyQ albedo is better correlated with ground measurements when sufficient valid observations are available or snow-free. The opposite happens when less than seven valid observations are available. GLASS albedo presents a larger RMSE than MCD43A3 and MuSyQ albedos in comparison with ground measurements. Over surfaces with smaller seasonal variations, MCD43A3 and MuSyQ albedos show smaller RMSEs than GLASS albedo in comparison with HJ albedo. However, for surfaces with larger temporal variations, both RMSEs and R-2 of GLASS albedo are comparable with MCD43A3 and MuSyQ. Generally, MCD43A3 and MuSyQ albedos featured the same RMSEs of 0.034 and similar R-2 (0.920 and 0.903, respectively), which are better than GLASS albedo (RMSE = 0.043, R-2 = 0.787). However, when it comes to comparison with aggregated HJ albedo, MuSyQ and GLASS albedos are with lower RMSEs of 0.027 and 0.032 and higher R-2 of 0.900 and 0.898 respectively than MCD43A3 (RMSE = 0.038, R-2 = 0.836). Despite the limited geographic region of the study area, they still provide an important insight into the accuracies of three albedo products.

TI  - Sponges (Porifera) as bioindicator species of environmental stress from de Gulf of Annaba (Algeria)
T2  - Biodiversity Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine seasonal variations of two biomarkers of oxidative stress, Glutathione (GSH) and Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), in sponge Sarcotragus spinosulus Schmidt, 1862 (Porifera Irciniidae). The samples were collected during the four seasons in 2016-2017 at two sites in the Gulf of Annaba (northeast of Algeria): Cape de Garde, which is some distance from any source of pollution, is considered a relatively clean site, while Alzon is a site exposed to various sources of industrial, urban and harbour pollution. The results show a significant seasonal decrease in GSH rate in Alzon compared with those at Cape de Garde. Moreover, GST activity increased significantly in Alzon relative to Cape de Garde site, with a maximum activity showed in autumn. This difference between those two sites was observed for all seasons, with more effect in spring and winter. The results obtained showed that under stressful conditions due to anthropogenic factors, some physiological processes of sponges can be affected. Thus, S. spinosulus appears to be a suitable sentinel species for the assessment of ecotoxicological risk in the Gulf of Annaba. Sponges present most of the characteristics researched in bioindicators of pollution and consequently have been proposed to constitute a "Sponge Watch Program''.

TI  - A simple method based on the thermal anomaly index to detect industrial heat sources
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Because waste gas from industrial burning has a significant effect on urban environment, it is important to detect industrial heat sources from remote sensing data. Given existing pyrometry, it is difficult to identify small factories with low burning temperatures. In addition, existing fire detection methods (such as the contextual algorithm) are cumbersome, complex, and contain multiple thresholds to be determined. With the purpose of detecting industrial heat sources efficiently and simply, we introduced a simple method based on the thermal anomaly index (TAI) to detect industrial heat sources. This index was constructed based on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) data with a detectable temperature of 400 K, which is lower than that used in most high-temperature detection methods. By confirming with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product and high-resolution images, the TAI confidently detected almost all hot spots with the VIIRS Nightfire product and detected many hot spots that were undetected by the VIIRS Nightfire product. Based on six images acquired over Tangshan, we determined that 54.52% of hot spots were undetected by the VIIRS Nightfire product, while the TAI method was able to detect these hot spots. With the MODTRAN 5 radiative transfer model, we simulated the high-temperature detection ability of the TAI. Compared with the VIIRS Nightfire product, the TAI is more sensitive when detecting hot spots below 700 K. Thus, this method can potentially detect family workshops engaged in the smallscale combustion of fuel.

TI  - Characterizing Variability of Solar Irradiance in San Antonio, Texas Using Satellite Observations of Cloudiness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the main attenuation of solar irradiance reaching the earth's surface is due to clouds, it has been hypothesized that global horizontal irradiance attenuation and its temporal variability at a given location could be characterized simply by cloud properties at that location. This hypothesis is tested using global horizontal irradiance measurements at two stations in San Antonio, Texas, and satellite estimates of cloud types and cloud layers from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Surface and Insolation Product. A modified version of an existing solar attenuation variability index, albeit having a better physical foundation, is used. The analysis is conducted for different cloud conditions and solar elevations. It is found that under cloudy-sky conditions, there is less attenuation under water clouds than those under opaque ice clouds (optically thick ice clouds) and multilayered clouds. For cloud layers, less attenuation was found for the low/mid layers than for the high layer. Cloud enhancement occurs more frequently for water clouds and less frequently for mixed phase and cirrus clouds and it occurs with similar frequency at all three levels. The temporal variability of solar attenuation is found to decrease with an increasing temporal sampling interval and to be largest for water clouds and smallest for multilayered and partly cloudy conditions. This work presents a first step towards estimating solar energy potential in the San Antonio area indirectly using available estimates of cloudiness from GOES satellites.

TI  - Impacts of Land Cover Changes on Ecosystem Carbon Stocks Over the Transboundary Tumen River Basin in Northeast Asia
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of land cover changes on ecosystem carbon stocks is essential for ecosystem management and environmental protection, particularly in the transboundary region that has undergone marked changes. This study aimed to examine the impacts of land cover changes on ecosystem carbon stocks in the transboundary Tumen River Basin (TTRB). We extracted the spatial information from Landsat Thematic Imager (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images for the years 1990 and 2015 and obtained convincing estimates of terrestrial biomass and soil carbon stocks with the InVEST model. The results showed that forestland, cropland and built-up land increased by 57.5, 429.7 and 128.9 km(2), respectively, while grassland, wetland and barren land declined by 24.9, 548.0 and 43.0 km(2), respectively in the TTRB from 1990 to 2015. The total carbon stocks encompassing aboveground, belowground, soil and litter layer carbon storage pools have declined from 831.48 Tg C in 1990 to 831.42 Tg C in 2015 due to land cover changes. In detail, the carbon stocks decreased by 3.13 Tg C and 0.44 Tg C in Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and Russia, respectively, while increased by 3.51 Tg C in China. Furthermore, economic development, and national policy accounted for most land cover changes in the TTRB. Our results imply that effective wetland and forestland protection policies among China, North Korea, and Russia are much needed for protecting the natural resources, promoting local ecosystem services and regional sustainable development in the transnational area.

TI  - Spatio-temporal simulation of energy consumption in China's provinces based on satellite night-time light data
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Delay in publication of energy statistics prevents a timely assessment of progress towards meeting targets for energy saving and emission reduction in China. This makes it difficult to meet the requirements to rapidly monitor and evaluate energy consumption for each province. In this study, an alternative approach is provided to estimate the energy consumption by using satellite remote sensing data. We develop spatio-temporal geographically weighted regression models to simulate energy consumption of provinces in China based on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) global stable night-time light data. The models simulate China's energy consumption accurately with the goodness of fit higher than 99%. Generally, the national average annual energy consumption is 2.8 billion tonnes of coal equivalent in China between 2000 and 2013, which is close to the actual value with errors smaller than 0.1%. From both temporal and spatial dimensions, the relative errors are smaller than 5.5% at the provincial level. Therefore, the use of satellite night-time light data provides a useful reference in monitoring and assessing provincial energy consumption in China.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Signal Denoising and Remote Sensing Image Denoising in Photoelectric Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Matched Wavelet
T2  - JOURNAL OF NANOELECTRONICS AND OPTOELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of remote sensing data acquisition by photoelectric sensors, the sensor signal is often distorted due to equipment, illumination and other factors. Therefore, an important goal of remote sensing data acquisition is to eliminate noise as much as possible. Firstly, a wireless network topology structure based on PAN3101 photoelectric sensor is constructed. With CC2530 as the main control chip, the software simulation and device selection of node system design and circuit design of photoelectric sensor are carried out. The knowledge of traditional wavelet analysis and filter is studied, and taking the abnormal signal of photoelectric sensor as the research object, a wavelet matched method based on the specified abnormal signal is proposed. This method combines the wavelet analysis with the filter, sets matching principles, and obtains the matched wavelet. The wavelet matching method is applied to detect the transmission quality of optoelectronic sensor signal and compare with the performance of Haar algorithm and DBn algorithm for image denoising. In the process of experiment, the method of wavelet matching is used for signal denoising and image denoising. In the experiment of signal denoising, the method of wavelet matching proposed has obvious advantages over the classical method of wavelet denoising in the MSE (Mean Square Error) and PSNR (Power Signal-to-Noise Ratio) indexes of image. In the experiment of image denoising, the algorithm proposed is applied to remote sensing image denoising. The noise of image transmitted by sensor is suppressed and the edge information of image is well preserved. It shows that this method has certain practical value in wireless network constructed by photoelectric sensor.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Changes of Oases in the Hexi Corridor over the Past 30 Years
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the oases in the Hexi Corridor have gone through a tremendous transformation, which has caused a series of social and environmental problems. We aim to explore quantitatively the characteristics of the oasis expansion and their dynamic mechanism(s) in the Hexi Corridor, and their implications and impact on current and future policies. The spatial distribution pattern and dynamic changes experienced by the oases are examined using Landsat imagery. Their spatio-temporal changes are analyzed using the grid-transformed model and the dynamic-degree model. The model drivers are analyzed based on data from statistics yearbooks and field surveys. The total area of oases in the Hexi Corridor has expanded tremendously during the last 30 years from 10,709 km(2) to 14,950 km(2), almost 40% of the original value. Oasis evolution patterns of unchanged', expanding', shrinking', and oscillating' are observed at different periods in the three basins. In terms of area, almost half of the oases experienced some change, where most of the changes took place in the ecotone between oases and deserts, and the interior of oases due to the reclamation of abandoned land. Oasis expansion is mainly determined by the human instincts for survival and well-being, which are generally governed by population growth, agricultural policies and economic development. These changes reflect the need to find a balance in the relationship between ecological protection and increasing the well-being of local residents, because unreasonable or excessive development and utilization will cause damage to the local ecological environment.

TI  - Quantifying the Effects of Dramatic Changes in Runoff and Sediment on the Channel Morphology of a Large, Wandering River Using Remote Sensing Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River (Huanghe River), which is the second largest river in China, has experienced dramatic changes in both runoff and sediment over the last 60 years. To quantify the effects on the channel morphology of the wandering reach on the Lower Yellow River (LYR), this study extracts morphological indices from Landsat imageries taken between 1979 and 2015. Over the dynamically adjusting complex channel-floodplain system, the spatial distribution of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is found helpful for identifying the wandering belt created by the frequent migrations of the pathways of the main flow, which are determined from the reflection of the sediment-laded water body in remote sensing images taken at low flows. The extracted results show clearly that the average width and area of the wandering belt over the entire study reach declined in a dramatic fashion between 1979 and 2000 and yet both varied respectively within very narrow ranges from 2000 to 2015. Although the number of bends increased significantly since the 1990s, the sinuosity of the pathways of the main flow remained almost unchanged. By combining the morphological indices extracted from the remote sensing images with field hydrological and geomorphological measurements, our regression analysis identifies that the width of the wandering belt changes at the highest degree of correspondence with the width/depth ratio of the main channel and the variations of both are related most closely to the average flow discharge and then to sediment concentration during the flood seasons. These implicate that a significant reduction of the magnitude of floods and sediment concentration is beneficial not only for making the main channel transit from a wider and shallower cross-section into a narrower and deeper profile but also for narrowing the wandering range of the LYR.

TI  - A Spatiotemporal Contextual Model for Forest Fire Detection Using Himawari-8 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two of the main remote sensing data resources for forest fire detection have significant drawbacks: geostationary Earth Observation (EO) satellites have high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution, whereas Polar-orbiting systems have high spatial resolution but low temporal resolution. Therefore, the existing forest fire detection algorithms that are based on a single one of these two systems have only exploited temporal or spatial information independently. There are no approaches yet that have effectively merged spatial and temporal characteristics to detect forest fires. This paper fills this gap by presenting a spatiotemporal contextual model (STCM) that fully exploits geostationary data's spatial and temporal dimensions based on the data from Himawari-8 Satellite. We used an improved robust fitting algorithm to model each pixel's diurnal temperature cycles (DTC) in the middle and long infrared bands. For each pixel, a Kalman filter was used to blend the DTC to estimate the true background brightness temperature. Subsequently, we utilized the Otsu method to identify the fire after using an MVC (maximum value month composite of NDVI) threshold to test which areas have enough fuel to support such events. Finally, we used a continuous timeslot test to correct the fire detection results. The proposed algorithm was applied to four fire cases in East Asia and Australia in 2016. A comparison of detection results between MODIS Terra and Aqua active fire products (MOD14 and MYD14) demonstrated that the proposed algorithm from this paper effectively analyzed the spatiotemporal information contained in multi-temporal remotely sensed data. In addition, this new forest fire detection method can lead to higher detection accuracy than the traditional contextual and temporal algorithms. By developing algorithms that are based on AHI measurements to meet the requirement to detect forest fires promptly and accurately, this paper assists both emergency responders and the general public to mitigate the damage of forest fires.

TI  - Estimating monthly evapotranspiration by assimilating remotely sensed water storage data into the extended Budyko framework across different climatic regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimates of actual evapotranspiration (E) across basins and/or regions are still facing some difficulties because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land-plant-atmosphere system, even though the basic physical mechanism of E is well understood. Presenting as a nonlinear relationship constrained by physical limits, the Budyko framework serves as a powerful tool used to estimate the averaged E at long-term scale. Given the ability of Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) in effectively simulating the terrestrial water storage change (Delta TWS) at monthly scale, a model to estimate E was developed based on the Budyko framework with mean monthly parameter of multi-years, and was applied to the estimation of E for the 24 selected catchments in different climatic regions across China. Results indicate that for the majority of 24 catchments, the positive or negative trends in precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (E-0), runoff (R) and Delta TWS were not statistically significant during 2003-2013 at both annual and monthly scales, but the Delta TWS occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of P into R and E at monthly scale. The monthly Budyko parameter showed large variation within the year and also across these 24 catchments. The Budyko-modeled monthly E (Budyko-E) represented the GRACE-derived ones (GRACE-E) across these catchments well with both modeled E volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with GRACE-E series except some underestimation for peak E. Overall, the Budyko-E represented GRACE-E in the arid and semi-arid catchments comparatively better than it in the humid and semi-humid catchments due to the larger proportion of Delta TWS in the P partition. Among all the 24 selected catchments, the monthly Budyko-type E model represented the GRACE-E across Shixiali catchment (located in the Hai River basin) best, with the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSCE) and relative error (RE) between GRACE-E and simulated results being 0.996, 0.988, - 0.033 in calibration and 0.994, 0.951, - 0.111 in validation, respectively. Furthermore, using GRACE-E as the benchmark values, the Budyko-E outperformed four other global E products from the newly published Global Land Data Assimilation System with Noah Land Surface Model-2 (GLDAS_E), MODIS (MODIS_E), Japanese 25-year reanalysis product (JRA_E), and Zhang's method (Zhang_E). GLDAS_E was the best of four global E products at reproducing monthly variations, with relatively high r and NSCE values, small RE. While MODIS_E showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter-annual E variations of these catchments, which was reflected by low r and NSCE values. This extended Budyko-E model can apply in other similar climatic regions and also may provide skill in evaluating the water resources since the preferable accuracy of E estimate.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Glacier Changes in Geladandong Peak Region in the Central Tibetan Plateau
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, contour lines from the topographic maps at a 1:100,000 scale (mapped in 1968), Landsat MSS/TM/OLI images, ASTER images and SPOT 6-7 stereo image pairs were used to study changes in glacier length, area and surface elevation. We summarized the results using the following three conclusions: (1) During the period from 1973 to 2013, glaciers retreated by 412 +/- 32 m at a mean retraction rate of 10.3 +/- 0.8 myear(-1) and the relative retreat was 5.6 +/- 0.4%. The glacier area shrank by 7.5 +/- 3.4%, which was larger than the glacier length. In the periods of 1968-2000, 2000-2005 and 2000-2013, the glacier surface elevation change rates were -7.7 +/- 1.4 m (-0.24 +/- 0.04 myear(-1)), -1.9 +/- 1.5 m (-0.38 +/- 0.25 myear(-1)) and -5.0 +/- 1.4 m (-0.38 +/- 0.11 myear(-1)), respectively. The changes in the glacier area and thickness exhibited similar trends, both showing a significant increasing reduction after 2000. (2) Eleven glaciers were identified as surging glaciers. Changes of the mass balance in surging glaciers were stronger than in non-surging glaciers between 1968 and 2013. Changes of area in surging glaciers were weaker than in non-surging glaciers. (3) Increasing temperature was the major cause of glacier thickness reduction and area shrinkage. The increase in precipitation, to a certain extent, inhibited glacial ablation but it did not change the status of the shrinkage in the glacial area and the reduction in the glacier thickness.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The effect of spatial scale could not be ignored in identification results of forest types generated by multi-resolution images, and the influence of adding texture information from remote sensing data on the accuracy of forest trees species identification at different spatial resolutions has not been clearly addressed. To clarify this situation, we studied the Wangyedian forest farm in Northeast China, by using quasi-synchronous and geographical coordinate matched multi-resolution satellite observations (six spatial resolution levels: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 30 m) which were supported with GF-1 PMS (pan and multi-spectra sensor), GF-2 PMS, GF-1 WFV (wide field view) and Landsat-8 OLI (operational land imager) and could investigate any possible correlations between spatial resolution and the recognition result, besides the influence of adding texture information. Five dominant tree species were classified and identified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We also examined the identification results of the dominant forest trees species obtained by using the up-scaling algorithm. The results showed that overall classification accuracy of tree species was significantly influenced by the spatial resolution of images. The highest accuracy at the 4 m resolution, and the accuracy decreased to a minimum as the resolution reduced to 30 m. The addition of texture information increased classification accuracy using multispectral imagery with resolutions from 1 to 8 m, and the overall accuracy of dominant tree species identification created after adding texture information was 2.0%-3.6% higher than that from results of spectral information alone in the study area. However, the improvement of accuracy did not appear to hold for medium resolution imagery (16 and 30 m spatial resolution). In addition, there was a significant difference between the multi-scale classification results provided by up-scaled images and that obtained from native remote-sensing images for each spatial scale. These results indicated that the real satellite images should be used to ensure the accuracy of results when we examine multi-spatial-scale remote sensing observations or applications.
AB  - 当前,不同空间分辨率卫星影像对森林类型识别结果中普遍存在的尺度效应,而且纹理参量对不同尺度下树种识别精度的影响仍缺乏广泛认知.本研究以中国东北旺业甸林场为研究区,采用观测时相同步、地理坐标匹配的GF-1 PMS、GF-2 PMS、GF-1 WFV,以及Landsat-8 OLI卫星传感器数据组成空间尺度观测序列(1、2、4、8、16、30 m),并结合支持向量机(SVM)模型,探讨了区域内5种优势树种遥感识别结果的尺度变化规律及其纹理特征参数的影响,同时检验了基于尺度上推转换影像的树种识别结果差异.结果表明: 影像空间分辨率对区域树种识别结果具有显著影响,其中,研究区森林树种识别的最佳影像分辨率为4 m,当分辨率降低至30 m时,树种识别结果最差.在1～8 m影像分辨率范围内,增加纹理信息能够显著提高不同优势树种的识别精度,使总分类精度提升了2.0%～3.6%,但纹理信息对16～30 m影像的识别结果没有显著影响.与真实尺度卫星影像相比,基于升尺度转换影像的树种识别结果及其尺度响应特征存在显著差异,表明在面向多个空间尺度的遥感观测和应用研究中,需要采用真实分辨率影像以确保结果的准确性.

TI  - Influence of the geographic proximity of city features on the spatial variation of urban carbon sinks: A case study on the Pearl River Delta
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Locations of city features, e.g., city centers, roads, railways, and rivers, may impact urban carbon sinks. Therefore, the effects of city features on spatial variations of urban carbon sinks were investigated using geographic proximity data. The main results were as follows. (1) Carbon sink function varied in a complex manner with distance from the city center and with city size. The carbon sink per unit area increased with distance from the prefecture-level city center (0-30 km), with the dominant influence occurring within a 9 km radius. The lowest carbon sink per unit area was observed at a distance of 12 km from the city center of the provincial capital city (Guangzhou) and special economic zone (Shenzhen), which may be suburban industrial zones. (2) Carbon sinks decreased with increases in road grades as a result of the different functions and traffic flow, and carbon sinks were lowest near city express ways. For highways, carbon sinks were lower near highway entrances and exits. Carbon sinks around ordinary railways were higher than those around subways and light rail, but carbon sink characteristics grew more complex with increasing distances from subways and light rail. (3) Rivers were closely related to the urban layout. Grade I (i.e., larger) rivers were associated with lower carbon sinks, and carbon sink characteristics became increasingly complex around larger rivers. Within a 0-1000 m distance of all rivers, the carbon sink per unit area increased rapidly, but carbon sink characteristics differed slightly for grade I rivers. This study implies that it is important to take urbanization spatial position effects into account while assessing regional carbon sinks during urbanization and development.

TI  - Quantifying spatial-temporal changes of tea plantations in complex landscapes through integrative analyses of optical and microwave imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High demand for tea has driven the expansion of tea plantations in the tropical and subtropical regions over the past few decades. Tea plant cultivation promotes economic development and creates job opportunities, but tea plantation expansion has significant impacts on biodiversity, carbon and water cycles, and ecosystem services. Mapping the spatial distribution and extent of tea plantations in a timely fashion is crucial for land use management and policy making. In this study, we mapped tea plantation expansion in Menghai County, Yunnan Province, China. We analyzed the structure and features of major land cover types in this tropical and subtropical region using (1) the HH and HV gamma-naught imagery from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and (2) time series Landsat TM/ETM + /OLT imagery. Tea plantation maps for 2010 and 2015 were generated using the pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) approach at 30 m resolution, which had high user/producer accuracies of 83.58%/91.67% and 87.50%/90.83%, respectively. The resultant maps show that tea plantation area increased by 33.56% (similar to 9335 ha), from similar to 27,817 ha in 2010 to similar to 37,152 ha in 2015. The additional tea plantation area was mainly converted from forest (32.50%) and cropland (67.50%). The results showed that the combination of PALSAR and optical data performed better in tea plantation mapping than using optical data only. This study provides a promising new approach to identify and map tea plantations in complex tropical landscapes at high spatial resolution.

AB  - Absorbing aerosols like smoke heat the atmosphere by absorbing solar radiation, and such heating is enhanced when aerosols are above liquid clouds. To reduce uncertainty in estimates of the aerosol radiative forcing, it is desirable to characterize the size, index of refraction, optical depth, and altitude of smoke aerosols and underlying cloud droplets. While past work with remotely sensed multi-spectral data have made progress toward such characterization, it remains unclear if those radiatively important parameters can be fully and simultaneously retrieved from shortwave hyperspectral measurements. This issue is studied here first by examining the spectral fingerprints of above-cloud aerosols in the shortwave region (wavelength from 330 nm to 4000 nm) using hyperspectral radiative transfer simulations. These simulations are further explored to analyze the information content for hyperspectral inversion of aerosol and cloud optical depths as well as their microphysical properties over an ocean surface. The analysis shows that the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with limited spectral bands in the solar spectrum, has partial information required for retrieving the optical depth and the effective radius of smoke and cloud. In contrast, hyperspectral measurements have about 5 extra pieces of information (double the degrees of freedom for signals of MODIS), allowing for the retrieval of additional aerosol and cloud microphysical parameters, including the smoke layer height above cloud, the imaginary part of smoke refractive index, and partially the effective variance of cloud droplet size. Thus, hyperspectral measurements can provide valuable constraints on heating rate estimates of absorbing aerosols above clouds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tracking annual cropland changes from 1984 to 2016 using time-series Landsat images with a change-detection and post-classification approach: Experiments from three sites in Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring food security has been the top priority of many regions, particularly in developing countries in Africa. In recent decades, increasing population, together with growing food demands, have put great pressure on the world's food production. Long-term, up-to-date, annual cropland mapping at high resolution (i.e., at tens-of-metre levels) is in urgent demand for tracking spatial and temporal patterns of cropland change. However, because of the difficulty of capturing seasonality and flexible cropping systems, few studies have focused on understanding the dynamics of cropland using Landsat data in Africa. Here, we propose a new method of updating annual cropland mapping using a change-detection approach and post-classification to improve on traditional bi-temporal change vector analysis. Three Landsat footprints in Africa were selected (Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa) as our study areas based on their different cropping systems and field sizes. The potential annual change areas were detected by employing multiple indices and thresholds in reference and long-term annual composite Landsat images. Next, map updates were conducted in the potential change pixels using random forest-based classification. Different training sample metrics were used (seasonal and annual samples) and compared in the classification step. The long-term cropland mapping accuracies for these three sites ranged from 88.04% to 94.30% (Egypt), 76.28% to 82.88% (Ethiopia) and 56.52% to 67.53% (South Africa). The results showed improvements in the accuracy and consistency of updating the annual cropland information using change-detection approaches, accounting for accuracy increases of 2.40%, 10.62% and 0.55% compared with a yearly cropland mapping approach in our previous research. The best results using annual samples extracted from the same season with the classified images supported the use of annual and growing samples in long-term annual mapping. Overall, a common trend of cropland expansion in all three sites was revealed, with an increase rate of 10.06, 3.73 and 1.35 kha/year in Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa, respectively. The results indicated a rapid increasing pattern from bare land (desert) to irrigated systems (Egyptian site) but smaller and stable cropland changes in smallholder and farming-pastoral ecotones (Ethiopian and South African site), where limited land was still available for an expansion of agricultural area. This study highlights the potential application of time-series Landsat data in documenting and contributing missing cropland distribution information required for assessing and solving food security in Africa.

AB  - The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river are an important component of the Yangtze River Economic Zone that is a center of immense biological wealth, apart from its social and economic importance in China. As the main supply of water sources, a complete understanding of the change in the lake area is essential for the development of the Yangtze River Economic Zone. In this paper, we collected Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer medium resolution (500 m) data from 2000 to 2016 to examine the long-term variation of the four largest lakes in this area, Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, Taihu Lake, and Chaohu Lake. Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake have a relatively stable lake area. Because they are clearly affected by human activities, the inflow and outflow of water from these two lakes are almost the same. In contrast, Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake experience rapid and large short-term fluctuations in the water area. These two lakes with large drainage areas have high amounts of water flowing into and out of them. The area of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake showed a downward trend before 2010. However, we found the annual minimum area of the two lakes increased by 60.51 km(2)/year (Poyang Lake) and 51.64 km(2)/year (Dongting Lake) after 2010. The timely and propermonitoring in this study is of major significance for protecting these lakes.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Changes of Wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from the 1970s to 2010s
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) perform a dazzling array of vital ecological functions and are one of the most fragile ecosystems in the world. Timely and accurate information describing wetland resources and their changes over time is becoming more important in their protection and conservation. By using remote sensing data, this study intended to investigate spatial distribution and temporal variations of wetlands on the QTP at different watershed scales from 1970s to 2010s. Results show that wetlands on the QTP have undergone widespread degradation from 1970s to 2010s, with nearly 6.4% of their area being lost. Areas of freshwater marsh, salt marsh and wet meadow declined by 46.6%, 53.9% and 15.6%, respectively, while lake area increased by 14.6%. The most extensive losses of natural wetlands have occurred in endorheic basins, such as in the Kunlun-Altun-Qilian Drainage Basin and Qiangtang Basin, which shrank by 44.5% and 33.1%, respectively. A pronounced increase in temperature tends to facilitate the evaporation process and reduce water availability for wetlands. One-third of the wetlands on the QTP are under threat of being submerged due to lakes rising in recent years. More research is needed to gain insight into the interaction mechanisms behind observed variations and potential impacts from further warming in the future.

TI  - Decomposition analysis of corporate carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions in Japan: Integrating corporate environmental and financial performances
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent empirical studies often support the positive relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and corporate financial performance (CFP). However, this depends on the measurements of CEP (the absolute and relative CEP) and CFP (accounting-based and market-based CFP). To understand the relationship structurally, based on the literature, this study proposes identity models that integrate CO2 and GHG emissions and financial factors. The models decompose CO2 (GHG) emissions into carbon intensity (GHG intensity), energy intensity, the cost-to-sales ratio, the total-assets-turnover ratio (TATR), leverage, and equity. The model of supply-chain GHG emissions additionally adopts supply-chain GHG intensity. As a decomposition method, this study uses the log-mean Divisia index. As an application example of the CO2 model, this study targets Japanese manufacturing firms in 16 sectors from fiscal years (FY) 2011 to 2015. Results show that the change in CO2 emissions as of 2015 (-802.1 kilotonnes [kt]) is decomposed into 2922.5 kt for carbon intensity, -26036.3 kt for energy intensity, -6350.5 kt for the cost-to-sales ratio, -8495.6 kt for the TATR, -7912.3 kt for leverage, and 45070.1 kt for equity. Average values of relative contribution ratios are 20.6% for carbon intensity, 19.1% for energy intensity, and the remaining approximately 60% for financial factors. Among the 16 sectors, as of 2015, the change in total CO2 emission is statistically significantly positive for equity and significantly negative for the TATR and leverage.

TI  - Prognostic outcome and complications of sentinel lymph node navigation surgery for early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTo evaluate the prognostic outcome and surgical complications in patients with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) for hysterectomy or trachelectomy.MethodsA total of 139 patients who underwent SNNS using Tc-99m phytate between 2009 and 2015 were evaluated. No further lymph node dissection was performed when intraoperative analysis of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was negative for metastasis. We compared the surgical complications between the SNNS group and 67 matched patients who underwent pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) after SLN mapping between 2003 and 2008. We also examined the clinical outcomes in the SNNS group.ResultsThe mean number of detected SLNs was 2.5 per patient. Fourteen of the 139 patients in the SNNS group underwent PLND based on the intraoperative SLN results. The amount of blood loss, the operative time, and the number of perioperative complications were significantly less in the SNNS group than in the matched PLND group. There was no recurrence during a follow-up period ranging from 2 to 88months (median 40months) in the SNNS group.ConclusionsUsing SNNS for early-stage cervical cancer is safe and effective and does not increase the recurrence rate. A future multicenter trial is warranted.

TI  - The Accuracy of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Clinically Node Positive Breast Cancer Patients: A Single Institution Experience
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is of questionable accuracy.Objectives: In this study, accuracy and feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with breast cancer presented with clinically positive axillary nodes were evaluated.Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study on patients with breast cancer treated at Milad Hospital of Tehran, Iran from June 2014 to February 2015. Clinically node positive patients (proven by biopsy), who became clinically node-negative by ultrasonography and physical examination following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had been dissected up to 3 lymph nodes according to sentinel lymph node pattern, were included in the study. We used a 2 x 2 contingency table to analyze the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (sensitivity, specificity, false negative ratio, and accuracy). STATA statistical software (version 13.0, StataCorp LP, Texas, USA) was used for statistical analysis.Results: Among 52 patients, who entered the study, 47 patients had been dissected up to 3 lymph nodes according to sentinel lymph node pattern. We achieved a sensitivity of 100% (16/16), false-negativerate of 0% (0/21), a negative predictive value of 100% (26/26), and an overall accuracy of 89.4%.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node dissection seems to be feasible and accurate in clinically lymph node positive patients with breast cancer, who achieve a clinically negative node status by ultrasonography and physical examination, following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - An analysis of the developmental differences in Borneo's Southeastern and Northwestern Coastal Zones
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, Landsat TM images were used to extract the land use information for Borneo's coastal zones (0 to 35km) during three time periods (1990, 2000, and 2010). Then, in combination with the DEM and shoreline types, the developmental differences under the influences of the geographical boundaries of the Borneo coastal zones were examined from such perspectives as the spatial distribution characteristics of the land development, sea-land gradient variation characteristics, and comparative analyses of the different regions. The results indicated that the geographic boundaries, as well as the different countries, had great influences on the development of the coastal zones. The regions with the most active development in Borneo's coastal zones were mainly located in the estuary bay, onshore with land on both sides, and the near-shore alluvial plain with DEM<50m. The northwestern coast zone showed relatively flat topography, and was close to an important international waterway. Therefore, the development in this area was found to be more intense than in the southeastern coastal zone, and which was characterized by a long developmental history. On one side of the geographical boundary, the development was also found to differ among the different countries. Malaysia was observed to be dominated by industrial plantations. Meanwhile, the industrial plantations, agriculture, and aquaculture in Indonesia were significantly increased, which was closely linked with the national economic policies. Furthermore, the development of Borneo's coastal zones has led to vegetation degradation towards a constant inland development, plantation enlargements, agricultural development, and cleared and burnt areas, which have resulted in the land use transfer of 22,000km(2) of forest land within the 0 to 35km range.

TI  - Axillary Management in Breast Cancer Patients: A Comprehensive Review of the Key Trials
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Optimal regional management in breast cancer patients has yet to be established. In patients who are clinically node-negative, but sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)-positive, the treatment paradigm has shifted toward the deescalation of further axillary management. In patients with 2 or fewer positive sentinel nodes, the standard of practice has shifted away from complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as a result of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial. The role of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) to the axilla, supraclavicular and internal mammary regions has also been investigated in the setting of positive SLNB in trials such as the MA20 and EORTC 22922. Having shown evidence of benefit in locoregional control, efforts are now focused on comparing ALND with RNI in patients with limited nodal disease. Results of early trials such as AMAROS suggest noninferiority of radiotherapy. In patients with node-positive or locally advanced disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is often used to downsize or downstage the disease. The utility of SLNB after NAC has been investigated, with discordant results reported from a number of trials. Current trials in progress seek to validate the noninferiority of RNI compared with ALND in patients with limited nodal disease, or in some trials, the complete omission of further axillary management. There is a global paradigm shift toward deescalation of axillary management on the basis of recent evidence suggesting lack of benefit from overaggressive treatment. In this review we aim to summarize the seminal trials addressing regional management in breast cancer to illustrate this fact. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - An insight into the surface velocity of Inylchek Glacier and its effect on Lake Merzbacher during 2006-2016 with Landsat time-series imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain glacier is one of the extremely sensitive indicators for climate change, and its surface motion distribution and corresponding variation are valuable information for understanding ice mass exchange and glacier dynamics. This paper presents the long-term ice velocity distributions of Inylchek Glacier in the Tianshan region by pixel-tracking algorithm with time-series Landsat imagery acquired during 2006-2016. Then the monitored ice motion fields of Inylchek Glacier were carefully analyzed and revealed a generally similar spatial distribution characteristic. Most of the ice of the North Inylchek Glacier remains in a stagnant state except for the upstream part, but a relatively high velocity of 20-40 cm/day with an RMSE of 3 cm/day was observed on most part of the South Inylchek Glacier, except for the slow-moving glacier terminus. We also state the glacier dynamics around Lake Merzbacher and their possible effect on its glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) risk. Besides, the surface velocity distribution on South Inylchek Glacier surface during the ablation period from 2014 to 2016 was also established and also compared with annual velocity. The corresponding difference yields that there is a positive relation between ice motion and temperature variation. Therefore, the time-series ice surface motion yielded by the Landsat imagery thus could provide us an efficient and low-cost way to analyze the current state and changes in glaciers, thanks to the continuous and regular spaceborne observations provided by the Landsat satellites.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sigma naught (sigma(0)) equation is essential to calculate geo-physical properties from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for the applications such as ground target identification, surface classification, sea wind speed calculation, and soil moisture estimation. In this paper, we are suggesting new Kompsat-5 (K5) Radar Cross Section (RCS) and sigma(0) equations reflecting the final SAR processor update and absolute radiometric calibration in order to increase the application of K5 SAR images. Firstly, we analyzed the accuracy of the K5 RCS equation by using trihedral corner reflectors installed in the Kompsat calibration site in Mongolia. The average difference between the calculated values using RCS equation and the measured values with K5 SAR processor was about 0.2 dBm(2) for Spotlight and Stripmap imaging modes. In addition, the verification of the K5 sigma(0) equation was carried out using the TerraSAR-X (TSX) and Sentinel-1A (S-1A) SAR images over Amazon rainforest, where the backscattering characteristics are not significantly affected by the seasonal change. The calculated s0 difference between K5 and TSX/S-1A was less than 0.6 dB. Considering the K5 absolute radiometric accuracy requirement, which is 2.0 dB (1 sigma), the average difference of 0.2 dBm(2) for RCS equation and the maximum difference of 0.6 dB for sigma(0) equation show that the accuracies of the suggested equations are relatively high. In the future, the validity of the suggested RCS and sigma(0) equations is expected to be verified through the application such as sea wind speed calculation, where quantitative analysis is possible.

TI  - Investigation of the Effect of Spectral Fitting Windows on the SO<sub>2</sub> Retrieval Based on the Radiance Simulation Using Principle Component Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to quantify the SO2 retrieval error induced by the spectral fitting windows, we, for the first time, carried out the retrieval of high level SO2 emitted from volcanic site based on the synthetic hyperspectral radiances and Principle component analysis (PCA). Multiple spectral windows with various centers of wavelengths have been used to investigate the optimized spectral fitting window for the PCA method. Synthetic radiances were generated using the radiative transfer model with the inputs of the column information of SO2 and O-3 as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from the real OMI measurements. The slant column retrieval errors tend to decrease with increasing the interval of spectral fitting windows from 10 to 20 nm due to the effects of various effective absorption light path lengths. The relationship between central wavelengths and retrieval errors is found to be negligible compared to the effect of the spectral fitting window length. It is revealed that the spectral fitting range from 325 to 337 nm is optimal for the slant column density (SCD) retrieval of high level SO2 using the PCA method. The SCD retrieval error is found to be 18% in the optimal fitting range from 325 to 337 nm, which is lower than 22% to 31% found in other spectral fitting windows. When the optimal fitting range is used, the linear regression between true SO2 SCD and those retrieved shows the correlation coefficient of 1.00 and the slope of 0.97. The optimal spectral fitting range, found in this present study, is expected to be useful for the high SO2 SCD retrieval, especially, from the many volcanic sites using the recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) as well as other future GEO sensors such as Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), Sentinel-4, and Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO).

TI  - A new generation of the United States National Land Cover Database: Requirements, research priorities, design, and implementation strategies
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released four National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation's land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation's land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2-3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping.

TI  - A Review of Ice Cloud Optical Property Models for Passive Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Review
AB  - The current wealth of spaceborne passive and active measurements from ultraviolet to the infrared wavelengths provides an unprecedented opportunity to construct ice cloud bulk optical property models that lead to consistent ice cloud property retrievals across multiple sensors and platforms. To infer the microphysical and radiative properties of ice clouds from these satellite measurements, the general approach is to assume an ice cloud optical property model that implicitly assumes the habit (shape) and size distributions of the ice particles in these clouds. The assumption is that this ice optical property model will be adequate for global retrievals. In this review paper, we first summarize the key optical properties of individual particles and then the bulk radiative properties of their ensemble, followed by a review of the ice cloud models developed for application to satellite remote sensing. We illustrate that the random orientation condition assumed for ice particles is arguably justified for passive remote sensing applications based on radiometric measurements. The focus of the present discussion is on the ice models used by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) science teams. In addition, we briefly review the ice cloud models adopted by the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) and the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) for ice cloud retrievals. We find that both the MODIS Collection 6 ice model and the CERES two-habit model result in spectrally consistent retrievals.

TI  - An Assessment of Snow Cover Duration Variability Among Three Basins of Songhua River in Northeast China Using Binary Decision Tree
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of snow cover differs greatly from basin to basin in the Songhua River of Northeast China, which is attributable to the differences in the topographic shift as well as changes in the vegetation and climate since the hydrological year (HY) 2003. Daily and flexible multi-day combinations from the HY 2003 to 2014 were produced using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from Terra and Aqua remote sensing satellites for the snow cover products in the three basins including the Nenjiang River Basin (NJ), Downstream Songhua River Basin (SD) and Upstream Songhua River Basin (SU). Snow cover duration (SCD) was derived from flexible multiday combination each year. The results showed that SCD was significantly associated with elevation, and higher SCD values were found out in the mountainous areas. Further, the average SCDs of NJ, SU and SD basins were 69.43, 98.14 and 88.84 d with an annual growth of 1.36, 2.04 and 2.71 d, respectively. Binary decision tree was used to analyze the nonlinear relationships between SCD and six impact factors, which were successfully applied to simulate the spatial distribution of depth and water equivalent of snow. The impact factors included three topographic factors (elevation, aspect and slope), two climatic factors (precipitation and air temperature) and one vegetation index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI). By treating yearly SCD values as dependent variables and six climatic factors as independent variables, six binary decision trees were built through the combination classification and regression tree (CART) with and without the consideration of climate effect. The results from the model show that elevation, precipitation and air temperature are the three most influential factors, among which air temperature is the most important and ranks first in two of the three studied basins. It is suggested that SCD in the mountainous areas might be more sensitive to climate warming, since precipitation and air temperature are the major factors controlling the persistence of snow cover in the mountainous areas.

TI  - Location awareness method for spot beam emitters
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As more and more spacecraft launched into the space, the probability of radiofrequency (RF) interference raises and the burden of RF spectrum management increases as well. The monitoring of global RF beam information and identifying of spot beam emitters location can effectively obtain space data resources, which will do great help for mitigating global RF interference and optimising space spectrum resources. This study proposes a novel location awareness method for spot beam emitters based on the nanosatellite platform. The proposed method identifies the position of spot beam emitters on a global scale by flying a low earth orbit CubeSat constellation through the coverage of the spot beams. The properties such as geometry, the target motion equation, the measurement process, and the Particle Filter equations are all addressed with respect to the location methods. The authors illustrate a realistic scenario simulated within the Systems Tool Kit, in which CubeSats receive signals from the spot beam emitters. The scenario shows that their location awareness method proposed in this study is available and efficient.

AB  - Therapy-related leukemia(TRL)is a distinctive clinical syndrome that occurs after exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We report a case of suspected TRLafter chemotherapy in a patient with breast cancer. A 61-year-old woman underwent total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy(negative)for her breast cancer. Histopathologic analysis showed invasive ductal carcinoma, pStage I. Her subtype histology was Luminal B-type, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy were administered. Four years after chemotherapy, a blood examination showed pancytopenia. Bone marrow examination showed acute promyelocytic leukemia. She was treated with chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. Breast cancer provides long-term survival after treatment. Attention should be paid to the occurrence of TRLin breast cancer surveillance.

TI  - Numerical Mapping and Modeling Permafrost Thermal Dynamics across the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor, China Integrated with Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost thermal conditions across the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor (QTEC) is of growing interest due to infrastructure development. Most modeling of the permafrost thermal regime has been conducted at coarser spatial resolution, which is not suitable for engineering construction in a warming climate. Here we model the spatial permafrost thermal dynamics across the QTEC from the 2010 to the 2060 using the ground thermal model. Soil properties are defined based on field measurements and ecosystem types. The climate forcing datasets are synthesized from MODIS-LST products and the reanalysis product of near-surface air temperature. The climate projections are based on long-term observations of air temperature across the QTEC. The comparison of model results to field measurements demonstrates a satisfactory agreement for the purpose of permafrost thermal modeling. The results indicate a discontinuous permafrost distribution in the QTEC. Mean annual ground temperatures (MAGT) are lowest (<-2.0 degrees C) for the high mountains. In most upland plains, MAGTs range from -2.0 degrees C to 0 degrees C. For high mountains, the average active-layer thickness (ALT) is less than 2.0 m, while the river valley features ALT of more than 4.0 m. For upland plains, the modeled ALTs generally range from 3.0 m to 4.0 m. The simulated results for the future 50 years suggest that 12.0%similar to 20.2% of the permafrost region will be involved in degradation, with an MAGT increase of 0.4 degrees C similar to 2.3 degrees C, and the ALT increasing by 0.4 m similar to 7.3 m. The results of this study are useful for the infrastructure development, although there are still several improvements in detailed forcing datasets and a locally realistic model.

T2  - SPATIAL STATISTICS

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 4th International Conference on Spatial Statistics - One World - One Health
CL  - Lancaster Univ, Lancaster, ENGLAND
AB  - Aflatoxin is a carcinogenic toxin to humans and animals produced by mold fungi in staple crops. Surveys of Aflatoxin are expensive, and the results are usually not available for implementing within season mitigation strategies. Identification of high and low risk areas and years is essential to reduce the number of samples analyzed for Aflatoxin concentration. Previously a risk factors approach was developed to determine county level Aflatoxin contamination risk in southern Georgia, but Aflatoxin concentrations and risk factor data were not analyzed simultaneously and all risk factors had equal weight which is unrealistic. In the current paper we propose a regression approach to overcome these problems. Spatial Poisson profile regression identified clusters of counties which have similar Aflatoxin risk and risk factor profiles, whilst explicitly taking into account multicollinearity in the risk factor data and spatial autocorrelation in the Aflatoxin data. This approach allows examination of the utility of different highly correlated variables including remotely sensed data that could give information at the sub-county level. The results identify plausible clusters compared to previous work but also give the relative importance of the risk factors associated with those clusters. The approach also helps show that some factors like well-drained soil behave differently from expectations and irrigation data is not useful. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development of a Storage Level and Capacity Monitoring and Forecasting Techniques in Yongdam Dam Basin Using High Resolution Satellite Image
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a real-time storage level and capacity monitoring and forecasting system for Yongdam Dam watershed was developed using high resolution satellite image. The drought indices such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) from satellite data were used for storage level monitoring in case of drought. Moreover, to predict storage volume we used a statistical method based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). According to this study, correlation coefficient between storage level and SPI (3) was highly calculated with CC=0.78, and the monitoring and predictability of storage level was diagnosed using the drought index calculated from satellite data. As a result of analysis of principal component analysis by SSA, correlation between SPI (3) and each Reconstructed Components (RCs) data were highly correlated with CC=0.87 to 0.99. And also, the correlations of RC data with Normalized Water Surface Level (N-W. S.L.) were confirmed that has highly correlated with CC=0.83 to 0.97. In terms of high resolution satellite image we developed a water detection algorithm by applying an exponential method to monitor the change of storage level by using Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensor of Sentinel-2 satellite. The materials of satellite image for water surface area detection in Yongdam dam watershed was considered from 2016 to 2018, respectively. Based on this, we proposed the possibility of real-time drought monitoring system using high resolution water surface area detection by Sentinel-2 satellite image. The results of this study can be applied to estimate of the reservoir volume calculated from various satellite observations, which can be used for monitoring and estimating hydrological droughts in an unmeasured area.

TI  - Snow cover variability at Polar Bear Pass, Nunavut
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on arctic snow covers is relevant for climate and hydrology studies and investigations into the sustainability of both arctic fauna and flora. This study aims to (1) highlight the variability of snow cover at Polar Bear Pass (PBP) at a range of scales: point, local, and regional using both in situ snow cover measurements and remote sensing imagery products; and (2) consider how snow cover at PBP might change in the future. Terrain-based snow surveys documented the end-of-winter snowpacks over several seasons (2008-2010, 2012-2013), and snowmelt was measured daily at typical terrain types. MODIS products (snow cover) were used to document spatial snow cover variability across PBP and Bathurst and Cornwallis Islands. Due to limited data, no significant difference in snow cover duration can be identified at PBP over the period of record. Locally, end-of-winter snow cover does vary across a range of terrain types with snow depths and densities reflecting polar oasis sites. Aspect remains a defining factor in terms of snow cover variability at PBP. Northern areas of the Pass melt earlier. Regionally, PBP tends to melt out earlier than most of Bathurst Island. In the future, we surmise that snowpacks at PBP will be thinner and disappear earlier.

TI  - Quantification of impact of changes in land use-land cover on hydrology in the upper Indus Basin, Pakistan
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirically based lumped hydrologic models have an extensive track record of use for various watershed managements and flood related studies. This study focuses on the impacts of land use land cover change for a 10 year period (2000-2010) on the stream discharge in a sub-watershed of Indus River using lumped model HEC-HMS. The input variables for model building in HEC-HMS were calculated based on the DEM, LULC, soil and precipitation data which was collected and pre-processed in HEC-GeoHMS. The model was calibrated for the year 2000 and validation was done for 2010. The statistics shows correlation coefficient = 0.96, relative Bias = -9% and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE) = 0.87. The validation statistics are Correlation Coefficient = 0.95, Bias = -14% and NSCE = 0.91. The model results shows that LULC change analysis using Landsat images in 10 years the overall concussion of change on discharge has been negligible in the study area. Due to decrease in forest the percent of bare soil and built up area increases. This conclusion was further supported by the LULC change analysis conducted on a local scale metropolitan district of Mansehra (16 km(2)). Soil and built up area in this sub-watershed increased from 69%, 8.2% in 2000 to 78%, 13.76% in 2010 respectively, whereas the corresponding river discharge increased by 33.61% from year 2000-2010, proving strong positive correlation on a local scale between the LULC and the river discharge.

TI  - Comparative Study on Changes of Croplands Between North Korea and South Korea During 1990-2015
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on long-term change of cropland is of great significance to the utilization of land resources and the implementation of scientific agricultural policies. The Korean Peninsula, adjacent to China, plays an important role in the international environment of Northeast Asia. The Korean Peninsula includes South Korea and North Koreatwo countries that have a great difference in their institutions and economic developments. Therefore, we aim to quantify the spatiotemporal changes of croplands in these two countries using Landsat Thematic Imager (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery, and to compare the differences of cropland changes between the two countries. This paper take full advantage of ODM approach (object-oriented segmentation and decision-tree classification based on multi-season imageries) to obtain the distribution of croplands in 1990 and 2015. Results showed that the overall classification accuracy of cropland data is 91.10% in 1990 and 92.52% in 2015. The croplands were mainly distributed in areas with slopes that were less than 8 degrees and with elevations that were less than 300 m in the Korean Peninsula. However, in other region (slope > 8 degrees or elevation > 300 m), the area and proportion of North Korea's croplands were significantly higher than that of South Korea. Croplands significantly increased by 15.02% in North Korea from 1990 to 2015. In contrast, croplands in South Korea slightly decreased by 1.32%. During the 25 years, policy shift, economic development, population growth, and urban sprawl played primary roles for cropland changes. Additionally, the regional differences of cropland changes were mainly due to different agriculture policies implemented by different countries. The achievements of this study can provide scientific guidance for the protection and sustainability of land resources.

TI  - Foliar optical traits indicate that sealed planting conditions negatively affect urban tree health
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees play a key role in mitigating environmental problems in cities, but they often face harsh environmental conditions as they generally grow in sealed soils that have small rooting space and low water availability. In this context, rapid monitoring and assessment of tree health status is critical to maintain urban trees and secure the provisioning of urban ecosystem services. Across three European cities we selected 187 Tilia tomentosa trees growing under following planting conditions: (i) sealed, trees planted in small soil pits or strips surrounded by highly sealed surfaces (concrete, pavement or asphalt); and (ii) unsealed, trees planted in roomy soil surfaces (e.g. parks). We measured leaf reflectance and fluorescence and derived a set of optical traits from the measurements. We examined whether these non-destructively measured optical traits differ between planting conditions and whether they correlate with leaf functional traits, e.g. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf water content (LWC) and leaf water per area (LWA). Compared to the unsealed trees, sealed trees showed decreased SLA and LWC while increased LWA. Leaf optical traits differed between the unsealed and sealed trees. Highly sealed soils accelerated leaf senescence of the sealed trees compared to the unsealed trees, embodied in the temporal trend of optical traits. Sealed planting conditions negatively affect urban tree health status and phenology. These negative effects can be estimated by leaf optical traits, demonstrating the great potential of optical traits in assessing tree health status. Our findings provide insights into facilitating urban green management using optical traits and remote sensing data.

TI  - Assessment of longwave radiative effect of nighttime cirrus based on CloudSat and CALIPSO measurements and single-column radiative transfer simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Cirrus clouds strongly influence weather and climate processes due to their effects on the radiative balance of the Earth-atmosphere system. In this work, longwave radiative forcing of nighttime cirrus was studied at grid-cell scales covering the regions between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N. The measurements of CloudSat and CALIPSO were used to obtain the occurrence frequencies of cirrus clouds with different optical thickness, and then the SBDART radiative transfer model was employed to compute the radiative forcing. For the study region, the occurrence frequencies at night time for subvisual (tau <= 0.03), thin (0.03 <= tau < 0.3), opaque (0.3 <= tau < 3), and thick (tau > 3) cirrus types are found to be 7.43%, 9.83%, 8.62%, and 1%; the average occurrence frequency can reach similar to 26.89%. Moreover, the mean effective radii are similar to 22.87, 19.23, 19.82, 27.6 and 39.18 mu m corresponding to total, subvisual, thin, opaque and thick cirrus clouds. We found that average longwave (4-50 mu m) radiative effect (LWRE) for nighttime cirrus clouds is similar to 17.38W.m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and similar to 1.14W.m(-2) at the Earth surface. Finally, the LWRF of opaque cirrus is identified to be the largest contribution to the warming effects at nighttime (similar to 7.76W.m(-2) at the TOA, 0.68W.m(-2) at the surface), primarily due to their high fractions and optical thickness, appearing simultaneously. These findings provide valuable references to understanding the role of nighttime cirrus in regulating the radiation field. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing effects of urban vegetation height on land surface temperature in the City of Tampa, Florida, USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation can mitigate urban heat island (UHI) due to its ability to regulate temperature by directly or indirectly influencing water vapor transport, shading effect, and wind speed and direction. Mechanisms of effects of vegetation cover on land surface temperature (LST) have been extensively documented. Few studies, however, have examined the role of vegetation height in controlling LST. In this study, we examined the relationship between LST and vegetation height by using Light Detection and Range (LiDAR) data from the city of Tampa, Florida, USA. The results revealed that vegetation height has significant impact on LST. Additionally, we also identified the optimal height and fractional cover at which vegetation can exert the greatest influence on LST. In particular, we found that the maximum cooling effect of vegetation can only be achieved when vegetation cover is above 93.33%, an amount of which is nearly impossible to have in most of the cities. On the other hand, LST decreases at an increasing rate with vegetation height, and is optimized at 20 m. This shows that vegetation height can play an important role in regulating UHI in contributing to effect maximization with least cover possible in a city. Findings derived from this study could provide urban planners with critical insights on precise and efficient urban vegetation management in the purpose of UHI mitigation.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we describe the application of differential radar interferometry for monitoring landslide slopes in the Sochi region under conditions of strong temporal decorrelation of the reflected signals from the underlying surface in images of the TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar. Measurements of the movement of the landslide surface became possible due to the use of steadily reflecting objects, e.g., specially designed trihedral corner reflectors with square plates having cut-off external corners. Radiophysical properties of the corners and the criteria for choosing their size and geometry are described in detail. The sensitivity of the position of the phase center of the signal scattered by a corner reflector to undesirable atmospheric phenomena (precipitation occurring inside the corner) is mentioned and substantiated. Based on an analysis of the results of processing four TerraSAR-X images, we show the possibility of measurements with millimeter accuracy in the X-band of the surface displacements of the observed landslide slope with the corner reflectors installed on its surface.

T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: One of the major problems of lymphoscintigraphy is the time of patient presence in the nuclear medicine wards. The operating room schedule can be compromised if the patients stay longer than usual in the nuclear medicine departments. However, too early imaging can be falsely negative for sentinel node visualization and delayed imaging may be required. The aim of the current study is to determine a time beyond which lymphoscintigraphy imaging does not yield more information and imaging can be terminated.Methods: One hundred and fifty women with proven clinically axillary node negative breast cancer entered the study For each patient 0.5 mCi Tc-99m phytate in the 0.2 cc volume was intradermally injected in periareolar region to raise a wheal. Lymphoscintigraphy imaging was done in the following time intervals: 5, 10, 30, 45, 60, 90 minutes post injection. In case of sentinel node visualization at any time, the imaging was terminated.Results: Sentinel nodes were first detected on 5, 10, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minute images in 31 (20.6%), 45 (30%), 46 (30.6%), 15 (10%), 1 (0.6%), and 0 patients. Median number of the detected sentinel nodes per patient was 1. At least one hot sentinel node could be identified in all 138 patients with observed sentinel nodes of whom, 45 had pathologically involved sentinel nodes and axillary lymph node dissection was done. In 12 patients, no sentinel node was visualized even on the 90 minute images. All of these patients had axillary node involvement and no sentinel node could be harvested intra-operatively either.Conclusion: Considering the rather slow movement of Tc-99m phytate in the lymphatic system, lymphoscintigraphy imaging of the breast cancer patients should be continued for 45 minutes in case of sentinel node detection failure. On the other hand imaging beyond 45 minutes does not seem to be necessary as the diagnostic yield is very low.

TI  - TO THE QUESTION OF CATEGORIZATION OF THE TERMINOLOGY OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS (ON THE BASIS OF ENGLISH TERMINOLOGY)
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the analysis of emergency situations terminology as a complex terminological system based on the representation of linguistic categories. This vocabulary can be referred to the newest terminologies that appeared at the bound of the 20th-21st centuries. Its appearance was influenced by various socio-linguistic factors. The first of them is the complexity and diversity of geographical landscape, the second is the high level of industrial development of the states, and the third is the need for emergency response with various civil protection forces and means. By now this institution has worked out its own language of description and its own terminology fixed in glossaries and dictionaries. The author highlights four aspects of the vocabulary of emergency situations: its specificity in terms of disciplinary categorization; the question of the origin of special language units; terms of emergency situations from the standpoint of systemic relations in the language; features of the form of special signs. Categorization of emergency situations terminology is based on disciplinary categories that reflect a special "network", a special worldview through the lens of abnormality, crisis, extraordinary event. Emergency situations vocabulary is formed mainly on the base of literary language units or borrowed terms that gain specific gender differences and narrow their semantics to the frame of this particular professional field. Emergency situations vocabulary is represented by forming its nucleus key terms as well as by peripheral linguistic units. Regarding the sources of emergency situations vocabulary, a corpus of national terminology and terms of Greek and Latin origin should be mentioned. Taking into account the complexity of syntactic structure of most terms concerning the form, we can emphasize the importance of abbreviation in representation of emergency situations lexical units. From a systemic standpoint, these terms are in different linguistic relations of polysemy and variation.

TI  - Abu Al-Hasan Al-Ash 'ari's Theological Method and Its Relevancy to Contemporary Philosophical Challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research focuses on Abu al-Hasan al-Ash 'ari's legacy and how to reconstruct it in order to provide an Islamic response to the contemporary philosophical challenges. It should be noted that these challenges are based on a type of metaphysics and axiology which completely opposed to the Islamic ones. Undoubtedly, the method of reconstruction will be based upon both rational stand and systematic procedures in its approach to the legacy of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash 'ari. By doing so, we will be able to come up with a re-reading of that legacy which is consistent and meaningful in its answers to the contemporary philosophical challenges. Obviously Kalam is the discipline within Islamic sciences that furnishes us with the Islamic worldview and its valuational system. It is because the basis of the disagreement between Islam and the contemporary philosophical trends is, essentially, about these two issues. Evidently, it will not include rational or scientific issues but rather will be confined to metaphysical and axiological problems. However, these disagreements are both old and new but their sources are the same fundamental convictions that differentiate Islam from other doctrines. Clearly, then, for the re-reading method the more it opens new horizons for understanding the contemporary philosophical challenges the better it will assist us to reconstruct meaningful alternatives to the contemporary metaphysical and valuational systems.

TI  - Blind Spot of Spectrum Awareness Techniques in Non-geostationary Satellite Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectrum awareness techniques have been proposed as a promising solution to improve the utilization of available spectrum bands. However, few works have discussed the feasibility of spectrum awareness techniques in satellite systems. In the scenario of spectrum coexistence between geostationary (GEO) and nongeostationary (NGEO) satellite systems, this paper investigates the issue of blind spot where the spectrum awareness techniques may fail to identify the spectrum holes. Both the uplink and downlink transmissions are analyzed and three key parameters, i.e., altitude of NGEO satellite and antenna diameters of NGEO and GEO earth stations, are considered. Simulation results show that in the uplink, when the NGEO satellite approaches to the GEO satellite with a certain heights, there exists the situation of blind spot. In addition, this paper also provides a specific method to eliminate or reduce the range of blind spot.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability of grassland yield and its response to climate change and anthropogenic activities on the Tibetan Plateau from 1988 to 2013
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and periodic assessment of grassland yield (GY) is of great importance for the management of high altitude plateau grasslands. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a very important pastoral area that provides a microcosm of typical alpine grassland ecosystems. Based on remote sensing data, meteorological datasets and observational plant biomass data, we used the Global Production Efficiency Model and Soil and Atmosphere Model (GLOPEMCEVSA) to estimate GY and its response to climate change and anthropogenic activities on the TP from 1988 to 2013. We quantitatively analyzed spatiotemporal dynamic changes of GY for four geomorphological divisions and five main grassland types. For the 26 years of the study, average annual total GY was 515.8 kg/ha/yr and gradually decreased from the southeast to the northwest of the TP. Annual GY fluctuated from year to year but had an overall positive trend (4.2 kg/ha/yr). Spatiotemporal variation of GY was greatly influenced by spatial heterogeneity. For the total area, the proportion showing a significant increase in GY was 45.2%, while only 12.6% showed a significant decrease. For the main grassland types, GY of Alpine Meadow was highest and had the highest slope of increase. The pattern of decrease of GY from the southeast to the northwest was predominantly related to climate gradients. Regional correlation analysis indicated that warming temperature promoted positive increase of GY for almost all the region. Annual precipitation was related to a less significant decreasing trend of GY over all the TP apart from an increase of GY in the middle area of the north. The grazing pressure index decreased over the years by control of livestock numbers, the reduction of grazing pressure assisting restoration of alpine grasslands. However, grazing pressure on the TP in 2013 remained too high and overloaded. Nevertheless, grassland protection and restoration projects have mitigated grassland degradation in some areas, promoted grassland restoration, and increased incomes of herdsmen. The study indicates that continuation of these projects is critical for the restoration and sustainable use of the TP grasslands.

TI  - Quantifying Short-Term Urban Land Cover Change with Time Series Landsat Data: A Comparison of Four Different Cities
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term characteristics of urban land cover change have been observed and reported from satellite images, although urban landscapes are mainly influenced by anthropogenic factors. These short-term changes in urban areas are caused by rapid urbanization, seasonal climate changes, and phenological ecological changes. Quantifying and understanding these short-term characteristics of changes in various land cover types is important for numerous urban studies, such as urbanization assessments and management. Many previous studies mainly investigated one study area with insufficient datasets. To more reliably and confidently investigate temporal variation patterns, this study employed Fourier series to quantify the seasonal changes in different urban land cover types using all available Landsat images over four different cities, Melbourne, Sao Paulo, Hamburg, and Chicago, within a five-year period (2011-2015). The overall accuracy was greater than 86% and the kappa coefficient was greater than 0.80. The R-squared value was greater than 0.80 and the root mean square error was less than 7.2% for each city. The results indicated that (1) the changing periods for water classes were generally from half a year to one and a half years in different areas; and, (2) urban impervious surfaces changed over periods of approximately 700 days in Melbourne, Sao Paulo, and Hamburg, and a period of approximately 215 days in Chicago, which was actually caused by the unavoidable misclassification from confusions between various land cover types using satellite data. Finally, the uncertainties of these quantification results were analyzed and discussed. These short-term characteristics provided important information for the monitoring and assessment of urban areas using satellite remote sensing technology.

TI  - Measurement of Ecological Land Use/Cover Change and Its Varying Spatiotemporal Driving Forces by Statistical and Survival Analysis: A Case Study of Yingkou City, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the spatial-temporal dynamics mechanisms and driving forces of ecological land change will offer a scientific basis for the sustainable utilization and ecological protection of regions undergoing rapid urbanization. This study examined the variations in ecological land from 2000 to 2015 in Yingkou by spatial statistical analysis with four land use/cover maps (2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015) interpreted by Landsat Thematic Mapper images and Google Earth maps. This study also measured the varying spatiotemporal drivers of typical ecological land use/cover types by survival analysis. The results indicated that ecological land was the main land use/cover type, and that the area decreased over time with a large transformation into agriculture and urban lands with significant temporal dynamics. The driving mechanisms became more complicated over time, and different time-dependent covariates significantly impacted the ecological land, forest land, and wetland losses. However, the distance from the city and different ways were the most important influencing spatiotemporal variables of the loss of ecological land, forest land, and wetlands over time. This study demonstrated the combined influence of a series of factors on ecological land loss. The spatial determinants and their impacts varied over time, especially the accessibility factors.

TI  - Tree-Lists Estimation for Chinese Boreal Forests by Integrating Weibull Diameter Distributions with MODIS-Based Forest Attributes from kNN Imputation
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wall-to-wall tree-lists information (lists of species and diameter for every tree) at a regional scale is required for managers to assess forest sustainability and design effective forest management strategies. Currently, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method and the Weibull diameter distribution function have been widely used for estimating tree lists. However, the kNN method usually relies on a large number of field inventory plots to impute tree lists, whereas the Weibull function relies on strong correlations between stand attributes and diameter distribution across large regions. In this study, we developed a framework to estimate wall-to-wall tree lists over large areas based on a limited number of forest inventory plots. This framework integrates the ability of extrapolating diameter distribution from Weibull and kNN imputation of wall-to-wall forest stand attributes from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We estimated tree lists using this framework in Chinese boreal forests (Great Xing'an Mountains) and evaluated the accuracy of this framework. The results showed that the passing rate of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test for Weibull diameter distribution by species was from 52% to 88.16%, which means that Weibull distribution could describe the diameter distribution by species well. The imputed stand attributes (diameter at breast height (DBH), height, and age) from the kNN method showed comparable accuracy with the previous studies for all species. There was no significant difference in the tree density between the estimated and observed tree-lists. Results suggest that this framework is well-suited to estimating the tree-lists in a large area. Our results were also ecologically realistic, capturing dominant ecological patterns and processes.

TI  - A nonparametric approach to filling gaps in satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth for estimating ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) is commonly used to estimate ambient levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), though it is important to mitigate the estimation bias of PM2.5 due to gaps in satellite-retrieved AOD. A nonparametric approach with two random-forest submodels is proposed to estimate PM2.5 levels by filling gaps in satellite-retrieved AOD. This novel approach was employed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 levels during 2013-2015 in the Sichuan Basin of Southwest China, where the coverage rate of composite AOD retrieved by the Terra and Aqua satellites was only 11.7%. Based on the retrieved AOD and various covariates (including meteorological conditions and land use types), the first random-forest submodel (named AOD-submodel) was trained to fill the gaps in the AOD dataset, giving a cross-validation R-2 of 0.95. Subsequently, the second random-forest submodel (named PM2.5-submodel) was trained to estimate the PM2.5 levels for unmonitored areas/days based on the gap-filled AOD, ground-monitored PM2.5 levels, and the covariates, and achieved a cross-validation R-2 of 0.86. By comparing the complete and incomplete (i.e., without the days when AOD data were missing) estimates, we found that the monthly PM2.5 levels could be overestimated by 34.6% if the PM2.5 values coincident with AOD gaps were not considered. The newly developed approach is valuable for deriving the complete spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 from incomplete remote sensing data, which is essential for air quality management and human exposure assessment.

TI  - Snow Cover Monitoring with Chinese Gaofen-4 PMS Imagery and the Restored Snow Index (RSI) Method: Case Studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an essential climate variable of the Global Climate Observing System. Gaofen-4 (GF-4) is the first Chinese geostationary satellite to obtain optical imagery with high spatial and temporal resolution, which presents unique advantages in snow cover monitoring. However, the panchromatic and multispectral sensor (PMS) onboard GF-4 lacks the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band, which is crucial for snow cover detection. To reach the potential of GF-4 PMS in snow cover monitoring, this study developed a novel method termed the restored snow index (RSI). The SWIR reflectance of snow cover is restored firstly, and then the RSI is calculated with the restored reflectance. The distribution of snow cover can be mapped with a threshold, which should be adjusted according to actual situations. The RSI was validated using two pairs of GF-4 PMS and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager images. The validation results show that the RSI can effectively map the distribution of snow cover in these cases, and all of the classification accuracies are above 95%. Signal saturation slightly affects PMS images, but cloud contamination is an important limiting factor. Therefore, we propose that the RSI is an efficient method for monitoring snow cover from GF-4 PMS imagery without requiring the SWIR reflectance.

TI  - Optimal Hyperspectral Characteristics Determination for Winter Wheat Yield Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth in different periods influences the final yield. This study started from the agronomic mechanism of yield formation and aimed to extract useful spectral characteristics in different phenological phases, which could directly describe the final yield and dynamic contributions of different phases to the yield formation. Hyperspectral information of the winter wheat canopy was acquired during three important phases (jointing stage, heading stage, and grain-filling stage). An enhanced 2D correlation spectral analysis method modified by mutual information was proposed to identify the sensitive wavebands. The selected wavebands performed well with good mechanism interpretation and close correlation with important crop growth parameters and main physiological activities related to yield formation. The quantitative contribution proportions of plant growth in three phases to the final yield were estimated by determining the coefficients of partial least square models based on full spectral information. They were then used as single-phase weight factors to merge the selected wavebands. The support vector machine model based on the weighted spectral dataset performed well in yield prediction with satisfactory accuracy and robustness. This result would provide rapid and accurate guidance for agricultural production and would be valuable for the processing of hyperspectral remote sensing data.

TI  - Effects of regional agricultural landscape patterns on populations of wheat aphids.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the effects of agricultural landscape patterns on wheat aphid populations is an important theoretical basis for ecological regulation and management of insect pests. Based on remote sensing data, land cover classification, and wheat aphid abundance survey data, we took a wheat planting region as a typical example and calculated the landscape pattern metrics and analyzed the effects of landscape patterns of farmland, non-crop habitat, and the regional agricultural landscape on wheat aphid abundances using a negative binomial generalized linear model. The results showed that aphid abundance was positively correlated with mean patch area and largest patch index of grassland and patch density of farmland, and was negatively correlated with mean Euclidean nearest neighbor distance and area-weighted mean patch area of the regional landscape and area-weighted mean patch area of farmland. The increase in patch area of grassland, fragmentation of the regional landscape and farmland, and the aggregation of the regional landscape promoted an increase in aphid abundance. The patch area and largest patch index of grassland and mean Euclidean nearest neighbor distance of the regional landscape best predicted aphid abundance. The patch area of grassland, the fragmentation of farmland, and the spatial distribution and fragmentation of the regional landscape and were important landscape factors affecting the occurrence of wheat aphids.

TI  - Dynamical Response of Changjiang River Plume to a Severe Typhoon With the Surface Wave-Induced Mixing
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons (or hurricanes) are the most energetic atmospheric forcing acting on coastal waters. Here in this study, we investigated the response of the summertime Changjiang River plume to a typical typhoon, Chan-hom (1509), with a combination of field observation and numerical simulation. Surface wave-induced mixing was considered in the model configuration. The results showed that the typical offshore-extending summer Changjiang River plume completely disappeared under the influence of typhoon wind. Instead, it extended southward along the Zhejiang and Fujian (Zhe-Min) coast as a typical wintertime Changjiang River plume. The along-shelf plume extension lasted for extra similar to 10days after the typhoon passage, until another strong weather event came. The competition between wind-driven current and buoyancy-driven current dominated the recovery of the Changjiang River plume. Through calculation, we found that the freshwater transported to the Zhe-Min Coastal Water reached similar to 4.7x10(10)m(3) as influenced by typhoon Chan-hom, which was similar to 5% of the total Changjiang River discharge in 2015 or similar to 12% of the total dry season Changjiang River discharge (October-April) when the majority of Changjiang River plume extended to Zhe-Min Coastal Water. The remote sensing data of chlorophyll- from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager also showed that significant algal bloom occurred when the southward extending Changjiang River plume retreated. Surface wave-induced mixing caused by typhoon wind was found to be important in destroying the vertical plume stratification and elongating the recovery processes from the typhoon influence.Plain Language Summary Large rivers discharge a great amount of freshwater and riverine materials to the receiving waterbody, causing significant ecological effects such as algal blooms and hypoxia. The associated river plume is highly mobile and can be easily disturbed by external forcings. Here in this study, we used the numerical simulation to examine the effect of one of the strongest atmospheric forcings, that is, the typhoon, on the horizontal and vertical structures of the Changjiang River plume. Strong wind-induced intensive surface wave and its effect on vertical mixing were also investigated. The results showed that the typical typhoon Chan-hom can dramatically shift the Changjiang River plume from the summer pattern to the winter pattern. It cannot recover to its initial state until after 2weeks. Wave mixing made the recovery time even longer. Massive freshwater was transported by the typhoon to the south of the Changjiang River mouth, which rarely happens in summer season. The resultant buoyant coastal current can self-sustained until another strong weather event came. We also found that the abnormal typhoon-induced transport of the Changjiang River plume by typhoon can cause massive algal blooms in the offshore Zhejiang coastal water, which rarely happens under normal weather.

TI  - An Adaptive Noise Reduction Method for NDVI Time Series Data Based on S-G Filtering and Wavelet Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to reduce the noise in advanced very high-resolution radiometer global inventory modeling and mapping studies normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) version 3g time series data, we propose an adaptive noise reduction method based on the Savitzky-Golay filter and wavelet analysis and on curve-fitting and spectrum analysis. The noise reduction effect was analyzed and evaluated. Studies have shown that the denoising of data using asymmetric Gaussian and double logistic curve-fitting methods results in the loss of details of the NDVI changes and is not conducive to the extraction of vegetation phenotypic characteristics. The wavelet function, wavelet decomposition layer number, and the threshold determination method have a large influence on the noise reduction effect, and the adaptive method has high noise reduction efficiency and effectively reduces the noise in the NDVI data. The proposed method does not require the determination of the smoothing window size and threshold for each year, which represents an advantage for processing large amounts of data.

TI  - Structure of the snowstorm cloud associated with northward Jiang-huai cyclone based on Cloudsat satellite data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Two unusual snowstorm events occurred in northern part of China on 3-5 March 2007 and 24-25 November 2013, respectively. They were triggered by northward Jiang-huai cyclones and have many similar features. The cloud structure and microphysical characteristic were analyzed by using routine observation data, cloud profile radar data from Cloudsat and NECP/NCAR reanalysis data. Main results show that: (1) Cold front cloud system of northward Jianghuai cyclone is narrow and dominated by deep convective cloud, whose structure and intensity have little change in different develop stages of cyclone. The echo core is between 2 km and 7 km. (2) Comma head cloud system is broader, and its structure and intensity have a big difference in different development stages of cyclone. There are two zones of precipitation within the comma head: a northern zone characterized by wide range stratiform clouds topped by generating cells and a southern zone marked by convective cloud column in the incipient frontal cyclone and frontal fracture stages. The strong radar echo stretched from surface. The feeder seeder mechanism is set up, which is favorable to the ice crystal growth. The cloud system of cold conveyor belt are mainly beneath 6km, with weak intensity and small ice water content. (3) Dry intrusion intensified in the bent-back warm front stage of cyclone, which lead to the wideness of the cloud-free area or partly cloudy area behind the cold front. The range of the comma head narrowed, and the cloud height, intensity and water content decrease. (4) Cold front cloud system and convective cloud column located in the southern part of comma head mainly produce rainfall, while comma head cloud at high latitude cause snowfall. However, convective instability develop and result in rainfall when comma head cloud is over the sea. Shallow cloud in the northern side of the cold front cloud system or the southern side of the comma head, which is composed of cumulostratus or altocumulus, produce drizzle. 100-200 km north of the cold front and the comma head are altostratus, which become thin with the increase of the height and distance, no corresponding precipitation.

TI  - Investigation of EM Backscattering from Slick-Free and Slick-Covered Sea Surfaces Using the SSA-2 and SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is devoted to investigating the electromagnetic (EM) backscattering from slick-free and slick-covered sea surfaces at various bands (L-band, C-band, X-band, and Ku-band) by using the second-order small slope approximation (SSA-2) and the measured synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. It is known that the impact of slick on sea surface is mainly caused by two factors: the Marangoni damping effect and the reduction of friction velocity. In this work, the influences induced by these two factors on the sea curvature spectrum, the root mean square (RMS) height, the RMS slope, and the autocorrelation function of sea surfaces are studied in detail. Then, the slick-free and slick-covered sea surface profiles are simulated using the Elfouhaily spectrum and the Monte-Carlo model. The SSA-2 with the tapered incident wave is employed to simulate the normalized radar cross-sections (NRCSs) of sea surfaces. Furthermore, for slick-free sea surfaces, the NRCSs simulated with the SSA-2 at various bands are compared with those obtained by the first-order small slope approximation (SSA-1), the classic two-scale model (TSM), and the geophysical model functions (GMFs) at various bands, respectively. For slick-covered sea surfaces, the SSA-2-simulated NRCSs are compared with those obtained from C-band Radarsat-2 images and L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) images, respectively. The numerical simulations illustrate that the SSA-2 can be used to study the EM backscattering from slick-free and slick-covered sea surfaces, and it has more advantages than the SSA-1 and the TSM. The works presented in this paper are helpful for understanding the EM scattering from the sea surface covered with slick, in theory.

TI  - Administrative-Hierarchical Urban Land Expansion in China: Urban Agglomeration in the Yangtze River Delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization in China has been strongly controlled by the administrative hierarchy system. Using Landsat images, this study compares the rates and forms of urban expansion across cities in the Yangtze River delta urban agglomeration in China between 2000 and 2015. Results indicate exponential downward trends of urban areas, urbanization levels (percentage of landscape taken by urban land), and urban growth with lower city administrative powers. Annual growth rates of urban lands peaked in relatively lower-level cities (county-level) and were lowest in top-level cities (directly controlled municipality/provincial capital). Also, this study shows that forms of urban growth were dominated by edge expansion (followed by leapfrogging) regardless of administrative position, and growth in lower-level cities tended to be more diffuse, fragmentary, and irregular. These findings highlight the administrative-hierarchical urbanization processes in China, along with the government's increasing emphasis on the development of medium- and small- sized cities within urban agglomerations. More in-depth study is needed to find a balance between urbanization and environmental sustainability for urban agglomerations. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - A Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation Neural Network for Predicting Forest Growing Stock Based on the Least-Squares Equation Fitting Parameters
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional field surveys are expensive, time-consuming, laborious, and difficult to perform, especially in mountainous and dense forests, which imposes a burden on forest management personnel and researchers. This study focuses on predicting forest growing stock, one of the most significant parameters of a forest resource assessment. First, three schemes were designedScheme 1, based on the study samples with mixed tree species; Scheme 2, based on the study samples divided into dominant tree species groups; and Scheme 3, based on the study samples divided by dominant tree species groupsthe evaluation factors are fitted by least-squares equations, and the non-significant fitted-factors are removed. Second, an overall evaluation indicator system with 17 factors was established. Third, remote sensing images of Landsat Thematic Mapper, digital elevation model, and the inventory for forest management planning and design were integrated in the same database. Lastly, a backpropagation neural network based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used to predict the forest growing stock. The results showed that the group estimation precision exceeded 90%, which is the highest standard of total sampling precision of inventory for forest management planning and design in China. The prediction results for distinguishing dominant tree species were better than for mixed dominant tree species. The results also showed that the performance metrics for prediction could be improved by least-squares equation fitting and significance filtering of the evaluation factors.

TI  - Impervious Surface Extraction From Multispectral Images via Morphological Attribute Profiles Based on Spectral Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces exhibit unique spatial characteristics in urban environments. The estimation of impervious surfaces is critical for the analysis of these environments. In this paper, we propose a new technique based on morphological attribute profiles for mapping impervious surfaces under a spectral mixture analysis model. A main feature of our newly developed method is that it can model different kinds of structural information, which represents an important competitive advantage over existing techniques. As a result, considering the special characteristics of urban environments, our new method for impervious surface extraction exhibits the potential to model complex urban backgrounds. Four kinds of remotely sensed data, including Landsat ETM+, GF-1, IKONOS and sentinel-2 collected over Guangzhou, China, are used in this work to test the performance of our approach in the task of extracting imperviousness from images with different spatial resolution. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed method exhibits very good performance in the task of estimating the impervious surface distribution, with relatively high precision. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 10.89%, mean absolute error (MAE) was 8.37% and Bias was 1.4% for the ETM+ data. RMSE was 11.49%, MAE was 6.25% and Bias was 2.34% for the GF-1 data. The RMSE was 7.72%, MAE was 7.67% and Bias was 3.91% for the IKONOS data, respectively. These results are superior to those provided by other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our results also show the effectiveness of the method in distinguishing bright impervious surface from the dark impervious surface, especially in high resolution remotely sensed images.

TI  - A Spatial Pattern Analysis of Frontier Passes in China's Northern Silk Road Region Using a Scale Optimization BLR Archaeological Predictive Model
T2  - HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In China's Northern Silk Road (CNSR) region, dozens of frontier passes built and fortified at critical intersections were exploited starting at approximately 114 B.C. to guarantee caravan safety. Understanding the pattern of these pass sites is helpful in understanding the defense and trading system along the Silk Road. In this study, a scale optimization Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) archaeological predictive model was proposed to study the spatial pattern of CNSR frontier passes for understanding the critical placement of ancient defense and trading pass sites. Three hundred and fifty sample locations and 17 natural proxies were input into the model. Four strongly correlated factors were reserved as independent variables to construct the model, which was validated by 150 surveyed data and Kvamme's Gain statistics. According to the variable selection and model optimization, the best spatial scale varies with the stability of the variables, such as 50 m and 1000 m, respectively, for the terrain and non-terrain variables. Clustering characteristics were identified with division overlapped with a 400 mm precipitation line using the site sensibility map. The high and medium probability areas were assembled along the Great Wall and the CNSR routes, especially in the western part, revealing that the model is also helpful to reconstruct the Silk Road routes.

TI  - Assessment of vegetation degradation in mountainous pastures of the Western Tien-Shan, Kyrgyzstan, using eMODIS NDVI
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection and assessment of vegetation degradation of mountain pastures is of high interest given the increasing number of reports on degradation as well as the importance of pastures as a source of livelihood for many mountain communities globally. Due to its synoptic perspective, remote sensing is an attractive instrument to rapidly assess and diagnose degradation prevalence and status. While it is relatively straight-forward to assess degradation leading to a change in vegetation cover by remote sensing, it is more challenging to study changes in vegetation composition, i.e. vegetation degradation. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the use of the seasonal variation (phenophases) of zonal-specific pastures varying in vegetation degradation using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). For ground-truthing, quantitative and qualitative releve data were collected during field surveys 2008-2015 during the growing season, and have been used to validate the classification of vegetation degradation based on eMODIS NDVI composite data for selected normal and dry years. Using a 500 m buffer zone, vegetation features have been extracted and correlated with satellite reflectance spectra for classifying the remote sensing imagery. We found a significant difference in compositional structure among degradation classes for all ecozones. Since qualitative changes in vegetation cover were caused by a replacement of dominant grasses and forbs with unpalatable forbs or shrubs with different reflectance patterns, our results indicate that excluding the alpine zone, vegetation degraded pastures differed from non-degraded ones by higher NDVI values at each phenology phase, although this was not always significant. As vegetation degradation led to an earlier greenup and later senescence, i.e. an observed extension of the growing season in terms of NDVI data, shifts in species composition could also be driving effects that have so far mostly been interpreted as signs of climatic changes. The procedures of this study and the developed conditional inference classification trees enable cost-effective screenings of large areas to detect vegetation degraded pastures and to assess seasonal grazing impact from remote sensing based interpretation. We conclude that the procedures developed here using eMODIS NDVI composite datasets are well suited for vegetation degradation assessments. This can improve monitoring of vegetation degradation as well as land-use planning.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Single Tree Data Enable the Determination of Habitat Thresholds for the Three-Toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biodiversity conservation requires precise, area-wide information on the abundance and distribution of key habitat structures at multiple spatial scales. We combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with color-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery for identifying individual tree characteristics and quantifying multi-scale habitat requirements using the example of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) (TTW) in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). This bird, a keystone species of boreal and mountainous forests, is highly reliant on bark beetles dwelling in dead or dying trees. While previous studies showed a positive relationship between the TTW presence and the amount of deadwood as a limiting resource, we hypothesized a unimodal response with a negative effect of very high deadwood amounts and tested for effects of substrate quality. Based on 104 woodpecker presence or absence locations, habitat selection was modelled at four spatial scales reflecting different woodpecker home range sizes. The abundance of standing dead trees was the most important predictor, with an increase in the probability of TTW occurrence up to a threshold of 44-50 dead trees per hectare, followed by a decrease in the probability of occurrence. A positive relationship with the deadwood crown size indicated the importance of fresh deadwood. Remote sensing data allowed both an area-wide prediction of species occurrence and the derivation of ecological threshold values for deadwood quality and quantity for more informed conservation management.

TI  - Effects of Meteorology Nudging in Regional Hydroclimatic Simulations of the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated the effects of grid and spectral nudging in regional hydroclimatic simulations over the Eastern Mediterranean climate change hot-spot. We performed year-long simulations for the hydrological year October 2001-September 2002 using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 12-km resolution, driven by the ERA-Interim reanalyses. Six grid and three spectral nudging options were tested using a number of model configurations. Due to the large uncertainty of regional observations, we compared the model with various satellite- and station-based meteorological datasets. The effect of nudging was tested for mean weather conditions and precipitation characteristics and extremes. For certain parts of the study domain, WRF was found to reproduce both aspects of rainfall over the Eastern Mediterranean reasonably well. Our findings highlighted that, for the WRF modeling system, nudging is critical for the simulation of rainfall; however, the application of interior constraint methods was found to have different impacts on various locations and climatic regimes. For the hyperarid parts of the domain, nudging did not improve the simulation of precipitation amounts (about 20% additional drying was introduced), while it added much value for the wetter rainfall regimes of the Eastern Mediterranean (corrections of about 30%). Improvements in the simulated precipitation were mostly introduced by spectral nudging; however, this option required significant computational resources. For these ERA-Interim-driven simulations, grid nudging that involves specific humidity within the planetary boundary layer is not recommended for the simulation of precipitation since it introduces dry biases up to 75-80%.

TI  - Integrative approach of RS and GIS in characterization of land suitability for agriculture: a case study of Darna catchment
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land elements like slope, soil depth, land use/land cover, water holding capacity, soil texture, soil erosion, elevation, potential of hydrogen, etc. determine the suitability for agriculture. Land suitability analysis is a one of the methods of assessment of detecting inherent capacities, potential and suitability levels of the lands for agriculture, and was utilized with the same land elements in this study. A multi-criterion decision making approach using IRS P6 LISS-IV satellite dataset within a GIS environment was used to identify suitable areas for agriculture in the Darna catchment. Experts' opinions, literature review, and correlation technique were used to decide influencing criteria, assign scores to sub-criteria, and judgment formation in pairwise comparison matrix. All thematic layers of criteria were integrated with each other in GIS using the weighted overlay technique and generated agriculture suitability map into four classes according to FAO. About 23% of the area is under agriculture in the study region. This area can extend up to 69% under agriculture converting fallow land, scrub land, and sparse forest according to soil qualities with suitability levels, i.e., highly suitable (19%), moderately suitable (16%), and marginally suitable (34%). About 31% (19,219ha) of reviewed area are classified in the class permanently not suitable for agriculture. Moderately and marginally suitable land requires the irrigation facility for efficient agriculture. This study emphasizes that about 46% area has potential as agriculture land and it will help improve the financial condition of the farmers.

TI  - Polyamine synthesis as a target of <i>MYC</i> oncogenes
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper is in recognition of the 100th birthday of Dr. Her-bert Tabor, a true pioneer in the polyamine field for over 70 years, who served as the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Biological Chemistry from 1971 to 2010. Wereview current knowledge of MYC proteins (c-MYC, MYCN, and MYCL) and focus on ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), an important bona fide gene target of MYC, which encodes the sentinel, rate- limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. Although notable advances have been made in designing inhibitors against the "undruggable" MYCs, their downstream targets and pathways are currently the main avenue for therapeutic anticancer interventions. To this end, the MYC-ODCaxis presents an attractive target for managing cancers such as neuroblastoma, a pediatric malignancy in which MYCN gene amplification correlates with poor prognosis and high-risk disease. ODC and polyamine levels are often up-regulated and contribute to tumor hyperproliferation, especially of MYC-driven cancers. We therefore had proposed to repurpose alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an FDA-approved, orally available ODC inhibitor, for management of neuroblastoma, and this intervention is now being pursued in several clinical trials. We discuss the regulation of ODC and polyamines, which besides their well-known interactions with DNA and tRNA/rRNA, are involved in regulating RNA transcription and translation, ribosome function, proteasomal degradation, the circadian clock, and immunity, events that are also controlled by MYC proteins.

TI  - Retrieval of global terrestrial solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence from TanSat satellite
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The first Chinese Carbon Dioxide Observation Satellite Mission (TanSat), which was launched on December 21, 2016, is intended to measure atmospheric CO2 concentration. The high spectral resolution (0.044 nm) and high SNR (360 at 15.2 mW m(-1) sr(-1) nm(-1)) measurements in the region of the O-2-A band of the Atmospheric Carbon dioxide Grating Spectroradiometer (AGCS) module onboard TanSat make it possible to retrieve solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from TanSat observations at the global scale. This paper aims to explore the potential of the TanSat data for global SIF retrieval. A singular vector decomposition (SVD) statistical method was employed to retrieve SIF using radiance over a micro spectral window (similar to 2 nm) around the Fe Fraunhofer lines (centered at 758.8 nm). The global SIF at 758.8 nm was successfully retrieved with a low residual error of 0.03 mW m(-1) sr(-1) nm(-1). The results show that the spatial and temporal patterns of the retrieved SIF agree well with the global terrestrial vegetation pattern. The monthly SIF products retrieved from the TanSat data were compared with other remote sensing datasets, including OCO-2 SIF, MODIS NDVI, EVI and GPP. The overall consistency between TanSat and OCO-2 SIF products (R-2 = 0.86) and the consistency of the spatial patterns and temporal variations between the TanSat SIF and MODIS vegetation indices and GPP enhance our confidence in the potential and feasibility of TanSat data for SIF retrieval. TanSat, therefore, provides a new opportunity for global sampling of SIF at fine spatial resolution (2 km x 2 km), thus improving photosynthesis observations from space. (C) 2018 Science China Press.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper compares extreme value statistics of daily maximum 10 m wind speed in winter simulated by the regional climate model COSMO-CLM at a horizontal resolution of 15 km (C15) with the reanalyses ERA-Interim and Arctic System re-analysis (ASR version 1 and 2) and with a satellite data set (CCMPv2). Our C15 simulation (1979/1980-2015/2016, November-April) is thereby the longest high-resolution simulation available for the Arctic. The results show that the extreme wind speeds tend to increase over the ocean with increasing the horizontal model resolution. A horizontal resolution of <= 15 km is required to sufficiently capture all extreme wind characteristics, in particular for the tip jets and barrier winds over the Irminger Sea and in the Denmark Strait, and for the low-level jets in the Nares Strait. Of almost equal importance are physical parameterizations of surface fluxes and of turbulence. Capturing extreme wind characteristics has a direct effect on climate relevant air-ice-ocean interactions, such as triggering open-ocean deep convection, polynya dynamics, or on the sea ice and freshwater balance of the Arctic.

T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are vulnerable to natural environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbances; but, the status and change dynamics at a national level are poorly understood. Consequently, this research is aimed to assess the changes in major mangrove forests of India between the period of 1989 and 2013, covering an area of 62678 km(2) from five coastal states. Landsat satellite data, post-classification approach, and ground truth verification were used for the mapping of the mangroves and assessing the changes in protected and unprotected forest regions. Our findings revealed that mangrove extent has increased from 3006 km(2) to 3406 km(2) within the period of study. Of the mangrove extent, 91% in 1989 and 80% in 2013 were located in the protected forest regions. The annual average rate of increase in mangrove area was 0.55%/yr. The mangroves gained and lost were 918 km(2) and 517 km(2) respectively, of which 53% of the growth and 81% of the loss occurred in protected regions. Natural factors were responsible for 97% of gain and 92% of the loss of mangrove area. The anthropogenic drivers were responsible for the 8% of mangrove conversion. The extent of mangroves grown was greater than that of deforestation in India, unlike many other shrimp growing countries. The results of the present study indicate the areas of intense change in mangrove forests and also provide important insight into the supportive efforts of mangrove conservation.

TI  - Interactive effects of water deficit and nitrogen nutrition on winter wheat. Remote sensing methods for their detection
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water and nitrogen (N) deficit are globally the most frequently limiting factors for agricultural crops, while both often occur together. To evaluate the interactive effects of water deficit and N nutrition on remote sensing data, rainout shelter field experiments were conducted in winter wheat during 2013-2014. Canopy spectral reflectance and infrared thermal imaging parameters were correlated to biochemical, physiological, morphological and production characteristics. Correlation analysis revealed that stomatal response to water deficit is best estimated using the NPCI (Normalized Pigment Chlorophyll Index) vegetation index and also by the CWSI (Crop Water Stress Index) thermal index. A variety of vegetation indices can be used to estimate grain yield, among which the best-performing is the Normalized Red Edge-Red Index (NRERI). That index shows the highest correlation irrespective of water deficit and N nutrition. Although none of the indices provided good detection of N content in plants, the total N uptake in wheat grain was reliably estimated by the TCARI/OSAVI (Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index). The results demonstrated that utilization of N for yield or grain protein formation was largely determined by water availability, and the relationships between vegetation indices and grain protein content thus have a distinct slope under water deficit. In summary, the spectral and thermal indices can provide satisfactory estimation, irrespective of interactions between water and N deficit, for grain yield, N uptake, and stomatal responses. However, when estimating the grain protein content, the water availability should be considered.

TI  - Landscape-scale modeling of agricultural land use for the quantification of ecosystem services
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land is strongly involved in the provision of ecosystem services given its spatial extent and impacts of agriculture on ecosystem functioning. Therefore, mapping ecosystem services require spatially explicit data on agricultural land uses. However, available data on agricultural land use usually have coarse spatial and temporal resolution, thus contributing significantly to uncertainties in ecosystem services quantification. Our goal is to develop an approach that produces high-resolution data on agricultural land uses. We propose a remote sensing approach using freely available MODIS images coupled with RapidEye images. Based on the phenological specificities of the different crops, we produced annual maps of agricultural land uses. We tested this approach over the spatially heterogeneous and mountainous region of Grenoble, France, where we mapped agricultural successions over 5 years. Maps produced at the scale of the agricultural parcel describe agricultural land uses through 17 classes. Our results suggest that coupling MODIS and RapidEye data can be used to map agricultural land use at high temporal and spatial resolution even in complex mountain landscapes. The comparison of the agricultural production service estimated by our method and from the Corine Land Cover database highlights the value of incorporating interannual variability in agricultural land use. This will also be facilitated in the future by the availability of new products from Sentinel 2. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Wetland landscape pattern changes over a period of rapid development (1985-2015) in the ZhouShan Islands of Zhejiang province, China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape dynamics of wetland are critical for understanding coastal ecosystem health and sustainability. The paper characterizes the spatiotemporal dynamics of the wetland landscape in the Zhoushan Islands during 1985-2015 to reveal the spatially explicit influential indicators. Wetland distribution in four periods (1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015) was derived from Landsat Images via artificial visual interpretation and support vector machine. Landscape pattern indices were then used to quantify landscape changes and statistical data was employed to identify the drivers. During 1985-2015, the total area of the Zhoushan Islands had been increased from 1277.15 km(2) in 1985 to 1368.12 km(2), and the total area of wetlands gradually increased from 123.31 km(2) to 195.88 km(2). The two-subtype wetlands presented opposite trends: the natural wetland decreased from 68.15 km(2) to 62.08 km(2) while the artificial wetland increased from 55.16 km(2) to 133.80 km(2). Since 1995, the area of artificial wetlands has exceeded that of natural wetlands. Moreover, natural wetland gradually became fragmented. The dominant transition of wetland types in the Zhoushan Islands was from natural wetlands to artificial wetlands. Moreover, some other transitions include artificial wetlands transferred to non-wetlands and new reclamation lands from the ocean transferred to construction and aquaculture lands were also identified. The wetland landscape pattern changes were not only affected by natural and socioeconomic factors, but also influenced by urbanization level and reclamation projects. Furthermore, the increasing artificial wetlands also played an important role in protecting the local ecological environment.

TI  - The effect of Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall on surface water δD values in the central Himalaya
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable isotope proxy records, such as speleothems, plant-wax biomarker records, and ice cores, are suitable archives for the reconstruction of regional palaeohydrologic conditions. But the interpretation of these records in the tropics, especially in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) domain, is difficult due to differing moisture and water sources: precipitation from the ISM and Winter Westerlies, as well as snow- and glacial meltwater. In this study, we use interannual differences in ISM strength (2011-2012) to understand the stable isotopic composition of surface water in the Arun River catchment in eastern Nepal. We sampled main stem and tributary water (n = 204) for stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analysis in the postmonsoon phase of two subsequent years with significantly distinct ISM intensities. In addition to the 2011/2012 sampling campaigns, we collected a 12-month time series of main stem waters (2012/2013, n = 105) in order to better quantify seasonal effects on the variability of surface water delta O-18/delta D. Furthermore, remotely sensed satellite data of rainfall, snow cover, glacial coverage, and evapotranspiration was evaluated. The comparison of datasets from both years revealed that surface waters of the main stem Arun and its tributaries were D-enriched by similar to 15 parts per thousand when ISM rainfall decreased by 20%. This strong response emphasizes the importance of the ISM for surface water run-off in the central Himalaya. However, further spatio-temporal analysis of remote sensing data in combination with stream water d-excess revealed that most high-altitude tributaries and the Tibetan part of the Arun receive high portions of glacial melt water and likely Winter Westerly Disturbances precipitation. We make the following two implications: First, palaeohydrologic archives found in high-altitude tributaries and on the southern Tibetan Plateau record a mixture of past precipitation delta D values and variable amounts of additional water sources. Second, surface water isotope ratios of lower elevated tributaries strongly reflect the isotopic composition of ISM rainfall implying a suitable region for the analysis of potential delta D value proxy records.

TI  - Analysis of combined and isolated effects of land-use and land-cover changes and climate change on the upper Blue Nile River basin's streamflow
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding responses by changes in land use and land cover (LULC) and climate over the past decades on streamflow in the upper Blue Nile River basin is important for water management and water resource planning in the Nile basin at large. This study assesses the long-term trends of rainfall and streamflow and analyses the responses of steamflow to changes in LULC and climate in the upper Blue Nile River basin. Findings of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test indicate statistically insignificant increasing trends for basin-wide annual, monthly, and long rainy-season rainfall but no trend for the daily, short rainy-season, and dry season rainfall. The Pettitt test did not detect any jump point in basin-wide rainfall series, except for daily time series rainfall. The findings of the MK test for daily, monthly, annual, and seasonal streamflow showed a statistically significant increasing trend. Landsat satellite images for 1973, 1985, 1995, and 2010 were used for LULC change-detection analysis. The LULC change-detection findings indicate increases in cultivated land and decreases in forest coverage prior to 1995, but forest area increases after 1995 with the area of cultivated land that decreased. Statistically, forest coverage changed from 17.4 % to 14.4%, by 12.2 %, and by 15.6 %, while cultivated land changed from 62.9 % to 65.6 %, by 67.5 %, and by 63.9 % from 1973 to 1985, in 1995, and in 2010, respectively. Results of hydrological modelling indicate that mean annual streamflow increased by 16.9 % between the 1970s and 2000s due to the combined effects of LULC and climate change. Findings on the effects of LULC change on only streamflow indicate that surface runoff and base flow are affected and are attributed to the 5.1 % reduction in forest coverage and a 4.6 % increase in cultivated land areas. The effects of climate change only revealed that the increased rainfall intensity and number of extreme rainfall events from 1971 to 2010 significantly affected the surface runoff and base flow. Hydrological impacts by climate change are more significant as compared to the impacts of LULC change for streamflow of the upper Blue Nile River basin.

TI  - Measuring subaqueous progradation of the Wax Lake Delta with a model of flow direction divergence
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed flow patterns can reveal the location of the subaqueous distal tip of a distributary channel on a prograding river delta. Morphodynamic feedbacks produce distributary channels that become shallower over their final reaches before the unchannelized foreset slopes basinward. The flow direction field over this morphology tends to diverge and then converge, providing a diagnostic signature that can be captured in flow or remote sensing data. A total of 21 measurements from the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) in coastal Louisiana and 317 measurements from numerically simulated deltas show that the transition from divergence to convergence occurs in a distribution that is centered just downstream of the channel tip, on average 132 m in the case of the WLD. These data validate an inverse model for remotely estimating subaqueous channel tip location. We apply this model to 33 images of the WLD between its initiation in 1974 and 2016. We find that six of the primary channels grew at rates of 60-80 m yr(-1), while the remaining channel grew at 116 m yr(-1). We also show that the subaqueous delta planform grew at a constant rate (1.72 km(2) yr(-1)). Subaerial land area initially grew at the same rate but slowed after about 1999. We explain this behavior as a gradual decoupling of channel tip progradation and island aggradation that may be common in maturing deltas.

TI  - Classification mapping of salt marsh vegetation by flexible monthly NDVI time-series using Landsat imagery
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are deemed as one of the most dynamic and valuable ecosystems on Earth. Recently, salt marsh deterioration and loss have become widespread because of anthropogenic stressors and sea level rise. Long-term acquisition of spatial information on salt marsh vegetation communities is thus critical to detect the general evolutionary trend of marsh ecosystems before irreversible change occurs. Medium resolution imagery organized in inter-annual time series has been proven suitable for large-scale mapping of salt marsh vegetation. For long-term monitoring purpose, the challenge still lies in developing time series based on data with sparse and uneven temporal distribution. This paper proposes a flexible Monthly NDVI Time-Series (MNTS) approach to achieve multi-temporal classification maps of salt marsh vegetation communities in the Virginia Coast Reserve, USA, by utilizing all viable Landsat TM/ETM + images during the period 1984-2011. Salt marsh vegetation communities are identified on a reference MNTS spanning 12 months with an overall accuracy of 0.898, approximately 0.107 higher than classifications using single images. Utilizing a flexible selection process based on the reference MNTS, a significant inverse hyperbolic relationship emerges between overall accuracy and average length of the time series. Based on these results, eight classification maps with average accuracy of 0.844 and time interval of 2-5 years are acquired. A spatio-temporal analysis of the maps indicates that the upper low marsh vegetation community has diminished by 19.4% in the study period, with a recent acceleration of losses. The conversion of marsh area to vegetation communities typical of low elevations (37.7 km(2)) is more than twice the conversion to vegetation communities typical of high elevations (18.3 km(2)), suggesting that salt marsh ecosystems at the Virginia Coast Reserve are affected by sea level rise.

TI  - Accessible remote sensing data based reference evapotranspiration estimation modelling
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is a fundamental requirement of agricultural water management. The FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) equation has been used as the standard for ET0 estimation. However, the lack of necessary meteorological data makes it difficult to estimate spatially distributed ET0 using the FAO-PM method in the wider ungauged areas. In this study, the aim is to explore the methodology for estimating reference evapotranspiration based on remote sensing data. In this method, remote sensing data are combined with machine learning algorithms to establish a model for spatially distributed ET0 estimation. Three machine learning algorithms were tested, including support vector machine (SVM), back-propagation neural network (BP), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFTS). Results showed this method had good ability in estimating ET0. Application of the method in Northwest China indicated that the land surface temperature (IST) can be used to accurately estimate ET0 with high correlation coefficients (r(2) of 0.897-0.915). The surface reflectance has potential for estimating ET0 with LST and can slightly improve model accuracy based on LST. Evaluation showed LST was more essential than surface reflectance and the model only based on LST had satisfactory performance. This method could be applicability in worldwide with available remote sensing and meteorological data due to the relationship between LST and ET0.

TI  - Insect-flower interaction networks vary among endemic pollinator taxa over an elevation gradient
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interaction networks are sensitive to elevation gradients through changes in local distribution of interacting partners. Here, we use plant-pollinator interaction network metrics to assess the effect of elevation on flowers and flower-visiting insect assemblages on a sentinel mountain used for monitoring climate change in the flower-and insect-rich Cape Floristic Region. We also use these interaction metrics to explain the effect of environmental factors on the interaction networks. We did this over four vegetation zones <1640m asl, as determined by former botanical studies. Overall, bees were the dominant flower visitors, followed by monkey beetles, and far behind were wasps and flies. The middle elevation zone (650-744 m a.s.l), which is also an ecotone between two distinct botanical zones, had the highest species richness and abundance of interacting plants and insects. Interaction frequency and size of network were also greatest in the middle zone, as were network diversity, generality, and linkage density, while lowest in the peak zone. In sum, there was distinct elevation zoning of flower-visiting insects. The greatest zonal change was between species at the middle compared with peak zone. Large-sized monkey beetles, bees and flies characterized the unique assemblage in the peak zone (1576-1640 m a.s.l.). The insect zonation tracked that of plant assemblages, with air temperature (lapse rate) being the primary driver of bee distribution, with lowest levels in the peak zone. In contrast, beetle distribution was driven mostly by flower assemblages as well as air temperature. In turn, wasp and fly interaction networks were not affected by any of the measured environmental variables. We conclude that increased elevation stress from reduced temperatures, changing abiotic weather conditions (e.g. strong winds at high elevations), and decline in flowering plant composition causes breakdown of interaction networks involving bees and beetles but not that of flies and wasps.

TI  - Preparing for safety monitoring after rotavirus vaccine introduction-Assessment of baseline epidemiology of intussusception among children &lt;2 years of age in four Asian countries
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intussusception is the invagination of one segment of the bowel into a distal segment, characterized by symptoms of bloody stool, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Previous studies have found regional differences in incidence but the etiology of most intussusception cases is unknown. Rotavirus vaccines were associated with a slightly of increased risk of intussusception in post-licensure evaluations in high and middle-income countries, but not in low income African countries. To describe the baseline epidemiology of intussusception in young children prior to rotavirus vaccine implementation, active sentinel hospital surveillance for intussusception in children < 2 years of age was conducted in 4 low income Asian countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Vietnam). Over a 24-month period, 15 sites enrolled 1,415 intussusception cases, of which 70% were enrolled in Vietnam. Overall, 61% of cases were male and 1% (n = 16) died, ranging from 8% in Pakistan to 0% in Vietnam. The median age of cases enrolled ranged from 6 months in Bangladesh and Pakistan to 12 months in Vietnam. The proportion of cases receiving surgical management was 100% in Bangladesh, 88% in Pakistan, 61% in Nepal, and 1% in Vietnam. The high proportion of males and median age of cases around 6 months of age found in this regional surveillance network are consistent with previous descriptions of the epidemiology of intussusception in these countries and elsewhere. Differences in management and the fatality rate of cases between the countries likely reflect differences in access to healthcare and availability of diagnostic modalities. These baseline data will be useful for post-rotavirus vaccine introduction safety monitoring. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundDuring the last 30years, the development of geographical information systems and satellites for Earth observation has made important progress in the monitoring of the weather, climate, environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence the reduction or the reemergence of vector-borne diseases. Analyses resulting from the combination of geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing have improved knowledge of climatic, environmental, and biodiversity factors influencing vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as malaria, visceral leishmaniasis, dengue, Rift Valley fever, schistosomiasis, Chagas disease and leptospirosis. These knowledge and products developed using remotely sensed data helped and continue to help decision makers to better allocate limited resources in the fight against VBDs.Main bodyBecause VBDs are linked to climate and environment, we present here our experience during the last four years working with the projects under the, World Health Organization (WHO)/ The Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR)-International Development Research Centre (IDRC) Research Initiative on VBDs and Climate Change to integrate climate and environmental information into research and decision-making processes. The following sections present the methodology we have developed, which uses remote sensing to monitor climate variability, environmental conditions, and their impacts on the dynamics of infectious diseases. We then show how remotely sensed data can be accessed and evaluated and how they can be integrated into research and decision-making processes for mapping risks, and creating Early Warning Systems, using two examples from the WHO TDR projects based on schistosomiasis analysis in South Africa and Trypanosomiasis in Tanzania.ConclusionsThe tools presented in this article have been successfully used by the projects under the WHO/TDR-IDRC Research Initiative on VBDs and Climate Change. Combined with capacity building, they are an important piece of work which can significantly contribute to the goals of WHO Global Vector Control Response and to the Sustainable Development Goals especially those on health and climate action.

TI  - Comparison of four calving laws to model Greenland outlet glaciers
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Calving is an important mechanism that controls the dynamics of marine terminating glaciers of Greenland. Iceberg calving at the terminus affects the entire stress regime of outlet glaciers, which may lead to further retreat and ice flow acceleration. It is therefore critical to accurately parameterize calving in ice sheet models in order to improve the projections of ice sheet change over the coming decades and reduce the uncertainty in their contribution to sea-level rise. Several calving laws have been proposed, but most of them have been applied only to a specific region and have not been tested on other glaciers, while some others have only been implemented in 1-D flowline or vertical flowband models. Here, we test and compare several calving laws recently proposed in the literature using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). We test these calving laws on nine tidewater glaciers of Greenland. We compare the modeled ice front evolution to the observed retreat from Landsat data collected over the past 10 years, and assess which calving law has better predictive abilities for each glacier. Overall, the von Mises tensile stress calving law is more satisfactory than other laws for simulating observed ice front retreat, but new parameterizations that better capture the different modes of calving should be developed. Although the final positions of ice fronts are different for forecast simulations with different calving laws, our results confirm that ice front retreat highly depends on bed topography, irrespective of the calving law employed. This study also confirms that calving dynamics needs to be 3-D or in plan view in ice sheet models to account for complex bed topography and narrow fjords along the coast of Greenland.

TI  - Separating Geophysical Signals Using GRACE and High-Resolution Data: A Case Study in Antarctica
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To fully exploit data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), we separate geophysical signals observed by GRACE in Antarctica by deriving high-spatial resolution maps for present-day glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and ice-mass changes with the least possible noise level. For this, we simultaneously (i) improve the postprocessing of gravity data and (ii) consistently combine them with high-resolution data from Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite altimeter (ICESat) and Regional Atmospheric Climate Model 2.3 (RACMO). We use GPS observations to discriminate between various candidate spatial patterns of vertical motions caused by GIA. The ICESat-RACMO combination determines the spatial resolution of estimated ice-mass changes. The results suggest the capability of the developed approach to retrieve the complex spatial pattern of present-day GIA, such as a pronounced subsidence in the proximity of the Kamb Ice Stream and pronounced uplift in the Amundsen Sea Sector.Plain Language Summary The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission has become an indispensable tool in monitoring global mass variations. However, the limited horizontal and lacking vertical resolution of the gravity satellite data is still a major challenge. We develop an approach that allows gravity satellite data to be consistently combined with other complementary data that feature higher spatial resolution (e.g., altimetry and climate data). The consistent combination in terms of horizontal resolution allows the different signals contributing to the total GRACE signal to be accurately separated. We demonstrate the utility of the developed approach by separating present-day ice-mass changes and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in Antarctica using gravimetry, altimetry, climate, and GPS data. For the first time, our data-driven approach allows the statistically significant small-scale GIA features to be retrieved, such as a pronounced subsidence in the proximity of the Kamb Ice Stream. The estimated GIA is important to validate geophysical GIA models, while accurately estimated Antarctic ice-mass changes are important for sea-level projections. Moreover, the developed method can be applied on data derived from, for example, the upcoming satellite altimetry and gravity missions and in any other application which involves GRACE data and any other geodetic data.

TI  - Challenges in the Search for Perchlorate and Other Hydrated Minerals With 2.1-μm Absorptions on Mars
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A previously unidentified artifact has been found in Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars targeted I/F data. It exists in a small fraction (<0.05%) of pixels within 90% of images investigated and occurs in regions of high spectral/spatial variance. This artifact mimics real mineral absorptions in width and depth and occurs most often at 1.9 and 2.1 mu m, thus interfering in the search for some mineral phases, including alunite, kieserite, serpentine, and perchlorate. A filtering step in the data processing pipeline, between radiance and I/F versions of the data, convolves narrow artifacts (spikes) with real atmospheric absorptions in these wavelength regions to create spurious absorption-like features. The majority of previous orbital detections of alunite, kieserite, and serpentine we investigated can be confirmed using radiance and raw data, but few to none of the perchlorate detections reported in published literature remain robust over the 1.0- to 2.65-mu m wavelength range.Plain Language Summary Many minerals can be identified with remote sensing data by their characteristic absorptions in visible-shortwave infrared data. This type of data has allowed geological interpretation of much of Mars' surface, using satellite-based observation. We have discovered an issue with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars instrument's data processing pipeline. In similar to<0.05% of pixels in almost all images, noise in the data is smoothed in such a way that it mimics real mineral absorptions, falsely making it look as though certain minerals are present on Mars' surface. The vast majority of previously identified minerals are still confirmed after accounting for the artifact, but some to all perchlorate detections and a few serpentine detections were not confirmed, suggesting that the artifact created false detections. This means concentrated regions of perchlorate may not occur on Mars and so may not be available to generate possibly habitable salty liquid water at very cold temperatures.

TI  - Mapping ground movements caused by mining-induced earthquakes applying satellite radar interferometry
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activity related to the extraction of gas and oil, raw materials or water pumping leads to slow or rapid ground deformation. The ground motion rate is related to the type of the mined material, geological conditions, mining methods and other factors. Ground subsidence resulting from the collapse of underground post-mining voids occurs gradually. Mining-induced earthquakes and seismic earthquakes are largely unpredictable and have an adverse impact on the local inhabitants and buildings. For this reason, monitoring of this phenomenon is a challenge. The application of interferometric SAR for the evaluation of ground movement has brought satisfactory results over the past twenty years mainly in the regions where no other measurements were conducted during ground subsidence. In this paper we have examined a mining-induced earthquake with a magnitude 4.5 which occurred in an underground copper ore mine in Poland on 29th November 2016 and caused eight fatalities. It also had an impact on ground surface deformation in the vicinity of the mine tailings. An assessment of the earthquake-related impact on surface movement was carried out by Sentinel-1 TOPS time series interferometry. The velocity of ground movement and the scale of the phenomenon were investigated. In addition, the impact of the mining-induced earthquake on Zelazny Most mine tailings site was analyzed. Moreover, the process of dynamic ground compaction was also investigated in detail. Ground movement following the mine earthquake was explored. Two time phases of the movements were determined. The first phase of dynamic ground displacement was rapid and 90% of total ground deformation appeared on the surface within 7 days. The second phase of displacement was a 'vanishing' one; it lasted for approx. 3 weeks and 10% of ground deformation appeared on the surface. The study revealed that the maximum observed ground subsidence did not exceed 9 cm. The presented results contribute to a better understanding of post-earthquake ground deformations in the light of their spatial distribution in time.

TI  - Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> nanoplates for contrast-enhanced photoacoustic imaging at 1064 nm
T2  - NANOSCALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a high-resolution biomedical imaging modality, which can be used to visualize biological tissues located beyond the limited penetration depth of existing optical imaging techniques. An optical wavelength of 1064 nm is of great interest in PA imaging due to low intrinsic absorption at this wavelength. Reduced absorption implies an increased depth of imaging, which enables several new clinical applications such as bladder imaging, gastrointestinal (GI) imaging, and sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging. In addition, a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser system enables a high power, cost-effective, and compact laser-based PA imaging system. However, at this wavelength, due to low intrinsic contrast, high absorption exogenous PA contrast agents are necessary for imaging. To this end, we present new Bi2Se3 nanoplates as PA contrast agents at 1064 nm wavelength for PA imaging. We successfully synthesized Bi2Se3 nanoplates and they exhibited relatively strong PA signals at 1064 nm. We confirmed the increased imaging depth of penetration by imaging the Bi2Se3-containing tube located 4.6 cm deep in biological tissues. We present in vivo PA imaging of the bladder, GI tract, and SLN in mice using a Bi2Se3 contrast agent establishing the clinical feasibility of these agents with a clinical photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging system. Our results confirm that Bi2Se3 nanoplates are promising PA contrast agents at 1064 nm that offer a high optical absorbance in the second NIR region providing a high contrast imaging and increased depth of penetration.

TI  - Remote Sensing of <i>Sargassum</i> Biomass, Nutrients, and Pigments
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Field and laboratory experiments are designed to measure Sargassum biomass per area (density), surface reflectance, nutrient contents, and pigment concentrations. An alternative floating algae index-biomass density model is established to link the spectral reflectance to Sargassum biomass density, with a relative uncertainty of similar to 12%. Monthly mean integrated Sargassum biomass in the Caribbean Sea and central West Atlantic reached at least 4.4 million tons in July 2015. The average %C, %N, and %P per dry weight are 27.16, 1.06, and 0.10, respectively. The mean chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is similar to 0.05% of the dry weight. With these parameters, the amounts of nutrients and pigments can be estimated directly from remotely sensed Sargassum biomass. During bloom seasons, Sargassum carbon can account for similar to 18% of the total particulate organic carbon in the upper water column. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of the overall Sargassum biomass, nutrients, and pigment abundance from remote sensing observations, thus helping to quantify their ecological roles and facilitate management decisions.

TI  - Estimating the Decoupling Degree of Subtropical Marine Stratocumulus Decks From Satellite
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The decoupling degree of stratocumulus (Sc) decks is an important quantity dictating evolutions of Sc. In subtropical oceans, the Sc decoupling is a key intermediate process of the Sc-to-cumulus transitions, a persistent phenomenon that is not fully understood. This study introduces a new approach for estimating the degree of decoupling of subtropical Sc decks using passive satellite sensors. This method is limited to regions where Sc decks are advected over progressively warmer water. This is most common in the subtropics. The estimation concept is that decoupled Sc clouds under cold-advection conditions are fed by spreading of the tops of cumulus clouds that are coupled. The cumulus clouds constitute a much larger liquid water path over small areas, which is identified by a positive skewness of the liquid water path, a quantity measurable from high-resolution satellite data. The decoupling degree here is defined as the difference between the Sc cloud-base height and lifting condensation level that is the cumulus cloud-base height under cold-advection conditions. This concept and the satellite-based estimations are supported by ship measurements over the Northeast Pacific. One-year climatology of the satellite-inferred decoupling degree was generated over the same region, revealing a coherent pattern of offshore decoupling, consistent with previous theory and field-campaign observations.Plain Language Summary Our climate system is considerably sensitive to marine low clouds that reflect a great amount of incoming solar radiation and cool the earth. These marine clouds are intimately coupled with the underlying sea surfaces that feed moisture and energy to the clouds for sustaining them. The degree of the surface-cloud coupling (SCC) considerably influences the cloud properties, which in turn modulates the temperature of our climate system. Despite its significance to climate, the SCC degree has never been measured from satellite, the only observational tool that offers global coverage. This study addresses this long-lasting issue by developing an innovative method to estimate the SCC degree using satellite data. The validity of this method is demonstrated by validating the SCC degree estimated by this new method against ground truth measurements over the Northeast Pacific. This method offers unprecedentedly new geophysical information, namely, the SCC degree that is crucial for the understanding of behavior of marine low clouds and its interactions with our climate system. This will eventually improve the accuracy with which future climate change is projected.

TI  - ProVal: A New Autonomous Profiling Float for High Quality Radiometric Measurements
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient system to produce in situ high quality radiometric measurements is compulsory to rigorously perform the vicarious calibration of satellite sensors dedicated to Ocean Color Radiometry (OCR) and to validate their derived products. This requirement is especially needed during the early stages of an OCR satellite activity or for remote areas poorly covered by oceanographic cruises with possible bio-optical anomalies. Taking advantage of Argo's profiling float technology, we present a new autonomous profiling float dedicated to in situ radiometric measurements. The float is based on the Provor CTS5 (manufacturer NKE) with an added novel two protruding arm design allowing for sensor redundancies, shading mitigation and near-surface data. Equipped with two identical radiometers on each arm that measure downward irradiance and upwelling radiance at seven wavelengths, the ProVal float generates both redundant radiometric profiles as well as an estimate of Remote Sensing Reflectance. Results from 449 profiles obtained in the NW Mediterranean Sea and in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean are presented to illustrate the ProVal float technical maturity. Analysis of the behavior of the profiling float, including tilting and ascent speeds is presented. The vertical stability of the ProVal exhibits 85% of surface data of the Mediterranean Sea with a tilt smaller than 10 degrees. This percentage is 40% in the Southern Ocean due to rougher seas. Redundant sensors provide a characterization of the relative drift between sensors over the deployment which is found to be <0.15% per month over a year. Post-cruise calibration of a recovered float revealed no significant drift. As an example of the utility of ProVal floats, a match-up of Remote Sensing Reflectance measured with the European Space Agency Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI onboard Sentinel-3A) is shown. It follows that profiling floats, such as ProVal, could provide a significant contribution to an upcoming global System Vicarious Calibration of space-based radiometers.

TI  - Mapping irrigated and rainfed wheat areas using high spatial-temporal resolution data generated by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detailed area and spatial distribution of irrigated and rainfed wheat can help forecast wheat yield and study water use efficiency. However, the similar spectral characteristics of irrigated and rainfed wheat make it difficult to separate them with low-spatial resolution or several high-spatial resolution images on the high heterogeneity of the southern Loess Plateau. To solve this challenge, this study used the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) to generate time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) at a 30-m resolution by fusing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat data. Then, the phenological feature extracted from the predicted NDVI is combined with an auxiliary dataset to classify irrigated and rainfed wheat using the support vector machine classifier. An overall classification accuracy of 93.7% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91 are achieved. Compared with corresponding high-resolution Google Earth images, the spatial distribution of the classification was consistent with actual land cover. This study demonstrates that the classification approach could classify irrigated and rainfed wheat in high heterogeneity regions and crops with smaller spectral characteristic differences. Moreover, it could be implemented across larger geographic regions. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Delineating Areas of Past Environmental Degradation near Smelters using Rock Coatings: A Case Study at Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions of SO2 from smelters can promote formation of acid rain, which can dissolve siliceous minerals on exposed rock surfaces and promote the formation of silica gel layers within which detrital and smelter-derived particulates can become trapped. These processes of dissolution and entrapment can result in the formation of rock coatings that contain elevated levels of heavy metals. Between 1927 and 1976, the Horne smelter processed sulfide ore derived from the Rouyn-Noranda region and became one of the largest emitters of particulates and sulfur dioxide in North America, promoting the formation of coatings on nearby rock surfaces. The reflectance spectra of these coatings are relatively flat, with typical reflectance values ranging between similar to 5% at visible wavelengths and similar to 16% in the shortwave infrared. Absorption troughs in coating spectra are consistent with the presence of materials including opaline silica, olivine, pyroxene, hydrous phyllosilicates, and sulfates. Classification of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data indicates that rock coatings near Rouyn-Noranda comprise a total surface area of similar to 1.5 km(2), nearly all of which is located within similar to 6 km of the Horne smelter. Remote sensing techniques can used to delineate the geographic extents of coatings near smelters, highlighting areas previously subjected to severe environmental degradation.

TI  - Canopy mortality has doubled in Europe's temperate forests over the last three decades
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mortality is a key indicator of forest health, and increasing mortality can serve as bellwether for the impacts of global change on forest ecosystems. Here we analyze trends in forest canopy mortality between 1984 and 2016 over more than 30 Mill. ha of temperate forests in Europe, based on a unique dataset of 24,000 visually interpreted spectral trajectories from the Landsat archive. On average, 0.79% of the forest area was affected by natural or human-induced mortality annually. Canopy mortality increased by +2.40% year(-1), doubling the forest area affected by mortality since 1984. Areas experiencing low-severity mortality increased more strongly than areas affected by stand-replacing mortality events. Changes in climate and land-use are likely causes of large-scale forest mortality increase. Our findings reveal profound changes in recent forest dynamics with important implications for carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, highlighting the importance of improved monitoring of forest mortality.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal variations of aerosols over China from two decades of multi-satellite observations - Part 2: AOD time series for 1995-2017 combined from ATSR ADV and MODIS C6.1 and AOD tendency estimations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding long-term variations in aerosol loading is essential for evaluating the health and climate effects of airborne particulates as well as the effectiveness of pollution control policies. The expected satellite lifetime is about 10 to 15 years. Therefore, to study the variations of atmospheric constituents over longer periods information from different satellites must be utilized.Here we introduce a method to construct a combined annual and seasonal long time series of AOD at 550 nm using the Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSR: ATSR-2 and AATSR combined) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on Terra (MODIS/Terra), which together cover the 1995-2017 period. The long-term (19952017) combined AOD time series are presented for all of mainland China, for southeastern (SE) China and for 10 selected regions in China. Linear regression was applied to the combined AOD time series constructed for individual L3 (1 degrees x 1 degrees) pixels to estimate the AOD tendencies for two periods: 1995-2006 (P1) and 2011-2017 (P2), with respect to the changes in the emission reduction policies in China.During P1, the annually averaged AOD increased by 0.006 (or 2% of the AOD averaged over the corresponding period) per year across all of mainland China, reflecting increasing emissions due to rapid economic development. In SE China, the annual AOD positive tendency in 1995-2006 was 0.014 (3%) per year, reaching maxima (0.020, or 4%, per year) in Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta regions. After 2011, during P2, AOD tendencies reversed across most of China with the annually averaged AOD decreasing by 0 : 015 (6%) per year in response to the effective reduction of the anthropogenic emissions of primary aerosols, SO2 and NOx. The strongest AOD decreases were observed in the Chengdu (0 : 045, or 8 %, per year) and Zhengzhou (0 : 046, or 9 %, per year) areas, while over the North China Plain and coastal areas the AOD decrease was lower than 0 : 03 (approximately 6 %) per year. In the less populated areas the AOD decrease was small.The AOD tendency varied by both season and region. The increase in the annually averaged AOD during P1 was mainly due to an increase in summer and autumn in SE China (0.020, or 4%, and 0.016, or 4%, per year, respectively), while during winter and spring the AOD actually decreased over most of China. The AOD negative tendencies during the 2011-2017 period were larger in summer than in other seasons over the whole of China (ca. -0.021, or 7%, per year) and over SE China (ca. -0.048, or 9%, per year).The long-term AOD variations presented here show a gradual decrease in the AOD after 2011 with an average reduction of 30%-50% between 2011 and 2017. The effect is more visible in the highly populated and industrialized regions in SE China, as expected.

TI  - TCR Repertoire as a Novel Indicator for Immune Monitoring and Prognosis Assessment of Patients With Cervical Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing evidence that deep sequencing-based T cell repertoire can sever as a biomarker of immune response in cancer patients; however, the characteristics of T cell repertoire including diversity and similarity, as well as its prognostic significance in patients with cervical cancer (CC) remain unknown. In this study, we applied a high throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencingmethod to characterize the T cell repertoires of peripheral blood samples from 25 CC patients, 30 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) patients and 20 healthy women for understanding the immune alterations during the cervix carcinogenesis. In addition, we also explored the signatures of TCR repertoires in the cervical tumor tissues and paired sentinel lymph nodes from 16 CC patients and their potential value in predicting the prognosis of patients. Our results revealed that the diversity of circulating TCR repertoire gradually decreased during the cervix carcinogenesis and progression, but the circulating TCR repertoires in CC patients were more similar to CIN patients than healthy women. Interestingly, several clonotypes uniquely detected in CC patients tended to share similar CDR3 motifs, which differed from those observed in CIN patients. In addition, the TCR repertoire diversity in sentinel lymphatic nodes from CC patients was higher than in tumor tissues. More importantly, less clonotypes in TCR repertoire of sentinel lymphatic node was associated with the poor prognosis of the patients. Overall, our findings suggested that TCR repertoire might be a potential indicator of immune monitoring and a biomarker for predicting the prognosis of CC patients. Although functional studies of T cell populations are clearly required, this study have expanded our understanding of T cell immunity during the development of CC and provided an experimental basis for further studies on its pathogenesis and immunotherapy.

TI  - Building a cloud in the southeast Atlantic: understanding low-cloud controls based on satellite observations with machine learning
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the processes that determine low-cloud properties and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs) is crucial for the estimation of their radiative effects. However, the covariation of meteorology and aerosols complicates the determination of cloud-relevant influences and the quantification of the aerosol-cloud relation.This study identifies and analyzes sensitivities of cloud fraction and cloud droplet effective radius to their meteorological and aerosol environment in the atmospherically stable southeast Atlantic during the biomass-burning season based on an 8-day-averaged data set. The effect of geophysical parameters on clouds is investigated based on a machine learning technique, gradient boosting regression trees (GBRTs), using a combination of satellite and reanalysis data as well as trajectory modeling of air-mass origins. A comprehensive, multivariate analysis of important drivers of cloud occurrence and properties is performed and evaluated.The statistical model reveals marked subregional differences of relevant drivers and processes determining low clouds in the southeast Atlantic. Cloud fraction is sensitive to changes of lower tropospheric stability in the oceanic, southwestern subregion, while in the northeastern subregion it is governed mostly by surface winds. In the pristine, oceanic subregion large-scale dynamics and aerosols seem to be more important for changes of cloud droplet effective radius than in the polluted, near-shore subregion, where free tropospheric temperature is more relevant. This study suggests the necessity to consider distinct ACI regimes in cloud studies in the southeast Atlantic.

TI  - Regional mapping of spekboom canopy cover using very high resolution aerial imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high resolution canopy cover maps of spekboom are required to assist with the restoration of degraded habitat in the Little Karoo, a large semiarid region in South Africa. Variations in habitat and level of degradation, in addition to radiometric variations in the imagery, make spekboom mapping at a regional scale a challenging problem. We present a per-pixel classification approach for canopy cover mapping of spekboom using multispectral 0.5-m resolution aerial imagery. The imagery is radiometrically homogenized with a technique that uses satellite data to convert digital numbers to estimated surface reflectance values. A feature selection procedure that is robust to redundancy is applied in order to select an informative feature subset from a typical set of spectral, textural, and vegetation index features. Support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and Bayes normal classifiers are evaluated against labeled pixel data and canopy cover ground truth acquired at 20 field sites. The results show that all the classifiers, except the Bayes normal classifier, perform well. The decision tree produces the best results (mean absolute canopy cover error of 5.85% with a standard deviation of 4.65%). (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB  - Inkjet printing silver electrodes for a-IGZO TFT array have recently become a hot spot benefitting from not requiring a conventional vacuum process. However, satellite droplets are unwanted in large area inkjet printing, because these satellites will decrease the performance of TFT array. Our work is aimed to eliminate satellite droplets by regulating the printing piezoelectric waveforms. With optimizing the inkjet printing condition, satellite-free silver electrodes array in a-IGZO TFT were obtained, which exhibited a mobility of 1.49 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) and an on/off current ratio of over 10(5). Our work provides a potential platform for future printed electronic application.

TI  - Asymptomatic myocardial ischemia forecasts adverse events in cardiovascular magnetic resonance dobutamine stress testing of high-risk middle-aged and elderly individuals
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Current guidelines for assessing the risk of experiencing a hospitalized cardiovascular ( CV) event discourage stress testing of asymptomatic individuals; however, these recommendations are based on evidence gathered primarily from those aged < 60 years, and do not address the possibility of unrecognized "silent myocardial ischemia" in middle aged and older adults.Methods: We performed dobutamine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) stress testing in 327 consecutively recruited participants aged > 55 years without CV-related symptoms nor known coronary artery disease, but otherwise at increased risk for a future CV event due to pre-existing hypertension or diabetes mellitus for at least 5 years. After adjusting for the demographics and CV risk factors, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models determined the additional predictive value of the stress test results for forecasting hospitalized CV events/survival. Either stress-induced LV wall motion abnormalities or perfusion defects were used to indicate myocardial ischemia.Results: Participants averaged 68 +/- 8 years in age; 39% men, 75% Caucasian. There were 38 hospitalized CV events or deaths which occurred during a mean follow-up of 58 months. Using Kaplan-Meier analyses, myocardial ischemia identified future CV events/survival (p < 0.001), but this finding was more evident in men (p < 0.001) versus women (p = 0.27). The crude hazard ratio (HR) of myocardial ischemia for CV events/survival was 3.13 (95% CI: 1.64-5.93; p < 0. 001). After accounting for baseline demographics, CV risk factors, and left ventricular ejection fraction/mass, myocardial ischemia continued to be associated with CV events/survival [HR: 4.07 (95% CI: 1.95-8.73) p < 0.001].Conclusions: Among asymptomatic middle-aged individuals with risk factors for a sentinel CV event, the presence of myocardial ischemia during dobutamine CMR testing forecasted a future hospitalized CV event or death. Further studies are needed in middle aged and older individuals to more accurately characterize the prevalence, significance, and management of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia.

TI  - Response of Arctic ozone to sudden stratospheric warmings
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are the main source of intra-seasonal and interannual variability in the extratropical stratosphere. The profound alterations to the stratospheric circulation that accompany such events produce rapid changes in the atmospheric composition. The goal of this study is to deepen our understanding of the dynamics that control changes of Arctic ozone during the life cycle of SSWs, providing a quantitative analysis of advective transport and mixing. We use output from four ensemble members (60 years each) of the Whole Atmospheric Community Climate Model version 4 performed for the Chemistry Climate Model Initiative and also use reanalysis and satellite data for validation purposes. The composite evolution of ozone displays positive mixing ratio anomalies of up to 0.5-0.6 ppmv above 550 K (similar to 50 hPa) around the central warming date and negative anomalies below (-0.2 to -0.3 ppmv), consistently in observations, reanalysis, and the model. Our analysis shows a clear temporal offset between ozone eddy transport and diffusive ozone fluxes. The initial changes in ozone are mainly driven by isentropic eddy fluxes linked to enhanced wave drag responsible for the SSW. The recovery of climatological values in the aftermath of SSWs is slower in the lower than in the upper stratosphere and is driven by the competing effects of cross-isentropic motions (which work towards the recovery) and isentropic irreversible mixing (which delays the recovery). These features are enhanced in strength and duration during sufficiently deep SSWs, particularly those followed by polar-night jet oscillation (PJO) events. It is found that SSW-induced ozone concentration anomalies below 600 K (similar to 40 hPa), as well as total column estimates, persist around 1 month longer in PJO than in non-PJO warmings.

TI  - Overview of the pathological results and treatment characteristics in the first 1000 patients randomized in the SERC trial: axillary dissection versus no axillary dissection in patients with involved sentinel node
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Three randomized trials have concluded at non inferiority of omission of complementary axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) for patients with involved sentinel node (SN). However, we can outline strong limitations of these trials to validate this attitude with a high scientific level. We designed the SERC randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01717131) to compare outcomes in patients with SN involvement treated with ALND or no further axillary treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze results of the first 1000 patients included.Methods: SERC trial is a multicenter non-inferiority phase 3 trial. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with adjuvant chemotherapy administration and non-sentinel node (NSN) involvement.Results: Of the 963 patients included in the analysis set, 478 were randomized to receive cALND and 485 SLNB alone. All patient demographics and tumor characteristics were balanced between the two arms. SN ITC was present in 6.3% patients (57/903), micro metastases in 33.0% (298), macro metastases in 60.7% (548) and 289 (34.2%) were non eligible to Z0011 trial criteria.Whole breast or chest wall irradiation was delivered in 95.9% (896/934) of patients, adjuvant chemotherapy in 69.5% (644/926), endocrine therapy in 89.6% (673/751) and the proportions were similar in the two arms. The overall rate of positive NSN was 19% (84/442) for patients with cALND. Crude rates of positive NSN according to SN status were 4.5% for ITC (1/22), 9.5% for micro metastases (13/137), 23.9% for macro metastases (61/255) and were respectively 29.36% (64/218), 9.33% (7/75) and 7.94% (10/126) when chemotherapy was administered after cALND, before cALND and for patients without chemotherapy.Conclusion: The main objective of SERC trial is to demonstrate non inferiority of cALND omission. A strong interaction between timing of cALND and chemotherapy with positive NSN rate was observed.

TI  - Evaluation of Senegal's prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) program data for HIV surveillance
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the expansion of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) services in Senegal, there is growing interest in using PMTCT program data in lieu of conducting unlinked anonymous testing (UAT)-based ANC Sentinel Surveillance. For this reason, an evaluation was conducted in 2011-2012 to identify the gaps that need to be addressed while transitioning to using PMTCT program data for surveillance.We conducted analyses to assess HIV prevalence rates and agreements between Sentinel Surveillance and PMTCT HIV test results. Also, a data quality assessment of the PMTCT program registers and data was conducted during the Sentinel Surveillance period (December 2011 to March 2012) and 3 months prior. Finally, we also assessed selection bias, which was the percentage difference from the HIV prevalence among all women enrolled in the antenatal clinic and the HIV prevalence among women who accepted PMTCT HIV testing.The median site HIV prevalence using routine PMTCT HIV testing data was 1.1% (IQR: 1.0) while the median site prevalence from the UAT HIV Sentinel Surveillance data was at 1.0% (IQR: 1.6). The Positive per cent agreement (PPA) of the PMTCT HIV test results compared to those of the Sentinel Surveillance was 85.1% (95% CI 77.2-90.7%), and the percent-negative agreement (PNA) was 99.9% (95% CI 99.8-99.9%). The overall HIV prevalence according to UAT was the same as that found for women accepting a PMTCT HIV test and those who refused, with percent bias at 0.00%. For several key PMTCT variables, including "HIV test offered" (85.2%), "HIV test acceptance" (78.0%), or "HIV test done" (58.8%), the proportion of records in registers with combined complete and valid data was below the WHO benchmark of 90%.The PPA of 85.1 was below the WHO benchmarks of 96.6%, while the combined data validity and completeness rates was below the WHO benchmark of 90% for many key PMTCT variables. These results suggested that Senegal will need to reinforce the quality of onsite HIV testing and improve program data collection practices in preparation for using PMTCT data for surveillance purposes.

TI  - The Influence of River Discharge on Nutrient Export and Phytoplankton Biomass Off the Central Chile Coast (33°-37°S): Seasonal Cycle and Interannual Variability
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Using in situ hydro-chemical data and MODIS-SeaWiFS ocean color images as a proxy of river plumes and phytoplankton biomass from 2000 to 2014, this study documents the temporal co-variability of river discharge, plume area, nitrate and phosphate export and phytoplankton biomass in the coastal waters off Central Chile (33 degrees-37 degrees S). Five major rivers (Maipo, Mataquito, Maule, Itata, and Biobio) drain into this region with annual mean discharge ranging from 120 to 1000 m(3) s(-1). River discharge and coastal plume area present a marked seasonal cycle, reaching maximum values during the winter rainy season (June-September). Export of riverine nutrients also peaks in winter, leading to an increase in phytoplankton biomass within the plumes that can be twice larger than the background values in coastal areas away from the river mouths. Wintertime river discharge, plume area and nutrient export are also correlated at interannual time scales. During a recent extended dry period (2010-2014), river discharges, plume areas and nutrient export clearly decreased by about 50% compared to historical values, reducing significantly the size of the chlorophyll pool within plumes off Central Chile during winter. The potential impacts of droughts are discussed in terms of coastal ecology and primary production, a highly relevant issue considering the projections of a dry climate over Central Chile in the future. Systematic evidence of mega-drought effects upon coastal productivity still does not exist, but it remains a priority to further investigate and quantify these impacts.

TI  - Resource-Effective Serosurveillance for the Detection of West Nile Virus in Switzerland Using Abattoir Samples of Free-Range Laying Hens
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an important zoonotic pathogen maintained in a natural transmission cycle between mosquitoes and birds as reservoir hosts. In dead-end hosts, such as humans, infection may result in fatal neurologic disease translating into disease and death-related suffering and increased health care costs. In humans, WNV may also be transmitted through blood transfusions and organ transplants. WNV is not present in Switzerland yet, but competent vector species (especially Culex pipiens and Aedes japonicus) are prevalent and an introduction of the virus, likely through wild birds, is expected at any time. Therefore, it is important for Switzerland to be prepared and establish a surveillance system for WNV to initiate increased prevention activities, such as the screening of blood and organ donations and public education activities in case virus circulation is detected. The long-term goal of these surveillance measures would be a reduced infection rate in humans resulting in less suffering and reduced health care costs. To provide the basis for a pragmatic and resource-effective WNV surveillance program, this study used aliquots of serum samples of free-range laying hens taken at the abattoir and collected in the frame of the ongoing Swiss Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease monitoring program for a 2-year period. All 961 aliquots were analyzed using a commercial competitive WNV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study allowed to set up sampling and laboratory routines as a basis for future WNV surveillance activities. At this stage there is no evidence for circulation of WNV in Switzerland.

TI  - An Ensemble Machine-Learning Model To Predict Historical PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in China from Satellite Data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The long satellite aerosol data record enables assessments of historical PM2.5 level in regions where routine PM2.5 monitoring began only recently. However, most previous models reported decreased prediction accuracy when predicting PM2.5 levels outside the model-training period. In this study, we proposed an ensemble machine learning approach that provided reliable PM2.5 hindcast capabilities. The missing satellite data were first filled by multiple imputation. Then the modeling domain, China, was divided into seven regions using a spatial clustering method to control for unobserved spatial heterogeneity. A set of machine learning models including random forest, generalized additive model, and extreme gradient boosting were trained in each region separately. Finally, a generalized additive ensemble model was developed to combine predictions from different algorithms. The ensemble prediction characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 well with the cross-validation (CV) R-2 (RMSE) of 0.79 (21 mu g/m(3)). The cluster-based subregion models outperformed national models and improved the CV R-2 by similar to 0.05. Compared with previous studies, our model provided more accurate out-of-range predictions at the daily level (R-2 = 0.58, RMSE = 29 mu g/m(3)) and monthly level (R-2 = 0.76, RMSE 16 mu g/m(3)). Our hindcast modeling system allows for the construction of unbiased historical PM2.5 levels.

TI  - Vulnerability of Amazonian forests to repeated droughts
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme droughts have been recurrent in the Amazon over the past decades, causing socio-economic and environmental impacts. Here, we investigate the vulnerability of Amazonian forests, both undisturbed and human-modified, to repeated droughts. We defined vulnerability as a measure of (i) exposure, which is the degree to which these ecosystems were exposed to droughts, and (ii) its sensitivity, measured as the degree to which the drought has affected remote sensing-derived forest greenness. The exposure was calculated by assessing the meteorological drought, using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD), which is related to vegetation water stress, from 1981 to 2016. The sensitivity was assessed based on the enhanced vegetation index anomalies (AEVI), derived from the newly available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm (MAIAC) product, from 2003 to 2016, which is indicative of forest's photosynthetic capacity. We estimated that 46% of the Brazilian Amazon biome was under severe to extreme drought in 2015/2016 as measured by the SPI, compared with 16% and 8% for the 2009/2010 and 2004/2005 droughts, respectively. The most recent drought (2015/2016) affected the largest area since the drought of 1981. Droughts tend to increase the variance of the photosynthetic capacity of Amazonian forests as based on the minimum and maximum AEVI analysis. However, the area showing a reduction in photosynthetic capacity prevails in the signal, reaching more than 400 000 km(2) of forests, four orders of magnitude larger than areas with AEVI enhancement. Moreover, the intensity of the negative AEVI steadily increased from 2005 to 2016. These results indicate that during the analysed period drought impacts were being exacerbated through time. Forests in the twenty-first century are becoming more vulnerable to droughts, with larger areas intensively and negatively responding to water shortage in the region.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the 2015/2016 El Nino on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications'.

TI  - Can HIV service data be used for surveillance purposes?: a case study in Guangzhou, China
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely monitoring HIV epidemic among key populations is a formidable challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the agreement between data collected from an enhanced HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS+) and an HIV service, and to discuss whether testing service data can be used for surveillance purposes.The HSS+ data were collected from HIV sentinel surveillance conducted annually among men who have sex with men (MSM) between 2009 and 2013 in Guangzhou, China. The HIV service data were obtained from the China-Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Cooperation Program on HIV Prevention and Care (China-Gates HIV Program) in Guangzhou during the same period. The China-Gates HIV Program aimed to increase HIV counseling and testing among MSM. We compared demographic characteristics, condom use, HIV testing history, and the HIV status among individuals in these two datasets. The Armitage-trend test was used to evaluate the HIV epidemic and behaviors of the participants in the two datasets over the study period.Overall, a total of 2224 and 5311 MSM were included in the surveillance and service datasets, respectively. The majority of participants in the two datasets were between 20 and 29 years old, at least attended college, and had never been married. However, socio-demographic characteristics varied slightly between the two datasets. Similar trends were observed for the HIV epidemic in these two datasets. The surveillance dataset indicated that HIV prevalence increased from 3.9% in 2009 to 11.4% in 2013 (P-value for trend < 0.001), while data from the HIV service dataset indicated that MSM HIV prevalence during this same period increased from 6.2 to 8.9% (P-value for trend = 0.025). The rates of condom use were similar between the two datasets and remained consistent throughout the study period.HIV service data can complement existing HIV surveillance systems for MSM in China, though it may underestimate the HIV prevalence (HSS+ data contains people whose status is already know, while service data contains people who were initially negative or people of unknown status). HIV service data can be used for surveillance purposes, when prerequisite variables are collected from a large number people, if the quality assessment is conducted.

TI  - Tropical land carbon cycle responses to 2015/16 El Nino as recorded by atmospheric greenhouse gas and remote sensing data
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The outstanding tropical land climate characteristic over the past decades is rapid warming, with no significant large-scale precipitation trends. This warming is expected to continue but the effects on tropical vegetation are unknown. El Nino-related heat peaks may provide a test bed for a future hotter world. Here we analyse tropical land carbon cycle responses to the 2015/16 El Nino heat and drought anomalies using an atmospheric transport inversion. Based on the global atmospheric CO2 and fossil fuel emission records, we find no obvious signs of anomalously large carbon release compared with earlier El Nino events, suggesting resilience of tropical vegetation. We find roughly equal net carbon release anomalies from Amazonia and tropical Africa, approximately 0.5 PgC each, and smaller carbon release anomalies from tropical East Asia and southern Africa. Atmospheric CO anomalies reveal substantial fire carbon release from tropical East Asia peaking in October 2015 while fires contribute only a minor amount to the Amazonian carbon flux anomaly. Anomalously large Amazonian carbon flux release is consistent with downregulation of primary productivity during peak negative near-surface water anomaly (October 2015 to March 2016) as diagnosed by solar-induced fluorescence. Finally, we find an unexpected anomalous positive flux to the atmosphere from tropical Africa early in 2016, coincident with substantial CO release.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the 2015/2016 El Nino on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications'.

TI  - Monitoring emissions from the 2015 Indonesian fires using CO satellite data
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia, in particular Indonesia, has periodically struggled with intense fire events. These events convert substantial amounts of carbon stored as peat to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and significantly affect atmospheric composition on a regional to global scale. During the recent 2015 El Nino event, peat fires led to strong enhancements of carbon monoxide (CO), an air pollutant and well-known tracer for biomass burning. These enhancements were clearly observed from space by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instruments. We use these satellite observations to estimate CO fire emissions within an inverse modelling framework. We find that the derived CO emissions for each sub-region of Indonesia and Papua are substantially different from emission inventories, highlighting uncertainties in bottom-up estimates. CO fire emissions based on either MOPITT or IASI have a similar spatial pattern and evolution in time, and a 10% uncertainty based on a set of sensitivity tests we performed. Thus, CO satellite data have a high potential to complement existing operational fire emission estimates based on satellite observations of fire counts, fire radiative power and burned area, in better constraining fire occurrence and the associated conversion of peat carbon to atmospheric CO2. A total carbon release to the atmosphere of 0.35-0.60 Pg C can be estimated based on our results.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the 2015/2016 El Nino on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications'.

AB  - The 2015/2016 El Nino was the first major climate variation when there were a range of satellite observations that simultaneously observed land, ocean and atmospheric properties associated with the carbon cycle. These data are beginning to provide new insights into the varied responses of land ecosystems to El Nino, but we are far from fully exploiting the information embodied by these data. Here, we briefly review the atmospheric and terrestrial satellite data that are available to study the carbon cycle. We also outline recommendations for future research, particularly the closer integration of satellite data with forest biometric datasets that provide detailed information about carbon dynamics on a range of timescales.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the 2015/2016 El Nino on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications'.

TI  - Possibility of avoiding axillary lymph node dissection by immune microenvironment monitoring in preoperative chemotherapy for breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The diagnosis of metastasis by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early breast cancer surgery provides an accurate view of the state of metastases to the axillary lymph nodes, and it has now become the standard procedure. In the present study, whether omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is possible by evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) before NAC in cases without metastasis on diagnostic imaging, but with metastasis on SLNB, was retrospectively investigated.Methods: A total of 91 patients with resectable, early-stage breast cancer, diagnosed as cT1-2, N0, M0, underwent SLNB and were treated with NAC. A semi-quantitative evaluation of lymphocytes infiltrating the peritumoral stroma as TILs in biopsy specimens of primary tumors prior to treatment was conducted.Results: In cases with a low number of TILs, estrogen receptor expression was significantly higher (p = 0.044), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression was significantly lower than in other cases (p = 0.019). The number of TILs was significantly lower in cases in which the intrinsic subtype was hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HRBC) (p = 0.044). Metastasis to axillary lymph nodes was significantly more common in HER2-negative cases and cases with a low number of TILs (p = 0.019, p = 0.005, respectively).Conclusions: Even if macrometastases are found on SLNB in cN0 patients, it appears that ALND could be avoided after NAC in cases with a good immune tumor microenvironment of the primary tumor.

TI  - Quantifying immediate carbon emissions from El Nino-mediated wildfires in humid tropical forests
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires produce substantial CO2 emissions in the humid tropics during El Nino-mediated extreme droughts, and these emissions are expected to increase in coming decades. Immediate carbon emissions from uncontrolled wildfires in human-modified tropical forests can be considerable owing to high necromass fuel loads. Yet, data on necromass combustion duringwildfires are severely lacking. Here, we evaluated necromass carbon stocks before and after the 2015-2016 El Nino in Amazonian forests distributed along a gradient of prior human disturbance. We then used Landsat-derived burn scars to extrapolate regional immediate wildfire CO2 emissions during the 20152016 El Nino. Before the El Nino, necromass stocks varied significantly with respect to prior disturbance and were largest in undisturbed primary forests (30.2 +/- 2.1 Mg ha(-1), mean +/- s. e.) and smallest in secondary forests (15.6 +/- 3.0 Mg ha(-1)). However, neither prior disturbance nor our proxy of fire intensity (median char height) explained necromass losses due towildfires. In our 6.5 million hectare (6.5 Mha) study region, almost 1 Mha of primary (disturbed and undisturbed) and 20 000 ha of secondary forest burned during the 2015-2016 ElNino. Covering less than 0.2% of Brazilian Amazonia, thesewildfires resulted in expected immediate CO2 emissions of approximately 30 Tg, three to four times greater than comparable estimates fromglobal fire emissions databases. Uncontrolled understoreywildfires in humid tropical forests during extreme droughts are a large and poorly quantified source of CO2 emissions.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the 2015/2016 El Nino on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications'.

T2  - HEREDITAS
M3  - Article
AB  - To develop a brackish water flea as a promising model for marine monitoring, Diaphanosoma celebensis were exposed to two pollutants, cadmium (Cd) and benzo[a] pyrene (BaP), which have different chemical characteristics and distinct modes of metabolic action on aquatic animals. Twenty-four hours after exposure to Cd (2mg/L) or BaP (25 mu g/L), whole body transcriptomes were analyzed. In total, 99.6 Mbp were assembled from nine libraries, resulting in 98,458 transcripts with an N50 of 1883 bp and an average contig length of 968 bp. Functional gene annotations were performed using Gene Ontology, Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. Cd significantly modulated endocrine and digestive enzyme system. Following BaP treatment, DNA repair and circadian rhythm related metabolisms were significantly modulated. Both the chemicals induced stress response and detoxification metabolism. This brackish water flea genomic information will be useful to monitor estuaries and coastal regions, as water fleas have been confirmed as promising sentinel models in freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - WRF-urban canopy model evaluation for the assessment of heat island and thermal comfort over an urban airshed in India under varying land use/land cover conditions
T2  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island effect has been assessed using weather research and forecasting model (WRF v3.5) focusing on air temperature and surface skin temperature in the sub-tropical urban Indian megacity of Delhi. Impact of urbanization-related changes in land use/land cover (LULC) on model outputs has been analyzed. Four simulations have been carried out with different types of LULC data viz. (1) USGS, (2) MODIS, (3) user-modified USGS and (4) user-modified land use data coupled with urban canopy model (UCM) for incorporation of canopy features. Heat island intensities have been estimated based on these simulations and subsequently compared with those derived from in situ and satellite observations. There is a significant improvement in model performance with modification of LULC and inclusion of UCM. Overall, RMSEs for near surface temperature improved from 6.3 to 3.9 degrees C and index of agreement for mean urban heat island intensities (UHI) improved from 0.4 to 0.7 with modified land use coupled with UCM. In general, model is able to capture the magnitude of UHI as well as high UHI zones well. A simple method of bias correction in model has been applied to improve model results for further application. The study highlights the importance of appropriate and updated the representation of land use-land cover and urban canopies for improving predictive capabilities of the mesoscale models. Urban heat island has been known to have effect on human thermal comfort. In the present study, Heat Index, a commonly used indicator of thermal comfort, is assessed spatially using WRF-UCM derived results. Urban areas were found to have higher Heat Index than non-urban areas by a difference of about 1.5-2 degrees C. Further, it was found that urban canopy effect leads to rise in thermal discomfort by increasing Heat Index. There is an increase in Heat Index of about 2.0-2.5 degrees C at dense built-up stations. Decrease in thermal comfort causes a significant impact on energy demand. Hence, analysis of urban heat island effect vis-a-vis thermal comfort provides useful information with regard to impact on human comfort and welfare.

TI  - Southern California megacity CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and CO flux estimates using ground- and space-based remote sensing and a Lagrangian model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimate the overall CO2, CH4, and CO flux from the South Coast Air Basin using an inversion that couples Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) observations, with the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC). Using TCCON data we estimate the direct net CO2 flux from the SoCAB to be 104 +/- 26 TgCO(2) yr(-1) for the study period of July 2013-August 2016. We obtain a slightly higher estimate of 120 +/- 30 TgCO(2) yr(-1) using OCO-2 data. These CO2 emission estimates are on the low end of previous work. Our net CH4 (360 +/- 90 GgCH(4) yr(-1)) flux estimate is in agreement with central values from previous top-down studies going back to 2010 (342-440 GgCH(4) yr(-1)). CO emissions are estimated at 487 +/- 122 GgCOyr(-1), much lower than previous top-down estimates (1440 GgCOyr(-1)). Given the decreasing emissions of CO, this finding is not unexpected. We perform sensitivity tests to estimate how much errors in the prior, errors in the covariance, different inversion schemes, or a coarser dynamical model influence the emission estimates. Overall, the uncertainty is estimated to be 25 %, with the largest contribution from the dynamical model. Lessons learned here may help in future inversions of satellite data over urban areas.

TI  - Toward a Broadband Parameterization Scheme for Estimating Surface Solar Irradiance: Development and Preliminary Results on MODIS Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A broadband parameterization scheme for estimating surface solar irradiance (SSI, similar to 0.3-4.0 mu m) is developed based on extensive radiative transfer simulations on a diversity of atmospheric conditions. In the new scheme, the accumulated SSI arriving at the surface is considered as a whole, but the different radiative attenuations, such as the ozone absorption, permanent gas absorption, water vapor absorption, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol absorption and scattering, and cloud absorption and scattering, are accounted for separately. In particular, for the cloud radiative attenuations, the single scattering and multiple scattering of clouds are parameterized respectively to improve the accuracy. Compared with the complicated spectral radiative transfer model of LibRadtran (Emde et al., 2016, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-1647-2016), more than 90% of the SSI discrepancies are within +/- 5%, which means in theory the new parameterization scheme is very accurate. When the broadband parameterization scheme is practically applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, the validation results indicate that the high-quality instantaneous SSI can be thus acquired. At eight sites over China, R-2 ranges from0.86 to 0.96 and all RMSEs lie within 100 W/m(2), while at seven sites over the United States, R-2 fluctuates within the range of 0.82-0.94 and the RMSEs at most sites are < 90 W/m(2), with the exception of Table Mountain. The performance of the new parameterization scheme is comparable to those of more complicated methods such as the look-up-table methods and the d-two-stream approximation methods. But it is more attractive due to its simplicity and efficiency.

TI  - Assessing the Implicit Rain Impact on Sea State During Hurricane Sandy (2012)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most understudied and less understood phenomenon in air-sea interaction studies is the effect of rain on the sea state and in turn the atmosphere's response to this surface forcing. In order to examine the entire process, a new parameterization scheme for rain-induced sea surface roughness was incorporated in the two-way atmosphere-ocean wave coupled system Chemical Hydrological Atmospheric Ocean wave System (CHAOS). The simulation of the late October 2012 Hurricane Sandy indicates that the complex rain-on-ocean effect primarily modifies sea surface roughness and attenuates both the atmospheric flow and the ocean wave growth. The heterogeneity of roughness variations modulates the asymmetry of the hurricane and affects its central pressure and its track as well. Comparing with in situ and remotely sensed data, the consideration of rain-on-ocean effect reduces the root-mean-square error up to 8% and 11% for wind speed and significant wave height, respectively, and finally improves Sandy's track offshore eastern U.S. coastline.Plain Language Summary The atmosphere and the ocean consist of a coupled system, exchanging mass and energy at the air-sea interface and determining Earth's climate characteristics. Understanding and analyzing to which extent the atmosphere and the ocean actually talk to each other is the subject of air-sea interactions. However, one of the most understudied and less understood processes in air-sea interaction studies is the effect of rain on the sea state, which is not currently incorporated in the state-of-the-art modeling systems. The exact knowledge of this complex effect can potentially improve the forecast skill of the weather and the ocean wave predictions supporting in that manner the natural hazards' preparedness and mitigation planning.

TI  - Possible correlation between the vertical component of lithospheric magnetic field and continental seismicity
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent magnetic satellite missions facilitate new birth of large-scale geomagnetic field models and their applications to tectonics. Here, we directly compare the global geomagnetic field models NGDC-720 with the tectonics and seismicity in Mainland China and surroundings. It is found that the tectonics and seismicity in this area show remarkable correlation with the vertical component of lithospheric magnetic field (B-z) calculated at an altitude of 200 km. Previous thought was that earthquakes are more likely to occur in zero B-z belts or in obvious anomaly gradient belts. On the contrary, we find that more than half (53.2%) of the earthquakes occurred in areas with B-z of -5 to -3 nT or in areas with a relatively small horizontal gradient of B-z in the same time interval with the satellite data. The percentage seismic energy in these areas (-5 nT < B-z < -3 nT) is even as high as 94.6%. We explain this unexpected result with a two equivalent source dipole model, arguing that the viscosity difference caused by the temperature gradient within the lithosphere likely accounts for the correlation between magnetic anomalies and seismicity.

TI  - Global Assessment of Supraglacial Debris-Cover Extents
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rocky debris on glacier surfaces influences ice melt rates and the response of glaciers to climate change. However, scarce data on the extent and evolution of supraglacial debris cover have so far limited its inclusion in regional to global glacier models. Here we present global data sets of supraglacial debris-cover extents, based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery. We find that about 4.4% (similar to 26,000 km(2)) of all glacier areas (excluding the Greenland ice sheet and Antarctica) are covered with debris, but that the distribution is heterogeneous. The largest debris-covered areas are located in high-mountain ranges, away from the poles. At a global scale, we find a negative scaling relationship between glacier size and percentage of debris. Therefore, the influence of debris cover on glacier mass balances is expected to increase in the future, as glaciers continue to shrink.Plain Language Summary Most of the melting of land-terminating glaciers occurs at their surface. In mountainous regions, these ice surfaces are often partly covered by rocks and sediments (debris), which can amplify, or reduce, ice melt rates, depending on debris thickness. So far, however, debris cover is rarely taken into account in models of how glaciers respond to climate change. New global data sets of debris-cover extents, based on high-resolution satellite imagery, indicate that similar to 4.4% of all glacier surfaces (excluding the Greenland ice sheet and Antarctica) are covered with debris. Debris cover is particularly common in high and steep mountain ranges but is rare in low-relief landscapes, closer to the poles. Our findings provide a basis for including debris-cover effects in regional to global glacier models.

TI  - Mapping Ice Algal Blooms in Southwest Greenland From Space
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the distribution and abundance of ice algae is fundamental for understanding the evolving processes of algal blooms in supraglacial environments, particularly over the Greenland ice sheet, given the role of algal impurities in modulating surface albedo and meltwater production. Field observations of ice algae in Greenland are very limited over space and time. Here we show for the first time the regional variability in algal abundance across the dark zone in southwest Greenland, derived from Sentinel-3 images acquired during the summertime in 2016 and 2017. We demonstrate the capacity of Sentinel-3 imagery to characterize the spatial pattern of algal abundance using the reflectance ratios between 709- and 673-nm bands, highly consistent with field measurements. The estimated algal abundance reveals a significant linear growth pattern of algal population with time after the peak of dark ice presence, shown to be tightly linked to surface runoff and meltwater production.Plain Language Summary Ice algae bloom plays an important role in enhancing the surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It has been challenging to monitor the development of ice algae at a regional scale with temporally frequent observations. In this study, we map the time series of algal abundance over southwest Greenland from space for the first time, by utilizing the advanced capability of Sentinel-3 satellites in detecting chlorophyll-a, a typical pigment generated by algae. The spatial pattern of algal abundance characterized by Sentinel-3 imagery is highly consistent with field measurements. Our analysis reveals the widespread proliferation of algae on bare ice from late July to mid-August, with increasing algal population over time after the peak of surface runoff and meltwater production. Incorporating the algal distribution derived from satellite data into regional climate models is expected to improve the projection of future mass balance over the Greenland ice sheet.

TI  - An Improved High-Spatial-Resolution Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm for MODIS Images Over Land
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data can play an important role in aerosol retrieval at the global scale due to their short revisit period and long-term observations. The operational MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are severely limited in air quality studies at the city or local scales due to their coarse spatial resolutions. Therefore, an improved aerosol retrieval algorithm for MODIS images at 1-km spatial resolution is proposed in this paper. This algorithm is based on the high-resolution aerosol retrieval algorithm with a priori land surface reflectance database support (HARLS), which was developed over bright urban areas and was subsequently modified and validated over land. For this study, an eight-day surface reflectance database and a seasonal aerosol-type database over land are constructed using the MODIS surface reflectance and aerosol products. Four typical regions (in Europe, North America, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and the Sahara) with different underlying surfaces and aerosol types are selected to perform the aerosol retrieval experiments. The AOD retrievals are validated against the AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) version 2 level 2.0 AOD measurements and compared with the operational MODIS AOD product at 3-km resolution (MOD04_3K). The results show that AOD retrievals adequately match with AERONET AOD measurements, with 79.56%, 72.69%, 74.71%, and 61.01% of the collections falling within the MOD04_3K expected error over land [+/-(0.05 + 20%)] for each of the above-listed regions, respectively. The Improved HARLS (I-HARLS) algorithm performs well overall under different surface conditions, but the data quality gradually decreases with the increase in surface reflectance. Moreover, the I-HARLS algorithm is robust with less bias and can provide more detailed aerosol spatial distributions than those provided by the MOD04_3K AOD product. These results suggest that the I-HARLS algorithm can be used for air-pollution-and climate-related studies at medium or small scales.

TI  - Improving Cloud Optical Property Retrievals for Partly Cloudy Pixels Using Coincident Higher-Resolution Single Band Measurements: A Feasibility Study Using ASTER Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clear-sky contamination is a challenging and long-lasting problem for cloud optical thickness (tau) and effective droplet radius (r(eff)) retrievals using passive satellite sensors. This study explores the feasibility of improving both tau and r(eff) retrievals for partly cloudy (PCL) pixels by using available subpixel samples in a visible to near-infrared band, which many satellite sensors offer. Data are provided by high-resolution reflectance (R) observations and cloud property retrievals by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) at horizontal resolutions between 30-960m. For partly cloudy 960-m observations, the clear-sky component of the pixels induces significant underestimations of up to 58% for tau, while overestimations in r(eff) can exceed 41%. This yields underestimations in the derived liquid water path and cloud droplet number concentration of up to 68% and 72%, respectively. By means of three different assumptions it is shown that subpixel R observations in the visible to near-infrared band can be used to estimate higher-resolution R for the second band in the retrieval scheme, as well as the subpixel cloud cover. The estimated values compare well to actually observed ASTER results and are used to retrieve cloud properties, which are unbiased by the clear-sky component of PCL pixels. While the presented retrieval approach is only evaluated for marine boundary layer clouds, it is computationally efficient and can be easily applied to observations from different imagers. As an example, the PCL retrieval scheme is applied to data by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, where similar biases for PCL pixels are observed.Plain Language Summary Clear-sky contamination is a challenging and long-lasting problem for cloud optical thickness and effective droplet radius retrievals using passive satellite sensors.

TI  - Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery for gastric tumors: Perspective for actual practice and oncological benefits
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) is a surgical technique that combines laparoscopic partial gastrectomy and endoscopic submucosal dissection. LECS requires close collaboration between skilled laparoscopic surgeons and experienced endoscopists. For successful LECS, experience alone is not sufficient. Instead, familiarity with the characteristics of both laparoscopic surgery and endoscopic intervention is necessary to overcome various technical problems. LECS was developed mainly as a treatment for gastric submucosal tumors without epithelial lesions, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Local gastric wall dissection without lymphadenectomy is adequate for the treatment of gastric GISTs. Compared with conventional simple wedge resection with a linear stapler, LECS can provide both optimal surgical margins and oncological benefit that result in functional preservation of the residual stomach. As technical characteristics, however, classic LECS involves intentional opening of the gastric wall, resulting in a risk of tumor dissemination with contamination by gastric juice. Therefore, several modified LECS techniques have been developed to avoid even subtle tumor exposure. Furthermore, LECS for early gastric cancer has been attempted according to the concept of sentinel lymph node dissection. LECS is a prospective treatment for GISTs and might become a future therapeutic option even for early gastric cancer. Interventional endoscopists and laparoscopic surgeons collaboratively explore curative resection. Simultaneous intraluminal approach with endoscopy allows surgeons to optimizes the resection area. LECS, not simple wedge resection, achieves minimally invasive treatment and allows for oncologically precise resection. We herein present detailed tips and pitfalls of LECS and discuss various technical considerations.

TI  - Performances of GPM satellite precipitation over the two major Mediterranean islands
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the reliability of satellite-precipitation products from the Global Precipitation Measurements (GPM) mission in regions with complex landscape morphology. Our analysis is carried out in the European mid-latitude area, namely on the two major islands of Mediterranean Sea, i.e. Sardinia and Sicily (Italy). Both islands experience precipitation originating from the interaction of steep orography on the coasts with winds carrying humid air masses from the Mediterranean Sea. The GPM post real-time IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals from Global Precipitation Measurement) "Final" run product at 0.1 degrees spatial resolution and half-hour temporal resolution have been selected for the two-year 2015-2016 period. Evaluation and comparison of the selected product, with reference to raingauge network data, are performed at hourly and daily time scales using statistical and graphical tools. The influences of morphology and land-sea coastal area transition on the reliability of the GPM product have been analysed.Confirming previous studies, results showed that GPM satellite data slightly overestimate rainfall over the study areas, but they are well correlated with the interpolated raingauge data. Metrics based on occurrences above a given threshold and on total volume above the same threshold were applied and revealed better performances for the latter ones. Applying the same metrics we show how GPM performances improve as the temporal aggregation increases. Several drawbacks were detected in the coastal areas, which were characterized by worse performances than internal areas. Statistics are generally very similar for the two considered case studies (i.e., Sardinia and Sicily) except for correlation between topography and accuracy of GPM products, which was slightly higher for Sardinia.

TI  - Catastrophic storm impact and gradual recovery on the Mississippi-Alabama barrier islands, 2005-2010: Changes in vegetated and total land area, and relationships of post-storm ecological communities with surface elevation
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most destructive tropical cyclones ever to strike the U.S., Hurricane Katrina made landfall along the Mississippi coast on 29th August 2005. The Mississippi-Alabama (MS-AL) barrier islands were subjected to storm breaching, area reduction, and vegetation loss caused by a number of parameters including salt spray, saltwater flooding, mechanical damage (e.g., ablation of bark from tree trunks), removal of plants and their soil substrate by scouring, burial under sand, and a 10-month, post-storm period of low rainfall. Repeated acquisitions of remotely-sensed data served as an essential tool in quantifying vegetated and total land area before and after the storm, and post-storm ecological community type and topographic elevation. Vegetated land area continued to decline on some islands in the first year following the storm. However, by November 2007, only 2.2 years after the storm, total vegetated land area had recovered to 72, 96, 77, 93, and 82%, and total subaerial land area to 97, 94, 33, 100, and 104%, of pre-Katrina values on Cat, W. Ship, E. Ship, Horn, and Petit Bois islands by natural re-growth and sediment accretion, respectively. Comparing ecological community-type maps that were developed from field and remotely-sensed data with LiDAR-derived digital elevation models determined that year 2010 ecological community type changed distinctively at the decimeter scale as mean surface elevation ranged from 0.1 m to 1.2 m. Storm-related changes in ecological community type included subtidal to supratidal sand flat, low marsh to wet or dry herbland, and woodland to wet herbland/shrubland. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Monitoring ecosystem reclamation recovery using optical remote sensing: Comparison with field measurements and eddy covariance
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series remote sensing vegetation indices derived from SPOT 5 data are compared with vegetation structure and eddy covariance flux data at 15 dry to wet reclamation and reference sites within the Oil Sands region of Alberta, Canada. This comprehensive analysis examines the linkages between indicators of ecosystem function and change trajectories observed both at the plot level and within pixels. Using SPOT imagery, we find that higher spatial resolution datasets (e.g. 10 m) improves the relationship between vegetation indices and structural measurements compared with interpolated (lower resolution) pixels. The simple ratio (SR) vegetation index performs best when compared with stem density-based indicators (R-2 = 0.65; p < 0.00), while the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) are most comparable to foliage indicators (leaf area index (LAI) and canopy cover (R-2 = 0.52-0.78; p > 0.02). Fluxes (net ecosystem production (NEP) and gross ecosystem production (GEP)) are most related to NDVI and SAVI when these are interpolated to larger 20 m x 20 m pixels (R-2 = 0.44-0.50; p < 0.00). As expected, decreased sensitivity of NDVI is problematic for sites with LAI > 3 m(2)m(-2),making this index more appropriate for newly regenerating reclamation areas. For sites with LAI < 3 m(2)m(-2), trajectories of vegetation change can be mapped over time and are within 2.7% and 33% of annual measured LAI changes observed at most sites. This study demonstrates the utility of remote sensing in combination with field and eddy covariance data for monitoring and scaling of reclaimed and reference site productivity within and beyond the Oil Sands Region of western Canada.

TI  - Warm season nocturnal rainfall over the eastern periphery of the Tibetan Plateau and its relationship with rainfall events in adjacent regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hourly observational records are used to investigate the distinct nocturnal rainfall and related convection activities over the eastern periphery of the Tibetan Plateau (EPTP). The results show that rainfall events over the EPTP are characterized by frequent moderate rainfall with long durations, which differs from both the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP_E) and the west Sichuan Basin (SCB_W). Although the nocturnal rainfall dominates the warm season rainfall over the EPTP and its adjacent slopes, the midnight rainfall peak is more evident over the slope and basin regions, whereas over the TP_E, the rainfall intensity tends to peak in the late afternoon. An eastwards phase delay is found from the TP_E to the downstream EPTP regions, and the signal is more evident in the intense long-duration rainfall events. To demonstrate the regional characteristics of the rainfall processes over the EPTP and its adjacent areas, a regional rainfall event (RRE) method is applied to consider the spatiotemporal evolution of the rainfall processes. The intense long-duration RREs over the EPTP are selected and classified into two categories, with one related to the early stage rainfall systems in the TP region (RRE_with_TP) and the other not related to the TP rainfall systems (RRE_without_TP). The RRE_with_TP cases are probably related to the propagation of rainfall systems from the plateau. By analysing the convective activity derived from the FY-2 geostationary satellites, evidence of the close relationship between the RRE_with_TP cases and the eastwards propagation of the convective systems that develop over the TP in the late afternoon is shown, whereas the RRE_without_TP cases seem to be more locally initialized or caused by rainfall systems from eastern regions. These results provide more detailed metrics to evaluate model performances over the EPTP region where excessive rainfall has been a long-standing problem in the simulation of the East Asian climate.

TI  - Reconstructing palaeoclimate and hydrological fluctuations in the Fezzan Basin (southern Libya) since 130 ka: A catchment-based approach
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a novel method to evaluate regional palaeoclimate that can be used to alleviate the problems caused by the discontinuous nature of palaeoenvironmental data found in deserts. The technique involves processing satellite imagery and DEM's to map past rivers, catchments and evaluate the areas and volumes of palaeolakes. This information is used to determine the new Lake Evaluation Index (LEI) that allows a qualitative estimate of the amount of sediment received by lakes and how long-lived those lakes are. Lakes with considerable longevity and large sediment stores are selected for study. Validation is performed using image interpretation of remote sensing data, UltraGPR surveys and fieldwork. These techniques are also used to identify and study spring deposits and fluvial landforms that provide valuable palaeoclimate information. The method is applied to the Fezzan Basin in southern Libya focusing on the Wadi ash Shati and Wadi el-Agial catchments. Results indicate that the palaeohydrology is accurately mapped except within dune fields. We analysed the sedimentology of the key deposits identified by this methodology, developing a chronology using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating. We find evidence for relatively humid conditions during MIS 5c/d and e, as well as during the early to middle Holocene. Larger lakes and more extensive river systems were present during MIS 5 than are found during the Holocene, suggestive of greater humidity. The Holocene humid period started at similar to 11 ka and continued until similar to 5 ka being interrupted by abrupt periods of aridity at similar to 8.2 ka and similar to 6 ka that coincide with North Atlantic cooling. After each of these arid events the climate was less humid than previously, suggesting that they were superimposed upon an overall drying trend. The termination of the Holocene humid period in the Sahara has received much scrutiny in recent years, and sediments of Palaeolake Shati provide a continuous record of this. We do not find evidence to support the hypothesis of either sudden or gradual aridification of the Sahara at similar to 5 ka, instead we find that that aridity started to develop at similar to 6.5 ka, whereupon the lake levels oscillated until finally drying-up by 53 ka. Most of the other lakes in the Fezzan also dried up at similar to 5ka. We suggest that thousands of years of aridification prior to 5 ka shrunk these lakes so that additional aridity at this time led to their final desiccation. Because lakes are prodigious dust sources this mechanism potentially explains the rapid rise in dust flux to the Atlantic at 5 ka, with this final drying being the culmination of longer term aridity, albeit overprinted with considerable climate variability.

TI  - Modelling of sand/dust emission in Northern China from 2001 to 2014
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion is a major contributing factor to soil degradation and environmental pollution. As a hot spot of wind erosion, Northern China suffers from severe wind erosion hazards. Besides, there is an ongoing controversy regarding the magnitudes of sand/dust emissions of anthropogenic sources. To understand the mechanism of soil degradation and environmental pollution caused by wind erosion, and to resolve the controversy whether sand/dust emissions is from natural or anthropogenic sources in Northern China, accurate spatio-temporal distributions of sand/dust emission should be obtained. Herein, a wind erosion model with a high spatio-temporal resolution was developed and employed to identify the sand and dust emissions of areas with different land cover types. The sand and dust emission hot spots from 2001 to 2014 were mainly distributed in the Gashun Gobi and Kumutage Deserts, those are all natural areas. In these regions, the average sand and dust emissions exceeded 10,000 kg/m/y (year) and 240 g/m(2)/y, respectively. The intensities of sand and dust emissions demonstrated significant decreasing trends during this time. According to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover data, the average sand/dust emission rates in natural sources were much higher than that in anthropogenic areas, e.g. from 2001 to 2014, the average annual dust emission of Northern China was about 130 Tg/y, and only approximately 3.7% of dust emissions originated from anthropogenic areas. Dust deflation correspondingly caused the entrainment of soil nutrients into atmosphere and result in soil degradation. Our results also show that the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) loss due to wind erosion in Northern China was about 0.9 Tg/y and that 32.5% and 7.5% of the SOC loss originated from grasslands (including woody savannas, savannas, and grasslands) and farmlands (including croplands and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics), respectively. With regard to such severe sand and dust emissions, we believe that the results of this study could provide valuable information for the creation of strategies to cope with wind erosion hazards and measures to control the extent of wind-blown sand. In addition, the proposed model could be of interest to ecological and environmental researchers.

TI  - Comparison of differences in resolution and sources of controlling factors for gully erosion susceptibility mapping
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion has been identified as an important soil degradation process and sediment source, especially in arid and semiarid areas. Thus, it is useful to identify the spatial occurrence of this form of water erosion in the landscape and the most vulnerable areas. In this study, we explored the effects of different pixel sizes on some controlling factors extracted from a digital elevation model and remote sensing data when producing a gully erosion susceptibility map (GESM) of Ekbatan Dam Basin, Hamadan, Iran. An inventory map of the gully landforms was prepared based on global positioning system routes of the gullies, extensive field surveys, and visual interpretations of satellite images obtained from Google Earth. Five data sets with pixel sizes ranging from 2 to 30 m were obtained using topographic attributes and remote sensing data comprising the elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, catchment area, plan curvature, profile curvature, stream power index, topographic position index, topographic wetness index, land use, and normalized difference vegetation index, which can affect the distribution of gully erosion. For each data set, 70% and 30% of the data were selected randomly for calibrating and validating the models, respectively. The statistical relationships between the occurrence of gully erosion and controlling factors were calculated using four machine-learning models, i.e., generalized linear model, boosted regression tree (BRT), multivariate adaptive regression spline, and artificial neural network (ANN). Statistical tests comprising the kappa coefficient and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for both the calibration and validation data sets to estimate the optimal pixel size. The results showed that among the data sets with different pixel sizes, the optimal pixel size was 10 m for each model. In addition, the capacity of the four techniques for modeling gully erosion occurrence was quite stable when the calibration and validation samples were changed in the data set. Finally, based on three changes of the calibration and validation data sets with a pixel size of 10 m, the BRT and ANN models obtained outstanding performance (AUC > 0.9), where they had the highest goodness-of-fit and predictive power, and thus the greatest robustness to changes in the calibration/validation data (i.e., lowest sensitivity to altering calibration/ validation data). Our results demonstrate the importance of selecting a suitable pixel size when producing a GESM for soil and water management practices.

TI  - Improved meteorology and surface fluxes in mesoscale modelling using adjusted initial vertical soil moisture profiles
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) is being used for different and diverse purposes, ranging from atmospheric and dispersion of pollutants forecasting to agricultural meteorology and ecological modelling as well as for hydrological purposes, among others. The current paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the RAMS forecasts, comparing the results not only with observed standard surface meteorological variables, measured at FLUXNET stations and other portable and permanent weather stations located over the region of study, but also with non-standard observed variables, such as the surface energy fluxes, with the aim of evaluating the surface energy budget and its relation with a proper representation of standard observations and key physical processes for a wide range of applications. In this regard, RAMS is assessed against in-situ surface observations during a selected period within July 2011 over Eastern Spain. In addition, the simulation results are also compared with different surface remote sensing data derived from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) (MSG-SEVIRI) as well as the uncoupled Land Surface Models (LSM) Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Both datasets complement the available in-situ observations and are used in the current study as the reference or ground truth when no observations are available on a selected location. Several sensitivity tests have been performed involving the initial soil moisture content, by adjusting this parameter in the vertical soil profile ranging from the most superficial soil layers to those located deeper underground. A refined adjustment of this parameter in the initialization of the model has shown to better represent the observed surface energy fluxes. The results obtained also show an improvement in the model forecasts found in previous studies in relation to standard observations, such as the air temperature and the moisture fields. Therefore, the application of a drier or wetter soil in distinct soil layers within the whole vertical soil profile has been found to be crucial in order to produce a better agreement between the simulation and the observations, thus reiterating the determining role of the initial soil moisture field in mesoscale modelling, but in this case considering the variation of this parameter vertically.

TI  - A proxy-year analysis shows reduced soil temperatures with climate warming in boreal forest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientists unequivocally agree that winter air temperature (T-A) in northern high latitudes will increase sharply with anthropogenic climate change, and that such increases are already pervasive. However, contrasting hypotheses and results exist regarding the magnitude and even direction of changes in winter soil temperature (T-s). Here we use field and satellite data to examine the 'cold soil in a warm world' hypothesis for the first time in the boreal forest using a proxy year approach. In a proxy warm year with a mean annual temperature similar to that predicted for similar to 2080, average winter T-s was reduced relative to the baseline year by 0.43 to 1.22 degrees C in open to forested sites. Similarly, average minimum and maximum winter T-s declined, and the number of freeze-thaw events increased in the proxy warm year, corresponding to a reduction in the number of snow-covered days relative to the baseline year. Our findings indicate that early soil freezing as a result of delayed snowfall and reduced snow insulation from cold winter air are the main drivers of reduced winter active-layer T-s (at similar to 2-cm depth) under warming conditions in boreal forest, and we also show that these drivers interact strongly with forest stand structure.

TI  - Using longitudinal syndromic surveillance to describe small ruminant health in village production systems in Myanmar
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel syndromic surveillance approach was used to describe small ruminant health in Myanmar, to help overcome limitations in disease diagnosis common in many parts of the world, especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Observations were made from July 2015 to June 2016 of ten clinical syndromes in 12 goat herds and sheep flocks owned by smallholders in the Central Dry Zone. Strengths and weaknesses to using syndromic surveillance in a village setting were identified using a formal surveillance evaluation framework, 'SERVAL'. Larger reporting teams made disproportionately more reports than smaller ones (86% compared to 14% of all reports, with a reporting rate ratio of 4.3 95% CI 3.5-5.4), which may have affected surveillance sensitivity. The benefits of the syndromic surveillance included its relatively low cost and ability to produce quantitative disease estimates that could be used to prioritise further disease investigation and extension activities. In particular, significant mortality was observed, with monthly mortality of 3.0% (95% CI 2.5-3.7%) and 0.28% (0.15-0.53%) in young and adult animals, respectively, and a population attributable fraction of mortality for young animals of 82% (68-91%). Mortality was associated with ill-thrift in young animals but had not previously been considered an important production-limiting condition in Myanmar. This information contributes to an understanding of the prevalence of excessive mortality in smallholder goat and sheep production systems. It is a practical example of the use of syndromic surveillance in a LMIC livestock production system, the results of which can direct future disease research, treatment and prevention to improve the health and productivity of small ruminants in Myanmar.

TI  - Effects of water stress on water use efficiency of irrigated and rainfed wheat in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Loess Plateau, the largest arid and semi-arid zone in China, has been confronted with more severe water resource pressure and a growing demand for food production under global changes. For developing sustainable agriculture in this region, it is critical to learn spatiotemporal variations in water use efficiency (WUE) of main crops (e.g. winter wheat in this region) under various water management practices. In this study, we classified irrigated and rainfed wheat areas based on MODIS data, and calculated the winter wheat yield by using an improved light use efficiency model. The actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of winter wheat and the evapotranspiration drought index (EDI) were also investigated. Then we mainly examined the synergistic relationship between crop yield, ETa, and WUE, and analyzed the variations in WUE of irrigated and rainfed wheat under water stress during the 2010-2011 growing season. The results suggested that winter wheat in the Loess Plateau was primarily dominated by fainted wheat. The average yield of irrigated wheat was 3928.4 kg/ha, 22.2% more than that of rainfed wheat. High spatial heterogeneities of harvest index (HI) and maximum light use efficiency (epsilon(max )) were found in the Loess Plateau. The ETa of irrigated wheat was 102% more than that of rainfed wheat. The ratio of irrigated and rainfed wheat under no water stress was 31.55% and 17.16%, respectively. With increasing water stress, the WUE of rainfed wheat decreased more quickly than that of irrigated wheat. The WUE variations in winter wheat under water stress depended strongly on the synergistic effects of two WUE components (crop yield and ETa) and their response to environmental conditions as well as water management practices (irrigated or rainfed). Our findings enhance our current understanding of the variations in WUE as affected by water stress under various water use conditions in arid and semi-arid areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatially variable evapotranspiration over salt affected pistachio orchards analyzed with satellite remote sensing estimates
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent prolonged droughts in California have emphasized the urgent need to implement more efficient water management practices for high value tree crops. Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET), a main component of consumptive water use, is critical for improving management of micro-irrigated pistachio orchards grown in the San Joaquin Valley of California. We estimated ET of three mature commercial pistachio orchards on non-saline and increasingly saline soils in 2015 and 2016, using the Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) method and Landsat 8 satellite observations. Based on a comparison with field observations at 8 sites, we modified the parameterizations of the momentum roughness length and net radiation for pistachio tree crops and reduced the uncertainty of daily ET estimates. When compared with field data, the recalibrated METRIC ET estimates had an R-2 of 0.59, a mean absolute error of 1.1 mm/day, and a RMSE of 1.4 mm/day during Landsat overpass dates (n = 72). The METRIC ET map captured the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity both within and among the orchards. The mean annual crop season estimated ET (mid-March to mid-October in 2016) with remote sensing decreased by 32% from 1064 +/- 99 mm in the non-salt affected control orchard to 725 +/- 82 nun in the orchard with the highest level of soil-water salinity. The ET reduction was consistent with canopy volume differences among the study orchards, as shown by summer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat observations, e.g., 0.72 +/- 0.06 in the control vs. 0.52 +/- 0.06 in the most saline orchard. The available energy was controlled mostly by canopy features and explained 64% of daily ET variation among all Landsat pixels and satellite overpass days. The normalized differenced water index (NDWI) could be considered as an important parameter to capture the partitioning of available energy for ET (R-2 = 0.38), suggesting that the lower soil osmotic potential in saline orchards further reduced crop ET.

TI  - Outdoor air pollution, greenspace, and incidence of ADHD: A semi-individual study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a frequently occurring neurodevelopmental disorder, symptoms of which first appear in early childhood. Etiology of ADHD is not well understood. We investigated whether outdoor air pollution and greenspace affect ADHD incidence in children residing in Saxony.Methods: 66,823 children, all beneficiaries of the statutory health insurance company AOK PLUS and born between 2000 and 2004, were followed until 2014. We considered any child with at least one ICD-10-GM F90 diagnosis by a child/adolescent psychiatrist, neuropaediatrician, or psychotherapist an ADHD case. Children's home addresses were known up to their four-digit postal code area. Population-weighted mean values of particulate matter with diameter of < 10 mu m (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated for 186 postal code areas. Associations with each exposure were assessed by two-level adjusted Poisson regression models.Results: 2044 children (3.06%) were diagnosed with ADHD within the observation period. An increase of PM10 and NO2 by 10 mu g/m(3) raised the relative risk of ADHD by a factor of 1.97 [95% CI: 1.35-2.86] and 1.32 [1.10-1.58], respectively. A 0.1-unit increase in NDVI decreased the relative risk of ADHD by a factor of 0.82 [0.68-0.981. Better access to child/adolescent psychiatrists was the most important confounder that increased ADHD risk across all models.Conclusion: Our results provide some evidence that air pollution might affect ADHD. Future studies with more detailed address information and better control for confounders, in particular socioeconomic status and parental psychopathology, should replicate the observed associations.

TI  - A comparison of Colombian Pacific mangrove extent estimations: Implications for the conservation of a unique Neotropical tidal forest
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental conservation, management, and policy rely on accurate scientific information and interpretation. Dramatic numbers related to the decline of a natural resource often get the attention of the media, and even the scientific community, and propagate through to wider society. Such headline-generating reporting of dramatic environmental loss scenarios can confuse and may result in poor decision making related to the application of funding priorities and policies driven by concerned scientists, environmental groups, and the public. Here we analyze the historical and current estimations of mangrove cover of a relatively pristine mangrove area of the Neotropics along the Colombian Pacific coast. Our comparison reveals highly differing estimates of mangrove coverage based on the methods used since the 1960's. As opposed to what is commonly claimed by some studies, and the media, mangrove cover in this region has likely remained relatively stable, at least over the last 15-years. Estimates constructed between 1966 and 1992 likely overestimate mangrove area due to the lack of high-resolution delineation methods, such as satellite imagery, and a lack of robust defined methodologies. Mangroves along the Pacific coast of Colombia, despite localized losses, likely remain one of the most well preserved tidal forests of the Neotropics. Future analyses of mangrove in this region need to treat with caution earlier estimates of mangrove cover that are likely overestimates based on dated technologies and undefined methodologies.

The increase in air pollution caused by heating in the south-central part of the BTH region is higher than that in the northern part. And the distribution of SO2 and NO2 increment has significant differences. In this work, SO2 and NO2 emissions over the BTH region are determined using an adaptive "nudging" constrained method and a variational processing technique based on Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data and surface measurement data collected in 2015. The application of the method can provide reliable, up-to-date and high-resolution mapping of sources of SO2 and NO2 emissions. These SO2 and NO2 emissions reflect the spatial differences in point and area sources in urban agglomerations and rural areas under different meteorological conditions during the non-heating and heating seasons. The intensity and influence of SO2 and NO2 emissions, particularly those of SO2, are significantly greater during the heating season than those during the non-heating season. Winter increases in SO2 emissions in the northern areas of the NH region are larger than those in the southern part. In addition, significant increases in SO2 emissions occur mainly in suburban and rural areas, while those of NO2 emissions mainly occur in urban agglomerations. In the major urban areas, where coal has been replaced by natural gas or electric power for heating. winter heating causes much smaller increases in SO2 emissions than in other areas. The large amounts of bulk coal consumption in the suburban and rural areas could cause significant regional air pollution. Clear increases in SO2 and NO2 emissions in winter occur along a belt from southern Beijing to Langfang. Baoding, Shijiazhuang and Xingtai. which is consistent with a special "quasi-steady" air pollutant transport belt in the region. All above results show that the adaptive "nudging" constrained emission method could be an effective tool for air pollution control during certain seasons. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization of atmospheric Black Carbon over a semi-urban site of Southeast India: Local sources and long-range transport
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous measurements of Black Carbon (BC) mass concentration using an advanced multi wavelength Aethalometer (AE-33) during January-December 2016 were carrried out, for the first time, at the premises of KL University, Vijayawada (16.44 degrees N, 80.62 degrees E, 30 m amsl), a semi-urban site in the southeast India. The estimates of the percentage contribution of Biomass Burning (BB%) aerosols to total BC concentration is utilised to understand the contribution of anthropogenic activities over the observational site. In this context, the diurnal and seasonal variation of BC mass concentrations and BB (%) contributions have been investigated and the possible sources are examined. A significant diurnal variation in BC concentration is observed with two prominent peaks, one occuring in the morning hours (around 0800-0900 IST) and the other occuring in the evening hours (around 2000 IST). Annually, the maximum BC concentration is observed during November (6.88 +/- 156 mu g m(-3)) and minimum during August (1.7 +/- 0.52 mu g m(-3)) over this location. On a seasonal scale, mean BC mass concentration is highest during winter (DJF, 4.68 +/- 1.32 mu g m(-3)) followed by post-monsoon (SON, 4.52 +/- 2.36 mu g(-3)), summer (MAM, 2.44 +/- 0.8 mu g m(-3)) and lowest during monsoon (JJA, 183 +/- 0.61 mu g m(-3)). The higher BB (%) contribution is observed during summer (25.21 +/- 7.02%), while the contribution is minimum in monsoon season (16.83 +/- 4.15%). Examination of the spectral properties of aerosol absorption in terms of angstrom ngstrom exponent (alpha) indicates that the major contributor of BC over this location is biomass burning (alpha similar to 1.66 +/- 0.06). This is supported by the higher number of fire counts (obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-MODIS onboard Terra satellite) in and around the study region during winter and summer revealing the higher contribution of BB aerosols. The concentration weighted trajectories (CWT) analysis (based on 5-day airmass back trajectories arriving the receptor site at an altitude of 500 m AGL) reveals that synoptic airmasses arriving from the continental regions located northeast of the observational sites mainly influence the BC properties over Vijayawada.

TI  - Increasing extent and intensity of thunderstorms observed over the Congo Basin from 1982 to 2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies found a long-term drought and resulting declines in vegetation greenness and canopy water content over the Congo Basin, the second largest rainforest in the world after the Amazon. Since most precipitation in tropical latitudes stems from convection, this paper analyzed 35 years of high-resolution (8 km spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution) satellite data to document the long-term trends in the number, size and intensity of thunderstorms activity over the Congo Basin during April, May, and June (AMJ) for the period 1982-2016. Changes in the magnitude and area of cold cloud top brightness temperatures (T-b) at different thresholds were used as a proxy to quantify the number and size of individual thunderstorms at different intensities. We found that the areal extent and intensity of thunderstorms increased over the past 35 years, particularly over Northern Congo Basin, and these changes are consistent with other satellite datasets. Combined with a reanalysis dataset, our work suggests that thunderstorms over the Congo Basin are becoming taller and wider, and likely resulting in a moister (drier) upper (lower) troposphere.

AB  - A 43-year-old perimenopausal woman who recently received a diagnosis of breast cancer visited her physician for follow-up after lumpectomy and axillary-node dissection, in which specimens of 12 lymph nodes were obtained. There was a positive finding only in the sentinel node. She is undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. The patient is concerned about the development of lymphedema. She wonders what she can do to minimize the risk of this complication and how it would be managed if it were to develop. She has no coexisting conditions and no symptoms related to the arms. Her body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) is 29. There is no detectable swelling on physical examination. How would you advise this patient?

TI  - How well do meteorological drought indices predict live fuel moisture content (LFMC)? An assessment for wildfire research and operations in Mediterranean ecosystems
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical variable affecting fire ignition, behavior and severity in many ecosystems. Although the use of meteorological drought indices as proxies for LFMC is a straightforward and widespread approach, it is largely unknown whether it can provide reliable estimates of LFMC, either for local or spatial applications. We address this issue by evaluating the capacity of drought indices to predict LFMC quantitative variations and critical values. LFMC observations used for reference were measured on six different Mediterranean shrub species for 15 years in 20 different sites in Southern France. Six drought indices were evaluated: the Duff Moisture Code (DMC) and Drought Code (DC) of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System, the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), the Nesterov Index (NI) and the Relative Water Content (RWC) of the soil derived from a forest water balance model for low (80 mm) and high (160 mm) field capacities. The species were classified in two groups according to their seasonal variability: high and low responding species. We found large differences in the capacity of drought indices to predict LFMC, with indices that simulate long-term drought dynamics (DC, RWC and KBDI) generally performing better than others (NI and DMC). Once calibrated at stand scale, drought indices showed a good potential for predicting LFMC of high responding species, although large variations between sites were observed. In contrast, spatial predictability was limited with a RMSE and 11 on the order of 20% and 0.3, respectively (for high responding species). Our results suggest that drought indices should therefore be used with caution for spatial applications in wildfire research and operational fire management. Because they can explicitly consider environmental (soil, climate) and biological (species traits related to dehydration) factors, mechanistic indices have a great potential to improve LFMC predictions.

TI  - Transient deformation during the Milashan Tunnel construction in northern Sangri-Cuona Rift, southern Tibet, China observed by Sentinel-1 satellites
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Using 3-year Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, we observed prominent ground subsidence around the construction site of the Milashan Tunnel, which is on top of the northern Sangri-Cuona Rift (SCR) in southern Tibet. The most deformed area extends similar to 7 km in the north-south direction and similar to 6 km in the east-west direction, with a peak subsidence rate of over 10 mm/a in the line of sight direction of both the descending and ascending satellites. Aside from the long-term ground subsidence arising directly from underground water outflow and rock excavation, a regional aseismic fault slip episode is also evident. The aseismic slip event began in May 2016 and ended in July 2016. The surface aseismic displacements can be explained by normal faulting with mainly down-dip movement and a modest right-lateral strike-slip component on a nearly north-south trending fault. The aseismic deformation triggered by the Milashan Tunnel construction demonstrates the sensitive response of crustal-scale tectonics to human activity, which poses high seismic hazards for the heavily populated region.

TI  - MERIS observations of phytoplankton phenology in the Baltic Sea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The historical data from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is an invaluable archive for studying global waters from inland lakes to open oceans. Although the MERIS sensor ceased to operate in April 2012, the data capacities are now re-established through the recently launched Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). The development of a consistent time series for investigating phytoplankton phenology features is crucial if the potential of MERIS and OLCI data is to be fully exploited for inland water monitoring. This study presents a time series of phytoplankton abundance and bloom spatial extent for the highly eutrophic inland water of the Baltic Sea using the 10-year MERIS archive (2002-2011) and a chlorophyll-a based Summed Positive Peaks (SPP) algorithm. A gradient approach in conjunction with the histogram analysis was used to determine a global threshold from the entire collection of SPP images for identifying phytoplankton blooms. This allows spatio-temporal dynamics of daily bloom coverage, timing, phytoplankton abundance and spatial extent to be investigated for each Baltic basin. Furthermore, a number of meteorological and hydrological variables, including spring excess phosphate, summer sea surface temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, were explored using boosted regression trees and generalised additive models to understand the ecological response of phytoplankton assemblages to environmental perturbations and potential predictor variables of summer blooms. The results indicate that the surface layer excess phosphate available in February and March had paramount importance over all other variables considered in governing summer bloom abundance in the major Baltic basins. This finding allows new insights into the development of early warning systems for summer phytoplankton blooms in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil organic carbon prediction based on scale-specific relationships with environmental factors by discrete wavelet transform
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) is vital to agricultural and environmental management, and its variation is influenced by environmental factors operating at different scales and intensities. The objective of this study was to explore the scale-dependent effects of environmental factors on SOC distribution and to predict SOC based on their scale-specific relationships using wavelet transform. The spatial data of SOC, slope, soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), sand, silt, and Landsat 8 remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were extracted at 330 m interval along three transects in the arable land of Taiyuan basin, China. The spatial series of SOC and environmental variables along each of three transects were separated into six detail components and one approximation representing different scales using wavelet decomposition. The specific scale of each detail component was identified by Hilbert transform. The SOC variances over the entire basin were mainly explained (54%-86%) by scales of 12.70 and 21.12 km. Compared with the relationships between SOC and environmental factors at sampling scale, their multiscale correlations were better at larger scales. The SOC estimation using wavelet reconstruction based on predicted SOC at all scale components outperformed its prediction using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) based on the original sampling data. The major contributing scale to SOC prediction was 12.70 km over the entire basin. In the prediction of overall SOC, Rrs was the major predictor in the upstream and downstream portions, whereas soil texture was the major contributor in the midstream portion. In this study, the SOC prediction using wavelet transform based on scale-dependent relationships with environmental variables generated new insights in soil properties estimation, and wavelet transform has potential for determining the multiscale relationships of soil properties with influencing factors.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - The presence of tumor cells can be identified in the lymph node when metastasis has occurred from the primary cancer site into the lymph node (1) If the sentinel lymph node ganglion is negative for the presence of tumor cells at the time of histological examination, the other lymph nodes are also negative in 99% of cases. If no tumor cells are identified in the sentinel lymph node ganglion by histological examination, the other lymph nodes are also negative for the presence of tumor cells in 99% of cases. The sentinel lymph node advantageously replaces axillary dissection as a staging method in breast cancer T1 and T2 (2). Approximately 40% of breast cancers metastasize to axillary lymph nodes and metastatic extension depends on disease stage. Sentinel lymph nodes are affected in the following stages: T1a (4.3%), T1b (19.5%), T1c (23.8%), T2 (48.9%), T3 (66.7%).

TI  - The value of satellite remote sensing soil moisture data and the DISPATCH algorithm in irrigation fields
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture measurements are needed in a large number of applications such as hydro-climate approaches, watershed water balance management and irrigation scheduling. Nowadays, different kinds of methodologies exist for measuring soil moisture. Direct methods based on gravimetric sampling or time domain reflectometry (TDR) techniques measure soil moisture in a small volume of soil at few particular locations. This typically gives a poor description of the spatial distribution of soil moisture in relatively large agriculture fields. Remote sensing of soil moisture provides widespread coverage and can overcome this problem but suffers from other problems stemming from its low spatial resolution. In this context, the DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange (DISPATCH) algorithm has been proposed in the literature to downscale soil moisture satellite data from 40 to 1 km resolution by combining the low-resolution Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite soil moisture data with the high-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) datasets obtained from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. In this work, DISPATCH estimations are compared with soil moisture sensors and gravimetric measurements to validate the DISPATCH algorithm in an agricultural field during two different hydrologic scenarios: wet conditions driven by rainfall events and wet conditions driven by local sprinkler irrigation. Results show that the DISPATCH algorithm provides appropriate soil moisture estimates during general rainfall events but not when sprinkler irrigation generates occasional heterogeneity. In order to explain these differences, we have examined the spatial variability scales of NDVI and LST data, which are the input variables involved in the downscaling process. Sample variograms show that the spatial scales associated with the NDVI and LST properties are too large to represent the variations of the average soil moisture at the site, and this could be a reason why the DISPATCH algorithm does not work properly in this field site.

TI  - Publications as predictors of racial and ethnic differences in NIH research awards
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research expands efforts to understand differences in NIH funding associated with the self-identified race and ethnicity of applicants. We collected data from 2,397 NIH Biographical Sketches submitted between FY 2003 and 2006 as part of new NIH R01 Type 1 applications to obtain detailed information on the applicants' training and scholarly activities, including publications. Using these data, we examined the association between an NIH R01 applicant's race or ethnicity and the probability of receiving an R01 award. The applicant's publication history as reported in the NIH biographical sketch and the associated bibliometrics narrowed the black/white funding gap for new and experienced investigators in explanatory models. We found that black applicants reported fewer papers on their Biosketches, had fewer citations, and those that were reported appeared in journals with lower impact factors. Incorporating these measures in our models explained a substantial portion of the black/white funding gap. Although these predictors influence the funding gap, they do not fully address race/ethnicity differences in receiving a priority score.

TI  - Do users benefit from additional information in support of operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin?
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We follow a user-based approach to examine how information supports operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin and how these can benefit from additional information such as from remote sensing data. First we consulted decision-makers at basin, irrigation district and farmer scale to investigate the drought-related decisions they make and the information they use to support their decisions. This allowed us to identify the courses of action available to the farmers and water managers, and to analyse their choices as a function of the information they have available to them. Based on the findings of the consultation, a decision model representing the interrelated decisions of the irrigation association and the farmers was built. The purpose of the model is to quantify the effect of additional information on the decisions made. The modelled decisions, which consider the allocation of water, are determined by the expected availability of water during the irrigation season. This is currently informed primarily by observed reservoir level data. The decision model was then extended to include additional information on snow cover from remote sensing. The additional information was found to contribute to better decisions in the simulation and ultimately higher benefits for the farmers. However, the ratio between the cost of planting and the market value of the crop proved to be a critical aspect in determining the best course of action to be taken and the value of the (additional) information. Risk-averse farmers were found to benefit least from the additional information, while less risk-averse farmers stand to benefit most as the additional information helps them take better informed decisions when weighing their options.

T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent scientific developments are advancing to link land use and land cover (LULC) change with ecosystem service (ES) potentials. Such links within peri-urban ecosystems are scanty due to methodological and expertise challenge, and data limitation. The study applies the 'ES matrix approach' to spatially display potentials for regulating ES in mainly overlooked data-scarce peri-urban areas, whereby LULC classes and qualitative ES values are the main data inputs. The LULC maps are based on LANDSAT satellite images from the years 1990, 2000 and 2010. ES potentials were assessed qualitatively on a relative scale ranging between 0 and 5 by use of interview data from local people. Results show that with exception of settlements, the area for all LULC classes decreased between 1990 and 2010. The 'matrix approach' successfully generated ES potential maps for the different LULC classes. Grasslands, forests and wetlands have comparatively high potentials for regulating ES, whereas settlements and 'otherlands' showed lower potentials. The main uncertainties of the study relate to study area selection, data accuracy and reliability, and 'matrix approach' adaptability. Results indicate that the potential of the area to provide regulating ES is declining over time. To realize suitable and reliable results, it is necessary to conduct data accuracy-check during and after the fieldwork exercise.

TI  - Generation and analysis of a new global burned area product based on MODIS 250 m reflectance bands and thermal anomalies
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper presents a new global burned area (BA) product, generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectances and thermal anomaly data, thus providing the highest spatial resolution (approx. 250 m) among the existing global BA datasets. The product includes the full times series (2001-2016) of the Terra-MODIS archive. The BA detection algorithm was based on monthly composites of daily images, using temporal and spatial distance to active fires. The algorithm has two steps, the first one aiming to reduce commission errors by selecting the most clearly burned pixels (seeds), and the second one targeting to reduce omission errors by applying contextual analysis around the seed pixels. This product was developed within the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, under the Fire Disturbance project (Fire_cci). The final output includes two types of BA files: monthly full-resolution continental tiles and biweekly global grid files at a degraded resolution of 0.25 degrees. Each set of products includes several auxiliary variables that were defined by the climate users to facilitate the ingestion of the product into global dynamic vegetation and atmospheric emission models. Average annual burned area from this product was 3.81 Mkm(2), with maximum burning in 2011 (4.1 Mkm(2)) and minimum in 2013 (3.24 Mkm(2)) The validation was based on a stratified random sample of 1200 pairs of Landsat images, covering the whole globe from 2003 to 2014. The validation indicates an overall accuracy of 0.9972, with much higher errors for the burned than the unburned category (global omission error of BA was estimated as 0.7090 and global commission as 0.5123). These error values are similar to other global BA products, but slightly higher than the NASA BA product (named MCD64A1, which is produced at 500 m resolution). However, commission and omission errors are better compensated in our product, with a tendency towards BA underestimation (relative bias -0.4033), as most existing global BA products. To understand the value of this product in detecting small fire patches (< 100 ha), an additional validation sample of 52 Sentinel-2 scenes was generated specifically over Africa. Analysis of these results indicates a better detection accuracy of this product for small fire patches (< 100 ha) than the equivalent 500 m MCD64A1 product, although both have high errors for these small fires. Examples of potential applications of this dataset to fire modelling based on burned patches analysis are included in this paper. The datasets are freely downloadable from the Fire_cci website (https://www.esa-fire-cci.org/, last access: 10 November 2018) and their repositories (pixel at full resolution: https://doi.org/cpk7, and grid: https://doi.org/gcx9gf).

TI  - Observations of positive sea surface temperature trends in the steadily shrinking Dead Sea
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing warming of steadily shrinking Dead Sea surface water compensates for surface water cooling (due to increasing evaporation) and even causes observed positive Dead Sea sea surface temperature trends. This warming is caused by two factors: increasing daytime heat flow from land to sea (as a result of the steady shrinking) and regional atmospheric warming. Using observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), positive trends were detected in both daytime and nighttime Dead Sea sea surface temperature (SST) over the period of 2000-2016. These positive SST trends were observed in the absence of positive trends in surface solar radiation, measured by the Dead Sea buoy pyranometer. We also show that long-term changes in water mixing in the uppermost layer of the Dead Sea under strong winds could not explain the observed SST trends. There is a positive feedback loop between the positive SST trends and the steady shrinking of the Dead Sea, which contributes to the accelerating decrease in Dead Sea water levels during the period under study. Satellite-based SST measurements showed that maximal SST trends of over 0.8 degrees C decade(-1) were observed over the northwestern and southern sides of the Dead Sea, where shrinking of the Dead Sea water area was pronounced. No noticeable SST trends were observed over the eastern side of the lake, where shrinking of the Dead Sea water area was insignificant. This finding demonstrates correspondence between the positive SST trends and the shrinking of the Dead Sea indicating a causal link between them. There are two opposite processes taking place in the Dead Sea: sea surface warming and cooling. On the one hand, the positive feedback loop leading to sea surface warming every year accompanied by long-term increase in SST; on the other hand, the measured acceleration of the Dead Sea water-level drop suggests a long-term increase in Dead Sea evaporation accompanied by a long-term decrease in SST. During the period under investigation, the total result of these two opposite processes is the statistically significant positive sea surface temperature trends in both daytime (0.6 degrees C decade(-1)) and nighttime (0.4 degrees C decade(-1)), observed by the MODIS instrument. Our findings of the existence of a positive feedback loop between the positive SST trends and the shrinking of the Dead Sea imply the following significant point: any meteorological, hydrological or geophysical process causing the steady shrinking of the Dead Sea will contribute to positive trends in SST. Our results shed light on continuing hazards to the Dead Sea.

TI  - Impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction and genotypic characteristics of rotavirus strains in children less than 5 years of age with gastroenteritis in Ethiopia: 2011-2016
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: A monovalent rotavirus vaccine was introduced in the Ethiopian Expanded Program on Immunization from November 2013. We compared impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction on rotavirus associated acute diarrhea hospitalizations and genotypic characteristics of rotavirus strains pre-and post-vaccine introduction.Methods: Sentinel surveillance for diarrhea among children <5 years of age was conducted at 3 hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 2011 to 2017. Stool specimens were collected from enrolled children and tested using an antigen capture enzyme immunoassay. Rotavirus positive samples (156 from pre- and 141 from post-vaccination periods) were further characterized by rotavirus genotyping methods to identify the predominant G and P types circulating during the surveillance era.Results: A total of 788 children were enrolled during the pre- (July 2011-June 2013) and 815 children during the post-vaccination (July 2014-June 2017) periods. The proportion of diarrhea hospitalizations due to rotavirus among children <5 years of age declined by 17% from 24% (188/788) in the pre-vaccine period and to 20% (161/185) in post-vaccine introduction era. Similarly, a reduction of 18% in proportion of diarrhea hospitalizations due to rotavirus in children <12 months of age in the post (27%) vs pre-vaccine (33%) periods was observed. Seasonal peaks of rotavirus declined following rotavirus vaccine introduction. The most prevalent circulating strains were G12P[8] in 2011 (36%) and in 2012 (27%), G2P[4] (35%) in 2013, G9P[8] (19%) in 2014, G3P[6] and G2P[4] (19% each) in 2015, and G3P[8] (29%) in 2016.Discussion: Following rotavirus vaccine introduction in Ethiopia, a reduction in rotavirus associated hospitalizations was seen in all age groups with the greatest burden in children <12 months of age. A wide variety of rotavirus strains circulated in the pre- and post-vaccine introduction periods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing biotic contributions to CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in northern China using the Vegetation, Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM-CHINA) and observations from 2005 to 2009
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately quantifying the spatiotemporal distribution of the biological component of CO2 surface-atmosphere exchange is necessary to improve top-down constraints on China's anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We provide hourly fluxes of CO2 as net ecosystem exchange (NEE; mu molCO(2)m(-2)s(-1)) on a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid by adapting the Vegetation, Photosynthesis, and Respiration Model (VPRM) to the eastern half of China for the time period from 2005 to 2009; the minimal empirical parameterization of the VPRM-CHINA makes it well suited for inverse modeling approaches. This study diverges from previous VPRM applications in that it is applied at a large scale to China's ecosystems for the first time, incorporating a novel processing framework not previously applied to existing VPRM versions. In addition, the VPRM-CHINA model prescribes methods for addressing dual-cropping regions that have two separate growing-season modes applied to the same model grid cell. We evaluate the VPRM-CHINA performance during the growing season and compare to other biospheric models. We calibrate the VPRM-CHINA with ChinaFlux and FluxNet data and scale up regionally using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model v3.6.1 meteorology and MODIS surface reflectances. When combined with an anthropogenic emissions model in a Lagrangian particle transport framework, we compare the ability of VPRM-CHINA relative to an ensemble mean of global hourly flux models (NASA CMS - Carbon Monitoring System) to reproduce observations made at a site in northern China. The measurements are heavily influenced by the northern China administrative region. Modeled hourly time series using vegetation fluxes prescribed by VPRM-CHINA exhibit low bias relative to measurements during the May-September growing season. Compared to NASA CMS subset over the study region, VPRM-CHINA agrees significantly better with measurements. NASA CMS consistently underestimates regional uptake in the growing season. We find that during the peak growing season, when the heavily cropped North China Plain significantly influences measurements, VPRM-CHINA models a CO2 uptake signal comparable in magnitude to the modeled anthropogenic signal. In addition to demonstrating efficacy as a low-bias prior for top-down CO2 inventory optimization studies using ground-based measurements, high spatiotemporal resolution models such as the VPRM are critical for interpreting retrievals from global CO2 remote-sensing platforms such as OCO-2 and OCO-3 (planned). Depending on the satellite time of day and season of crossover, efforts to interpret the relative contribution of the vegetation and anthropogenic components to the measured signal are critical in key emitting regions such as northern China - where the magnitude of the vegetation CO2 signal is shown to be equivalent to the anthropogenic signal.

TI  - The CALIPSO version 4 automated aerosol classification and lidar ratio selection algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) version 4.10 (V4) level 2 aerosol data products, released in November 2016, include substantial improvements to the aerosol subtyping and lidar ratio selection algorithms. These improvements are described along with resulting changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD). The most fundamental change in the V4 level 2 aerosol products is a new algorithm to identify aerosol subtypes in the stratosphere. Four aerosol subtypes are introduced for stratospheric aerosols: polar stratospheric aerosol (PSA), volcanic ash, sulfate/other, and smoke. The tropospheric aerosol subtyping algorithm was also improved by adding the following enhancements: (1) all aerosol subtypes are now allowed over polar regions, whereas the version 3 (V3) algorithm allowed only clean continental and polluted continental aerosols; (2) a new "dusty marine" aerosol subtype is introduced, representing mixtures of dust and marine aerosols near the ocean surface; and (3) the "polluted continental" and "smoke" subtypes have been renamed "polluted continental/smoke" and "elevated smoke", respectively. V4 also revises the lidar ratios for clean marine, dust, clean continental, and elevated smoke subtypes. As a consequence of the V4 updates, the mean 532 nm AOD retrieved by CALIOP has increased by 0.044 (0.036) or 52 % (40 %) for nighttime (daytime). Lidar ratio revisions are the most influential factor for AOD changes from V3 to V4, especially for cloud-free skies. Preliminary validation studies show that the AOD discrepancies between CALIOP and AERONET-MODIS (ocean) are reduced in V4 compared to V3.

T2  - Ugeskrift for laeger
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Danish women. In Denmark, mammography screening has been implemented since 2010. The surgical approach has turned from mastectomy and axillary clearance to breast conserving surgery and sentinel node procedure. The development of radiotherapy is heading towards shorter treatment periods and more precise targeting leading to reduced toxicity. Genomic profiling aims at giving a more personalised adjuvant medical treatment with a high predictive chance of response. Nowadays, more women are offered neoadjuvant treatment, where the systemic treatment is delivered before surgery in order to downsize the disease and reduce surgical treatment.

TI  - Impact of maternal ART on mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV at six weeks postpartum in Rwanda
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn 2010, Rwanda adopted ART for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV from pregnant women living with HIV during pregnancy and breasfeeding period. This study examines rates of mother-to-child-transmission of HIV at 6-10weeks postpartum and risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) among HIV infected women on ART during pregnancy and breastfeeding.MethodsA cross-sectional survey study was conducted between July 2011-June 2012 among HIV-exposed infants aged 6-10weeks and their mothers/caregivers. Stratified multi-stage, probability proportional to size and systematic sampling to select a national representative sample of clients. Consenting mothers/caregivers were interviewed on demographic and program interventions. Dry blood spots from HIV-exposed infants were collected for HIV testing using DNA PCR technique. Results are weighted for sample realization. Univariable analysis of socio-demographic and programmatic determinants of early mother-to-child transmission of HIV was conducted. Variables were retained for final multivariable models if they were either at least of marginal significance (p-value <0.10) or played a confounding role (the variable had a noticeable impact >10% change on the effect estimate).ResultsThe study sample was 1639 infants with HIV test results. Twenty-six infants were diagnosed HIV-positive translating to a weighted MTCT estimate of 1.58% (95% CI 1.05-2.37%). Coverage of most elimination of MTCT (EMTCT) program interventions, was above 80, and 90.4% of mother-infant pairs received antiretroviral treatment or prophylaxis. Maternal ART and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis (OR 0.01; 95%CI 0.001-0.17) and maternal age older than 25years were significantly protective (OR 0.33; 95%CI 0.14-0.78). No disclosure of HIV status, not testing for syphilis during pregnancy and preterm birth were significant risk factors for MTCT. Factors suggesting higher socio-demographic status (flush toilet, mother self-employed) were borderline risk factors for MTCT.ConclusionART for all women during pregnancy and breastfeeding was associated with the estimated low MTCT rate of 1.58%. Mothers who did not receive a full package of anti-retroviral therapy according to the Rwanda EMTCT protocol, and young and single mothers were at higher risk of MTCT and should be targeted for support in preventing HIV infection.

TI  - An index of non-sampling error in area frame sampling based on remote sensing data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural areas are often surveyed using area frame sampling. Using non-updated area sampling frame causes significant non-sampling errors when land cover and usage changes between updates. To address this problem, a novel method is proposed to estimate non-sampling errors in crop area statistics. Three parameters used in stratified sampling that are affected by land use changes were monitored using satellite remote sensing imagery: (1) the total number of sampling units; (2) the number of sampling units in each stratum; and (3) the mean value of selected sampling units in each stratum. A new index, called the non-sampling error by land use change index (NELUCI), was defined to estimate non-sampling errors. Using this method, the sizes of cropping areas in Bole, Xinjiang, China, were estimated with a coefficient of variation of 0.0237 and NELUCI of 0.0379. These are 0.0474 and 0.0994 lower, respectively, than errors calculated by traditional methods based on non-updated area sampling frame and selected sampling units.

TI  - Identification and Normalization of Image Gain of FY-3A MERSI Shortwave Infrared Bands
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium-resolution spectral imager (MERSI) obtains global image and radiation data from the second generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, FY-3A, launched by China. However, the on-orbit gain levels of imager in shortwave infrared bands occasionally jump due to the unpredictability of space environment and other factors. Such phenomena limit the quantitative application of the data. The space view is selected to identify gain jumps based on the analysis of MERSI observation targets, such as space view, visible onboard calibrator, and blackbody. Automatic identification, gain classification, and level normalization arc proposed as methods. The daily identification and intraday precision detection methods arc combined to obtain the time and space of gain jumps, and the classified statistical method contraposing the data of gain jumps is used to obtain the on-orbit gain levels. In addition, the onboard calibration source targets and Earth view images arc used to verify the normalized effect. The 91 gain jumps of 1.64 mu m and 18 gain jumps of 2.13 mu m arc accurately positioned during the lifetime. In addition, the eight on-orbit gain levels and the levels of all gain jumps arc obtained. The results revealed that the normalized effect is ideal. Further, the most gain jumps occur during the Earth view scanning process and the gain jump time varied between the detectors. Because of the complexity of the Earth view targets, it is difficult to realize the normalization of the image of the jumping frame based on the physical methods. These results contribute to the improvement of FY-3A MERSI image quality and play an important role in reprocessing historical data.

TI  - Fuzzy risk assessment modelling of wild animal life in Bijar protected area
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bijar protected area (BPA) is suffering from land use change and livestock grazing. Since 1977, the number of main species (Ovis orientalis gmelini) living in BPA has reduced from 2000 to 435. In order to study the wild animal life (WAL) risk of BPA, a Fuzzy model in Geographical information system (GIS) environment and remote sensing was utilized. The seven selected input indices for the model were 'BPA conversion rate', 'Natural resource, 'Population density', 'Population growth rate', 'Social status', 'Security threat', and 'Livelihood status'. BPA conversion rate was obtained based on Landsat 8 Satellite images of 2016 and agricultural area maps of BPA villages. The weight and Fuzzy rules ranges of the sub-indices were created based on an expert opinion survey (questionnaire) developed according to the related literature. Sub-indices were union in vector format in the GIS environment to acquire the main indices and they were overly in raster format based on Fuzzy membership functions to obtain the WAL risk in three levels of high, moderate and low. Results showed that the areas with high risk were (i) agricultural lands, (ii) lands that underwent use change (rangelands to agricultural lands), (iii) areas with a large number of livestock, (iv) areas within the proximity to roads, and (v) areas far from the protected stations. From the results it can be concluded that low level of livelihood, low number of protective stations and weak protective regulations are the main reasons behind increasing WAL risk in BPA.

TI  - Review of Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder
T2  - CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - To measure the global atmospheric three-dimensional distribution and change of temperature and humidity is one of the key areas in atmospheric remote sensing detection; it is also a new research and development direction in the field of meteorological satellite application. As a main element of China second generation of geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun 4 (FY-4), which was launched on Dec. 11, 2016, the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) is the first interferometric infrared sounder working on geostationary orbit internationally. It is used for vertical atmospheric sounding and gains atmospheric temperature, humidity, and disturbances. The combination of Fourier transform spectrometer technology and infrared detectors makes GIIRS have high spectral resolution and large coverage over spatial areas. With this kind of instrument, meteorological satellites can improve the capabilities for severe weather event monitoring and numerical weather prediction. Here a concise review of the GIIRS development project, including its history, missions and functions, technical design, key technologies, system integration, calibration and in-orbit operation status, etc., is presented.

TI  - Comparison and Analysis of Gaussian Decomposition and Gaussian Wavelet Decomposition for GLAS Full Waveform Data
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Full waveform data decomposition is critical to obtain the effective information of tested object from the large-spot laser altimetry data. Gaussian decomposition and wavelet decomposition arc two universal methods to achieve the full waveform data decomposition in the large-spot laser altimetry currently. However, the decomposition effect and accuracy arc ambiguity for different echo signals of ground objects. In this paper, the two methods arc applied to the full waveform data of the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), and the waveforms of several typical ground objects in flat and slop areas arc decomposed. The results arc analyzed and compared qualitatively and quantitatively according to the index of goodness-of-fit and the iteration times of achieving the best goodness-of-fit. The results show that the Gaussian decomposition and Guassian wavelet decomposition arc nearly same for the accuracy of best goodness-of-fit. With the increase of the complexity of the ground objects, the iteration times of achieving the best goodness-of-fit with the Gaussian decomposition is less than that with the Gaussian wavelet decomposition.

TI  - Completing missing exam scores with structural information and beyond
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Score missing is a common problem involved in exam datasets due to, for example, the absence of students from a test, major-transfer, accidental deletion by operators, etc. Incomplete data tend to bring great inconvenience to analysis, comparison, and evaluation, which may further affect the reliability of the final conclusion and the subsequent decision-making (e.g., adjustment of the teaching plan). Although, in principle, most of the existing data completion methods can be directly used on the exam score dataset, to our best knowledge, there is no systematic evaluation on these methods for the score completion problem. Moreover, the general completion methods cannot effectively employ the special structural information in the score dataset (e.g., the order structure in the students and the relationship between different subjects). Therefore, (1) we conduct a comparative study on the mainstream data completion methods for estimating the missing values in score datasets, (2) we propose an easy-to-implement score completion method by explicitly using informative structures in the dataset, which achieves the best estimation/prediction accuracy with a high efficiency. Beyond the exam scores, we also verify the flexibility of our proposed method in completing remote sensing data. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017
T2  - LANCET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk outcome associations.Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017.Findings In 2017,34.1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 33.3-35.0) deaths and 121 billion (144-1.28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61.0% (59.6-62.4) of deaths and 48.3% (46.3-50.2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10.4 million (9.39-11.5) deaths and 218 million (198-237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7.10 million [6.83-7.37] deaths and 182 million [173-193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6.53 million [5.23-8.23] deaths and 171 million [144-201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4.72 million [2.99-6.70] deaths and 148 million [98.6-202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1.43 million [1.36-1.51] deaths and 139 million [131-147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4.9% (3.3-6.5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23.5% decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18.6% increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low.Interpretation By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.

TI  - Object-based urban landcover mapping methodology using high spatial resolution imagery and airborne laser scanning
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping landcover in cities is essential for urban ecology and landuse management, yet urban landcover is often highly heterogeneous at fine spatial scales. Pixel-based approaches are shown to be less successful for effectively mapping urban landcover due to high heterogeneity, with relatively low accuracies reported despite the use of high spatial resolution optical imagery. Alternatively, geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) has yielded higher accuracies across a range of urban applications. We combine three-dimensional (3-D) information from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with RapidEye high-spatial-resolution imagery in a GEOBIA approach to classify urban landcover in a large metropolitan region in Vancouver, Canada. Results indicate that 12 urban classes could be accurately mapped at 2-m spatial resolution across 150,000 ha with an overall accuracy of 88% (kappa 0.87). Though 5-m RapidEye multispectral pixels were often mixed in heterogeneous urban areas, the additional insight provided by the 3-D ALS information enabled accurate classification of fine spatial objects such as street trees and single-family dwellings.

TI  - Education and philosophy in R. F. Holland's <i>Against Empiricism</i>: A reassessment
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In his 1980 book Against Empiricism: On Education, Epistemology and Value, British philosopher R. F. Holland (1923-2013) exposes the inadequacies of a philosophy of education originating from an empiricist worldview. By following Plato's view that the issue of what qualifies as knowledge has to be understood with reference to whether it is teachable, Holland's critique of empiricism highlights the social and communal dimensions of education. The primary objective of this paper is to offer a reassessment of Holland's thoughts on education and value. To do so, I first discuss Holland's use of Plato's ideas in his article 'Epistemology and Education' to demonstrate that Holland's position can offer us a fruitful way to diagnose common, prevalent educational practices. I then turn to look at Holland's views on value and morality. To illustrate how his thoughts on education can be seen to be relevant to the contemporary world, I explore and criticize some implicit presuppositions on knowledge in the 2011 box-office hit Limitless. The conceptual dimension of Holland's take on education is then examined alongside with some recent trends in epistemology and philosophy of education.

TI  - Estimation of rational polynomial coefficients based on singular value decomposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rational function model (RFM) has been widely used in space-borne photogrammetry owing to its simplicity and generality. One of the key issues for using the RFM is to robustly estimate the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). However, owing to over-parameterization of the RFM, estimating the RPCs is an ill-posed problem. A feasible method for estimating the RPCs based on singular value decomposition is presented. The presented method can estimate the RPCs directly based on an observation vector and three matrices decomposed from the design matrix. Consequently, the numerical instability of computing the inverse matrix of the ill-conditioned normal matrix can be avoided. Experimental results of the SPOT-5, ZiYuan-3, and GaoFen-2 images show that the presented method can benefit the terrain-dependent and terrain-independent scenarios. Under the terrain-dependent scenario, the influence of the observation errors of actual ground control points (GCPs) can be eliminated effectively and the RPCs can be estimated robustly by selecting a proper regularization parameter and truncating some small singular values. Under the terrain-independent scenario, owing to a very important characteristic that the virtual GCPs do not have observation errors, the presented method can estimate the RPCs robustly even without the selection of the regularization parameter.

TI  - Small Mountainous Rivers Generate High-Frequency Internal Waves in Coastal Ocean
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency internal waves propagating offshore in small river plumes are regularly observed at satellite imagery in many world regions. In this work we describe a mechanism of generation of these internal waves by discharges of small and rapid rivers inflowing to coastal sea. Friction between river runoff at high velocity and the subjacent sea of one order of magnitude lower velocity causes abrupt deceleration of a freshened flow and increase of its depth, i.e., a hydraulic jump is formed. Transition from supercritical to subcritical flow conditions induces generation of high-frequency internal waves that propagate off a river mouth at a stratified layer between a buoyant river plume and subjacent ambient sea and influence turbulence and mixing at this layer. Basing on in situ and satellite data we estimated wavelengths, phase speeds, and frequencies of internal waves generated in small river plumes located off the northeastern coast of the Black Sea. This process is typical for many other world mountainous regions where numerous and closely spaced small and rapid rivers inflow to sea during high discharge periods and can strongly influence, first, structure and dynamics of river plumes and, second, physical, biological, and geochemical processes in adjacent coastal areas.

TI  - A host immune hormone modifies parasite species interactions and epidemics: insights from a field manipulation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasite epidemics can depend on priority effects, and parasite priority effects can result from the host immune response to prior infection. Yet we lack experimental evidence that such immune-mediated priority effects influence epidemics. To address this research gap, we manipulated key host immune hormones, then measured the consequences for within-host parasite interactions, and ultimately parasite epidemics in the field. Specifically, we applied plant immune-signalling hormones to sentinel plants, embedded into a wild host population, and tracked foliar infections caused by two common fungal parasites. Within-host individuals, priority effects were altered by the immune-signalling hormone, salicylic acid (SA). Scaling up from within-host interactions, hosts treated with SA experienced a lower prevalence of a less aggressive parasite, increased burden of infection by a more aggressive parasite, and experienced fewer co-infections. Together, these results indicate that by altering within-host priority effects, host immune hormones can drive parasite epidemics. This study therefore experimentally links host immune hormones to within-host priority effects and parasite epidemics, advancing a more mechanistic understanding of how interactions among parasites alter their epidemics.

TI  - A case of radiation-associated angiosarcoma after breast cancer
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiation-associated angiosarcoma (RAAS) is a rare subtype of secondary angiosarcoma that is characterized by rapid proliferation and extensive tissue infiltration. Although various treatments for RAAS (such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy) have been reported, there is no consensus as to which approach is the best.A 76-year-old woman presented with right breast cancer (T1N0M0, stage I) 9 years ago. She had undergone breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy and was receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the malignancy. Six years after presenting with the tumor, she developed pigmented skin and was diagnosed with a RAAS; this angiosarcoma recurred three times within 2 years. The angiosarcoma was resected each of the three times, after which adjuvant radiation therapy was performed. At 76 years old, the patient developed a new mass on her chest skin in the vicinity of the scar. Angiosarcoma was diagnosed following a pathology report, which resulted in a second diagnosis of recurrent RAAS again since the diagnostic criteria were met. After extensive resection of the irradiated area, the patient has remained free of angiosarcoma for the last 3 years.Resection of the entire irradiated field is critical for successful treatment of RAAS.

TI  - Prey abundance and urbanization influence the establishment of avian predators in a metropolitan landscape
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization causes the simplification of natural habitats, resulting in animal communities dominated by exotic species with few top predators. In recent years, however, many predators such as hawks, and in the US coyotes and cougars, have become increasingly common in urban environments. Hawks in the Accipiter genus, especially, are recovering from widespread population declines and are increasingly common in urbanizing landscapes. Our goal was to identify factors that determine the occupancy, colonization and persistence of Accipiter hawks in a major metropolitan area. Through a novel combination of citizen science and advanced remote sensing, we quantified how urban features facilitate the dynamics and long-term establishment of Accipiter hawks. Based on data from Project FeederWatch, we quantified 21 years (1996-2016) of changes in the spatio-temporal dynamics of Accipiter hawks in Chicago, IL, USA. Using a multi-season occupancy model, we estimated Cooper's (Accipiter cooperii) and sharp-shinned (A. striatus) hawk occupancy dynamics as a function of tree canopy cover, impervious surface cover and prey availability. In the late 1990s, hawks occupied 26% of sites around Chicago, but after two decades, their occupancy fluctuated close to 67% of sites and they colonized increasingly urbanized areas. Once established, hawks persisted in areas with high levels of impervious surfaces as long as those areas supported high abundances of prey birds. Urban areas represent increasingly habitable environments for recovering predators, and understanding the precise urban features that drive colonization and persistence is important for wildlife conservation in an urbanizing world.

TI  - Effects of Single and Combined Water, Sanitation and Handwashing Interventions on Fecal Contamination in the Domestic Environment: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial in Rural Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions have varying effectiveness in reducing fecal contamination in the domestic environment; delivering them in combination could yield synergies. We conducted environmental assessments within a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh that implemented single and combined water treatment, sanitation, handwashing (WSH) and nutrition interventions (WASH Benefits, NCT01590095). After one and two years of intervention, we quantified fecal indicator bacteria in samples of drinking water (from source or storage), child hands, children's food and sentinel objects. In households receiving single water treatment interventions, Escherichia coli prevalence in stored drinking water was reduced by 50% and concentration by 1-log. E. coli prevalence in food was reduced by 30% and concentration by 0.5-log in households receiving single water treatment and handwashing interventions. Combined WSH did not reduce fecal contamination more effectively than its components. Interventions did not reduce E. coli in groundwater, on child hands and on objects. These findings suggest that WSH improvements reduced contamination along the direct transmission pathways of stored water and food but not along indirect upstream pathways. Our findings support implementing water treatment and handwashing to reduce fecal exposure through water and food but provide no evidence that combining interventions further reduces exposure.

TI  - A global dataset of air temperature derived from satellite remote sensing and weather stations
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Air temperature at 2m above the land surface is a key variable used to assess climate change. However, observations of air temperature are typically only available from a limited number of weather stations distributed mainly in developed countries, which in turn may often report time series with missing values. As a consequence, the record of air temperature observations is patchy in both space and time. Satellites, on the other hand, measure land surface temperature continuously in both space and time. In order to combine the relative strengths of surface and satellite temperature records, we develop a dataset in which monthly air temperature is predicted from monthly land surface temperature for the years 2003 to 2016, using a statistical model that incorporates information on geographic and climatic similarity. We expect this dataset to be useful for various applications involving climate monitoring and land-climate interactions.

TI  - Using Polyurethane Foam-Based Passive Air Sampling Technique to Monitor Monosaccharides at a Regional Scale
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monosaccharides are important tracers of pollution aerosol from biomass burning. Air sampling of monosaccharides is often conducted using active samplers. However, applicability of sampling monosaccharides using polyurethane foam passive air samplers (PUF-PASs) has not been investigated, since passive air samplers are often applied to monitor semivolatile organic contaminants in large scale and remote area. Our study successfully collected atmospheric monosaccharides using PUF-PASs, providing a valuable tool for monosaccharides sampling. PUF-PAS sampling rates for individual monosaccharides were calibrated using an active sampler for 92 days, and were 1.1, 1.5, and 1.1 m(3)/d for levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan, respectively. Degradation of monosaccharides in PUF-PAS was demonstrated to be negligible by spike test of C-13-labeled levoglucosan. Furthermore, passive sampling was carried out at 11 sites in the Pearl River Delta of Southern China from January to April and July to September of 2015. Monosaccharide concentrations derived from PUF-PASs were comparable with the reported data obtained by active sampling, demonstrating that the PUF-PAS approach is valid for monosaccharides monitoring. On the basis of our approach, we found that there is a clear correlation between the monosaccharide concentrations and the MODIS fire activities during January-April.

TI  - Consideration of NDVI thematic changes in density analysis and floristic composition of Wadi Yalamlam, Saudi Arabia
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wadi Yalamlam is known as one of the significant wadis in the west of Saudi Arabia. It is a very important water source for the western region of the country. Thus, it supplies the holy places in Mecca and the surrounding areas with drinking water. The floristic composition of Wadi Yalamlam has not been comprehensively studied. For that reason, this work aimed to assess the wadi vegetation cover, life-form presence, chorotype, diversity, and community structure using temporal remote sensing data. Temporal datasets spanning 4 years were acquired from the Landsat 8 sensor in 2013 as an early acquisition and in 2017 as a late acquisition to estimate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes. The wadi was divided into seven stands. Stands 7, 1, and 3 were the richest with the highest Shannon index values of 2.98, 2.69, and 2.64, respectively. On the other hand, stand 6 has the least plant biodiversity with a Shannon index of 1.8. The study also revealed the presence of 48 different plant species belonging to 24 families. Fabaceae (17 %) and Poaceae (13 %) were the main families that form most of the vegetation in the study area, while many families were represented by only 2 % of the vegetation of the wadi. NDVI analysis showed that the wadi suffers from various types of degradation of the vegetation cover along with the wadi main stream.

TI  - Virtual mortality and near-death experience after a prolonged exposure in a shared virtual reality may lead to positive life-attitude changes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mortality is an obvious if uncomfortable part of the human condition, yet it is impossible to study its impact on anyone who experiences it. Reports of phenomena associated with death such as out-of-the-body (OBE) and near death experiences (NDE) can only be studied post-hoc, since it is impossible to design a scientific study where an experimental group experiences death (and returns) and a control group does not. Yet NDEs seem to have a profound influence on the subsequent lives of people and are therefore worthy of study. Terror Management Theory, which argues that death anxiety contributes to in-group solidarity and hostility to out-groups, relies on studies that manipulate opinions and cannot be based on experiential evidence. Here we introduce a potential methodology that uses immersive virtual reality (VR) for the study of mortality and NDEs. Participants are embodied in alternate bodies in a beautiful island along with two companions. They explore the island and carry out tasks together. The mechanism of embodiment produces strong illusions of ownership over their life-sized virtual bodies. Over time each participant witnesses the death of the two companions and then her own death-which includes the reported features of an NDE (OBE, life review, the tunnel leading to white light) followed by a period of observation of the continuing activities in the virtual world on an external screen. Fifteen female participants experienced 6 sessions in the island, each starting as a child and gradually maturing, and eventually ageing and dying. Sixteen control subjects formed a waiting group. We introduce this as a methodology for the study of these issues, and present promising results, suggesting that those who experienced the island report life attitude changes, becoming more concerned with others and more interested in global rather than material issues compared to the control group. The results are based on a small sample size, and should be considered as indicative of the possibilities of this new methodology as a way forward for future studies in this field.

TI  - Building extraction method based on the spectral index for high-resolution remote sensing images over urban areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of high-resolution remote sensing images, automatic building extraction methods play a more important role in rapidly acquiring information about large-scale buildings. Although advanced building extraction methods have been introduced to improve building extraction results, these methods involve complex processing and high-computation times. We put forward an effective method to extract building information, based on a proposed spectral building index. The basic idea of the spectral building index is to generate an optimized index based on the computation and analysis of spectral bands, which are beneficial for image enhancement for buildings in images Aiming at the band number of the multispectral satellite images in high-resolution remote sensing images, we propose two spectral indices for building extraction, including the normalized spectral building index (NSBI) and the difference spectral building index (DSBI). Considering the current spectral band number of high-resolution satellite images, NSBI is suited for satellite images with eight spectral bands, whereas DSBI is suited for satellite images with four spectral bands. The proposed method is validated on various high-resolution images including WorldView-2, GF-1, GF-2, and QuickBird images with 13 experiment datasets, as well as a detailed comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, such as the morphological building index, nonhomogeneous feature difference, and building condition index. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method can achieve promising results for different building conditions, such as regular and irregular building shapes and concrete and metal roofing materials. The average overall accuracy was over 85% with low-time consumption (<1 s). (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Towards risk-based flood management in highly productive paddy rice cultivation - concept development and application to the Mekong Delta
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is an imminent natural hazard threatening most river deltas, e.g. the Mekong Delta. An appropriate flood management is thus required for a sustainable development of the often densely populated regions. Recently, the traditional event-based hazard control shifted towards a risk management approach in many regions, driven by intensive research leading to new legal regulation on flood management. However, a large-scale flood risk assessment does not exist for the Mekong Delta. Particularly, flood risk to paddy rice cultivation, the most important economic activity in the delta, has not been performed yet. Therefore, the present study was developed to provide the very first insight into delta-scale flood damages and risks to rice cultivation. The flood hazard was quantified by probabilistic flood hazard maps of the whole delta using a bivariate extreme value statistics, synthetic flood hydrographs, and a large-scale hydraulic model. The flood risk to paddy rice was then quantified considering cropping calendars, rice phenology, and harvest times based on a time series of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from MODIS satellite data, and a published rice flood damage function. The proposed concept provided flood risk maps to paddy rice for the Mekong Delta in terms of expected annual damage. The presented concept can be used as a blueprint for regions facing similar problems due to its generic approach. Furthermore, the changes in flood risk to paddy rice caused by changes in land use currently under discussion in the Mekong Delta were estimated. Two land-use scenarios either intensifying or reducing rice cropping were considered, and the changes in risk were presented in spatially explicit flood risk maps. The basic risk maps could serve as guidance for the authorities to develop spatially explicit flood management and mitigation plans for the delta. The land-use change risk maps could further be used for adaptive risk management plans and as a basis for a cost-benefit of the discussed land-use change scenarios. Additionally, the damage and risks maps may support the recently initiated agricultural insurance programme in Vietnam.

TI  - Assessing the calibration differences in the reflective solar bands of Terra MODIS and Landsat-7 enhanced thematic mapper plus
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term data records obtained from Earth observing sensors depend not only on the calibration accuracy of individual sensors but also on the consistency across instruments and platforms. Hence, sensor calibration intercomparison plays a vital role for a better understanding of various science products. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) on the Terra and Landsat 7 platforms have operated successfully since their launch, collecting measurements in the reflective solar and infrared parts of the spectrum. Terra MODIS has employed a reflectance-based calibration since beginning its mission. In the case of ETM+, a radiance-based calibration was employed until recent years, when a reflectance-based calibration was introduced. Being in the AM constellation with less than 30 min difference in overpass times, near-simultaneous Earth scene measurements can be effectively used to assess the calibration differences between the spectrally matching bands of these two instruments. The pseudoinvariant calibration sites (PICS) in the North African desert are widely used for on-orbit calibration and validation of satellite sensors. Four PICS from this region have been employed to assess the multitemporal reflectance differences. Correction for bidirectional reflectance, spectral response function mismatch, and impacts of atmospheric water-vapor have been incorporated to provide an assessment of the long-term stability of each spectral band and reflectance differences amongst them. Results indicate that the spectral bands of both instruments show a long-term stability to within 2% from 2000 to 2017. The top-of-atmosphere reflectances between the two instruments postcorrection agree to within 4%. Also included in this paper is a detailed discussion of various parameters contributing to the uncertainties of this cross-calibration. The techniques presented in this paper can be further extended to perform similar intercomparison between Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, Aqua MODIS, and Suomi-NPP VIIRS.

TI  - Variations in the extent and elevation of the Larsen A and B ice shelves, Antarctica, derived from multiple datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurements of retreat and progressive lowering of ice shelves are critical for estimating the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet under projected warming. Ice shelf extent was extracted from declassified aerial photographs and modern satellite images (Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer imagery), and a 48-year time series of the areal extents of the Larsen A ice shelf (LAIS) and the Larsen B ice shelf (LBIS) was compiled. In addition, we characterize the surface elevation changes of the LAIS and LBIS over the last two decades by combining the Ocean Topography Experiment/Poseidon and the Envisat Radar Altimeter-2 using the collinear analysis method. The Larsen ice shelf displayed no significant changes until the late 1980s, whereas the LAIS has retreated rapidly since 1986, and the LBIS has followed a similar pattern since the early 1990s. The LAIS and LBIS have already diminished by similar to 14,000 km(2) in total since 1968. As the ice shelves retreated, the surface elevations of the LAIS and LBIS exhibited progressive lowering from 1992 to 2010, with the lowering rate of the LAIS significantly greater than that of the LBIS. The remaining ice of the LAIS was lowered at a rate of 0.45 m a(-1) from 1992 to 2001, and the remnant LBIS was lowered at a rate of 0.07 m a(-1) from 1992 to 2010. In response to the continuous retreat of the LAIS and LBIS, their surface elevations are very sensitive to the collapse and retreat of the ice shelves.

TI  - 5-Year survival after splenectomy in a patient with recurrent cutaneous melanoma: a case report
T2  - ACTA CHIRURGICA BELGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Splenic metastases of melanoma are uncommon and generally part of a disseminated disease with a poor prognosis. In case of solitary visceral metastasis, surgical resection often remains an effective treatment. This case describes a long-term survival after splenectomy for a recurrent melanoma. Methods: We present a 55-year-old female with a solitary splenic metastasis. Her medical history revealed a melanoma of the foot in 2007 and an in-transit metastasis in 2011. A PET-CT revealed in 2012 the presence of a small aspecific lesion in the spleen. Close follow-up was chosen. Since PET-CT and MRI showed a progressive lesion, a laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. Results: Histological report confirmed the diagnosis of a metastatic lesion. Sixty months after the first radiographic evidence of the splenic metastasis, follow-up revealed no signs of residual disease. Conclusions: Although current systemic approaches demonstrate to provide clinically important benefit, patients with oligometastatic disease should be evaluated for surgical metastasectomy. A laparoscopic approach for splenic metastasis is shown to be a safe treatment. This disease-free survival of 60 months in a patient with a history of an in-transit metastasis has not been published before. A splenectomy for a solitary metastasis could prolong the survival, even in a recurrent melanoma.

TI  - Wave run-up prediction and observation in a micro-tidal beach
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events bear a significant impact on coastal human activities and on the related economy. Forecasting and hindcasting the action of sea storms on piers, coastal structures and beaches is an important tool to mitigate their effects. To this end, with particular regard to low coasts and beaches, we have developed a computational model chain based partly on open-access models and partly on an ad-hoc-developed numerical calculator to evaluate beach wave run-up levels and flooding. The offshore wave simulations are carried out with a version of the Wave-Watch III model, implemented by CCMMMA (Campania Centre for Marine and Atmospheric Monitoring and Modelling - University of Naples Parthenope), validated with remote-sensing data. The waves thus computed are in turn used as initial conditions for the run-up calculations, carried out with various empirical formulations; the results were finally validated by a set of specially conceived video-camerabased experiments on a micro-tidal beach located on the Ligurian Sea. Statistical parameters are provided on the agreement between the computed and observed values. It appears that, while the system is a useful tool to properly simulate beach flooding during a storm, empirical run-up formulas, when used in a coastal vulnerability context, have to be carefully chosen, applied and managed, particularly on gravel beaches.

TI  - Investigation of the success of monitoring slow motion landslides using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and GNSS methods
T2  - SURVEY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine deformations in landslide areas with two methods, Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). In the Koyulhisar landslide area, 53 GNSS points were established throughout the region. Velocity values for these points are three-dimensional. In addition, TerraSAR-X SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images were processed with Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers software. Slip surfaces of the landslide region in the direction of the line of sight were calculated from PSI in addition to one-dimensional velocity values. These values were compared to GNSS data converted to the same format. GNSS was found more effective for tracking local deformations based on point data while PSI was better at areal movements. Using both methods together is the most effective in this region because there are small local movements independent of regional movements.

TI  - Changes in Day and Night Temperatures and Their Asymmetric Effects on Vegetation Phenology for the Period of 2001-2016 in Northeast China
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Asymmetrical changes in day and night temperatures (Td, Tn) have become a hot topic in climate change research. Using the MODIS 8-day synthetic temperature (MOD11A2) and the SPOT-VGT/PROBA_V 10-day synthetic normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), we analyzed the spatiotemporal trends of Td and Tn in spring and autumn in Northeast China during the period of 2001-2016 and the partial correlation between temperature and vegetation phenology (start of season, SOS; end of season, EOS). We revealed that spring Td was the main negative factor pertaining to SOS. An increasing Td resulted in a delayed SOS in arid and semiarid regions, while in boreal areas, an increasing Td ensured the heat required for vegetation growth and prompted the SOS to advance. Conversely, EOS was positively correlated with Tn in autumn. Areas showing positive correlations between Tn and EOS totaled 73.26%, and 14.19% of the areas had a significant correlation (p<0.05). However, the effects of Td on EOS were not as significant as Tn, and only at a 10.62% correlation did Td achieve significance, which was mostly attributable to areas of high elevation and latitude. Our results are crucial for future improvements in dynamic vegetation activities in response to climate change.

TI  - Outcome of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with clinically non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the rate of occult SN metastases, oncological outcome, and association of recurrence with the pattern of lymphatic tumour drainage in RCC.Materials and methods: A pooled RCC sub-group analysis was conducted of secondary endpoints from a published feasibility and a phase II prospective single-arm SN study to investigate oncological outcome. Patients with cT1-3 (<10 cm) cN0M0 RCC of any sub-type were enrolled. After intratumoural injection of Tc-99m nanocolloid, pre-operative imaging of SNs with SPECT/CT was followed by (partial) nephrectomy with SN and regional lymph node dissection using a gamma-probe. The patients were followed with a risk-adapted surveillance programme. Endpoints of the studies were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models.Results: Sixty-six RCC patients were included. Two patients (3%, 95% CI =0.5-11%) had occult SN metastases and remained free of disease at 57 and 72 months. Ten patients (15%, 95% CI =7-26%) developed recurrences, and four (6%, 95% CI =2.3-14.5%) had died of disease at a median follow-up of 57 months (IQR =18-72 months). Occurrence of distant metachronous metastases were associated with tumour size (HR =1.39, p = 0.02), pT stage (HR =6.83, p < 0.01 for comparison T1 vs T3/4), Grade 3/4 (HR =8.38, p = 0.05 for comparison 1/2 vs 3/4) and interaortocaval sentinel lymph node location (HR =10.52, p = 0.03 for comparison yes vs no).Conclusions: The rate of occult metastatic SN is low, but long disease-free survival (DFS) was observed in two patients with occult SN metastases. We hypothesize an interaortocaval lymphatic route in thoracic recurrences. Evaluation of the prognostic and therapeutic role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) requires a clinical trial in high-risk RCC.

T2  - SURVEY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the 3 July 2015 (M-w=6.4) earthquake that affected Pishan County in Xinjiang, China. Using Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR), we mapped the near-field surface displacement of this event to better characterize the seismic source parameters. The inverted results suggest that a conjugate fault system could produce very similar deformation patterns as those observed in both ascending and descending InSAR observations, and the south-dipping fault is selected as the optimal fault responsible for the event. The selected fault was concentrated on a thrust fault with a strike of 112 degrees, a dip of 25 degrees and an average rake angle of 89 degrees. The InSAR analysis reveals a fragmentation of the Western Kunlun north margin fault, and the overall deformation of the seismogenic fault is characterized by thrust motion, which is consistent with the transpressional tectonic characteristics of the major faults in this region.

TI  - Large-scale subpixel mapping of landcover from MODIS imagery using the improved spatial attraction model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping plastic-mulched landcover (PML) is an important agricultural monitoring task. Because of its daily revisiting, imagery from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been widely used to detect PML over a large area. However, the coarse spatial resolution and small field size make subpixel PML a problem for accurate PML mapping from MODIS. This study applies the improved spatial attraction model (ISAM), which estimates the spatial attraction of the central subpixel of a moving window by all subpixels in the window, to map large-scale subpixel PML from MODIS imagery. The linear spectral mixing model is used to obtain fractions of PML and three other landcover classes in each MODIS pixel as the inputs to ISAM for obtaining the hard subpixel PML maps at spatial resolution of 31.25 m. The accuracy evaluation, with validated landcover classification derived from Landsat-8 imagery as the ground truth, shows that overall accuracy, Kappa coefficients, producer accuracy, and user accuracy are 83.51%, 0.69, 90.97%, and 81.51%, respectively, indicating large-scale PML mapping at spatial resolution comparable to Landsat-8 can be derived from MODIS images with acceptable accuracy by ISAM. This study provides a practical and economic way for mapping PML for a large area at similar to 30-m spatial resolution. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Fusion of deep learning with adaptive bilateral filter for building outline extraction from remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solving the problem of building extraction from remote sensing images, which have high spatial resolution, is considered to be one of the most challenging issues in the field of photogrammetry science and remote sensing. The purpose of this study is to present an innovative algorithm, named adaptive bilateral filter (ABF) + segment-based neural network, which is based on the fusion of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and adaptive ABF and has resulted in improvements in the accuracy of building extraction from remote sensing images with high spatial resolution. The building extraction process in this study includes the following steps: applying the ABF to the research data set and optimizing its parameters in order to improve the building outlines, designing, and training the DCNN, SegNet, based on the improved data set and optimizing it using an adaptive moment estimation algorithm and assessing the impact of applying the ABF + SegNet algorithm to automatic building outline extraction. The proposed algorithm in this study is tested on three sets of remote sensing data from the cities of Potsdam, Indianapolis, and Tehran. The results indicate that the ABF + SegNet algorithm is able to extract the buildings from remote sensing color images with suitable accuracy.

TI  - Influence of Incidence Angle in the Correlation of C-band Polarimetric Parameters with Biophysical Variables of Rain-fed Crops
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-temporal field experiment was conducted within the Soil Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS) in Spain in order to retrieve useful crop information. The objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of polarimetric observations for crop monitoring by exploiting a time series of 20 quad-pol RADARSAT-2 images at different incidence angles (i.e. 25 degrees, 31 degrees, and 36 degrees) during an entire growing season of rain-fed crops, from February to July 2015. The time evolution of 6 crop biophysical variables was gathered from the field measurements, whereas 10 polarimetric parameters were derived from the images. Thus, a subsequent correlation analysis between both datasets was performed. The study demonstrates that the backscattering ratios (HH/VV and HV/VV), the normalized correlation between HH and VV ((HHVV)), and the dominant alpha angle ((1)), showed significant and relevant correlations with several biophysical variables such as biomass, height, or leaf area index (LAI) at incidence angles of 31 degrees or 36 degrees. The joint use of data acquired with different beams could be exploited effectively to increase the refresh rate of information about crop condition with respect to a single incidence acquisition scheme.

TI  - Evaluation of Chinese Quad-polarization Gaofen-3 SAR Wave Mode Data for Significant Wave Height Retrieval
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our work describes the accuracy of Chinese quad-polarization Gaofen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wave mode data for wave retrieval and provides guidance for the operational applications of GF-3 SAR. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of the SAR-derived significant wave height (SWH) from 10,514 GF-3 SAR images with visible wave streaks acquired in wave mode by using the existing wave retrieval algorithms, e.g., the theoretical-based algorithm parameterized first-guess spectrum method (PFSM), the empirical algorithm CSAR_WAVE2 for VV-polarization, and the algorithm for quad-polarization (Q-P). The retrieved SWHs were compared with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis field with 0.125 degrees grids. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the SWH is 0.57 m, found using CSAR_WAVE2, and this RMSE value was less than the RMSE values for the analysis results achieved with the PFSM and Q-P algorithms. The statistical analysis also indicated that wind speed had little impact on the bias with increasing wind speed. However, the retrieval tended to overestimate when the SWH was smaller than 2.5 m and underestimate with an increasing SWH. This behavior provides a perspective of the improvement needed for the SWH retrieval algorithm using the GF-3 SAR acquired in wave mode.

TI  - Using Data Mining for Predicting Cultivable Uncultivated Regions in the Middle East
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Middle-East region is mostly characterized by a hot and dry climate, vast deserts and long coastlines. Deserts cover large areas, while agricultural lands are described as small areas of arable land under perennial grass pastures or crops. In view of the harsh climate and falling ground-water level, it is critical to identify which agriculture produce to grow, and where to grow it? The traditional methods used for this purpose are expensive, complex, prone to subjectivity, risky and are time-consuming; this points to the need of exploring novel IT techniques using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this paper, we present a data-driven stand-alone flexible analysis environment i.e., Spatial Prediction and Overlay Tool (SPOT). SPOT is predictive spatial data mining GIS tool designed to facilitate decision support by processing and analysing agro-meteorological and socio-economic thematic maps and generating crop cultivation geo-referenced prediction maps by predicative data mining. In this paper, we present a case study of Saudi Arabia by using decade old wheat cultivation data, and compare the historically uncultivated regions predicted by SPOT with their current cultivation status. The prediction results were found to be promising after verification in time and space using latest satellite imagery followed by on-site physical ground verification using GPS.

TI  - Characterisation of emission from open-field burning of crop residue during harvesting period in north-west India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Open-field crop residue burning is one of the important sources of atmospheric pollution in north-west India during the harvesting period. In this work, we studied NO2 and SO2 concentrations and physical and chemical properties of aerosols from open-field combustion of rice and wheat residue. NO2 and SO2 were analysed using UV-spectrophotometer and ion chromatography (IC) respectively. The aerosol particles were analysed by scan electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) for their physical dimension (size distribution) and elemental composition, and by IC for their ionic content. The measured concentrations of gases during burning showed rice straw burning spews more NO2 and SO2 than wheat straw burning. The calculated size of the particles ranged from 0.26 to 151.09m with high standard deviation. The median diameter of 1.64m (+/- 6.9) represented the central tendency of the particles emitted due to this combustion process. Comparative content analysis revealed that rice-borne particles are richer in Na, K, Al, Si and Zn, whereas, wheat-borne particles are more abundant in C, Mg, Fe, P and Cl. The results from IC and SEM-EDX evidenced the presence of fluoride, sulphate, carbonate, chloride, oxides and silicate compounds in particles. The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols with this particle chemistry increases the atmospheric opacity through the absorption and scattering of incoming radiation at a significant amount in the UV-IR range causing high aerosol optical depth (AOD).

TI  - Assessing fire hazard potential and its main drivers in Mazandaran province, Iran: a data-driven approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are a major disturbance to forest ecosystems and socioeconomic activities in Mazandaran province, northern Iran, particularly in the Hyrcanian forest sub-region. Mapping the spatial distribution of fire hazard levels and the most important influencing factors is crucial to enhance fire management strategies. In this research, MODIS hotspots were used to represent fire events covering Mazandaran Province over the period 2000-2016. We applied the ecological niche theory through the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method to estimate fire hazard potential and the association with different anthropogenic and biophysical conditions, by applying different modeling approaches (heuristic, permutation, and jackknife metrics). Our results show that higher fire likelihood is related to density of settlements, distance to roads up to 3km and to land cover types associated with agricultural activities, indicating a strong influence of human activities in fire occurrence in the region. To decrease fire hazard, prevention activities related to population awareness and the adjustment of farming practices need to be considered.

TI  - Beyond GIS Layering: Challenging the (Re)use and Fusion of Archaeological Prospection Data Based on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource remote sensing data acquisition has been increased in the last years due to technological improvements and decreased acquisition cost of remotely sensed data and products. This study attempts to fuse different types of prospection data acquired from dissimilar remote sensors and explores new ways of interpreting remote sensing data obtained from archaeological sites. Combination and fusion of complementary sensory data does not only increase the detection accuracy but it also increases the overall performance in respect to recall and precision. Moving beyond the discussion and concerns related to fusion and integration of multisource prospection data, this study argues their potential (re)use based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) fusion models. The archaeological site of Veszt-Magor Tell in the eastern part of Hungary was selected as a case study, since ground penetrating radar (GPR) and ground spectral signatures have been collected in the past. GPR 20 cm depth slices results were correlated with spectroradiometric datasets based on neural network models. The results showed that the BNN models provide a global correlation coefficient of up to 73%-between the GPR and the spectroradiometric data-for all depth slices. This could eventually lead to the potential re-use of archived geo-prospection datasets with optical earth observation datasets. A discussion regarding the potential limitations and challenges of this approach is also included in the paper.

TI  - Comparison of Aerosol Reflectance Correction Schemes Using Two Near-Infrared Wavelengths for Ocean Color Data Processing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reanalyzes the aerosol reflectance correction schemes employed by major ocean color missions. The utilization of two near-infrared (NIR) bands to estimate aerosol reflectance in visible wavelengths has been widely adopted, for example by SeaWiFS/MODIS/VIIRS (GW1994), OCTS/GLI/SGLI (F1998), MERIS/OLCI (AM1999), and GOCI/GOCI-II (A2016). The F1998, AM1999, and A2016 schemes were developed based on GW1994; however, they are implemented differently in terms of aerosol model selection and weighting factor computation. The F1998 scheme determines the contribution of the most appropriate aerosol models in the aerosol optical thickness domain, whereas the GW1994 scheme focuses on single-scattering reflectance. The AM1999 and A2016 schemes both directly resolve the multiple scattering domain contribution. However, A2016 also considers the spectrally dependent weighting factor, whereas AM1999 calculates the spectrally invariant weighting factor. Additionally, ocean color measurements on a geostationary platform, such as GOCI, require more accurate aerosol correction schemes because the measurements are made over a large range of solar zenith angles which causes diurnal instabilities in the atmospheric correction. Herein, the four correction schemes were tested with simulated top-of-atmosphere radiances generated by radiative transfer simulations for three aerosol models. For comparison, look-up tables and test data were generated using the same radiative transfer simulation code. All schemes showed acceptable accuracy, with less than 10% median error in water reflectance retrieval at 443 nm. Notably, the accuracy of the A2016 scheme was similar among different aerosol models, whereas the other schemes tended to provide better accuracy with coarse aerosol models than the fine aerosol models.

TI  - Assessment of Segmentation Parameters for Object-Based Land Cover Classification Using Color-Infrared Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques for land use-land cover classification (LULC) has become an area of interest due to the availability of high-resolution data and segmentation methods. Multi-resolution segmentation in particular, statistically seen as the most used algorithm, is able to produce non-identical segmentations depending on the required parameters. The total effect of segmentation parameters on the classification accuracy of high-resolution imagery is still an open question, though some studies were implemented to define the optimum segmentation parameters. However, recent studies have not properly considered the parameters and their consequences on LULC accuracy. The main objective of this study is to assess OBIA segmentation and classification accuracy according to the segmentation parameters using different overlap ratios during image object sampling for a predetermined scale. With this aim, we analyzed and compared (a) high-resolution color-infrared aerial images of a newly-developed urban area including different land use types; (b) combinations of multi-resolution segmentation with different shape, color, compactness, bands, and band-weights; and (c) accuracies of classifications based on varied segmentations. The results of various parameters in the study showed an explicit correlation between segmentation accuracies and classification accuracies. The effect of changes in segmentation parameters using different sample selection methods for five main LULC types was studied. Specifically, moderate shape and compactness values provided more consistency than lower and higher values; also, band weighting demonstrated substantial results due to the chosen bands. Differences in the variable importance of the classifications and changes in LULC maps were also explained.

AB  - This paper proposes a buoy independent directional calibration methodology that uses satellite altimeter data to correct the simultaneous wind-sea and all swell partitions available from wave hindcasts. The proposed technique was applied to a 20-year wave hindcast in the New Zealand region and showed promising results.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, three Nigerian cities were listed amongst the World's most polluted in terms of particulate matter (PM). Acknowledging Nigeria's limited resources for outdoor air pollution monitoring, this study attempts to investigate the effects on atmospheric aerosol optical depth and ground PM on GPS derived-precipitable water vapour estimates. The study utilized available GPS-derived precipitable water vapour (GPS(PWV)), the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer aerosol optical depth (MODISAOD) and the ground level particulate matter of less than 10 mu m (GPM) datasets for December 2015-November 2016. All the datasets were tested for normality. To evaluate the atmospheric aerosol properties, the MODISPWV estimates were pre-validated using the GPS(PWV) measurements. The results revealed GPS(PWV)-MODISPWV agreement (R = 0.964; RMSE = 3.810 mm). The GPS(PWV)-MODISAOD analysis showed relationship (R <= -0.636; RMSE <= 0.563) for the atmospheric aerosol experiment, while the collocating GPS(PWV)-GPM seasonal analysis also revealed significant correlation (R < -0.660). The correlation of combined seasonal datasets for the GPS(PWV)-MODISAOD and GPS(PWV)-GPM relationships showed high negative correlation values of 0.79 and 0.68 respectively. The findings of this study is in agreement with similar related studies, as well as serve as position accuracy for future related studies.

TI  - Big earth observation time series analysis for monitoring Brazilian agriculture
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents innovative methods for using satellite image time series to produce land use and land cover classification over large areas in Brazil from 2001 to 2016. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data to classify natural and human-transformed land areas in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's agricultural frontier. Our hypothesis is that building high-dimensional spaces using all values of the time series, coupled with advanced statistical learning methods, is a robust and efficient approach for land cover classification of large data sets. We used the full depth of satellite image time series to create large dimensional spaces for statistical classification. The data consist of MODIS MOD13Q1 time series with 23 samples per year per pixel, and 4 bands (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), near-infrared (nir) and mid-infrared (mir)). By taking a series of labelled time series, we fed a 92 dimensional attribute space into a support vector machine model. Using a 5-fold cross validation, we obtained an overall accuracy of 94% for discriminating among nine land cover classes: forest, cerrado, pasture, soybean fallow, fallow-cotton, soybean-cotton, soybean-corn, soybean-millet, and soybean-sunflower. Producer and user accuracies for all classes were close to or better than 90%. The results highlight important trends in agricultural intensification in Mato Grosso. Double crop systems are now the most common production system in the state, sparing land from agricultural production. Pasture expansion and intensification has been less studied than crop expansion, although it has a stronger impact on deforestation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our results point to a significant increase in the stocking rate in Mato Grosso and to the possible abandonment of pasture areas opened in the state's frontier. The detailed land cover maps contribute to an assessment of the interplay between production and protection in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado biomes.

TI  - Monitoring Andean high altitude wetlands in central Chile with seasonal optical data: A comparison between Worldview-2 and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Maipo watershed, situated in central Chile, mining activities are impacting high altitude Andean wetlands through the consumption and exploitation of water and land. As wetlands are vulnerable and particularly susceptible to changes of water supply, alterations and modifications in the hydrological regime have direct effects on their ecophysiological condition and vegetation cover. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Worldview-2 and Sentinel-2 sensors to identify and map Andean wetlands through the use of the one-class classifier Bias support vector machines (BSVM), and then to estimate soil moisture content of the identified wetlands during snow-free summer using partial least square regression.The results obtained in this research showed that the combination of remote sensing data and a small sample of ground reference measurements enables to map Andean high altitude wetlands with high accuracies. BSVM was capable to classify the meadow areas with an overall accuracy of over similar to 78% for both sensors. Our results also indicate that it is feasible to map surface soil moisture with optical remote sensing data and simple regression approaches in the examined environment. Surface soil moisture estimates reached r(2) values of up to 0.58, and normalized mean square errors of 19% using Sentinel-2 data, while Worldview-2 estimates resulted in non-satisfying results. The presented approach is particularly valuable for monitoring high-mountain wetland areas with limited accessibility such as in the Andes.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental pollution and disasters have gradually increased with the growth of the population. Surveillance of the effects of these incidents is very important for public health. Satellite missions are a very efficient tool for identifying pollutants such as oil spills. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor is an active microwave sensing system that can be used for oil spill applications with optical sensors mounted on Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite systems taking into account cloud coverage and revisiting time of the satellite at the same location. In this study, the oil spill area caused by a ship running aground at 13:40 local time (LT) on 18 December 2016 was studied on the coast of Ildr Bay (Izmir, Turkey) with Sentinel 1 SAR and Landsat 8 multispectral sensors. Different image-processing techniques were applied to Landsat 8 bands such as minimum noise fraction (MNF), morphology, and convolution filters in order to highlight the oil spill area related to the incident. In the detection stage, oil slicks and look-alikes were successfully distinguished by analyzing the SAR data with Landsat 8 results and the location of the ship. With the visual interpretation of the results, the selected techniques are consistent with each other in terms of showing oil spill areas.

TI  - Monitoring thirty years of small water reservoirs proliferation in the southern Brazilian Amazon with Landsat time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent decoupling of agricultural production and deforestation in the southern Amazon has been made possible thanks to (1) the adoption of intensive agricultural practices, including irrigation, and (2) the diversification of economic activities, including fish farming. Whereas this new agricultural model has brought out positive results to contain deforestation, it also implied new pressures on the environment, and especially on water resources. Many small artificial water reservoirs have been built with different uses, e.g. crop irrigation, energy generation, fish farming or livestock watering. In this paper, we introduce a method to automatically map small water bodies based on time series of Landsat images. The method was tested in the municipality of Sorriso (state of Mato Grosso, Brazil). The statistical results (Overall Accuracy = 0.872; Kappa index = 0.745) validated the efficiency of the methodology although the spatial resolution of Landsat images limited the detection of very small and linear reservoirs. In Sorriso, we estimated that the cumulated area and the number of small water reservoirs increased more than tenfold (from 153 to 1707 ha) and fivefold (86 to 522), respectively, between 1985 and 2015. We discuss the numerous socio-environmental implications raised by the cumulated impacts of these proliferating small reservoirs. We conclude that integrated whole-landscape approaches are necessary to assess how anthropized hydrosystems can counteract or exacerbate the socio-environmental impacts of deforestation and intensive agriculture.

TI  - Relationship between Spatiotemporal Variations of Climate, Snow Cover and Plant Phenology over the Alps-An Earth Observation-Based Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change, and therefore it is of significant interest to understand the relationships between phenology and its seasonal drivers in mountain areas. However, no alpine-wide assessment on the relationship between land surface phenology (LSP) patterns and its climatic drivers including snow exists. Here, an assessment of the influence of snow cover variations on vegetation phenology is presented, which is based on a 17-year time-series of MODIS data. From this data snow cover duration (SCD) and phenology metrics based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have been extracted at 250 m resolution for the entire European Alps. The combined influence of additional climate drivers on phenology are shown on a regional scale for the Italian province of South Tyrol using reanalyzed climate data. The relationship between vegetation and snow metrics strongly depended on altitude. Temporal trends towards an earlier onset of vegetation growth, increasing monthly mean NDVI in spring and late summer, as well as shorter SCD were observed, but they were mostly non-significant and the magnitude of these tendencies differed by altitude. Significant negative correlations between monthly mean NDVI and SCD were observed for 15-55% of all vegetated pixels, especially from December to April and in altitudes from 1000-2000 m. On the regional scale of South Tyrol, the seasonality of NDVI and SCD achieved the highest share of correlating pixels above 1500 m, while at lower elevations mean temperature correlated best. Examining the combined effect of climate variables, for average altitude and exposition, SCD had the highest effect on NDVI, followed by mean temperature and radiation. The presented analysis allows to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of earth-observation based snow and vegetation metrics over the Alps, as well as to understand the relative importance of snow as phenological driver with respect to other climate variables.

TI  - The extent of mangrove change and potential for recovery following severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi, Hinchinbrook Island, Queensland, Australia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclones are significant drivers of change within mangrove ecosystems with the extent of initial damage determined by storm severity, location and distribution (exposure), and influenced by species composition and structure (e.g., height). The long-term recovery of mangroves is often dependent upon hydrological regimes, as well as the frequency of storm events. On February 3, 2011, Tropical Cyclone Yasi (Category 5) made landfall on the coast of north Queensland Australia with its path crossing the extensive mangroves within and surrounding Hinchinbrook Island National Park. Based on a combination of Landsat-derived foliage projective cover (FPC), Queensland Globe aerial imagery, and RapidEye imagery, 16% of the 13,795 ha of mangroves experienced severe windthrow during the storm. The greatest damage from the cyclone was inflicted on mangrove forests dominated primarily by Rhizophora stylosa, whose large prop roots were unable to support them as wind speeds exceeded 280 km/hr. Classification of 2016 RapidEye data indicated that many areas of damage had experienced no or very limited recovery in the period following the cyclone, with this confirmed by a rapid decline in Landsat-derived FPC (from levels > 90% from 1986 to just prior to the cyclone to < 20% postcyclone) and no noticeable increase in subsequent years. Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) L-band HH backscatter also increased initially and rapidly to 5 +/- 2 dB (2007-2011) due to the increase in woody debris but then decreased subsequently to -20 +/- 2 dB (postcyclone), as this decomposed or was removed. The lack of recovery in affected areas was attributed to the inability of mangrove species, particularly R. stylosa, to resprout from remaining plant material and persistent inundation due to a decrease in sediment elevation thereby preventing propagule establishment. This study indicates that increases in storm intensity predicted with changes in global climate may lead to a reduction in the area, diversity, and abundance of mangroves surrounding Hinchinbrook Island.

TI  - A Novel Automatic Method for Alfalfa Mapping Using Time Series of Landsat-8 OLI Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) data have been utilized increasingly for mapping various crops at local and regional scales using various techniques. However, training data collection of these methods is costly and time consuming. On the other hand, time series of RS data have provided valuable information about crop phenological patterns, which can be utilized for automatic crop mapping independent of training data. Hence, the aim of this research is to develop a new automatic method to map alfalfa by identification of specific characteristics of alfalfa based on time series of Landsat 8 OLI images in four study sites in Iran and the United States. Alfalfa fields are usually harvested periodically and two neighboring farms may not be harvested simultaneously. To address this challenge, the alfalfa spectral reflectance values in various bands were compared with those of other crops during the growing season. In the following, three assumptions were made to find suitable relationships for demonstrating alfalfa characteristics as well as separating it from other crops. The results indicated that the summation of differences between the red and NIR reflectance values of alfalfa in the time series of Landsat images is significant; and also, the average values of the NIR and red bands during the growing season are remarkably higher and lower than those of other crops, respectively. Hence, based on these findings, a new specific feature was developed to detect alfalfa with the overall accuracy of 93%, 90%, 94%, and 90% in Moghan, Qazvin, Razan, and Parker Valley, respectively.

TI  - Analysing decadal-scale crescentic bar dynamics using satellite imagery: A case study at Anmok beach, South Korea
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding long-term sandbar dynamics can be crucial for informed coastal zone management, but is often hampered by data availability. To increase the number of sandbar observations available from bathymetric surveys, this study proposes and evaluates a method to manually extract the sandbar location using freely available satellite imagery for the case study of Anmok beach in South Korea. Validation of the satellite extracted sandbar locations against 9 in-situ measurements shows good agreement with errors well within the pixel resolution of the satellite imagery (i.e. 30 m for Landsat missions). The applicability of the method is constrained to locations where (1) the cross-shore crescentic length scales are larger than the image resolution, (2) frequent wave breaking and clouds are absent and (3) the water clarity is sufficient to enable the manual extraction of the sandbar crest line. Using the additional sandbar observations from the satellite imagery significantly increases the temporal extent and resolution of the dataset for Anmok beach. This allows the study of sandbar characteristics, dynamics and impacts of human interventions to an extent that would not have been possible without the satellite imagery. Within the study period 1990-2017 it is found that the sandbar maintains a persistent crescentic pattern that is only altered during prolonged and very intense storm conditions. The cumulative alongshore migration of the sandbars is investigated and found to be in the order of hundreds of meters over the 27 years study period. Comparing the sandbar characteristics prior and after the construction of Gangneung port shows that both the amplitudes and wavelengths of the sandbar crescents near the port have decreased after its construction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th International Workshop on Radiation Imaging Detectors
CL  - Sundsvall, SWEDEN
AB  - The VZLUSAT-1 satellite, the first Czech CubeSat, was successfully launched on June 23, 2017, to a 510 km Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit. It carries several scientific payloads including a Timepix detector as focal plane imager for the X-Ray telescope onboard. The Timepix detector contributes significantly to the satellite data collection, with more than 25 000 sampling acquisitions in the first year of deployment. Despite limitations of the satellite attitude control system, necessary for capturing X-Ray images of the Sun, the Timepix detector allows measuring the space radiation environment along the satellite orbit. As of September 2018, we conducted 33 whole-Earth mappings, recording radiation doses around the planet. Further, we show data from scans of the South Atlantic Anomaly and polar radiation horns, where the location and acquisition time were tailored to minimize event pile-up and particle track overlap. Since October 2017, the optics segment of the onboard X-Ray telescope was deployed, which exposed the Timepix detector unshielded to free open space. This change produced entirely new observations namely of low energy charged particles and a significant increase of measured particle flux. We also registered the effects of exposing the sensor to direct intense sunlight. We will summarize on the actual performance of the custom readout interface, which exceeds expectations in the constrained environment of the low-cost and low-powered CubeSat nanosatellite.

TI  - Validation of satellite soil moisture in the absence of <i>in situ</i> soil moisture: the case of the Tropical Yankin Basin
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is known to be important in hydrology, agronomy, flood and drought forecasting. Acquisition of in situ soil moisture data is time consuming, costly, and does not cover the scale required for basin analysis. The consideration of remotely-sensed soil moisture is therefore promising. However, considering the limitations of satellite data, there is a need to check their validity prior to their utilization for impact studies. This, in turn, poses a problem in the absence of in situ soil moisture. The present study suggests a methodology for testing the validity of remotely-sensed soil moisture without in situ soil moisture. Hydrological models with a detailed soil moisture routine are calibrated and validated with measured stream flows. The most behavioural solutions of modelled soil moistures are averaged, and used as proxy measurements. This methodology was applied to the Yankin Basin (8,171 km(2)), a tributary of the Niger River Basin. The soil moistures of three hydrological models (UHP-HRU, SWAT and WaSiM) used as proxy were compared with the daily ESA-CCI soil moisture for a four year period (2005-2008). The coefficient of determination (R-2), bias and visual inspection were used as quality criteria. A rather small bias ranging from - 0.01cm(3)/cm(3) (SWAT & UHP-HRU) to -0.04cm(3)/cm(3) (WaSiM &UHP-HRU) was determined as well as good R-2 varying between 0.71 (SWAT & UHP-HRU) and 0.81 (WaSiM & SWAT & UHP-HRU). The ESA-CCI soil moisture was therefore judged as reliable for the study area. More important, this research shows that averaging soil moistures from different hydrological models provides valuable proxy measurements for testing the reliability of satellite soil moistures.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of human appropriation of net primary production in the Rio de la Plata grasslands
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Latin America, and particularly, the Rio de la Plata Grasslands (RPG), are one of the regions with the highest rates of land use change worldwide. These changes drastically alter ecosystems energy flows, affecting biodiversity, atmospheric composition, and the ecosystem capacity to provide services. In this work we evaluated the impact of these changes on Net Primary Production (NPP), one of the most important and integrative ecosystem attributes, through the calculation of Human Appropriation of NPP (HANPP), a very complete indicator of human impact on ecosystems. Our results provide a comprehensive and fine grained description of HANPP patterns over an entire biogeographycal region for two periods that encompass a strong agricultural intensification process. We used medium resolution land use maps and NPP estimates from sub-national level agricultural statistics and remotely sensed data modeling. Results show that the human impact on the energy flow in RPG ecosystems reached very high levels compared to other regions of the world. The average appropriation of was 42% of the potential vegetation NPP in 2001/2002 and it increased 4.5% during the last years due to an intense land use changes. Most of the HANPP was explained by harvest rather than by land use changes, mainly in the last period due to crops yield increase and the expansion of double crop system as a common agronomic practice. High HANPP values found were associated to a set of environmental impacts that affect ecosystems sustainability and their ability to provide ecosystem services.

TI  - Intercomparison and evaluation of three global high-resolution evapotranspiration products across China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) has an important scientific and practical significance. In this study, three global high-resolution ET products were intercompared and evaluated across China; the evaluated ET products were the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) version 3.2, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) version 2.0 Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) dataset, and the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) dataset. The evaluations were performed at the site scale with eddy covariance (EC) based observations from eight flux stations, and at the basin scale with water balance-based ET estimates from 22 river basins in China. The intercomparison results indicated that the three products consistently presented an increasing trend over a large proportion of China but large differences in the trend of the annual ET and the mean annual ET estimates. The trends of the annual ET estimates derived from the GLEAM, GLDAS, and NTSG products are 0.449, 0.904 and 1.261 mm/yr(2), respectively; the countrywide mean annual ET derived from the three products are 390.2, 443.4 and 419.9 mm/yr, respectively. The site-scale evaluation results indicated that the GLEAM and NTSG products achieved comparable consistencies with the monthly gauge observations and outperformed the GLDAS product; GLEAM was more consistent with the daily gauge observations than GLDAS. At the basin scale, all three products were unable to reasonably reproduce the water balance-based annual ET time series in most basins; the three products systematically overestimated ET in the wet basins compared with the water balance-based ET estimates. The differences in the ET estimates among the ET products may be largely attributed to the discrepancies in the forcing data and model algorithms.

TI  - On-going transmission of human onchocerciasis in the Massangam health district in the West Region of Cameroon: Better understanding transmission dynamics to inform changes in programmatic interventions
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMassangam health district (HD), in the West Region of Cameroon, has received ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) for 20 years, however there is evidence of continued high transmission of Onchocerca volvulus. In order to better understand the transmission dynamics in the HD and inform intervention strategies there is a need to delineate the boundaries of the suspected area of high transmission within the wider transmission zone.Methodology/Principal findingsParasitological and entomological surveys were conducted to map out the breeding sites of Simulium damnosum and evaluate the prevalence of onchocerciasis in neighbouring communities, including Makouopsap sentinel community. Potential rapids were prospected for identification of S. damnosum larvae and black flies collected to determine infectivity rates. Adults were assessed for the presence of O. volvulus microfilariae through a skin snip biopsy and examined for the presence of nodules. Anti Ov-16 antibodies were tested for in children. Four perennial breeding sites were identified on the Rivers Mbam and Nja. Large number of flies were collected along the River Mbam, especially in the rainy season, with up to 955 flies per day, suggesting this river is a perennial source of black flies. A total of 0.8% of parous flies were infective across the study area. Parasitological studies provided evidence of high rates of infection in the sentinel community and three neighbouring communities, with 37.1% of adults microfilariae positive in Makouopsap. High Ov-16 seropositivity in children also provided evidence of recent on-going transmission. In comparison, communities sampled further away from the sentinel community and neighbouring breeding sites were much closer to reaching onchocerciasis elimination targets.Conclusions/SignificanceThis study provides evidence of a particular geographic area of high transmission in an approximate 12 km range around the sentinel community of Makouopsap and the neighbouring breeding sites on the River Nja. To eliminate onchocerciasis by 2025, there is a need to explore alternative intervention strategies in this area of high transmission.

TI  - Evaluation of Spectral Indices for Assessing Fire Severity in Australian Temperate Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral indices derived from optical remote sensing data have been widely used for fire-severity classification in forests from local to global scales. However, comparative analyses of multiple indices across diverse forest types are few. This represents an information gap for fire management agencies in areas like temperate south-eastern Australia, which is characterised by a diversity of natural forests that vary in structure, and in the fire-regeneration strategies of the dominant trees. We evaluate 10 spectral indices across eight areas burnt by wildfires in 1998, 2006, 2007, and 2009 in south-eastern Australia. These wildfire areas encompass 13 forest types, which represent 86% of the 7.9M ha region's forest area. Forest types were aggregated into six forest groups based on their fire-regeneration strategies (seeders, resprouters) and structure (tree height and canopy cover). Index performance was evaluated for each forest type and forest group by examining its sensitivity to four fire-severity classes (unburnt, low, moderate, high) using three independent methods (anova, separability, and optimality). For the best-performing indices, we calculated index-specific thresholds (by forest types and groups) to separate between the four severity classes, and evaluated the accuracy of fire-severity classification on independent samples. Our results indicated that the best-performing indices of fire severity varied with forest type and group. Overall accuracy for the best-performing indices ranged from 0.50 to 0.78, and kappa values ranged from 0.33 (fair agreement) to 0.77 (substantial agreement), depending on the forest group and index. Fire severity in resprouter open forests and woodlands was most accurately mapped using the delta Normalised Burnt ratio (dNBR). In contrast, dNDVI (delta Normalised difference vegetation index) performed best for open forests with mixed fire responses (resprouters and seeders), and dNDWI (delta Normalised difference water index) was the most accurate for obligate seeder closed forests. Our analysis highlighted the low sensitivity of all indices to fire impacts in Rainforest. We conclude that the optimal spectral index for quantifying fire severity varies with forest type, but that there is scope to group forests by structure and fire-regeneration strategy to simplify fire-severity classification in heterogeneous forest landscapes.

TI  - Hazard Implications of the 2016 Mw 5.0 Cushing, OK Earthquake from a Joint Analysis of Damage and InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cushing Hub in Oklahoma, one of the largest oil storage facilities in the world, is federally designated as critical national infrastructure. In 2014, the formerly aseismic city of Cushing experienced a Mw 4.0 and 4.3 induced earthquake sequence due to wastewater injection. Since then, an M4+ earthquake sequence has occurred annually (October 2014, September 2015, November 2016). Thus far, damage to critical infrastructure has been minimal; however, a larger earthquake could pose significant risk to the Cushing Hub. In addition to inducing earthquakes, wastewater injection also threatens the Cushing Hub through gradual surface uplift. To characterize the impact of wastewater injection on critical infrastructure, we use Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), a satellite radar technique, to observe ground surface displacement in Cushing before and during the induced Mw 5.0 event. Here, we process interferograms of Single Look Complex (SLC) radar data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1A satellite. The preearthquake interferograms are used to create a time series of cumulative surface displacement, while the coseismic interferograms are used to invert for earthquake source characteristics. The time series of surface displacement reveals 4-5.5 cm of uplift across Cushing over 17 months. The coseismic interferogram inversion suggests that the 2016 Mw 5.0 earthquake is shallower than estimated from seismic inversions alone. This shallower source depth should be taken into account in future hazard assessments for regional infrastructure. In addition, monitoring of surface deformation near wastewater injection wells can be used to characterize the subsurface dynamics and implement measures to mitigate damage to critical installations.

TI  - Previous exposure to myxoma virus reduces survival of European rabbits during outbreaks of rabbit haemorrhagic disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Exploiting synergies among diseases or parasites could increase the efficacy of biological control of invasive species. In Australia, two viruses were introduced to control European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus: myxoma virus in 1950 and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus in 1995. While these biological controls caused initial declines of >95% in affected populations, and despite recurring outbreaks of both diseases, rabbits remain a problem in many areas.2. We used 18 years of capture-mark-recapture, dead recovery, and antibody assay data from a sentinel population in South Australia to test whether these two diseases interact to modify the survival of individual wild rabbits. We compared four joint, multistate, dead-recovery models to test the hypotheses that rabbit haemorrhagic disease and myxoma viruses have synergistic (i.e., previous exposure to one virus affects survival during outbreaks of the other virus) or additive effects (i.e., previous exposure to one virus does not affect survival during outbreaks of the other virus).3. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease outbreaks reduced the survival of individuals with no immunity by more than half during the 58-day capture-trip intervals, i.e., from 0.86-0.90 to 0.37-0.48. Myxomatosis outbreaks had a smaller effect, reducing survival to 0.74-0.82; however, myxomatosis outbreaks were more prolonged, spanning more than twice as many trips.4. There was considerable information-theoretic support (wAIC(c) = 0.69) for the model in which exposure to myxomatosis affected survival during rabbit haemorrhagic disease outbreaks. Rabbits previously exposed to myxoma virus had lower survival during rabbit haemorrhagic disease outbreaks than rabbits never exposed to either virus. There was negligible support for the model in which previous exposure to rabbit haemorrhagic disease affected survival in myxomatosis outbreaks (wAIC(c) < 0.01).5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that biological control agents can have a greater impact than single-pathogen challenge studies might suggest. Introducing additional biological control agents might therefore increase the mortality of rabbits beyond the additive effects of individual biological controls. Furthermore, our results show that by understanding and exploiting disease synergies, managers could increase the efficacy of biological controls for other invasive animals.

TI  - Urine drug screening for early detection of unwitting use of fentanyl and its analogues among people who inject heroin in Sydney, Australia
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and Aims North America has witnessed a dramatic rise in fatal opioid overdoses due to the unwitting consumption of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl and its analogues. While some of the drivers of this crisis-including profitability and access to high-potency opioids through internet sources-also apply in Australia, to our knowledge, there have been no ongoing surveillance studies of local populations. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to detect unintentional fentanyl consumption among people who inject heroin through instant urine screening, and determine the feasibility and acceptability of voluntary urinalysis of clients at the Medically Supervised Injecting Centre, Kings Cross, Sydney. Design and Methods Results Brief surveys and urine drug screens were conducted with 67 participants in Wave 1 (October 2017) and 51 participants in Wave 2 (March 2018). Urine samples were tested with BTNX Rapid Response (TM) fentanyl urine strip test at a detection level of 20 ng/mL norfentanyl. These strips also cross-react to numerous fentanyl analogues. There were no cases where positive urine tests suggested unwitting fentanyl use detected in this study. Discussion and Conclusions These negative findings contrast sharply with similar Canadian studies. While no cases of fentanyl-laced heroin use have been detected so far, we have demonstrated that this surveillance design is low-cost, feasible and scalable approach to monitoring the considerable public-health threat of undetected fentanyl and its analogues in Australia. Further validation of cross-reactivity of test strips would strengthen this method.

TI  - Using GRACE to Estitmate Snowfall Accumulation and Assess Gauge Undercatch Corrections in High Latitudes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ten years of terrestrial water storage anomalies from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were used to estimate high-latitude snowfall accumulation using a mass balance approach. The estimates were used to assess two common gauge-undercatch correction factors (CFs): the Legates climatology (CF-L) utilized in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the Fuchs dynamic correction model (CF-F) used in the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) monitoring product. The two CFs can be different by more than 50%. CF-L tended to exceed CF-F over northern Asia and Eurasia, while the opposite was observed over North America. Estimates of snowfall from GPCP, GPCC-L (GPCC corrected by CF-L), and GPCC-F (GPCC corrected by CF-F) were 62%, 64%, and 46% more than GPCC over northern Asia and Eurasia. The GRACE-based estimate (49% more than GPCC) was the closest to GPCC-F. We found that as near-surface air temperature decreased, the products increasingly underestimated the GRACE-based snowfall accumulation. Overall, GRACE showed that CFs are effective in improving GPCC estimates. Furthermore, our case studies and overall statistics suggest that CF-F is likely more effective than CF-L in most of the high-latitude regions studied here. GPCP showed generally better skill than GPCC-L, which might be related to the use of satellite data or additional quality controls on gauge inputs to GPCP. This study suggests that GPCP can be improved if it employs CF-L instead of CF-F to correct for gauge undercatch. However, this implementation requires further studies, region-specific analysis, and operational considerations.

The spectacle of Middle Eastern and African refugees shuttled by train from camp to squalid camp has understandably drawn parallels to the darkest pages in twentieth-century continental history. Such a historical comparison between Islamophobia and antisemitism, however, risks missing their ongoing interrelation. This article examines that interrelation, arguing that Islamophobia and antisemitism now most resemble each other as complementary mechanisms for diverting the anxieties bred by the global economic order. Antisemitism has long scapegoated the Jews for capitalism's tendency to produce outsized winners. But there has been no comparably global shorthand for the anxiety prompted by capitalism's losersuntil now. Muslim refugees help give a name, Islam, to the masses seemingly encroaching from the margins of the world system. The result, I argue, is the hardening of Islamophobia and antisemitism into the inextricable poles of a reactionary worldview. Taking France as a case study, the article reads the burkini bans prompted by the July 2016 terror attack in Nice as an expression of middle-class fear about downward mobility. Targeted at both internal Muslim leisure and external Muslim encroachment, the bans evoke how European unease about globalization increasingly takes Islamophobic form. Such intolerance threatens not only to lodge Islamophobia at the heart of a reconstituted Europe but also to erode the vigilance against antisemitism once characteristic of the postwar European project.

TI  - Recurrent Multiresolution Convolutional Networks for VHR Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images has three major challenges: 1) inherent low intraclass and high interclass spectral similarities; 2) mismatching resolution of available bands; and 3) the need to regularize noisy classification maps. Conventional methods have addressed these challenges by adopting separate stages of image fusion, feature extraction, and postclassification map regularization. These processing stages, however, are not jointly optimizing the classification task at hand. In this paper, we propose a single-stage framework embedding the processing stages in a recurrent multiresolution convolutional network trained in an end-to-end manner. The feedforward version of the network, called FuseNet, aims to match the resolution of the panchromatic and multispectral bands in a VHR image using convolutional layers with corresponding downsampling and upsampling operations. Contextual label information is incorporated into FuseNet by means of a recurrent version called ReuseNet. We compared FuseNet and ReuseNet against the use of separate processing steps for both image fusions, e.g., pansharpening and resampling through interpolation and map regularization such as conditional random fields. We carried out our experiments on a land-cover classification task using a Worldview-03 image of Quezon City, Philippines, and the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 2-D semantic labeling benchmark data set of Vaihingen, Germany. FuseNet and ReuseNet surpass the baseline approaches in both the quantitative and qualitative results.

TI  - The discovery of the Antarctic Ozone Hole
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The author Nassim Taleb has coined the term "Black Swan" event to describe a very low probability event that come as a surprise and has a major effect in the field in which it occurs. He suggests that such events have occurred in history, finance, science, and technology more frequently than one can expect from stochastic theory. The discovery of the Antarctic Ozone Hole fits this description well. In this paper, we describe the events surrounding this discovery and the role of NASA satellite data before and soon after the seminal paper by Farman et al., in May 1985 that first brought this phenomenon to the attention of the broader science community.

TI  - A model for predicting low probability of nonsentinel lymph node positivity in melanoma patients with a single positive sentinel lymph node
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMethodsIdentifying factors associated with nonsentinel lymph node (NSN) metastases in melanoma patients with a single positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) could aid decision making regarding adjuvant therapy. We describe a model for identifying patients with a single positive SLN at low risk for NSN metastasis.Factors associated with NSN metastasis in patients with a primary cutaneous melanoma and a single positive SLN who underwent completion lymph node dissection (CLND) were identified. These factors were used to construct a model for predicting the NSN status. The model was validated using a separate data set from another tertiary referral cancer center.ResultsConclusionsIn the training data set, 111 patients had a single positive SLN. Of these, 27 had positive NSN. SLN tumor deposit diameter 0.75mm (OR, 3.43; P=0.047), age 40 (OR, 12.14; P=0.024), and multifocal SLN tumor deposit location (OR, 4.16; P=0.0096) were independently associated with NSN positivity. Patients with 0 to 1 of these risk factors had a low risk of NSN metastasis in both the training (7.5%) and validation (4.6%) data sets.A combination of patient and SLN tumor burden characteristics can help to identify patients with a single positive SLN who are at a low risk of NSN metastasis.

TI  - Impact of hydroclimatic variability on regional-scale landscape connectivity across a dynamic dryland region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In dynamic dryland regions, accounting for spatiotemporal landscape dynamics is essential to understanding how ecological habitat networks are affected by hydroclimatic variability at regional or sub-continental scales. Here we assess how changes in the distribution and availability of surface water influence potential landscape connectivity for water-dependent organisms by combining graph theory network analysis with a Landsat-derived, seasonally continuous 25-year surface-water time-series. We focused on Australia's Murray Darling Basin (MDB), a globally significant and ecologically stressed 1 million km(2) semi-arid region recently affected by two unprecedented hydroclimatic extremes: the 1997-2010 Millennium Drought and 2010-2012 La Nina floods. We constructed potential habitat networks for two dispersal abilities using circuit theory resistance distances, and used 'habitat availability' graph theory metrics as indicators of regional-scale connectivity. We analysed 792 unique potential habitat networks containing over 6.6 million nodes, making our study one of the largest spatially explicit ecological network analyses yet conducted. Our indicators of connectivity revealed consistently positive but spatially heterogeneous relationships between flooded habitat area and landscape connectivity. Connectivity increased by over two orders of magnitude along the spectrum from severe drought to flood, associated with a transition from connectivity driven by intra-habitat or short-distance dispersal during drought to long-distance dispersal during wet conditions. Reductions in connectivity during drought were lower than expected given equivalent decreases in surface water habitat area, suggesting habitat network structure provides a degree of resistance to dry conditions. By providing insights into the processes driving connectivity during different phases along the drought-flood spectrum, our approach may assist in guiding conservation management aimed at maintaining or improving landscape connectivity within dynamic environments faced with increasing hydroclimatic variability.

TI  - Current landscape and future perspective of sentinel node mapping in endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) represents the most common gynecological neoplasm in developed countries. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for EC. Although EC is characterized by a high prevalence several features regarding its management are still unclear. In particular the execution of lymphadenectomy is controversial. The recent introduction of sentinel node mapping represents the mid-way between the execution and omission of node dissection in EC patients. In the present review we discuss the emerging role of sentinel node mapping in EC. In addition, we discussed how type of tracers utilized and site of injection impacted on sentinel node detection rates. Future perspective regarding EC management are also discussed.

TI  - Linking geomorphological and demographic movements: The case of Southern Albania
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Albania has experienced one of the Europe's highest population migration rates in recent decades. At the same time, the landscape of this country has very dynamic geomorphological behaviour (erosion and ground subsidence), as an effect of various drivers. This paper examines the correlation between the population migrations and geomorphological dynamics in the wider Vlora area in Southern Albania between 1979 and 2016. In social studies and the humanities this interplay is largely unrepresented, whereas in the environmental sciences these two issues have been conceptualized as having a causal relationship. The article develops a tripartite analytic synthetic model consisting of (A) remote sensing analysis based on automated land/water detection from satellite data; (B) demographic analysis focusing on population changes using the methods of statistical analysis; and (C) extensive anthropological fieldwork grounded on participant observation, archival work and gathering previously inaccessible statistical and other relevant data. The results of this study show that the coastal erosion or water inundation along with other geomorphological (site-specific relief, place-bound ground subsidence and water bodies distribution) and geotectonic characteristics of the wider Vlora area are inextricably bound up with the population migrations. The paper foregrounds new methodological approaches that correlate coastal or pericoastal erosion with geomorphological, geotectonic and population movements, and provides a holistic framework that can be applied to examine this issue in similar areas elsewhere.

TI  - Landslide state of activity maps by combining multi-temporal A-DInSAR (LAMBDA)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a new methodology was developed to automatically update Landslide state of Activity Maps by combining multi-temporal A-DInSAR data (LAMBDA). LAMBDA procedure was tested using ERS-1/2 (1992-2000), Radarsat-1/2 (2003-2009) and COSMO-SkyMed data (2011-2014) over an area of 2199 km(2) located in Alps context of Piedmont region (north-western Italy). For the first time, a multidimensional landslide activity matrix was implemented to update the landslide state of activity during the monitored time span. For the definition of the state of activity, the representative velocity of each landslide was divided by the standard deviation of the velocities along the slope of the whole dataset. Thus, a common stability threshold of 1 was introduced for multi-sensors A-DInSAR data, allowing to distinguish a phenomenon with stable targets (PS-DS) or unstable PS-DS. By combining activity classes estimated during different time spans allows to determine if a phenomenon is active, reactivated, or dormant. Furthermore, an innovative confidence degree assessment was carried out to verify the reliability of the procedure, by considering the measuring points distribution and the variability of the movements for each landslide. The results were validated using the landslide inventory of the study area and in-situ monitoring systems for representative case studies. Thanks to this approach an updated state of activity until 2014 was assigned to 507 landslides out the 1657 which were previously mapped in the study area.

TI  - Landscape variability of vegetation change across the forest to tundra transition of central Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread increases in the productivity of tundra ecosystems and static trends or even declines in boreal ecosystems have been detected since the early 1980s using coarse-scale remote sensing. However, intermediate scale Landsat studies have shown that these changes are heterogeneous and may be related to landscape and regional variability in climate, land cover, topography and moisture availability. In this study, a Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series (1984-2016) was examined for an area spanning the transition from sub-Arctic boreal forest to Low Arctic tundra in central Canada. This was supplemented by analyses of relationships with a suite of environmental variables and in situ measurements of bulk vegetation volume. Results show that NDVI trends were generally positive (i.e. increasing) across the study area but were smallest in the forest zone and largest in the northern tundra zone. More than one-quarter (27%) of un-masked pixels exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) trend and virtually all (99.3%) of those pixels exhibited an increasing, or "greening", trend. Greening pixels were most common in the northern tundra zone and the southern ecotone zone. Random Forest modeling of the relationship between NDVI and environmental variables indicated that the magnitude and direction of trends varied across the forest to tundra transition. Areas that experienced larger increases in NDVI include: (i) areas where summer temperatures increased; (ii) areas exhibiting predominantly shrub and forest cover; and (iii) locations closer to major drainage systems, further from major lakes, and at lower elevations. Ground validation in the central portion of the study area reveals a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.79) between vegetation volume and NDVI for non-tree functional groups and that alder (Alnus crispa) shrublands and open spruce (Picea mariana and P. glauca) woodland with shrubby understories were most likely to exhibit greening. These findings indicate that the largest positive and more significant NDVI trends were associated with increased productivity in shrub-dominated environments, especially at, and north of the treeline in localities with favorable growing conditions. Smaller and less significant NDVI trends in boreal forest environments south of the treeline were likely associated with long-term successional change following disturbance rather than the variables analyzed here.

TI  - A multi-scale approach interpreting sediment processes and distribution from desert sand colour in central Saudi Arabia
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In central Saudi Arabia the redness of sands observed on satellite imagery, often related to iron oxide amount, was used to better interpret geomorphic processes operating in the area. To compare variations between dune and interdune morphology, linear and dome dunes, and an ephemeral river partly buried under a sand sea, Nafud Al-Thuwayrat, a multi-scale approach was used to identify the spatial variation in causes of iron oxide amounts and colour. Macro-scale mapping of Image Spectral Redness identified that the extent and intensity of colour grading across the orientation of well-defined linear and dome dune types, interdunes and the Wadi Al-Rimah, indicated sediment mixing of different provenance. Meso-scale chemical, physical and colour analysis of surface samples indicated that iron oxide coated grains were present within all the samples and was not the sole control on Image Spectral Redness. The reddest sediments were the best sorted medium-to fine-quartz sands with iron oxide bearing chemistry and the paler sediments contained coarser sands with additional feldspars, calcite and gypsum. Micro-scale analysis of grain characteristics found dune-interdune contrasts and that the reddest sands with iron coatings were of aeolian origin and the paler sands contained larger fluvial material mixed with reworked aeolian deposits. Dust in the area consists of high amounts of iron oxide and appears to be a major contributor to redness in the sand dunes. These controls on colour show the sand seas are paler westwards because a major river and local drainage systems deliver fluvial sediments from the carbonate and sandstone bedrock into the quartz-rich aeolian material from the linear dunes. Evaporite deposits dominate in the paler interdunes, and south of the Wadi the dome dunes are the reddest as they are not migrating but building up. This multi-scale approach has provided a modern analogy of processes for palaeoenvironmental studies. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Mapping phytoplankton blooms in deep subalpine lakes from Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - For effective lakes' management, high-frequent water quality data on a synoptic scale are essential. The aim of this study is to test the suitability of the latest generation of satellite sensors to provide information on lake water quality parameters for the five largest Italian subalpine lakes. In situ data of phytoplankton composition, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration and water reflectance were used in synergy with satellite observations to map some algal blooms in 2016. Chl-a concentration maps were derived from satellite data by applying a bio-optical model to satellite data, previously corrected for atmospheric effects. Results were compared with in situ data, showing good agreement. The shape and magnitude of water reflectance from different satellite data were consistent. Output chl-a concentration maps, show the distribution within each lake during blooming events, suggesting a synoptic view is required for these events monitoring. Maps show the dynamic of bloom events with concentration increasing from 2 up to 7mgm(-3) and dropping again to initial value in less than 20days. Latest generation sensors were shown to be valuable tools for lakes monitoring, thanks to frequent, free of charge data availability over long time periods.

TI  - Appraisal of the Sentinel-1 & 2 use in a large-scale wildfire assessment: A case study from Portugal's fires of 2017
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent launch of Sentinel missions offers a unique opportunity to assess the impacts of wildfires at higher spatial and spectral resolution provided by those Earth Observing (EO) systems. Herein, an assessment of the Sentinel-1 & 2 to map burnt areas has been conducted. Initially the use of Sentinel-2 solely was explored, and then in combination with Sentinel-1 and derived radiometric indices. As a case study, the large wildfire occurred in Pedrogao Grande, Portugal in 2017 was used. Burnt area estimates from the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS) were used as reference. Burnt area was delineated using the Maximum Likelihood (MI) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers, and two multi-index methods. Following this, burn severity was assessed using SVMs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), again for both standalone Sentinel-2 data and in combination with Sentinel-1 and spectral indices. Soil erosion predictions were evaluated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The effect of the land cover derived from CORINE operational product was also evaluated across the burnt area and severity maps. SVMs produced the most accurate burnt area map, resulting a 94.8% overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90. SVMs also achieved the highest accuracy in burn severity levels estimation, with an overall accuracy of 77.9% and a kappa of 0.710. From an algorithmic perspective, implementation of the techniques applied herein, is based on EO imagery analysis provided nowadays globally at no cost. It is also robust and adaptable, being potentially integrated with other high EO data available. All in all, our study contributes to the understanding of Mediterranean landscape dynamics and corroborates the usefulness of Sentinels data in wildfire studies.

TI  - Synergy of cytological methods in the pathological staging of breast cancer: Axillary fine-needle aspiration and intraoperative scrape cytology of the sentinel lymph node
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard in breast cancer staging, but it is costly and time-consuming. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) under ultrasonographic guidance identifies patients who need axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND), thus reducing costs. As an alternative to frozen sections (FS), intraoperative scrape cytology (ISC) for SLNB is an inexpensive, rapid, accurate and safe technique. We evaluated the synergy of FNAC and SLNB in determining the axillary burden and the performance of the ISC method. Methods Over a nine-year period, 894 breast cancer patients were analyzed. Of these, 439 patients with echographic suspicious nodes underwent preoperative FNAC; negative axillary ultrasounds or FNACs resulted in 606 intraoperative SLNB, performed using the ISC technique. The results were compared with histological diagnosis, and sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and accuracy were calculated. Results Of the 439 FNACs, 121 were positive and underwent immediate ALND, and 242 negative patients underwent intraoperative SLNB (69% sensitivity, 99% specificity). Positive cases often had multiple nodal involvement (55% pN2-3). Of the 606 SLNB-ISC smears, 510 were true negative; 65 true positives allowed for one-step ALND (71% sensitivity, 99% specificity). Conclusion Preoperative positive axillary FNAC predicts a higher disease burden and determines the avoidance of SLNB for patients eligible for immediate ALND. ISC instead of FS is a safe and sensitive technique to identify metastases, indicating completion of ALND.

TI  - Towards an along-track validation of HOAPS precipitation using OceanRAIN optical disdrometer data over the Atlantic Ocean
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and fluxes from Satellite data (HOAPS) passive-microwave precipitation scan product is compared with the Ocean Rainfall And Ice-phase precipitation measurement Network (OceanRAIN) surface-based precipitation reference dataset over the global ocean. For the first time, we apply statistical point-to-area adjustments and along-track averaging to ship-based OceanRAIN precipitation data over the Atlantic Ocean to represent collocated precipitation rates better within a HOAPS satellite pixel. The statistical adjustments reduce the HOAPS-OceanRAIN root-mean-square error strongly from 2.65 to 1.01 mm/hr. Overall, the point-to-area effect impacts HOAPS-OceanRAIN differences more strongly than the precipitation regime. Higher-resolution satellite data indicate that these adjustments work best for the most convective-like precipitation cases, while some rather stratiform-like precipitation cases would need no adjustment. Excluding precipitation rates below the HOAPS sensitivity threshold of 0.3 mm/hr reduces the difference in average precipitation rates between HOAPS hits and false detections combined and OceanRAIN hits and misses combined to 2%. This precipitation-rate difference lies below the uncertainty obtained from resampling of about 10%. Without false detections, the HOAPS precipitation rate of hits-only exceeds that of OceanRAIN by 50%. Most of the HOAPS false detections follow from cases when precipitation occurs within the HOAPS pixel but off the ship track. Consequently, these apparent false detections lead to an overestimation of HOAPS precipitation rates compared with OceanRAIN, particularly in the inner Tropics and partly the midlatitudes, where clustered convective precipitation occurs most frequently. Misses cause underestimated HOAPS precipitation rates, mainly in mid and high latitudes. However, for a HOAPS validation, apparent false detections need to be considered in addition to hits of OceanRAIN precipitation rates, to which we successfully applied statistical point-to-area adjustments.

TI  - Enhancing Crop Acreage Estimation within a Semiarid Watershed via Statistical Assessments and Techniques
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to examine if the statistical methods designed to improve Cropland Data Layer (CDL) acreage estimates at a national level improve estimates at the county level. This study determined whether the calibration of CDL by statistical techniques increased the accuracy of crop estimates on a semiarid West Texas watershed. Since there is a substantial amount of agriculture and farming in areas like West Texas, accurate crop estimates of datasets at smaller scales become important. We compared three methods: the pixel counting method of the CDL, linear regression of the CDL against the MODIS Land Cover Type Product (MLCT), and the Bayesian method (posterior probability) on the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) against the USDA National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) Quick Stats. Four crops [corn (Zea mays L.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench), and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)] were analyzed at state and county levels during two growing seasons (2009 and 2011). Prediction errors were estimated by comparing computed acreage with the appropriate NASS Quick Stats values. The total error for each assessment method was estimated for all acreage values in that particular assessment category. We found that the Bayesian method improved the estimates of sorghum and winter wheat and linear regression improved acreage estimates for cotton and corn in 2011 and 2009, respectively. Our results indicate that county-level adjustments are very sensitive. Therefore, one must carefully select the method that best fits the type of crop, geographical location, and growing season being considered.

TI  - Deforestation pattern dynamics in protected areas of the Brazilian Legal Amazon using remote sensing data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation and deforestation are subjects of great concern in tropical regions, namely in South America and Africa, contributing to a rapid loss of tropical forest area and with serious implications for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation. Despite the decrease in deforestation rates In recent years, the Brazilian Amazon, with the largest continuous region of tropical forest in the world, has suffered the greatest recorded losses, which have been contributing to continuous habitat fragmentation and a reduction in the territory occupied by Amerindian populations. In an attempt to preserve the remaining habitats and forests, Brazil has been adopting land conservation policies, including the implementation of protected areas. Protected areas (PAs) possess the potential to significantly reduce habitat fragmentation by conserving large, contiguous areas of land. In order to examine how effective PAs are at conserving forest area in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, patterns of deforestation are analyzed and compared, inside and outside the PM, through landscape metrics calculated using the Patch Analyst and V-LATE extensions of a Geographic Information System. Two different sources (the Hansen Global Forest Change Dataset and the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research's (INPE) PRODES project) of annual forest cover-loss data derived from satellite imagery at medium-to-high spatial and temporal resolutions are compared at two-yearly intervals across 2002-2016. Additionally, fragmentation levels associated with deforestation patterns are assessed through an index modeled using a set of uncorrelated landscape metrics, and the associated change factors and trend are discussed. Results show that there is greater fragmentation in some PAs located in Mato Grosso and Para States, especially those near the "arc of deforestation", and that Yanomami Indigenous Lands (YIL) are tending towards more fragmentation. Although some PM are in a critical condition, findings show they all actively contribute to improved conservation of the native ecosystem and, in conjunction with sustainable management policies, will continue to help reduce or avoid forest fragmentation and degradation processes.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variations in NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> over the Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Zone in China during 2005-2015 Based on Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Zone (CCEZ), which is located in southwestern China, is the fourth largest economic zone in China. The rapid economic development of this area has resulted in many environmental problems, including extremely high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, current ground observations lack spatial and temporal coverage. In this study, satellite remote sensing techniques were used to analyze the variation in NO2 and PM2.5 from 2005 to 2015 in the CCEZ. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product were used to retrieve tropospheric NO2 vertical columns and estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. Geographically, high NO2 concentrations were mainly located in the northwest of Chengdu and southeast of Chongqing. However, high PM2.5 concentrations were mainly located in the center areas of the basin. The seasonal average NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were both highest in winter and lowest in summer. The seasonal average NO2 and PM2.5 were as high as 749.33 x 10(13) molecules x cm(-2) and 132.39 mu g .m(-3) in winter 2010, respectively. Over 11 years, the annual average NO2 and PM2.5 values in the CCEZ increased initially and then decreased, with 2011 as the inflection point. In 2007, the concentration of NO2 reached its lowest value since 2005, which was 230.15 x 10(13) molecules.cm-(2) and in 2015, the concentration of PM2.5 reached its lowest value since 2005, which was 26.43 mu g.m(-3). Our study demonstrates the potential use of satellite remote sensing to compensate for the lack of ground-observed data when quantitatively analyzing the spatial-temporal variations in regional air quality.

TI  - Monitoring the Control of Sexually Transmissible Infections and Blood-Borne Viruses: Protocol for the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS)
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: New biomedical prevention interventions make the control or elimination of some blood-borne viruses (BBVs) and sexually transmissible infections (STIs) increasingly feasible. In response, the World Health Organization and governments around the world have established elimination targets and associated timelines. To monitor progress toward such targets, enhanced systems of data collection are required. This paper describes the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS).Objective: This study aims to establish a national surveillance network designed to monitor public health outcomes and evaluate the impact of strategies aimed at controlling BBVs and STIs.Methods: ACCESS is a sentinel surveillance system comprising health services (sexual health clinics, general practice clinics, drug and alcohol services, community-led testing services, and hospital outpatient clinics) and pathology laboratories in each of Australia's 8 states and territories. Scoping was undertaken in each jurisdiction to identify sites that provide a significant volume of testing or management of BBVs or STIs or to see populations with particular risks for these infections ("priority populations"). Nationally, we identified 115 health services and 24 pathology laboratories as relevant to BBVs or STIs; purposive sampling was undertaken. As of March 2018, we had recruited 92.0% (104/113) of health services and 71% (17/24) of laboratories among those identified as relevant to ACCESS. ACCESS is based on the regular and automated extraction of deidentified patient data using specialized software called GRHANITE, which creates an anonymous unique identifier from patient details. This identifier allows anonymous linkage between and within participating sites, creating a national cohort to facilitate epidemiological monitoring and the evaluation of clinical and public health interventions.Results: Between 2009 and 2017, 1,171,658 individual patients attended a health service participating in ACCESS network comprising 7,992,241 consultations. Regarding those with unique BBV and STI-related health needs, ACCESS captured data on 366,441 young heterosexuals, 96,985 gay and bisexual men, and 21,598 people living with HIV.Conclusions: ACCESS is a unique system with the ability to track efforts to control STIs and BBVs-including through the calculation of powerful epidemiological indicators-by identifying response gaps and facilitating the evaluation of programs and interventions. By anonymously linking patients between and within services and over time, ACCESS has exciting potential as a research and evaluation platform. Establishing a national health surveillance system requires close partnerships across the research, government, community, health, and technology sectors.

TI  - Pectoral nerve block as a single anesthetic technique for breast surgery and sentinel lymph node investigation
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE ANESTESIOLOGIA Y REANIMACION
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia or, more recently, combined with conventional regional techniques. Pectoral nerves (PECs) block appears as an analgesic alternative in these procedures, but few studies refer to it as a single anesthetic technique(1-3).In this case report, we describe a 56-year-old female patient, BMI 31 kg/m(2), ASA IV, admitted for elective tumorectomy of the left upper quadrant of the breast and sentinel node investigation.Given the multiple comorbidities and the high anesthetic and surgical risk, the anaesthetic plan consisted in ultrasound guided PECs II block as a single anesthetic technique.The authors report a successful anesthetic and pain management without complications in breast surgery. PECs block, as a single anesthetic technique, may be safe, advantageous and effective with haemodynamic stability and few side effects in high risk cardiac patients.

TI  - Measuring Landscape Albedo Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is a critical parameter in surface energy balance, and albedo change is an important driver of changes in local climate. In this study, we developed a workflow for landscape albedo estimation using images acquired with a consumer-grade camera on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Flight experiments were conducted at two sites in Connecticut, USA and the UAV-derived albedo was compared with the albedo obtained from a Landsat image acquired at about the same time as the UAV experiments. We find that the UAV estimate of the visibleband albedo of an urban playground (0.037 +/- 0.063, mean +/- standard deviation of pixel values) under clear sky conditions agrees reasonably well with the estimates based on the Landsat image (0.047 +/- 0.012). However, because the cameras could only measure reflectance in three visible bands (blue, green, and red), the agreement is poor for shortwave albedo. We suggest that the deployment of a camera that is capable of detecting reflectance at a near-infrared waveband should improve the accuracy of the shortwave albedo estimation.

TI  - A simple method to improve the quality of NDVI time-series data by integrating spatiotemporal information with the Savitzky-Golay filter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data are important for many regional and global ecological and environmental applications. Unfortunately, residual noise in current NDVI time-series products greatly hinders their further applications. Several noise-reduction methods have been proposed during the past two decades, but two important issues remain to be resolved. First, the methods usually perform poorly for cases of continuous missing data in the NDVI time series. Second, they generally assume negatively biased noise in the NDVI time series and thus erroneously raise some local low NDVI values in certain cases (e.g., the harvest period for multi-season crops).We therefore developed a new noise-reduction algorithm called the Spatial-Temporal Savitzky-Golay (STSG) method. The new method assumes discontinuous clouds in space and employs neighboring pixels to assist in the noise reduction of the target pixel in a particular year. The relationship between the NDVI of neighboring pixels and that of the target pixel was obtained from multi-year NDVI time series thanks to the accumulation of NDVI data over many years, which would have been impossible a decade ago. We tested STSG on 16-day composite MODIS NDVI time-series data from 2001 to 2016 in regions of mainland China and 11 phenology camera sites in North American. The results showed that STSG performed significantly better compared with four previous widely used methods (i.e., the Asymmetric Gaussian, Double Logistic, Fourier-based, and Savitzky-Golay filter methods). One obvious advantage was that STSG was able to address the problem of temporally continuous NDVI gaps. STSG effectively increased local low NDVI values and simultaneously avoided overcorrecting low NDVI values during the crop harvest period. In addition, implementing STSG required only raw MODIS NDVI time-series products without any additional burden of data requirements. All of these advantages make STSG a promising noise-reduction method for generating high quality NDVI time-series data.

TI  - Landscape Topoedaphic Features Create Refugia from Drought and Insect Disturbance in a Lodgepole and Whitebark Pine Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts and insect outbreaks are primary disturbance processes linking climate change to tree mortality in western North America. Refugia from these disturbanceslocations where impacts are less severe relative to the surrounding landscapemay be priorities for conservation, restoration, and monitoring. In this study, hypotheses concerning physical and biological processes supporting refugia were investigated by modelling the landscape controls on disturbance refugia that were identified using remotely sensed vegetation indicators. Refugia were identified at 30-m resolution using anomalies of Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index in lodgepole and whitebark pine forests in southern Oregon, USA, in 2001 (a single-year drought with no insect outbreak) and 2009 (during a multi-year drought and severe outbreak of mountain pine beetle). Landscape controls on refugia (topographic, soil, and forest characteristics) were modeled using boosted regression trees. Landscape characteristics better explained and predicted refugia locations in 2009, when forest impacts were greater, than in 2001. Refugia in lodgepole and whitebark pine forests were generally associated with topographically shaded slopes, convergent environments such as valleys, areas of relatively low soil bulk density, and in thinner forest stands. In whitebark pine forest, refugia were associated with riparian areas along headwater streams. Spatial patterns in evapotranspiration, snowmelt dynamics, soil water storage, and drought-tolerance and insect-resistance abilities may help create refugia from drought and mountain pine beetle. Identification of the landscape characteristics supporting refugia can help forest managers target conservation resources in an era of climate-change exacerbation of droughts and insect outbreaks.

TI  - Frozen Section for Detection of Lymph Nodes After Cervical Injection with Indocyanine Green (ICG) for Sentinel Lymph Node Technique in Endometrial Cancer Staging
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to assess the role of frozen section (FS) in identifying an absence of lymph nodes during sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for apparent early-stage endometrial cancer (EC).MethodsConsecutive apparent early-stage EC patients who had SLNs removed after cervical injection with indocyanine green (ICG) from 1 June 2014 to 30 June 2016 were analyzed. An empty node (EN) was defined as an SLN specimen without evidence of lymph node(s). The association of tumor and patient characteristics with an EN was evaluated, and trend analysis to compare the rate of ENs over calendar quarters was performed. A decision-tree model was then created to compare the use of FS versus no FS for SLN evaluation in the hypothetical cohort affected by early-stage EC in the US each year.ResultsOver the study period, 300 patients met the inclusion criteria. FS revealed ENs in 24 (8%) patients. No association between patient demographic characteristics (age, body mass index, prior abdominopelvic surgery, international federation of gynecology and obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histology, myometrial invasion, cervical stromal invasion) and presence of ENs was observed. The rate of ENs at FS did not change over time (p=0.68). The hypothetical analysis showed a 4.3% decrease of inappropriately staged patients with the use of FS on the SLN (95% confidence interval 4.1-4.5).ConclusionsENs during SLN biopsy for EC staging is not a rare event and can be easily detected with FS. The implementation of FS of SLN might reduce inadequate staging of EC. Individual institutions may want to examine their own EN rates and determine if this would assist them in their SLN practices for EC.

TI  - Subpixel variability and quality assessment of satellite sea surface temperature data using a novel High Resolution Multistage Spectral Interpolation (HRMSI) technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel interpolation technique is applied to assessment of the quality of sea surface temperature (SST) observations and quantitative analysis of the subpixel variability within satellite footprints of different size. Using retrieved satellite data as input, the new, global, multistage interpolation technique generates a trigonometric polynomial, providing a representation of the underlying physical SST field in functional form. The resulting interpolating function can be efficiently and accurately evaluated anywhere within the domain over which it was derived and its moments calculated to estimate the mean and variance of the field over desired sub-regions. Application of the technique is demonstrated for SST retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensors. Comparison of the functional form with the data from which it was derived demonstrates how the technique can potentially help to identify small observational artifacts such as MODIS scan striping and residual cloud contamination. Integrals of the interpolating functions over successively larger spatial scales successfully emulate the retrieved SST at the different effective spatial resolutions and the second moments are consistent with the direct sample variances, and hence representative of the spatial SST variability of the available finer-resolution observations over the coarser scales. Using the approach, the variability of 1-km-resolution SST observations on open ocean grids of both 5- and 25 km resolution is found to be similar to 0.07 K. In regions of sharper gradients such as associated with strong localized diurnal warming, the variability within 25-km-resolution grids increases to as much as 0.4 K for sampling at 1 km resolution. The variability of 1-km observations on a 25-km-resolution grid is about 2.4 times greater than that on a 5-km-resolution grid. Broader application of the technique globally could help better quantify regional variations in the spatial variability, which would subsequently improve uncertainty estimates for existing satellite-based SST products.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was created to reduce the morbidity associated with pelvic lymphadenectomy in the early stages of cervical cancer (CC), preserving its prognostic information. The goal is to assess the diagnostic validity of SLNB in CC in initial stages (IA1 with lymphovascular infiltration (LVI) +, IA2, IB1 and IlAl ), thus avoiding unnecessary lymphadenectomies in many of the cases.Material and method: From January 2012 to April 2017, 23 patients with initial stages of CC were included in a cross-sectional study to evaluate the effectiveness of the SLNB in CC with a mixed technique of cervical injection of Tc-99(m)-nanocolloid of albumin and methylene blue, using combined planar lymphoscintigraphy with multimodality SPECT/CT image and subsequent removal of the sentinel node (SN) by laparoscopy.Results: The detection rate of SLNB with the mixed technique was 95.65%, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.45% and sensitivity (S) of 100% in the case of bilateral drainage. The mean of excised SN was 3 (range 1-5). The bilateral detection rate in laparoscopy was 85.35%. The concordance between SPECT/CT and laparoscopy for the number and bilaterality of the SN using the Pearson coefficient was r = 0.727 and r = 0.833, respectively; p = 0.01. We only found one SN with a deferred result of micrometastasis and one false negative was detected.Conclusions: SLNB in CC using a mixed technique has a high detection and bilateral drainage rate, but S is still low if we include cases of unilateral drainage. A greater number of cases and the development of intraoperative ultrastaging could increase the S of the technique and to reduce the number of false negatives.

TI  - MaxEnt modeling of soil-transmitted helminth infection distributions in Thailand
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Infections due to soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), i.e. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworms, and Strongyloides stercoralis, are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas in which approximately 1.5 billion people are infected. A clear understanding of the epidemiology and distribution of diseases is an important aid for control and prevention. The aim of our study was to identify the effects of environmental and climatic factors on distribution patterns of STHs and to develop a risk map for STH infections under current environmental and climate regimes in Thailand. Geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm software were used to determine the significant factors and to create predictive risk maps for STH infections in Thailand. The disease data from Thailand covered the years from 1969 to 2014, while environmental and climatic data were compiled from the Worldclim database, MODIS satellite imagery, Soilgrids and ISCGM. The models predicted that STHs occur mainly in southern Thailand. Mean annual precipitation was the factor most affecting the current distribution of A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and S. stercoralis. Land cover class was the main predictor for distribution of S. stercoralis and important for hookworms. Altitude was the dominant factor affecting the distribution of hookworms, and mean temperature of the wettest quarter was significantly associated with A. lumbricoides distribution. A predicted distribution map of STHs to identify environmental risk factors in Thailand is presented. This work provides a model for use in STH monitoring and health planning not only in Thailand but also in other countries with similar disease conditions.

TI  - Mechanisms of the intensification of the upwelling-favorable winds during El Nino 1997-1998 in the Peruvian upwelling system
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical processes driving the wind intensification in a coastal band of similar to 100 km off Peru during the intense 1997-1998 El Nino (EN) event were studied using a regional atmospheric model. A simulation performed for the period 1994-2000 reproduced the coastal wind response to local sea surface temperature (SST) forcing and large scale atmospheric conditions. The model, evaluated with satellite data, represented well the intensity, seasonal and interannual variability of alongshore (i.e. NW-SE) winds. An alongshore momentum budget showed that the pressure gradient was the dominant force driving the surface wind acceleration. The pressure gradient tended to accelerate the coastal wind, while turbulent vertical mixing decelerated it. A quasi-linear relation between surface wind and pressure gradient anomalies was found. Alongshore pressure gradient anomalies were caused by a greater increase in near-surface air temperature off the northern coast than off the southern coast, associated with the inhomogeneous SST warming. Vertical profiles of wind, mixing coefficient, and momentum trends showed that the surface wind intensification was not caused by the increase of turbulence in the planetary boundary layer. Moreover, the temperature inversion in the vertical mitigated the development of pressure gradient due to air convection during part of the event. Sensitivity experiments allowed to isolate the respective impacts of the local SST forcing and large scale condition on the coastal wind intensification. It was primarily driven by the local SST forcing whereas large scale variability associated with the South Pacific Anticyclone modulated its effects. Examination of other EN events using reanalysis data confirmed that intensifications of alongshore wind off Peru were associated with SST alongshore gradient anomalies, as during the 1997-1998 event.

TI  - Detection of IASI dust AOD trends over Sahara: How many years of data required?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting trends in climate variables has become of great importance in the context of the rapid evolution of the Earth's climate. Among the climate variables recognized as acting on climate variability, aerosols continue to contribute one of the largest uncertainties to the total radiative forcing estimate. The present study focuses on dust aerosols, a major contributor to total aerosol loading. Observation from space offers a good opportunity to follow aerosol evolution at global scale and over long time series. In this context, infrared observations, by allowing retrieving dust optical depth (AOD) day-time and night-time, over oceans and over continents, in particular over desert, is complementary to observations in the visible on which a majority of aerosol studies are so far based. The two spectral domains are not sensitive to the same range of particle size, coarse mode particles ( > 1 m) being preferentially observed in the infrared, when both coarse and fine mode particles (0.1-1 mu m) are observed in the visible making the distinction between the two modes difficult. Starting from METOP-A/IASI-derived dust AOD (July 2007 to June 2017), this study aims at detecting and estimating, day-time and night-time, dust AOD trends over Sahara, a region where dust aerosol emissions are frequent and often intense. Detecting trends in geophysical variable time series is a difficult task due to the frequent presence of serial correlation, to holes in the data, to "outliers", or to variables not normally distributed, etc. Here, trends are determined using the non-parametric Theil-Sen slope estimator followed by the Mann-Kendall statistical test for randomness against trend, the statistical hypothesis (H-0) being that the trend is equal to zero. Resulting trends are judged to be significantly different from zero if their so-called "confidence level" is above a given percentage, usually 95% (referred to as "real" trend in the following). Then, in a second step, supposing the statistical hypothesis is now that a non-zero trend of specified magnitude exists, we can calculate the probability that this hypothesis is true. The number of years of data required to detect a "real" trend of a specified magnitude with probability 0.9 ("probability-assigned real" trend) is finally determined following (Tiao et al., 1990). This approach is then applied to the 120 months of IASI-retrieved dust AOD. Main conclusions are that the present 10 year period of IASI observations is still too limited to provide enough reliable, probability-assigned, trends over Sahara and that a period of 14-15 years would largely increase their number and spatial coverage. This is fully compatible with the already planned length of the IASI series on board METOP-A to -C, taking into account the high demonstrated stability of this instrument.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations over China during 2005-2016: A satellite-based estimation using the random forests approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Few studies have estimated historical exposures to PM10 at a national scale in China using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (ADD). Also, long-term trends have not been investigated.Objectives: In this study, daily concentrations of PM10 over China during the past 12 years were estimated with the most recent ground monitoring data, AOD, land use information, weather data and a machine learning approach.Methods: Daily measurements of PM10 during 2014-2016 were collected from 1479 sites in China. Two types of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD data, land use information, and weather data were downloaded and merged. A random forests model (non-parametric machine learning algorithms) and two traditional regression models were developed and their predictive abilities were compared. The best model was applied to estimate daily concentrations of PM10 across China during 2005-2016 at 0.1 degrees (approximate to 10 km).Results: Cross-validation showed our random forests model explained 78% of daily variability of PM10 [root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) = 31.5 mu g/m(3)]. When aggregated into monthly and annual averages, the models captured 82% (RMSE = 19.3 mu g/m(3)) and 81% (RMSE = 14.4 mu g/m(3)) of the variability. The random forests model showed much higher predictive ability and lower bias than the other two regression models. Based on the predictions of random forests model, around one-third of China experienced with PM10 pollution exceeding Grade II National Ambient Air Quality Standard (>70 mu g/m(3)) in China during the past 12 years. The highest levels of estimated PM10 were present in the Taklamakan Desert of Xinjiang and Beijing-Tianjin metropolitan region, while the lowest were observed in Tibet, Yunnan and Hainan. Overall, the PM10 level in China peaked in 2006 and 2007, and declined since 2008.Conclusions: This is the first study to estimate historical PM10 pollution using satellite-based AOD data in China with random forests model. The results can be applied to investigate the long-term health effects of PM10 in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phenology-Based Residual Trend Analysis of MODIS-NDVI Time Series for Assessing Human-Induced Land Degradation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is a widespread environmental issue and an important factor in limiting sustainability. In this study, we aimed to improve the accuracy of monitoring human-induced land degradation by using phenological signal detection and residual trend analysis (RESTREND). We proposed an improved model for assessing land degradation named phenology-based RESTREND (P-RESTREND). This method quantifies the influence of precipitation on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) variation by using the bivariate linear regression between NDVI and precipitation in pre-growing season and growing season. The performances of RESTREND and P-RESTREND for discriminating land degradation caused by climate and human activities were compared based on vegetation-precipitation relationship. The test area is in Western Songnen Plain, Northeast China. It is a typical region with a large area of degraded drylands. The MODIS 8-day composite reflectance product and daily precipitation data during 2000-2015 were used. Our results showed that P-RESTREND was more effective in distinguishing different drivers of land degradation than the RESTREND. Degraded areas in the Songnen grasslands can be effectively detected by P-RESTREND. Therefore, this modified model can be regarded as a practical method for assessing human-induced land degradation.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns and Impacts of Sediment Variations in Downstream of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spanning the Yangtze River of China, the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has received considerable concern worldwide with its potential impacts on the downstream side of the dam. This work investigated the spatio-temporal variations of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at the downstream section of Yichang-to-Chenglingji from 2002 to 2015. A random forest model was developed to estimate SSC using MODIS ground reflectance products, and the spatio-temporal distributions of SSC were retrieved with this model to investigate the characteristics of water-silt variation. Our results revealed that, relatively, SSC before 2003 was evenly distributed in the downstream Yangtze River, while this spatial distribution pattern changed ce 2003 when the dam started storing water. Temporally, the SSC demonstrated a W-shaped curve of seasonal variation as one peak occurred in September and two troughs in March and November, and showed a significantly decreasing trend after three-stage impoundment. After official operation of the TGD in 2009, the SSC was reduced by over 40% than before 2003. Spatially, the most significant changes occurred in the upper Jingjiang section, where the SSC dropped by 45%. During all stages of impoundment, the water impoundment to 135 m in 2003 had the most significant impact on suspended sediment. The decreased SSC has led to emerging risks of bank failure, aggravated erosion of water front and aggressive down-cutting erosion along the downstream of the dam, as well as other ecological and environmental issues that require urgent attention by the government.

TI  - Improving regional winter wheat yield estimation through assimilation of phenology and leaf area index from remote sensing data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation at regional scale using crop model is generally subjected to large uncertainties from insufficient spatial information on heterogeneous growth environment and agronomic management practices. To solve this problem, we assimilated crop phenology and leaf area index (LAI) derived from remote sensing into a crop model (MCWLA-Wheat) to improve its reliability in estimating winter wheat yields at regional scale. Since the LAI magnitude was obviously underestimated however its spatial pattern was relatively well captured by remote sensing, we developed a novel spatial assimilation scheme that assimilated the spatial differences instead of the absolute values of LAI into crop model. Firstly, we retrieved the information of critical development stages of winter wheat from remote sensing data to adjust the simulation of phenology by MCWLA-Wheat model; then the spatial differences of LAI derived from remote sensing were assimilated into the MCWLA-Wheat model using a kind of constant gain Kalman Filter algorithm to improve the ability of the model in estimating winter wheat LAI and yields at regional scale in the North China Plain. This assimilation scheme extracted effective information from remote sensing LAI and meanwhile abandoned the information with obvious errors, ensuring that the assimilation variables could be close to the reality. It avoids the requirement for correction of the LAI derived from remote sensing using other high-quality ancillary data from field measurements. Using this assimilation scheme, the performance of crop model improved substantially. It successfully produced more accurate yield estimates at regional scale during the period of 2001-2008 (mean R-2 = 0.42, RMSE = 737/ha) than those without assimilation (mean R-2 = 0.26, RMSE = 1012 kg/ha) and those directly assimilating the absolute LAI values derived from remote sensing (mean R-2 = 0.30, RMSE = 1257/ha). Our findings demonstrated a reliable and promising assimilation scheme for improving yield estimation of crop model at regional scale with low data requirement.

TI  - Towards a 20 m Global Building Map from Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces a technique for automatically mapping built-up areas using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering intensity and interferometric multi-temporal coherence generated from Sentinel-1 data in the framework of the Copernicus program. The underlying hypothesis is that, in SAR images, built-up areas exhibit very high backscattering values that are coherent in time. Several particular characteristics of the Sentinel-1 satellite mission are put to good use, such as its high revisit time, the availability of dual-polarized data, and its small orbital tube. The newly developed algorithm is based on an adaptive parametric thresholding that first identifies pixels with high backscattering values in both VV and VH polarimetric channels. The interferometric SAR coherence is then used to reduce false alarms. These are caused by land cover classes (other than buildings) that are characterized by high backscattering values that are not coherent in time (e.g., certain types of vegetated areas). The algorithm was tested on Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath data from five different test sites located in semiarid and arid regions in the Mediterranean region and Northern Africa. The resulting building maps were compared with the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) derived from the TerraSAR-X mission data and, on average, a 92% agreement was obtained.

TI  - A Corporate Understanding of Biblical Salvation and Its Application to Climate Change Mitigation Measures
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with a theological approach to the issue of climate change and examines some of the misconceptions found within Christianity with regards the environment. These distortions of understanding can be traced back to the way in which salvation is articulated and perceived. In the circumstances it becomes a pressing public task to consider the key biblical conceptions of salvation. Of critical significance is how the salvific tradition is understood to be corporate rather than individualistic. That is so right from the beginning of Israel's redemptive history and carries through the biblical material to include God's redemptive work in Christ which is itself extended through to the rest of creation. The current mitigation measures (and their limitations) with regards to climate change are critically evaluated alongside these salvific claims.

TI  - Taking climate change here and now - mitigating ideological polarization with psychological distance
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Construal level theory of psychological distance suggests that people are likely to pay more attention to contextual cues when appraising proximal, rather than distant stimuli. We tested the theory in the climate change context by examining if framing climate change impacts in a psychologically close way may motivate the American public to support climate-mitigating policies and enact climate-mitigating actions, accounting for their political ideology, cultural worldview, and environmental value. Results of an experimental survey based on a large adult sample (N = 1,086) supported some of our hypotheses. Ideological polarization in climate change perception was reduced when climate change impact was portrayed as influencing a spatially close and familiar exemplar, as compared to a spatially distant and novel exemplar. However, cultural worldview and environmental value had consistent influence on policy support and environmental action, regardless of message framing.

TI  - Seasonal distributions of heavy metal concentrations in different snail (<i>Helix pomatia</i>) tissues from an urban environment in Serbia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences between concentrations of heavy metals (cadmium, copper, zinc, iron, and manganese) in terrestrial gastropods, Helix pomatia, collected in four different environment locations in Panevo city, Serbia. Metal concentrations in the foot and in the digestive gland were measured. Heavy metals cadmium, copper, zinc, iron, and manganese were measured in triplicate by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Also, this study investigated correlations between the trace element content in the soft tissues and different seasons (summer and fall). The results showed that heavy metal concentrations of the measured elements in both snail tissues were significantly higher in polluted sites when compared to the background levels in the city. In digestive gland tissues, the concentration of heavy metals was higher compared with that in foot tissues. The bioaccumulation (heavy metal concentrations in soft tissues) of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn) in snails, Helix pomatia, has been assessed and related to seasons and sites. Heavy metal accumulation in the soft tissues of snails could provide a powerful monitoring tool for the assessment of environmental heavy metal pollution.

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Electronic data collected from routine health care can be used for public health surveillance. To examine the Sentinel System, a distributed data network of health plans, as a source for influenza surveillance, we compared trends in outpatient prescription dispensings of influenza antivirals in Sentinel to trends in CDC's ILINet and NREVSS systems over five seasons. There were 2102885 dispensed prescriptions of oseltamivir capsules, 494188 of oseltamivir powder, and 7955 of zanamivir. Across all seasons, the magnitude and timing of peaks in drug utilization were highly comparable to those in ILINet and NREVSS. Oseltamivir capsules and powder were well correlated with ILINet and NREVSS. This lays the foundation for further exploration of Sentinel's utility for influenza surveillance.

TI  - A first assessment of the Sentinel-2 Level 1-C cloud mask product to support informed surface analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection in optical remote sensing images is a crucial problem because undetected clouds can produce misleading results in the analyses of surface and atmospheric parameters. Sentinel-2 provides high spatial resolution satellite data distributed with associated cloud masks. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 Level-1C cloud mask products to discriminate clouds over a variety of biogeographic scenarios and in different cloudiness conditions. Reference cloud masks for the identification of misdetection were generated by applying a local thresholding method that analyses Sentinel-2 Band 2 (0.490 mu m) and Band 10 (1.375 mu m) separately; histogram-based thresholds were locally tuned by checking the single bands and the natural color composite (B4B3B2); in doubtful cases, NDVI and DEM were also analyzed to refine the masks; the B2B11B12 composite was used to separate snow.The analysis of the cloud classification errors obtained for our test sites allowed us to get important inferences of general value. The L1C cloud mask generally underestimated the presence of clouds (average Omission Error, OE, 37.4%); this error increased (OE > 50%) for imagery containing opaque clouds with a large transitional zone (between the cloud core and clear areas) and cirrus clouds, fragmentation emerged as a major source of omission errors (R-2 0.73). Overestimation was prevalently found in the presence of holes inside the main cloud bodies. Two extreme environments were particularly critical for the L1C cloud mask product. Detection over Amazonian rainforests was highly inefficient (OE > 70%) due to the presence of complex cloudiness and high water vapor content. On the other hand, Alpine orography under dry atmosphere created false cirrus clouds. Altogether, cirrus detection was the most inefficient. According to our results, Sentinel-2 L1C users should take some simple precautions while waiting for ESA improved cloud detection products.

TI  - Advanced Ultraviolet Radiation and Ozone Retrieval for Applications (AURORA): A Project Overview
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P, lifted-off on 13 October 2017), Sentinel-4 (S-4) and Sentinel-5 (S-5)(from 2021 and 2023 onwards, respectively) operational missions of the ESA/EU Copernicus program, a massive amount of atmospheric composition data with unprecedented quality will become available from geostationary (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) observations. Enhanced observational capabilities are expected to foster deeper insight than ever before on key issues relevant for air quality, stratospheric ozone, solar radiation, and climate. A major potential strength of the Sentinel observations lies in the exploitation of complementary information that originates from simultaneous and independent satellite measurements of the same air mass. The core purpose of the AURORA (Advanced Ultraviolet Radiation and Ozone Retrieval for Applications) project is to investigate this exploitation from a novel approach for merging data acquired in different spectral regions from on board the GEO and LEO platforms. A data processing chain is implemented and tested on synthetic observations. A new data algorithm combines the ultraviolet, visible and thermal infrared ozone products into S-4 and S-5(P) fused profiles. These fused products are then ingested into state-of-the-art data assimilation systems to obtain a unique ozone profile in analyses and forecasts mode. A comparative evaluation and validation of fused products assimilation versus the assimilation of the operational products will seek to demonstrate the improvements achieved by the proposed approach. This contribution provides a first general overview of the project, and discusses both the challenges of developing a technological infrastructure for implementing the AURORA concept, and the potential for applications of AURORA derived products, such as tropospheric ozone and UV surface radiation, in sectors such as air quality monitoring and health.

TI  - Laboratory challenges of Plasmodium species identification in Aceh Province, Indonesia, a malaria elimination setting with newly discovered <i>P-knowlesi</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The discovery of the life-threatening zoonotic infection Plasmodium knowlesi has added to the challenges of prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis and surveillance. In this study from Aceh Province, Indonesia, a malaria elimination setting where P. knowlesi endemicity was not previously known, we report the laboratory investigation and difficulties encountered when using molecular detection methods for quality assurance of microscopically identified clinical cases. From 2014 to 2015, 20 (49%) P. falciparum, 16 (39%) P. vivax, 3 (7%) P. malariae, and 2 (5%) indeterminate species were identified by microscopy from four sentinel health facilities. At a provincial-level reference laboratory, loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP), a field-friendly molecular method, was performed and confirmed Plasmodium in all samples though further species-identification was limited by the unavailability of non-falciparum species-specific testing with the platform used. At a national reference laboratory, several molecular methods including nested PCR (nPCR) targeting the 18 small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA, nPCR targeting the cytochrome-b (cytb) gene, a P. knowlesi-specific nPCR, and finally sequencing, were necessary to ultimately classify the samples as: 19 (46%) P. knowlesi, 8 (20%) P. falciparum, 14 (34%) P. vivax. Microscopy was unable to identify or mis-classified up to 56% of confirmed cases, including all cases of P. knowlesi. With the nPCR methods targeting the four human-only species, P. knowlesi was missed (18S rRNA method) or showed cross-reactivity for P. vivax (cytb method). To facilitate diagnosis and management of potentially fatal P. knowlesi infection and surveillance for elimination of human-only malaria in Indonesia and other affected settings, new detection methods are needed for testing at the point-of-care and in local reference laboratories.

TI  - Aspects Regarding the Use of Some Species of Plants as Bioindicators in Air Quality Assessment
T2  - REVISTA DE CHIMIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to assess the identification of the specific species of plants for selection of certain plant species and utilization of selected one's in experimental biomonitoring studies. The purpose of the proposed study was to develop and apply new techniques, methods and methodologies for air quality assessing in the context of climate change and updating of international environmental studys. The novelty of the active biomonitoring method using plants is an innovative research area for the National Research and Development Institute for Industrial Ecology in terms of the use of sentinel species. The first stage research activity was aimed to identify plant species with specific response to certain environmental pollutants, in our case, ozone. By exposing higher plants (from the Solanaceae family) to various environmental conditions, a direct impact measurement of ground-level ozone was considered - as an indicator of environmental pollution (air) - there was a significant difference relationship between soil level ozone variation and foliar necrosis.

TI  - Absolute Calibration or Validation of the Altimeters on the Sentinel-3A and the Jason-3 over Lake Issykkul (Kyrgyzstan)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Calibration/Validation (C/V) studies using sites in the oceans have a long history and protocols are well established. Over lakes, C/V allows addressing problems such as the performance of the various retracking algorithms and evaluating the accuracy of the geophysical corrections for continental waters. This is achievable when measurements of specific and numerous field campaigns and a ground permanent network of level gauges and weather stations are processed. C/V consists of installation of permanent sites (weather stations, limnigraphs, and GPS reference points) and the organization of regular field campaigns. The lake Issykkul serves as permanent site of C/V, for a multi-mission purpose. The objective of this paper is to calculate the altimeter biases of Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A, both belonging to an operational satellite system which is used for the long-term monitoring of lake level variations. We have also determined the accuracy of the altimeters of these two satellites, through a comparison analysis with in situ data. In 2016 and 2017, three campaigns have been organized over this lake in order to estimate the absolute bias of the nadir altimeter onboard the Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A. The fieldwork consisted of measuring water height using a GPS system, carried on a boat, along the track of the altimeter satellite across the lake. It was performed at the time of the pass of the altimeter. Absolute altimeter biases were calculated by averaging the water height differences along the pass of the satellite (GPS from the boat system versus altimetry). Jason-3 operates in a Low Resolution Mode (LRM), while the Sentinel-3A operates in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode. In this study we found that the absolute biases measured for Jason-3 were -28 +/- 40 mm with the Ocean retracker and 206 +/- 30 mm with the Ice-1 retracker. The biases for Sentinel-3A were -14 +/- 20 mm with the Samosa (Ocean like) retracker and 285 +/- 20 mm with the OCOG (Ice-1-like) retracker. We have also evaluated the accuracy of these two altimeters over Lake Issykkul which reached to 3 cm, for both the instruments, using the Ocean retracker.

TI  - A Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Procedure Based on Stable Areas to Filter the Atmospheric Component
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) procedure to monitor the land deformation in an urban area induced by aquifer dewatering and the consequent drawdown of the water table. The procedure, based on Sentinel-1 data, is illustrated considering the construction works of Glories Square, Barcelona (Spain). The study covers a period from March 2015 to November 2017, which includes a dewatering event in spring 2017. This paper describes the proposed procedure, whose most original part includes the estimation of the atmospheric phase component using stable areas located in the vicinity of the monitoring area. The performances of the procedure are analysed, characterising the original atmospheric phase component and the residual one that remains after modelling the atmospheric contribution. This procedure can work with any type of deformation phenomena, provided that its spatial extension is sufficiently small. The quality of the obtained time series is illustrated discussing different deformation results, including a validation result using piezometric data and a thermal expansion case.

TI  - Management of the axilla after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: Sentinel node biopsy and radiotherapy considerations
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Preoperative or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the management of breast cancer is a treatment approach that has gained in popularity in recent years. However, it is unclear if the treatment paradigms often employed for patients treated with surgery first hold true for those treated with preoperative chemotherapy. The role of sentinel node biopsy and the data supporting its use is different for those with clinically negative and clinically positive nodes prior to chemotherapy. For clinically node-negative patients, sentinel node biopsy after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy may be appropriate. For those node-positive patients whose axillary disease resolves clinically, the false-negative rate of the sentinel node biopsy is high. However, there are measures that can reduce that rate. After surgery, the radiation oncologist is often faced with complicated decisions surrounding the optimal radiotherapy in this setting. Tailoring radiation plans based on chemotherapy response holds promise and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials. In the accompanying article, we review the current literature on both surgery and radiation in axillary management and describe the interplay between these two treatment modalities. This highlights the need for multidisciplinary management in making treatment decisions for patients treated in this manner.

TI  - Simulation of Pollutant Trajectories in Natural and Anthropogenic Events
T2  - REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Several evidences support the idea that the Homo sapiens has become a geological force, which may introduce changes not only in human life but also in the life of all living species in the Earth and on the equilibrium of chemical and biochemical process. Nowadays, some anthropogenic events, such as accidents in industrial and energy supplies, mainly nuclear plants, may release huge quantities of pollutants which may affect Earths's life in a similar way than natural events, such as volcanic eruptions. In this work, the trajectory model HYSPLIT (Hybrid Singled-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory), which has an easy implementation, is presented to simulate the air trajectories. As case studies, a natural event, the Puyehue volcano (Chile) eruption, and a fire episode in the port area of Guaruja (SP, Brasil) were selected. The volcano eruption began on June 04, 2011 and the ashes first reached the region of Bariloche and Villa La Angostura (Argentina). Lately the ashes reached the North of Patagonia and Buenos Aires (Argentina) and finally Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and the South of Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina). The fire in Guaruja lasted 37 hours and began in a freight terminal on January 14, 2016. Toxic gases affected the accident area (Vicente de Carvalho District in the city of Guaruja, SP), and diffused in Guaruja, reaching Santos and Cubatao. Using HYSPLIT model, it was possible to reproduce the air masses trajectories in a good agreement with available data for both events. This study shows that the program, which can be used online, provides satisfactory results, consistent with satellite data and information from meteorological and air quality stations, both for natural events, such as volcanic eruptions and natural fires, and, also for accidents in industries, nuclear plants and fires.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Coastal Upwelling in the South-Eastern Baltic Sea: Statistical Properties and Implications for the Coastal Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A detailed study of wind-induced coastal upwelling (CU) in the south-eastern Baltic Sea is presented based on an analysis of multi-mission satellite data. Analysis of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea surface temperature (SST) maps acquired between April and September of 2000-2015 allowed for the identification of 69 CU events. The Ekman-based upwelling index (UI) was applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the satellite measurements for upwelling detection. It was found that satellite data enable the identification of 87% of UI-based upwelling events during May-August, hence, serving as an effective tool for CU detection in the Baltic Sea under relatively cloud-free summer conditions. It was also shown that upwelling-induced SST drops, and its spatial properties are larger than previously registered. During extreme upwelling events, an SST drop might reach 14 degrees C, covering a total area of nearly 16,000 km(2). The evolution of an upwelling front during such intensive events is accompanied by the generation of transverse filaments extending up to 70 km offshore. An analysis of the satellite optical data shows a clear decline in the chlorophyll-a concentration in the coastal zone and in the shallow Curonian Lagoon, where it drops down by an order of magnitude. It was also shown that a cold upwelling front alters the stratification in the atmospheric boundary layer, leading to a sudden drop of air temperature and near-surface winds.

AB  - A promising application field of geophysics is monitoring and analysis of the state of conservation of works of art, such as wall paintings including frescoes. To this aim, two are the issues to address: the choice of the most appropriate survey instrument and method, and the analysis and interpretation of data coming from the survey, after their processing. This paper deals with a spatial analysis based protocol for the interpretation of data coming from different non-invasive tests, to improve the extraction process of the pattern decay. The case study is a frescoed wall of Gymnasium in Pompeii, investigated with the following non-invasive techniques: structure-from-motion photogrammetry (SfM), ground-penetrating radar, multitemporal infrared thermography.

TI  - Sentinel-1 and Ground-Based Sensors for Continuous Monitoring of the Corvara Landslide (South Tyrol, Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions over large areas with high temporal and spatial resolution. This new generation of satellites providing open-data products has enhanced the capabilities for continuously studying Earth surface changes. Over the past two decades, several studies have demonstrated the potential of differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) for detecting and quantifying land surface deformation. DInSAR limitations and challenges are linked to the SAR properties and the field conditions (especially in mountainous environments) leading to spatial and temporal decorrelation of the SAR signal. High temporal decorrelation can be caused by changes in vegetation (particularly in nonurban areas), atmospheric conditions, or high ground surface velocity. In this study, the kinematics of the complex and vegetated Corvara landslide, situated in Val Badia (South Tyrol, Italy), are monitored by a network of three permanent and 13 monthly measured benchmark points measured with the differential global navigation satellite system (DGNSS) technique. The slope displacement rates are found to be highly unsteady and reach several meters a year. This paper focuses firstly on evaluating the performance of DInSAR changing unwrapping and coherence parameters with Sentinel-1 imagery, and secondly, on applying DInSAR with DGNSS measurements to monitor an active and complex landslide. To this end, 41 particular SAR images, coherence thresholds, and 2D and 3D unwrapping processes give various results in terms of reliability and accuracy, supporting the understanding of the landslide velocity field. Evolutions of phase changes are analysed according to the coherence, the changing field conditions, and the monitored ground-based displacements.

T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present days, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques are comprehensive tools for the assessment of water resource, its management and conservation. In this study, remote sensing and GIS techniques are taken into consideration for zonation of different groundwater prospects of Pravara basin. Several contributing factors in which groundwater potential of an area entirely or partially depends such as lithology, geomorphology, slope, soil, lineament density, drainage density, land use and rainfall are assessed individually as well as together for making the different groundwater prospect maps through influencing factor (IF) and frequency ratio (FR) techniques. In ArcGIS software, all these thematic layers are prepared using different satellite imageries and conventional data sets, obtained from different sources. All these layers are transformed into high-resolution raster format and meshed together in GIS environment using IF and FR methods. Groundwater prospect maps are constructed as a result of overlay analysis. Based on the constructed map of groundwater prospect zones, as a result of this study, the study area is divided into five categories of different groundwater potential zones: very high, high, moderate, low and very low. Validation of the resultant maps has shown that frequency ratio technique is having higher accuracy (AUC=73%) compared to the influencing factors (AUC=69%). The present study of groundwater zonation provides a simple and less time-consuming technique; also, the results can directly be used for planning and sustainable management in Pravara basin.

TI  - Evaluation of Remotely Sensed Snow Water Equivalent and Snow Cover Extent over the Contiguous United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global snow water equivalent (SWE) products derived at least in part from satellite remote sensing are widely used in weather, climate, and hydrometeorological studies. Here we evaluate three such products using our recently developed daily 4-km SWE dataset available from October 1981 to September 2017 over the conterminous United States. This SWE dataset is based on gridded precipitation and temperature data and thousands of in situ measurements of SWE and snow depth. It has a 0.98 correlation and 30% relative mean absolute deviation with Airborne Snow Observatory data and effectively bridges the gap between small-scale lidar surveys and large-scale remotely sensed data. We find that SWE products using remote sensing data have large differences (e.g., the mean absolute difference from our SWE data ranges from 45.8% to 59.3% of the mean SWE in our data), especially in forested areas (where this percentage increases up to 73.5%). Furthermore, they consistently underestimate average maximum SWE values and produce worse SWE (including spurious jumps) during snowmelt. Three additional higher-resolution satellite snow cover extent (SCE) products are used to compare the SCE values derived from these SWE products. There is an overall close agreement between these satellite SCE products and SCE generated from our SWE data, providing confidence in our consistent SWE, snow depth, and SCE products based on gridded climate and station data. This agreement is also stronger than that between satellite SCE and those derived from the three satellite SWE products, further confirming the deficiencies of the SWE products that utilize remote sensing data.

TI  - Improvements of the MODIS Gross Primary Productivity model based on a comprehensive uncertainty assessment over the Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests and savannas are responsible for the largest proportion of global Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), a major component of the global carbon cycle. However, there are still deficiencies in the spatial and temporal information of tropical photosynthesis and its relations with environmental controls. The MOD17 product, based on the Light Use Efficiency (LUE) concept, has been updated to provide GPP estimates around the globe. In this research, the MOD17 GPP collections 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0 and their sources of uncertainties were assessed by using measurements of meteorology and eddy covariance GPP from eight flux towers in Brazilian tropical ecosystems, from 2000 to 2006. Results showed that the MOD17 collections tend to overestimate GPP at low productivity sites (bias between 111% and 584%) and underestimate it at high productivity sites (bias between - 2% and - 18%). Overall, the MOD17 product was not able to capture the GPP seasonality, especially in the equatorial sites. Recalculations of MOD17 GPP using site-specific meteorological data, corrected land use/land cover (LULC) classification, and tower-based LUE parameter showed improvements for some sites. However, the improvements were not sufficient to estimate the GPP seasonality in the equatorial forest sites. The use of a new soil moisture constraint on the LUE, based on the Evaporative Fraction, just showed improvements in water-limited sites. Modifications in the algorithm to account for separate LUE for cloudy and clear sky days presented noticeably improved GPP estimates in the tropical ecosystems investigated, both in magnitude and in seasonality. The results suggest that the high cloudiness makes the diffuse radiation an important factor to be considered in the LUE control, especially over dense forests. Thus, the MOD17 GPP algorithm needs more updates to accurately estimate productivity in tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Breast-conserving surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation offers survival benefits over mastectomy without irradiation
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The prognostic equivalence between mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiotherapy was shown in pivotal trials conducted decades ago. Since then, detection and treatment of breast cancer have improved substantially and recent retrospective analyses point towards a survival benefit for less extensive breast surgery. Evidence for the association of such survival data with locoregional recurrence rates is largely lacking.Methods: The Swedish Multicentre Cohort Study prospectively included clinically node-negative patients with breast cancer who had planned sentinel node biopsy between 2000 and 2004. Axillary lymph node dissection was undertaken only in patients with sentinel node metastases. For the present investigation, adjusted survival analyses were used to compare patients who underwent BCS and postoperative radiotherapy with those who received mastectomy without radiotherapy.Results: Of 3518 patients in the Swedish Multicentre Cohort Study, 2767 were included in the present analysis; 2338 had BCS with postoperative radiotherapy and 429 had mastectomy without radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 156 months. BCS followed by whole-breast irradiation was superior to mastectomy without irradiation in terms of both overall survival (79.5 versus 64.3 per cent respectively at 13 years; P < 0.001) and breast cancer-specific survival (90.5 versus 84.0 per cent at 13 years; P < 0.001). The local recurrence rate did not differ between the two groups. The axillary recurrence-free survival rate at 13 years was significantly lower after mastectomy without irradiation (98.3 versus 96.2 per cent; P < 0.001).Conclusion: The present data support the superiority or BCS with postoperative radiotherapy over mastectomy without radiotherapy. The axillary recurrence rate differed significantly, and could be one contributing factor in a complex explanatory model.

TI  - Mapping Crop Calendar Events and Phenology-Related Metrics at the Parcel Level by Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) of MODIS-NDVI Time-Series: A Case Study in Central California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology allows monitoring the progress of vegetation and crop phenology in large regions. Seasonal vegetation trends are commonly estimated from high temporal resolution but coarse spatial resolution satellite imagery, e.g., from MODIS-NDVI (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series, which has usually limited their application to scenarios with few land uses or crops covering areas larger than actual parcel sizes. As an alternative, this paper proposes a general and robust procedure to map crop phenology at the level of individual crop parcels, and validates its feasibility in a complex and diverse cropland area located in central California. A first calibration phase consisted of evaluating the three curve-fitting models implemented in the TIMESAT software (i.e., asymmetric Gaussian (AG), double logistic (DL), and adaptive Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering) and reporting the model and its settings that best adjusted to the MODIS-NDVI profile of each crop studied. Next, based on the selected crop-specific models and with a crop map previously obtained from ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) multi-temporal images, the procedure mapped four crop calendar events (i.e., start, end, middle, and length of the season) and five phenology-related metrics (i.e., base, maximum, amplitude, derivatives, and integrals of the NDVI values) of the study region by object-based image analysis (OBIA) of the MODIS-NDVI time-series. To mitigate the impact of mixed pixels, the OBIA procedure was designed to automatically apply a restrictive criterion based on the coverage of MODIS-NDVI pixels in each crop parcel: (1) using only the MODIS-NDVI pixels that were placed 100% within each crop parcel (i.e., pure pixels); or (2) if no pure pixels exist in any crop parcel, using only pixels with coverage percentages greater than 50%, and in such cases, reporting the mixing percentage in the output file. The calibration phase showed that the performance of the SG filtering was superior in most crops, with the exception of rice, while the AG model was intermediate in all of the cases. Differences between the dates of the start and end of the season that were observed in 120 ground-truth fields and the ones estimated by the crop-specific models were in a range of 11 days (for the corn fields) and 22 days (for the vineyard fields) on average. The OBIA procedure was also validated in 240 independent parcels with pure MODIS-NDVI pixels, reporting 89% and 82% of accuracy when mapping the start and end of the season, respectively. Our results revealed different growth patterns of the studied crops, especially of the crop calendar events of herbaceous (i.e., corn, rice, sunflower, and tomato) and woody crops (i.e., almond, walnut, and vineyard), of the NDVI derivatives of rice and the other studied herbaceous crops, and of the NDVI integrals of vineyard and the other studied woody crops. The resulting maps and tables provide valuable geospatial information for every parcel over time with several applications in cropland management, irrigation scheduling, and ecosystem modeling.

TI  - Axillary Surgery in Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Breast-Conserving Surgery at German Breast Cancer Centers Within the Last 14 Years - Comparison of a University Center and a Community Hospital
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Guideline recommendations for axillary surgical approach in breast cancer (BC) treatment changed over the last decade.Methods Data from all invasive BC patients (n = 5344) treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) at the breast cancer centers of the University Hospital Ulm (U-BCC) and the community hospital Dachau (D-BCC) were included into a retrospective analysis for assessing information on axillary surgery between 2003 and 2016 based on the documented cancer registry data.Results The average annual rate of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) was 85.5% and 87.2% in Ulm and Dachau, respectively. SNB was performed more precisely at the U-BCC with a median of 2.4 resected lymph nodes (LN) compared to a median of 3.2 resected LN in Dachau. Median number of resected LN for axillary lymph node dissection (ALNE) showed a statistically significant reduction over time in Ulm (rs = -0.82; p < 0.001) and Dachau (rs = -0.76; p = 0.002). The rate of secondary ALNE (after SNB; 2 degrees ALNE) decreased significantly in U-BCC (r(s) = -0.76; p = 0.002) while it remained stable in D-BCC. The influential publication of the Z0011 study in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction of secondary ALNE (24.1% preZ0011 and 14.4% postZ0011; p < 0.001) in Ulm.Conclusion Changes in axillary surgery over time can be seen in the annual statistics of the reviewed BCCs. With BCS, mostly SNB was performed and numbers of removed LN in ALNE have decreased. In the U-BCC, the rate of 2 degrees ALNE dropped after the publication of the Z0011 data. The fact that no such decrease for 2 degrees ALNE was found in D-BCC suggests that university hospitals implement new data and research results into clinical routine earlier than peripheral community hospitals.

TI  - Vegetation and soil moisture inversion from SAR closure phases: First experiments and results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The inversion of soil moisture from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) closure phases is intrinsically plagued by ambiguities that affect the moisture order. This work shows a characterization of the ambiguities and a way to solve for them with the help of interferometric coherence. This allows to properly constrain the inversion and to retrieve the moisture signal. A data set of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 L-band images is used as an example of successful inversion at the scene level, with sub-kilometer resolution. The results are validated with soil moisture products based on ASCAT and show a high degree of correlation. The raw moisture derived by the algorithm could be immediately used to correct SAR interferometric phases; however, for applications that need absolute moisture levels, a calibration step is likely necessary. Unexpectedly, a good performance was observed over forested areas, which suggests a sensitivity of closure phases to tree moisture; at the same time, over pastures and agricultural fields the closure phase signal was found relatively weak. Additional research is needed to evaluate the applicability of the same measurements principle to shorter wavelengths and exploitation of potential synergies with backscatter and polarimetric information.

AB  - This is a 24 year old man with profound chronic hydrocephalus found to have a cauda equina abscess composed of Candida albicans. Prior literature reveals a paucity of central nervous system candidiasis. In these previously reported cases, there was evidence of local invasion of surrounding structures; however, this case is a sentinel report of a fungal abscess without evidence of local structural invasion. The patient's course was complicated by clinical and radiographic worsening to cauda equina syndrome, requiring emergent surgical decompression, despite appropriate antifungal treatment. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge of this rare entity and the need for close follow up with this patient population.

TI  - Assessing land use and land cover changes and agricultural farmland expansions in Gambella Region, Ethiopia, using Landsat 5 and Sentinel 2a multispectral data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The pace of change in land use and cover in Ethiopia depends on three main factors that cause pressure on agriculture land: resettlement programmes, population growth and increasing agricultural investments. Gambella is one of the regions of Ethiopia that attracts large-scale agricultural investments that extensively drive land use and cover changes in the region. The aim of this study is to examine the rate, extent and distribution of various land use and cover changes in Gambella Regional State, Ethiopia, from 1987 to 2017. The analysis is mainly based on Landsat 5 and Sentinel 2A satellite images and fieldwork. Two Landsat Thematic Mapper and a Sentinel 2A image were used for determining the maximum likelihood of land use/cover classification. The results show that farmland decreased by 26 km(2) from 1987 to 2000; however, during the last two decades, agricultural land area increased by 599 km(2), mainly at the cost of tropical grasslands and forests. We found that areas cultivated by smallholder farmers increased by 9.17% from 1987 to 2000. However, small-scale farm activities decreased by 7% from 2000 to 2017. Areas cultivated by large-scale state farms totalled 202 km(2) in 1987; but by 2000, this large-scale state farming had been completely abandoned by the state, and as a result, its land use has decreased to zero. Despite this, in 2017 large-scale farming increased to 746 km(2). In addition, Gambella National Park, which is the nation's largest national park and ecosystem, was also largely affected by Land Use and Land Cover changes. The conversion of savannah/tropical grasslands to agricultural farmland has caused varied and extensive environmental degradation to the park. The Land Use and Land Cover changes in the Gambella region are discussed on the basis of underlying socioeconomic factors.

TI  - Towards Feature Enhanced SAR Tomography: A Maximum-Likelihood Inspired Approach
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main objectives of the upcoming space missions, such as Tandem-L and BIOMASS, is to map, on a global scale, the forest structure by means of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR). On one hand, the number of baselines is constrained to the revisit time that avoids temporal decorrelation issues. On the other hand, enhanced resolution is desired, since the forest structure is characterized from the vegetation layers that compose it, reflected in the tomographic profiles as local maxima. The TomoSAR nonlinear ill-conditioned inverse problem is conventionally tackled within the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation framework. The DOA-inspired nonparametric techniques are well suited to cope with distributed targets; nonetheless, the achievable resolution highly depends on the span of the tomographic aperture. Alternatively, superresolved parametric approaches have the main drawback related to the white noise model assumption that guaranties the separation of the signal and noise subspaces. Overcoming the disadvantages of the aforementioned techniques, in this letter, we address a novel maximum-likelihood (ML) inspired adaptive robust iterative approach (MARIA) for feature-enhanced TomoSAR reconstruction. MARIA performs resolution enhancement, with suppression of artifacts and ambiguity levels reduction, to an initial estimate of the continuous power spectrum pattern. After convergence, an accurate location of the closely spaced phase centers is achieved, easing the characterization of the forest structure. The feature-enhancing capabilities of the proposed approach are corroborated using airborne F-SAR data of the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

TI  - Multisource data integration to investigate one century of evolution for the Agnone landslide (Molise, southern Italy)
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the most relevant geohazards worldwide, causing direct and indirect costs and fatalities. Italy is one of the countries most affected by mass movements, and the Molise region, southern Italy, is known to be susceptible to erosional processes and landslides. In January 2003, a landslide in the municipality of Agnone, in the Colle Lapponi-Piano Ovetta (CL-PO) territory, occurred causing substantial damage to both structures and civil infrastructure. To investigate the evolution of the landslide-affected catchment over approximately one century, different data were taken into account: (i) literature information at the beginning of the twentieth century; (ii) historical sets of aerial optical photographs to analyse the geomorphological evolution from 1945 to 2003; (iii) SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data from the ERS1/2, ENVISAT and COSMO-SkyMed satellites to monitor the displacement from 1992 to 2015; (iv) traditional measurements carried out through geological and geomorphological surveys, inclinometers and GPS campaigns to characterize the geological setting of the area; and (v) recent optical photographs of the catchment area to determine the enlargement of the landslide. Using the structure from motion technique, a 3D reconstruction of each set of historical aerial photographs was made to investigate the geomorphological evolution and to trace the boundary of the mass movements. As a result, the combination of multitemporal and multitechnique analysis of the evolution of the CL-PO landslide enabled an assessment of the landslide expansion, which resulted in a maximum length of up to approximately 1500m. A complete investigation of the past and present deformational sequences of the area was performed to potentially plan further mitigation and prevention strategies to avoid possible reactivations.

We analyzed the impact of content produced by the hacktivist Julian Assange [1] and his WikiLeaks organization in support of the Catalan independence process in the last quarter of 2017. A total of 1,708,087 unique results were retrieved from multiple streams of Internet data, of which 99.85% is from Twitter with a 93% viralization rate. The 50 most viral tweets were analyzed qualitatively to identify the underlying misinformation patterns. The research findings show 1) the extent to which such misinformation favors the internal logic, coherence and survival of the independence worldview, whose main value lies in its national utility and 2) misinformation does not use the coercion of lies or falsehoods typical of totalitarian propaganda, but the freedom of citizens to voluntarily engage.

TI  - Interannual to Multidecadal Forcing of Mesoscale Eddy Kinetic Energy in the Subtropical Southern Indian Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A region of elevated mesoscale eddy activity spans the subtropical southern Indian Ocean (SSIO) between Madagascar and Australia. The interannual and decadal changes in eddy activity in the SSIO eddy band, as represented by the variability of eddy kinetic energy (EKE), have implications for the large-scale circulation, mixed-layer budgets, and biological activity. An analysis of nearly two and a half decades of sea level anomaly (SLA) data from merged satellite altimetry shows that, in the southeast Indian Ocean east of 90 degrees E, the variations of EKE and SLA are positively correlated on interannual and decadal time scales. Moreover, EKE exhibits a multidecadal increasing linear trend that corresponds to an increasing trend of SLA in the region. The EKE-SLA covariability in the southeast Indian Ocean does not appear to be associated with a preference for anticyclonic over cyclonic eddy activity; rather, it can be attributed to the common remote forcing from the tropical Pacific associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In the west central SSIO, wind stress curl just south of the eddy band forces potential vorticity anomalies that affect conditions for instability in the west central SSIO; potential density and potential vorticity gradient anomalies also suggest a remote forcing mechanism originating in the region southwest of Australia. The interannual to multidecadal variability of EKE in the SSIO and its relationship with large-scale SLA has implications for mixed-layer dynamics and biogeochemistry and provides a basis for assessment of model simulations of eddy activity in the region.Plain Language Summary Eddiesrotating storm systems in the oceanthat are formed in the parts of the ocean between the tropics and poleward regions are very important for moving heat, salt, and other substances dissolved in the ocean between the tropics and the poles. An area in the southern Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Australia has particularly high levels of eddy activity, and the energy of the eddies changes substantially over the course of years and decades. To understand why these changes occur, satellite data were used that measure the height of the ocean surface and therefore tell us about the ocean circulation and its variability. This study found that levels of eddy activity near Australia are largely determined by the climate phenomena of La Nina and El Nino. In the central part of the southern Indian Ocean, closer to Madagascar, eddy energy levels are influenced by wind variations locally and ocean conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean. These factors that influence eddy activity in the southern Indian Ocean can help us make better predictions of eddy energy in the region; this will tell us more about how heat, salt, and nutrients are transported between the tropics and the waters near Antarctica.

In this work, we used the new dual-source model named Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration (SPARSE) based on the Two Sources Energy Balance (TSEB) model rationale which solves the surface energy balance equations for the soil and the canopy. SPARSE can be used (i) to retrieve soil and vegetation stress levels from known surface temperature and (ii) to predict transpiration, soil evaporation, and surface temperature for given stress levels. The main innovative feature of SPARSE is that it allows to bound each retrieved individual flux component (evaporation and transpiration) by its corresponding potential level deduced from running the model in prescribed potential conditions, i.e., a maximum limit if the surface water availability is not limiting. The main objective of the paper is to assess the SPARSE model predictions of water stress and evapotranspiration components for its two proposed versions (the "patch" and "layer" resistances network) over 20 in situ data sets encompassing distinct vegetation and climate. Over a large range of leaf area index values and for contrasting vegetation stress levels, SPARSE showed good retrieval performances of evapotranspiration and sensible heat fluxes. For cereals, the layer version provided better latent heat flux estimates than the patch version while both models showed similar performances for sparse crops and forest ecosystems. The bounded layer version of SPARSE provided the best estimates of latent heat flux over different sites and climates. Broad tendencies of observed and retrieved stress intensities were well reproduced with a reasonable difference obtained for most of the points located within a confidence interval of 0.2. The synchronous dynamics of observed and retrieved estimates underlined that the SPARSE retrieved water stress estimates from Thermal Infra-Red data were relevant tools for stress detection.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Associating a radar scatterer to a physical object is crucial for the correct interpretation of interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements. Yet, especially for medium-resolution imagery, this is notoriously difficult and dependent on the accurate 3-D positioning of the scatterers. Here, we investigate the 3-D positioning capabilities of ENVISAT medium-resolution data. We find that the data are perturbed by range-and-epoch-dependent timing errors and calibration offsets. Calibration offsets are estimated to be about 1.58 m in azimuth and 2.84 m in range and should be added to ASAR products to improve geometric calibration. The timing errors involve a bistatic offset, atmospheric path delay, solid earth tides, and local oscillator drift. This way, we achieve an unbiased positioning capability in 2-D, while in 3-D, a scatterer was located at a distance of 28 cm from the true location. 3-D precision is now expressed as an error ellipsoid in local coordinates. Using the Bhattacharyya metric, we associate radar scatterers to real-world objects. Interpreting deformation of individual infrastructure is shown to be feasible for this type of medium-resolution data.

TI  - Estimating Calibration Variability in Evapotranspiration Derived from a Satellite-Based Energy Balance Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Computing evapotranspiration (ET) with satellite-based energy balance models such as METRIC (Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration) requires internal calibration of sensible heat flux using anchor pixels (hot and cold pixels). Despite the development of automated anchor pixel selection methods that classify a pool of candidate pixels using the amount of vegetation (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and surface temperature (T-s), final pixel selection still relies heavily on operator experience. Yet, differences in final ET estimates resulting from subjectivity in selecting the final hot and cold pixel pair (from within the candidate pixel pool) have not yet been investigated. This is likely because surface properties of these candidate pixels, as quantified by NDVI and surface temperature, are generally assumed to have low variability that can be attributed to random noise. In this study, we test the assumption of low variability by first applying an automated calibration pixel selection process to 42 nearly cloud-free Landsat images of the San Joaquin area in California taken between 2013 and 2015. We then compute T-s (vertical near-surface temperature differences) vs. T-s relationships at all pixels that could potentially be used for model calibration in order to explore ET variance between the results from multiple calibration schemes where NDVI and T-s variability is intrinsically negligible. Our results show significant variability in ET (ranging from 5% to 20%) and a high-and statistically consistent-variability in dT values, indicating that there are additional surface properties affecting the calibration process not captured when using only NDVI and T-s. Our findings further highlight the potential for calibration improvements by showing that the dT vs. T-s calibration relationship between the cold anchor pixel (with lowest dT) and the hot anchor pixel (with highest dT) consistently provides the best daily ET estimates. This approach of quantifying ET variability based on candidate pixel selection and the accompanying results illustrate an approach to quantify the biases inadvertently introduced by user subjectivity and can be used to inform improvements on model usability and performance.

TI  - Aerosol Microphysical Particle Parameter Inversion and Error Analysis Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of Raman and high-spectral lidars enables measurements of a stratospheric aerosol extinction profile independent of backscatter, and a multi-wavelength (MW) lidar can obtain additional information that can aid in retrieving the microphysical characteristics of the sampled aerosol. The inversion method for retrieving aerosol particle size distributions and microphysical particle parameters from MW lidar data was studied. An inversion algorithm for retrieving aerosol particle size distributions based on the regularization method was established. Based on the inversion of regularization, the inversion method was optimized by choosing the base function closest to the aerosol distribution. The logarithmic normal distribution function was selected over the triangle function as the base function for the inversion. The averaging procedure was carried out for three main types of aerosol. The 1% averaging result near the minimum of the discrepancy gave the best estimate of the particle parameters. The accuracy and stabilization of the optimized algorithm for microphysical parameters were tested by scores of aerosol size distributions. The systematic effects and random errors impacting the inversion were also considered, and the algorithm was tested by the data, showing 10% systematic error and 15% random error. At the same time, the reliability of the proposed algorithm was also verified by using the aerosol particle size distribution data of the aircraft. The inversion results showed that the algorithm was reliable in retrieving the aerosol particle size distributions at vertical heights using lidar data.

TI  - In situ and satellite long-term monitoring of the Latronico landslide, Italy: displacement evolution, damage to buildings, and effectiveness of remedial works
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The slow and continuous movements of a deep and complex active landslide system cause severe damage to Latronico, a village of the Italian southern Apennines. In order to obtain a deeper insight in the phenomenon, its kinematic features have been investigated by means of both ground based displacement measurements (by mobile and fixed-in-place inclinometers) and by the processing of images acquired by synthetic aperture radar sensors (ERS, Envisat, COSMO-SkyMed satellites). The results of the analyses show that the landslide system includes different phenomena at different scales and of different age, from old and huge landslides (early stage of last post-glacial) to young shallower reactivations. Secondary creep and rain-induced displacements coexist, occurring at different depths. The reconstruction of the kinematic history of the inhabited area-subsoil system shows that the yearly average displacement rates have been almost constant over the last 25 years (several cm/year). The depth of the slip surfaces and the volumes of the instable soils explain why the numerous and expensive remedial measures and stabilization interventions have had very limited effects, if any, on the displacement rate field.

TI  - Monitoring of <i>Enteromorpha prolifera</i> in the Yellow Sea with MODIS image based on linear mixing model and NDVI threshold
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to eutrophication, E. prolifera disasters have frequently occurred in China's Yellow Sea since 2007, which have become the most serious ecological disaster in the Yellow Sea. Satellite remote sensing has the advantages of large. scale monitoring and instantaneous monitoring, and is one of the most important monitoring means of E. prolifera disaster. Moderate. resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) image is the main data source of E. prolifera operational monitoring because of its large size, high temporal resolution and free distribution. There are many errors in E. prolifera area derived from NDVI threshold, because of mixed pixels in the coarse resolution (250 m) MODIS images. In order to solve this problem, we extracted the E. prolifera area from the MODIS image with the spatial resolution of 250 m by combining the linear spectral mixture decomposition method and NDVI threshold method. A large area and its three inner subareas were selected for the accuracy evaluation based on the data of E. prolifera extracted from quasi. synchronous ZY-3 satellite with 5.8 m spatial resolution. We found that the error of E. prolifera area, extracted from the linear mixed model with a NDVI threshold of 0.04, was the smallest, and the errors of the large area and its three subareas were 7.86%, 14.59%, -7.65% and -0.15% respectively. Hence, we provide a method that can effectively eliminate interference from the E. prolifera mixed pixel and non E. prolifera pixel, and greatly improve the inversion precision which is stable in different regions. This method can provide support for the management decision and evaluation of E. prolifera ecological disaster.

TI  - Validation of the CHIRPS satellite rainfall estimates over eastern Africa
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long and temporally consistent rainfall time series are essential in climate analyses and applications. Rainfall data from station observations are inadequate over many parts of the world due to sparse or non-existent observation networks, or limited reporting of gauge observations. As a result, satellite rainfall estimates have been used as an alternative or as a supplement to station observations. However, many satellite-based rainfall products with long time series suffer from coarse spatial and temporal resolutions and inhomogeneities caused by variations in satellite inputs. There are some satellite rainfall products with reasonably consistent time series, but they are often limited to specific geographic areas. The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP) and CHIRP combined with station observations (CHIRPS) are recently produced satellite-based rainfall products with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions and quasi-global coverage. In this study, CHIRP and CHIRPS were evaluated over East Africa at daily, dekadal (10-day) and monthly time-scales. The evaluation was done by comparing the satellite products with rain-gauge data from about 1,200 stations. The CHIRP and CHIRPS products were also compared with two similar operational satellite rainfall products: the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) and the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data (TAMSAT). The results show that both CHIRP and CHIRPS products are significantly better than ARC2 with higher skill and low or no bias. These products were also found to be slightly better than the latest version of the TAMSAT product at dekadal and monthly time-scales, while TAMSAT performed better at the daily time-scale. The performance of the different satellite products exhibits high spatial variability with weak performances over coastal and mountainous regions.

TI  - Fast Cloud Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about clouds is important for observing and predicting weather and climate as well as for generating and distributing solar power. Most existing approaches extract cloud information from satellite data by classifying individual pixels instead of using closely integrated spatial information, ignoring the fact that clouds are highly dynamic, spatially continuous entities. This paper proposes a novel cloud classification method based on deep learning. Relying on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image segmentation, the presented Cloud Segmentation CNN (CS-CNN), classifies all pixels of a scene simultaneously rather than individually. We show that CS-CNN can successfully process multispectral satellite data to classify continuous phenomena such as highly dynamic clouds. The proposed approach produces excellent results on Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite data in terms of quality, robustness, and runtime compared to other machine learning methods such as random forests. In particular, comparing CS-CNN with the CLAAS-2 cloud mask derived from MSG data shows high accuracy (0.94) and Heidke Skill Score (0.90) values. In contrast to a random forest, CS-CNN produces robust results and is insensitive to challenges created by coast lines and bright (sand) surface areas. Using GPU acceleration, CS-CNN requires only 25 ms of computation time for classification of images of Europe with 508 x 508 pixels.

AB  - Objective To use data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) to evaluate the prevalence of antidepressant and antipsychotic prescriptions among patients with no previous depression or psychosis diagnoses, and to identify the factors associated with the use of these drugs in this population.Design Retrospective cohort study using data derived from CPCSSN.Setting Primary care practices associated with CPCSSN.Participants Patients who were born before 1949; who were associated with a CPCSSN primary care practitioner between October 1,2007, and September 30, 2013; and whose electronic medical records contained data from at least 6 months before and 12 months after the date of dementia diagnosis.Main outcome measures Prescription for an antidepressant or antipsychotic medication in the absence of a depression or psychosis diagnosis. Multivariable models were fitted to determine estimated odds ratios (ORs) and were adjusted for age and sex.Results Of the 3252 patients without a depression diagnosis, 8.5% received a new prescription for an antidepressant in the 12 months following their diagnosis of dementia. Prescribing was reduced in association with older age (OR of 0.86 per 5-year age increase, P=.001) and male sex (OR=0.77, P=.056), and prescribing increased in association with prescription of cholinesterase inhibitor medications (OR=1.57, P=.003). Of the 4262 patients without a diagnosis of psychosis, 6.1% received a new prescription for an antipsychotic in the 12 months following their diagnosis of dementia. Higher rates of antipsychotic prescriptions were reported in men (OR=1.31, P=.046), those receiving a prescription for steroids (OR=1.90, P=.037), and those diagnosed with Parkinson disease (OR 1.58, P=.051).Conclusion A substantial number of patients with dementia are being prescribed antidepressant or antipsychotic medications by their primary care practitioners without evidence of depression or psychosis in their electronic medical records.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Yield Forecasting for Sugarcane (<i>Saccharum officinarum</i> L.) Crop in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early yield assessment at local, regional and national scales is a major requirement for various users such as agriculture planners, policy makers, crop insurance companies and researchers. This current study explored a remote sensing-based approach of predicting sugarcane yield, at district level, using Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), under the FASAL programme of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare. 13-years' historical database (2003-2015) of NDVI was used to derive the VCI. NDVI products (MOD-13A2) of MODIS instrument on board Terra satellite at 16-day interval from first fortnight of June to second fortnight of October (peak growing period) were used to calculate the VCI. Stepwise regression technique was used to develop empirical models between VCI and historical yield of sugarcane over 52 major sugarcane-growing districts in five states of India. For all the districts, the empirical models were found to be statistically significant. A large number of statistical parameters were computed to evaluate the performance of VCI-based models in predicting district-level sugarcane yield. Though there was variation in model performance in different states, overall, the study showed the usefulness of VCI, which can be used as an input for operational sugarcane yield forecasting.

TI  - THE CURRENT SITUATION AND RECENT CHANGES IN VEGETATION INDICES (VIS) IN FORESTED CITIES WITH DRY CLIMATES: THE CASE OF THE MENDOZA METROPOLITAN AREA, ARGENTINA
T2  - URBANO
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities in drylands have adapted to the scarcity of resources and the anthropic-cultural complexity of the habitat. Urban vegetation is a key element for resilience and the mitigation of climate changes when faced with the complex energy-environmental issues related to urban-building morphologies. The objective of this research is to study the current conditions and recent changes in urban vegetation in the 6 municipalities of the Mendoza Metropolitan Area (MMA) by analyzing the temporal and spatial variability of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). Methodologically, the indices were determined using geographic information systems (GIS) from the analysis of satellite images from Landsat 5 (1986-2011) and Landsat 8 (2013-2017), and a statistical analysis was carried out to estimate trends and correlations. The results obtained indicate a generally decreasing slope in the mean NDVI and SAVI values during the 1986-2011 period. The municipalities of Maipu and Guaymallen show the greatest decreasing slopes, and should be given priority for intervention in decision-making to resolve this trend, followed by Lujan de Cuyo and Las Heras. Capital is the municipality with the most gradual decreasing slope. During the 2013-2017 period, very high positive correlations were found between municipalities. The municipality of Godoy Cruz is the priority for intervention with the increasing vegetation indices strategy, considering the results by municipality and by urban block for the entirety of the years studied. Lastly, the public green spaces of the MMA that are the priority for intervention are located in Las Heras for the increasing vegetation indices and increasing the surface area of public green spaces strategies.

TI  - Interdisciplinary Approach Implementation In Teaching English as a Foreign Language
T2  - MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the significant achievements of science in the interdisciplinary approach implementation in students' education, the results of theoretical and empirical research are not widely used in a secondary school class. In particular, it concerns teaching English. The demands placed on individuals today are far beyond the mere acquisition of a language. Students are expected to have a wide range of knowledge and skills as well as personal qualities that equip them to compete in the modern job market. English must be not so much a separate subject as a means of obtaining information from various spheres of human activity. Holistic learning nurtures students' disposition to move beyond learning multiple isolated facts and seek understanding of consequence, conduct critical analysis of complex issues, and synthesize perspectives in quality interdisciplinary work.The analysis of teachers' experience shows that in most cases they have been teaching language for the sake of language alone; moreover they don't establish any significant links with other school subjects. The reference to knowledge from other sciences is fragmentary and unmotivated.The article describes the results of an experiential learning of secondary school students. The objective was to improve their English written-language skills by conducting specially designed interdisciplinary classes.The rationale for introducing the interdisciplinary approach into the wide practice of teaching English as a foreign language is presented on the basis of the obtained results.

AB  - Sustainable management and exploitation policies as well as suitable conservation and mitigation strategies are mandatory to preserve cultural heritage and to reduce threats, weathering phenomena, and human actions that may produce significant deterioration and alteration of cultural heritage and its environment. In this context, remote sensing technologies can offer useful data to timely update information and documentation and set up reliable tools for systematic monitoring of cultural properties. In this study, multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data from Corona, Landsat, Spot, Quickbird, and Sentinel-2A have been exploited along with spatial analysis to investigate the area of the Theban temples at west Luxor (Egypt), severely threatened by uncontrolled urban sprawl. The results from our analyses showed that the urban expansion continuously occurred during the whole investigated period causing an increasing in urban areas around (1) 1.316km(2) from 1967 to 1984, (2) 1.705km(2) from 1984 to 2000, (3) 0.978km(2) from 2000 to 2003, (4) 2.314km(2) from 2003 to 2011, and (5) 1.377km(2) from 2011 to 2017. The random urban expansion caused bad sewage networks and high groundwater depth which in turn affected the archaeological areas directly (as evident on a landscape view) and indirectly by causing changes (growing) in the level of ground water depth and increasing and accelerating weathering phenomena. The quantification and mapping of urban sprawl enabled us not only to quantify and spatially characterize urban sprawl but also to create a model to mitigate the impact and provide some operational recommendations to protect the archaeological site. Outcomes from our analysis pointed out that today the tremendous availability of advanced remote sensing data has opened new prospectives unthinkable several years ago.

TI  - What Rainfall Does Not Tell Us-Enhancing Financial Instruments with Satellite-Derived Soil Moisture and Evaporative Stress
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced parametric financial instruments, like weather index insurance (WII) and risk contingency credit (RCC), support disaster-risk management and reduction in the world's most disaster-prone regions. Simultaneously, satellite data that are capable of cross-checking rainfall estimates, the standard dataset to develop such financial safety nets, are gaining importance as complementary sources of information. This study concentrates on the analysis of satellite-derived multi-sensor soil moisture (ESA CCI, Version v04.2), the evapotranspiration-based Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), and CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) rainfall estimates in nine East African countries. Based on spatial correlation analysis, we found matching spatial/temporal patterns between all three datasets, with the highest correlation coefficient occurring between October and March. In large parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, we observed a lower (partly negative) correlation coefficient between June and August, which was likely caused by issues related to cloud cover and the volume scattering of microwaves in sandy, hot soils. Based on simple linear and logit regression analysis with annual, national maize yield estimates as the dependent variable, we found that, depending on the chosen period (averages per year, growing or harvesting months), there was added value (higher R-squared) if two or all three variables were combined. The ESI and soil moisture have the potential to close sensitive knowledge gaps between atmospheric moisture supply and the response of the land surface in operational parametric insurance projects. For the development and calibration of WII and RCC, this means that better proxies for historical and potential future drought impact can strengthen drought narratives, resulting in a better match between calculated payouts/credit repayment levels and the actual needs of smallholder farmers.

TI  - Risk Factors for Regional and Systemic Metastases in Patients with Sentinel Lymph Node-negative Melanoma
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node status is a strong prognostic factor in melanoma. However, up to 21% of sentinel lymph node-negative patients develop locoregional and distant metastases during follow-up. Aim: To analyze risk factors for locoregional and distant metastasis in patients with sentinel lymph node-negative melanoma. Patients and Methods: A total of 545 patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) between 2005 and 2013 at our hospital. Data for 449 patients with a negative SNB were analyzed regarding risk factors and development of metastases. Followup was performed until 2016. Results: A total of 72 SNB-negative patients developed metastases, including 25 (34.7%) distant and 47 (63.3%) locoregional metastases. Locoregional metastases occurred earlier compared to distant metastases (with a mean of 24.2 and 23.5 months for regional lymph node and cutaneous metastases, respectively, vs. 31.4 months for distant metastases). Patients with metastases despite negative SNB had a greater tumor thickness (p=0.001), a higher rate of nodular melanoma (p=0.001), ulceration (p<0.001), and were older (p=0.05) compared to SNB-negative patients without subsequent metastases. Out of SNB-negative patients, 16% developed metastases. Conclusion: Close clinical followup including sonography of the draining lymph node region is mandatory for melanoma patients regardless of SNB status.

TI  - Landscape Drivers and Social Dynamics Shaping Microbial Contamination Risk in Three Maya Communities in Southern Belize, Central America
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Land transformation can have cascading effects on hydrology, water quality, and human users of water resources, with serious implications for human health. An interdisciplinary analysis is presented, whereby remote-sensing data of changing land use and cover are related to surface hydrology and microbial contamination in domestic use areas of three indigenous Maya communities in Belize, Central America. We asked whether a departure from traditional land-use patterns toward intensified use led to consequences for hydrology and microbial contamination of drinking water, and investigated how social factors in the three study communities may act to ameliorate human health risks associated with water contamination. We showed that a departure from traditional land use to more intensive cultivation and grazing led to significantly increased surface water runoff, and intensified microbial contamination of surface water sources sometimes used for drinking. Results further suggested that groundwater contamination was widespread regardless of land cover, due to the widespread presence of pit latrines, pigs, and cows on the landscape, and that human users were consistently subject to health risks from potential pathogens as a result. Given that both surface and groundwater resources were found to be contaminated, it is important that water distribution systems (piped water from tanks; shallow and deep wells) be monitored for Escherichia coli and treated when necessary to reduce or eliminate contaminants and protect public health. Results of interviews suggested that strengthened capacity within the communities to monitor and treat centralized drinking water sources and increase water treatment at the point of use could lead to reduced risk to water consumers.

TI  - Assessing environmental impacts and change in Myanmar's mangrove ecosystem service value due to deforestation (2000-2014)
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Myanmar is one of the mangrove-richest countries in the world, providing valuable ecosystem services to people. However, due to deforestation driven primarily by agricultural expansion, Myanmar's mangrove forest cover has declined dramatically over the past few decades, while what remains is still under pressure. To support management planning, accurate quantification of mangrove forest cover changes on a national scale is needed. In this study, we quantified Myanmar's mangrove forest cover changes between 2000 and 2014 using remotely sensed data, examined the environmental impacts of such changes, and estimated the changes in the economic values of mangrove ecosystem services in the country. Results indicate that Myanmar had a net mangrove loss of 191,122 ha over the study period. Since 2000, Myanmar has been losing mangrove forest cover at an alarming rate of 14,619 ha/year (2.2%/year). The loss was predominant in Rakhine and Ayeyarwady. The observed mangrove forest cover loss has resulted in decreased evapotranspiration, carbon stock, and tree cover percentage. Due to deforestation, Myanmar also suffered a net loss of 2,397 million US$/year in its mangrove ecosystem service value (i.e. 28.7% decrease from 2000), in which maintenance of fisheries nursery populations and habitat and coastal protection were among those services that were greatly affected. We suggest that intensive reforestation and mangrove protection programs be implemented immediately. Agroforestry and community forestry programs are encouraged in areas that are under immense pressure from paddy field expansion, fuelwood extraction, charcoal production, and fish and shrimp farming activities. Potential alternative sustainable solutions should include intensive government-led private forest plantations or community-owned forest plantations to be developed with care by local farmers, nongovernmental organizations, and business owners.

TI  - Enhancing digital elevation models for hydraulic modelling using flood frequency detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium-resolution DEMs have limited applicability to flood mapping in large river systems within data sparse regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. We present a novel approach for the enhancement of the SRTM (30 m) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in The Gambia, West Africa: A time-series analysis of flood frequency and land cover was used to delineate differences in the vertical limits between morphological units within an alluvial floodplain. Combined with supplementary river stage data and vegetation removal techniques, these methods were used to improve the estimation of bare-earth terrain in flood modelling applications for a region with no access to high-resolution alternatives. The results demonstrate an improvement in floodplain topography for the River Gambia. The technique allows the reestablishment of small-scale complex morphology, instrumental in the routing of floodwater within a noise-filled DEM. The technique will be beneficial to flood-risk modelling applications within data sparse regions.

TI  - Maintaining carbon stocks in extractive reserves in Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extractive reserves in the Amazon Forest maintain carbon stocks out of the atmosphere, thereby avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions that provoke global warming. This and other environmental services, such as recycling water and maintaining biodiversity, provide major reasons for creating these reserves and for according them priority in government programs. The importance of reducing carbon emissions from deforestation has been the principal motivation for international funding, which has been key to creating and supporting extractive reserves, notably in the cases of Germany through the PPG7 program and Norway through the Amazon Fund. Estimating the amount of carbon in these reserves and the losses that have occurred from deforestation is essential as an input to making decisions that affect current and potential future extractive reserves. By 2014, there were 47 federal extractive reserves in Brazil's Legal Amazonia region, of which 45 were in the Amazonian Tropical Forest Biome and 26 extractive reserves belonged to states, all of which were in the Amazonia Biome. This study provides data for each of the 73 extractive reserves in Legal Amazonia, based on biomass information by forest type calculated from RadamBrasil survey data, and deforestation from PRODES monitoring by LANDSAT or equivalent satellites (30-m resolution). The stocks represent carbon in the "pre-modern" biomass, that is, the biomass present in approximately 1970, or before substantial deforestation or logging activity in the region. The carbon losses reflect only deforestation, not degradation of forest by logging and/or fire. The total area of extractive reserves in Legal Amazonia amounted to 126,709 km2, of which 4301 km2 (3.4%) had been cleared by 2014. Those extractive reserves had a remaining carbon stock in forest vegetation (above and below-ground) of 2.1 billion tons. The carbon lost to deforestation totaled 74.9 million tons. Avoiding further carbon loss to both deforestation and degradation needs to be a high priority for the extractivists, as it is the value of the forest's environmental services that has the greatest potential for providing a means of support that is increasing in value and is inherently sustainable.

TI  - Application of damage theory to structures made from high-strength steels Prediction of component strength and ductility
T2  - STEEL CONSTRUCTION-DESIGN AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a general question as to whether the established rules for predicting ultimate resistance under global tension can also be applied to structures made from HSS, i.e. up to f(y) = 960 MPa. Apart from the welding issue, for the base material, this question refers to several items, e.g. the plastic flow curve, the yield stress level, the yield ratio, the upper-shelf ductility and strainability and the lower-shelf toughness. It reveals that predicting the ductile fracture of steel components can only be an approximation, and neither allows for a deeper understanding of the real ductile crack development up to ultimate load nor leads to a realistic extrapolation if high-strength steels are used. The research work presented in this paper therefore suggests an innovative extension of the FEM analysis by implementing appropriate GTN ductile damage approaches. After a short introduction to the principles of this methodology, possibilities for its use in structural steel research and design as well as further insights into the structural behaviour of steel components, especially HSS up to S960, are presented - insights that are not possible by traditional testing or simulation.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite rainfall estimates over the Lake Tana basin at the source region of the Blue Nile River
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) have become alternative sources of rainfall data for several applications. However, the accuracy of the SREs is likely to vary from region to region and must be evaluated on a local basis. This study evaluated the accuracy of three SREs for the Lake Tana basin in northwestern Ethiopia. This basin is characterized by complex topography comprising both lowlands and highlands. The three SREs were the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT), the Climate Hazard Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), and the Africa Rainfall Climatology (ARC). The SREs were compared with gauge measurements in lowland and highland regions during the period 1995-2010 on a point-to-pixel basis at daily, dekadal (10 days), monthly, and seasonal periodicities. The results show that the three SREs underestimated rainy events, but TAMSAT captured rainfall occurrence relatively well in both regions. ARC better estimated light rain rates (1-5 mm d(-1)) than did TAMSAT and CHIRPS; however, all the SREs markedly underestimated moderate and heavier rain rates (>= 10 mm d(-1)). TAMSAT and CHIRPS estimated the amount of rainfall reasonably well (high efficiency, low random errors, and bias < 10%) at daily, dekadal, and monthly time scales, whereas ARC did not perform satisfactorily (high random errors, low efficiency, and bias > 20%) at any time scale. On a seasonal scale, CHIRPS estimated the secondary rainy season (March-May) rainfall better than did ARC and TAMSAT, whereas TAMSAT outperformed both CHIRPS and ARC during the primary rainy season (June-September). Overall, the rainfall detection capabilities and rainfall amount estimates of the SREs were better over the lowlands, and the cumulative rainfall estimates tended to improve with increasing integration time (i.e., from daily to seasonal totals).

TI  - Temporal and spatial variation of particulate matter and its correlation with other criteria of air pollutants in Lanzhou, China, in spring-summer periods
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study on major atmospheric pollutants is based on data received from 5 ground-based air-quality monitoring stations and satellite sounding which provides for the use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to study aerosol optical depth on the territory of the city of Lanzhou, Gansu Province. Data were received in the spring-summer period of 2014-2017. The present paper is intended to analyze the mass concentrations and spatial-temporal variation of PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2 and O-3 in the above city. When comparing and averaging the daily, monthly, and annual pollutants concentrations, it was revealed that the average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations exceeded the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) and were 42.37 and 112.67 mu g/m(3), respectively. Of all studied days, 62.5% showed high PM2.5 concentration, and 78.2%-high PM10 concentration. PM2.5 and PM10 demonstrated a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.81) with PM2.5 being about 37% of PM10. This indicates that decrease of PM10 emissions is very critical for reducing pollution with PM and thus for improving the air quality in China. The linear correlation analysis reveals unstable correlation between PM and gaseous pollutants, average correlation between PM and SO2 (PM2.5/SO2 r = 0.439; PM10/SO2 r = 0.328), negative correlation between PM, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3 (PM2.5/O-3 r = -0.335, PM10/O-3 r = -0.213, SO2/O-3 r = -0.527, NO2/O-3 r = -0.272, CO/O-3 r = -0.558), and strong correlation between other gaseous pollutants (NO2/CO r = 0.502, NO2/SO2 r = 0.534, SO2/CO r = 0.706).

TI  - Detecting ebb-tidal delta migration using Landsat imagery
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ebb-tidal deltas are important coastal sedimentary features that influence broad-scale coastal system behaviour. However, sediment transport within and around tidal deltas is complex, making it very difficult to understand the role they play within coastal sedimentary systems. Here we present details of a new method to examine ebb tidal delta processes using long records of cloud-masked Landsat 7 and 8 satellite imagery. Our approach is similar to that adopted in nearshore process studies, in which time-averaged collections of digital photographs from terrestrial cameras are used to differentiate between broken and unbroken water based on image tone. Using the Google Earth Engine we are able to rapidly segment 100s of Landsat images into broken and unbroken water classes based on a threshold value. By then calculating the frequency of wave breaking at the Manukau ebb-tidal delta (METD) near Auckland, New Zealand, we can repeatedly map geomorphic features such as channels, linear bar formation, channel margin linear bars, swash bars, and the terminal lobe that marks the outer limit of wave breaking. Using a similar to 17-year long record of observations we observe > 2 km of northward alongshore channel migration and the potential emergence of a new channel to the south. The approach is simple, quick and with the growing constellations of earth observation satellites, has easy application to a range of other coastal systems.

TI  - Reservoir Sedimentation Assessment Through Remote Sensing and Hydrological Modelling
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir sedimentation is the gradual accumulation of incoming sediments from upstream catchment leading to the reduction in useful storage capacity of the reservoir. Quantifying the reservoir sedimentation rate is essential for better water resources management. Conventional techniques such as hydrographic survey have limitations including time-consuming, cumbersome and costly. On the contrary, the availability of high resolution (both spatial and temporal) in public domain overcomes all these constraints. This study assessed Jayakwadi reservoir sedimentation using Landsat 8 OLI satellite data combined with ancillary data. Multi-date remotely sensed data were used to produce the water spread area of the reservoir, which was applied to compute the sedimentation rate. The revised live storage capacity of the reservoir between maximum and minimum levels observed under the period of analysis (2015-2017) was assessed utilizing the trapezoidal formula. The revised live storage capacity is assessed as 1942.258 against the designed capacity of 2170.935Mm(3) at full reservoir level. The total loss of reservoir capacity due to the sediment deposition during the period of 41years (1975-2017) was estimated as 228.677Mm(3) (10.53%) which provided the average sedimentation rate of 5.58Mm(3)year(1). As this technique also provides the capacity of the reservoir at the different elevation on the date of the satellite pass, the revised elevation-capacity curve was also developed. The sedimentation analysis usually provides the volume of sediment deposited and rate of the deposition. However, the interest of the reservoir authorities and water resources planner's lies in sub-watershed-wise sediment yield, and the critical sub-watersheds upstream reservoir requires conservation, etc. Therefore, in the present study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used for the estimation of sediment yield of the reservoir. The average annual sediment yield obtained from the SWAT model using 36years of data (1979-2014) was 13.144Mm(3)year(-1) with the density of the soil (loamy and clay) of 1.44tonm(-3). The findings revealed that the rate of sedimentation obtained from the remote sensing-based methods is in agreement with the results of the hydrographic survey.

TI  - Cutaneous melanoma. Lymph node staging based on current evidence
T2  - GACETA MEDICA DE MEXICO
M3  - Article
AB  - Most patients with cutaneous melanoma present with clinical stage 1 at diagnosis, i.e., with no evidence of lymph node or systemic metastases. However, since this is a type of neoplasm with high affinity to lymphatic tissue, between 30 and 60% of patients are estimated to have occult metastases on the lymph nodes of the area that drains the primary tumor site at the moment of diagnosis. This possibility depends on several histologic factors, especially thickness of the neoplasm. Historically, in order to reduce the rate of regional recurrence, lymphadenectomy was an essential part of cutaneous melanoma treatment, which has associated morbidity. In the decade of 1990, Morton et al. reported that lymph is initially received by a single lymph node in the lymphatic basin and that its histological status predicts the status of the others and that, therefore, in patients with sentinel lymph node free of metastases lymphadenectomy is not necessary, which reduces morbidity. In the present manuscript, indications, contraindications and requirements for sentinel lymph node identification are described, as well as its current value in cutaneous melanoma diagnostic and therapeutic process.

TI  - Fuel load mapping in the Brazilian Cerrado in support of integrated fire management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is considered to be the most species-rich savannah region in the world, covering 2 million km(2). Uncontrolled late season fires promote deforestation, produce greenhouse gases (similar to 25% of Brazil's land-use related CO2 emissions between 2003 and 2005) and are a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. Governmental institutions therefore implemented early dry season (EDS) prescribed burnings as part of integrated fire management (IFM) in protected areas of the Cerrado, with the aim to reduce the area and severity of late dry season (LDS) fires. The planning and implementation of EDS prescribed burning is supported by satellite-based geo-information on fuel conditions, derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel -2 data. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering algorithm was used to analyse the data, and the relationship between the resulting matched fractions (dry vegetation, green vegetation and soil) and in situ surface fuel samples was assessed. The linear regression of in situ data versus matched filter scores (MF scores) of dry vegetation showed an r(2) of 0.81 (RMSE = 0.15) and in situ data versus MF scores of soil showed an r(2) of 0.65 (RMSE = 0.38). To predict quantitative fuel load, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with MF scores of NPV and soil as predictors (adjusted r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.001; standard error = 0.075). The fuel load maps were additionally evaluated by fire managers while planning EDS prescribed burning campaigns. The fuel load mapping approach has proven to be an effective tool for integrated fire management by improving the planning and implementation of prescribed burning, promoting pyrodiversity, prioritising fire suppression and evaluating fire management efforts to meet overall conservations goals. National and state level authorities have successfully institutionalized the approach and it was incorporated into IFM policies in Brazil.

TI  - The Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS), mapping far red fluorescence from aircraft
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS) is an airborne high resolution imaging spectrometer built at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for evaluating solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). OCO-2 is a NASA mission designed to measure atmospheric CO2 but one of the novel data products is SIF, retrieved using reductions in the optical depth of Fraunhofer lines in OCO-2's O-2 Aband, covering 757-775 nm at 0.042 nm spectral resolution. CFIS was specifically designed to retrieve SIF within the wavelength range of OCO-2, but extends further down to 737 nm, nearly maintaining the high spectral resolution of the OCO-2 instrument (0.07 vs. 0.042 nm). Here, we provide an overview of the instrument calibration and performance as well as the retrieval strategy based on non-linear weighted least-squares. To illustrate the retrieval performance using actual flight data, we focus on data acquired over agricultural fields in Mead, Nebraska from an unpressurized Twin Otter (DHC-6) aircraft at a flight altitude of 3000 m above ground level (AGL). Spectral residuals are consistent with expected detector noise, which enables us to compute realistic 1-alpha precision errors of 0.5-0.7 W/m(2)/sr/mu m for typical SIF retrievals, which can be reduced to < 0.2 W/m(2)/sr/mu m when individual data is gridded at 30 m spatial resolution. The 30 m resolution also enabled direct comparison with the Crop Data Layer from the National Agricultural Statistics Service as well as Landsat imagery (NDVI, EVI, T-sk(in)), taken just a day prior to the CFIS overflights. Results show consistently higher vegetation indices and SIF values over soy fields compared to corn, likely due to the respective phenological stage, which might already have affected chlorophyll content and canopy structure (August 15, 2016). While this work is intended to highlight the technical capabilities and performance of CFIS, the comparisons against Landsat and crop types provide insights into how CFIS can be used to study mechanisms related to photosynthesis at fine spatial scales, with the fidelity needed to obtain un-biased SIF retrievals void of atmospheric correction.

TI  - Treatment of cutaneous malignantmelanoma in the head and neck region. An update
T2  - HNO
M3  - Article
AB  - Major progress has been made in the treatment of malignant melanoma during recent years. On the one hand, reliable evidence-based recommendations regarding surgical resection as well as lymph node management have been established on the basis of results from randomized multicenter studies. On the other hand, the advent of targeted therapies has led to spectacular improvements in the treatment of metastasized melanomas. Knowledge concerning treatment algorithms and updates thereof is also essential for maxillofacial surgeons. The German S3 guideline on diagnosis and treatment of melanoma was published in 2013 and revised in 2016 and 2018. This article informs readers about these developments and addresses the items relevant for treatment of head and neck melanomas in particular.

TI  - Blind Signal Separation Methods for InSAR: The Potential to Automatically Detect and Monitor Signals of Volcanic Deformation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There are some 1,500 volcanoes with the potential to erupt, but most are not instrumentally monitored. However, routine acquisition by the Sentinel-1 satellites now fulfils the requirements needed for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to progress from a retrospective analysis tool to one used for near-real-time monitoring globally. However, global monitoring produces vast quantities of data, and consequently, an automatic detection algorithm is therefore required that is able to identify signs of new deformation, or changes in rate, in a time series of interferograms. On the basis that much of the signal contained in a time series of interferograms can be considered as a linear mixture of several latent sources, we explore the use of blind source separation methods to address this issue. We consider principal component analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) which have previously been applied to InSAR data and nonnegative matrix factorization which has not. Our systematic analysis of the three methods shows ICA to be best suited for most applications with InSAR data. However, care must be taken in the dimension reduction step of ICA not to remove important smaller magnitude signals. We apply ICA to the 2015 Wolf Volcano eruption (Galapagos Archipelago, Ecuador) and automatically isolate three signals, which are broadly similar to those manually identified in other studies. Finally, we develop a prototype detection algorithm based on ICA to identify the onset of the eruption.Plain Language Summary Through monitoring volcanoes, we can detect signs that they may be likely to erupt in the future, yet many of the world's volcanoes remain unmonitored. However, the latest generation of RADAR satellites produces regular measurements of ground displacement around the majority of the world's volcanoes, and these measurements can be used to detect signs of unrest at many previously unmonitored volcanoes. As the volume of data produced in this undertaking is vast, an automatic detection algorithm is required to detect these signals of interest. In this work, we present methods to separate signals indicative of volcanic unrest from other nuisance signals and to then monitor the geophysically important signals to detect if a volcano has entered a period of unrest.

TI  - A New Hurricane Wind Direction Retrieval Method for SAR Images without Hurricane Eye
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new approach for hurricane wind direction retrieval utilizing rainband streaks contained in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images without hurricane eye information, based on the hurricane inflow angle. To calculate the wind direction field, a method for estimating the location of the hurricane center is given. In this paper, four Sentinel-1A (S-1A) images with a hurricane eye are used to clarify the center estimation method. Three S-1A SAR images without a hurricane eye are studied to evaluate the accuracy of the new method. The estimated locations of hurricane centers show good agreement with hurricane track data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) Hurricane Research Division (HRD), HurricaneCity, and the National Institute of Informatics (NII). To validate the estimated wind directions, the NOAA HRD dropwindsonde observations for Tropical Storm Karl are collected and compared. The wind directions retrieved by our approach are more consistent with visual inspection than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method in subimages. Moreover, the retrieved wind speeds utilizing C-band model 5.N (CMOD5.N) are compared with wind speed estimations observed by Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR). The results suggest that the proposed method has good potential to retrieve hurricane wind direction from SAR images without a hurricane eye and external data.

TI  - Evaluation of Spatial Generalization Characteristics of a Robust Classifier as Applied to Coral Reef Habitats in Remote Islands of the Pacific Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was an evaluation of the spectral signature generalization properties of coral across four remote Pacific Ocean reefs. The sites under consideration have not been the subject of previous studies for coral classification using remote sensing data. Previous research regarding using remote sensing to identify reefs has been limited to in-situ assessment, with some researchers also performing temporal analysis of a selected area of interest. This study expanded the previous in-situ analyses by evaluating the ability of a basic predictor, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), trained on Depth Invariant Indices calculated from the spectral signature of coral in one location to generalize to other locations, both within the same scene and in other scenes. Three Landsat 8 scenes were selected and masked for null, land, and obstructed pixels, and corrections for sun glint and atmospheric interference were applied. Depth Invariant Indices (DII) were then calculated according to the method of Lyzenga and an LDA classifier trained on ground truth data from a single scene. The resulting LDA classifier was then applied to other locations and the coral classification accuracy evaluated. When applied to ground truth data from the Palmyra Atoll location in scene path/row 065/056, the initial model achieved an accuracy of 80.3%. However, when applied to ground truth observations from another location within the scene, namely, Kingman Reef, it achieved an accuracy of 78.6%. The model was then applied to two additional scenes (Howland Island and Baker Island Atoll), which yielded an accuracy of 69.2% and 71.4%, respectively. Finally, the algorithm was retrained using data gathered from all four sites, which produced an overall accuracy of 74.1%.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in small papillary thyroid cancer. A review on novel surgical techniques
T2  - ENDOCRINE
M3  - Review
AB  - PurposeSentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and negative for clinically neck lymph node metastatic involvement (N0) has emerged as a promising minimally invasive procedure to detect metastatic nodes.MethodsThe MEDLINE database was searched via the PubMed interface on 10 January 2018 for the MeSH headings sentinel lymph node biopsy and thyroid carcinoma.ResultsVital blue dye, radioisotope, and the combination of both techniques are used in PTC patients. These methods and the emerging role of SPECT/CT are discussed in this review. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rates ranged from 0 to 100% for blue dye, 83 to 100% for radioisotopes, and 66 to 100% for the combination of both techniques, respectively.ConclusionsSNB based on radioisotope technique with the use of intraoperative gamma-probe is an accurate and safe method that allows the highest SLN detection rate. There is sufficient evidence to propagate the increasing use of SNB procedure that has the potential to avoid prophylactic lymph node surgery in patients clinically N0.

TI  - (Not so) gently down the stream: River pollution and health in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterborne diseases, often arising from freshwater pollution, are a leading cause of mortality in developing countries. However, data limitations inhibit our understanding of the extent of damage arising from freshwater pollution. We employ a novel hydrological approach combined with village census data to study the effect of upstream polluting behavior on downstream health in Indonesia. We find that upstream use of rivers for bathing and associated sanitary practices can explain as many as 7.5% of all diarrhea-related deaths annually. We also find suggestive evidence for differential avoidance behavior in response to different pollutants. Our approach relies on publicly available satellite data, open source hydrological models, and coarse village census data allowing us to estimate health externalities from river pollution in particularly vulnerable and data poor environments.

TI  - Secretory breast carcinoma in an 8-year-old girl: A case report and literature review
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Secretory breast carcinoma (SBC) is a rare form of breast cancer found in both children and adults, and is the most common breast cancer in the pediatric population. Although SBC usually carries a favorable prognosis, there have been reported cases of axillary and distant metastases. Surgery is the primary mode of treatment, however, there exists variability within the literature surrounding the management of SBC. We report a case of an 8-year-old girl who presented with a firm, mobile, palpable breast mass. Ultrasonography was performed, followed by local excision, with surgical pathology concerning for SBC. The patient was definitively treated with mastectomy and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. She received no adjuvant therapies and 2 years later, remains disease free. Herein, we review the literature, curate data from 89 reported cases of pediatric and adult SBC, and address some of the controversy surrounding its treatment. From this review we conclude that patients with SBC should be reviewed at multidisciplinary treatment planning conference, undergo surgery with mastectomy or lumpectomy with SLN biopsy, and have long-term postoperative follow-up.

TI  - Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis started during or after travel: A GeoSentinel analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRecent studies demonstrate that rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP) in international travelers is suboptimal, with only 5-20% of travelers receiving rabies immune globulin (RIG) in the country of exposure when indicated. We hypothesized that travelers may not be receiving RIG appropriately, and practices may vary between countries. We aim to describe the characteristics of travelers who received RIG and/or RPEP during travel.Methodology/Principal findingsWe conducted a multi-center review of international travelers exposed to potentially rabid animals, collecting information on RPEP administration. Travelers who started RPEP before (Group A) and at (Group B) presentation to a GeoSentinel clinic during September 2014-July 2017 were included. We included 920 travelers who started RPEP. About two-thirds of Group A travelers with an indication for rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) did not receive it. Travelers exposed in Indonesia were less likely to receive RIG in the country of exposure (relative risk: 0.30; 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.73; P = 0.01). Travelers exposed in Thailand [Relative risk (RR) 1.38, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 1.0-1.8; P = 0.02], Sri Lanka (RR 3.99, 95% CI: 3.99-11.9; P = 0.013), and the Philippines (RR 19.95, 95% CI: 2.5-157.2; P = 0.01), were more likely to receive RIG in the country of exposure.Conclusions/SignificanceThis analysis highlights gaps in early delivery of RIG to travelers and identifies specific countries where travelers may be more or less likely to receive RIG. More detailed country-level information helps inform risk education of international travelers regarding appropriate rabies prevention.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of rotaviruses in Northwest Ethiopia after national vaccine introduction
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rotaviruses mortality among infants and young children is high in Sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, Ethiopia introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine in its national immunization program to decrease the burden of rotavirus disease and mortality. Rotavirus surveillance in Ethiopia is based largely on data provided by sentinel hospitals in its capital Addis Ababa.Objective: To assess rotavirus abundancy and diversity in outpatient infants and children outside of Addis Ababa in the early post-introduction period.Method: Fecal samples were obtained from children aged less than five years presenting with diarrhea at outpatient health institutions in two cities in Northwest Ethiopia, Gondar and Bahir Dar, from November 2015 to April 2016. Basic demographic data were assessed. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect rotavirus A RNA. Based on sequences of VP4 and VP7 gene segments phylogenetic analysis was performed.Results: Rotavirus wildtype positivity was 25% (113/450). Rotavirus infection was less common in infants below 6 months than in children of all other age-groups. Rotavirus genotype distributions were distinct between Bahir Dar and Gondar. In total, wildtype G3P[8], G2P[4], G9P[8], G12P[8], and G3P[6] rotaviruses were detected in 68 (60.2%), 21 (18.6%), 13 (11.5%), 9 (8.0%), and 2 (1.8%) of the positive samples, respectively. Wildtype G1P [8] strains were absent. The phylogenetic analysis revealed close relatedness of current rotaviruses with Ethiopian strains of the pre-vaccination period.Conclusion: In the early period after the introduction of vaccination, rotaviruses in Northwestern Ethiopia were frequent in children of 6-59 months and diverse. High phylogenetic relatedness with strains of the pre-vaccine era, indicate absence of early vaccine-induced strain replacement. Future surveillance studies should be carried out throughout the country to gain comprehensive data on rotavirus strain diversity and to monitor the effect of the ongoing vaccine program on the disease burden and eventual rotavirus strain replacement.

TI  - Estimating Groundwater Abstractions at the Aquifer Scale Using GRACE Observations
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater monitoring requires costly in situ networks, which are difficult to maintain over long time periods, especially in countries facing economic recession such as Greece. Our work aims at providing a methodology to estimate groundwater abstractions at the aquifer scale using publicly available remotely sensed data from the NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) together with publicly available meteorological observations that serve as input variables to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. The methodology was demonstrated in an alluvial aquifer in NE Greece for a 10-year period (2005-2014), where irrigation agriculture poses a serious threat to both groundwater resources and their dependent ecosystems. To generalize the developed model, an ensemble of 100 ANNs was created by the initial weight randomization approach and output was computed by averaging the output of each individual model. Scaled Root Mean Square Error and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient were used to test the model efficiency. Both of these performance metrics indicated that monthly groundwater abstractions can be estimated efficiently and that the developed methodology offers an inexpensive substitute for in situ groundwater monitoring when in situ networks are not available or cannot operate properly.

TI  - Can Complete Axillary Node Dissection Be Safely Omitted in Patients with Early Breast Cancer When the Sentinel Node Biopsy Is Positive for Malignancy? An Update for Clinical Practice
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Review
AB  - The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the new standard-of-care for patients with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer. The focused examination of fewer lymph nodes in addition to improvements in histopathological and molecular analysis have increased the rate at which micrometastases and isolated tumor cells are identified. We reviewed the literature and summarized the evidence regarding the need for complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following the finding of a positive sentinel node biopsy through the identification of the most important outcomes and evaluation of quality of evidence. The article focuses on the safe omission of complete ALND when the axillary lymph nodes contain macrometastases and provides an overview of the topic primarily based on level 1 evidence derived from randomized clinical trials with a critical appraisal of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial.

TI  - Deriving three dimensional reservoir bathymetry from multi-satellite datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate different techniques that rebuild reservoir bathymetry by combining multi-satellite imagery of surface water elevation and extent. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are processed in two distinct ways in order to determine 3-D reservoir bathymetry. They are defined as (a) linear extrapolation and (b) linear interpolation. The first one linearly extrapolates the land slope, defining the bottom as the intersection of all extrapolated lines. The second linearly interpolates the uppermost and lowermost pixels of the reservoir's main river, repeating the process for all other tributaries. A visible bathymetry, resulting from the combination of radar altimetry and water extent masks, can be coupled with the DEM, improving the accuracy of techniques (a) and (b). Envisat and Altika-based altimetric time series is combined to a Landsat-based water extent database over the 2002-2016 period in order to generate the visible bathymetry, and topography is derived from the 3-arcsec HydroSHEDS DEM. Fourteen 3-D bathymetries derived from the combination of these techniques and datasets, plus the inclusion of upstream and downstream riverbed elevations, are evaluated over Lake Mead. Accuracy is measured using ground observations, and show that metrics improve as a function of added data requirement and processing. Best bathymetry estimates are obtained when the visible bathymetry, linear extrapolation technique and riverbed elevation are combined. Water storage variability is also evaluated and shows that best results are derived from the aforementioned combination. This study contributes to our understanding and representation of reservoir water impoundment impacts on the hydrological cycle.

TI  - Radiometric Normalization of Multitemporal and Multisensor Remote Sensing Images Based on a Gaussian Mixture Model and Error Ellipse
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relative radiometric normalization is often required in time series analysis of satellite Earth observations such as land cover change detection. Normalization process reduces the radiometric differences caused by changes in the environmental conditions during the acquisition of multitemporal satellite images. In this paper, we proposed an efficient and automatic method based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to find a set of subjectively chosen invariant pixels. A linear model, based on Error Ellipse, was then adjusted to normalize the subject image. The proposed method involves two main steps; in the first step, invariant pixels, which are known as most probable unchanged pixels, were obtained by analyzing image differences estimated by GMMs. Then, these pixels were used to model the relationship between two multitemporal images. To evaluate the proposed method in real analysis scenarios, three multitemporal datasets acquired by different satellite sensors such as Ikonos, Quickbird, SuperView-1, and Worldview-2 were analyzed. These images were collected before and after the 2011's Japan and the 2004's Indonesia Tsunamis, and the 2017's Iran-Iraq earthquake. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can considerably improve the radiometric variations between temporal images for change detection applications.

TI  - Efficient method for outlier removal in SAR image matching based on epipolar geometry
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A method is proposed for removing falsely matched points after sparse matching in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This method uses epipolar geometry as well as random sample consensus (RANSAC) to automatically remove false matches (outliers) among all points. The method randomly selects at least four points among all matched points. Then, using a bilinear equation, a generic relation is established between the pixel coordinates of a reference point in the master image and the parameters of the corresponding epipolar line in the slave image. Therefore, it is possible to calculate the epipolar line for all points using the bilinear function and then evaluate the accuracy of the matched points. Moreover, the proposed method is compared with the method that uses the RANSAC with an affine function, which is a common method for removing outliers. Here, the output of the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm is used to conduct the experiments. Furthermore, the SAR image pairs from southern Iran are utilised to evaluate the performance of the method. Experiments are conducted on TerraSAR-X images, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method has high reliability for removing false matches.

TI  - Multi-spectral and panchromatic image fusion approach using stationary wavelet transform and swarm flower pollination optimization for remote sensing applications
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a multi-spectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) image fusion approach based on the flower pollination algorithm optimization (FPA). The FPA is used to get an optimal fused image. The image fusion quality depends on the choice of the weight of fusion rule. The proposed approach uses FPA to optimize the weights of a fusion rule to make a perfect image fusion process. FPA is a nature inspired algorithm, based on the characteristics of a flower pollination process. FPA averts trapping in local optimal solution. In this paper, the remote sensing image fusion based on flower pollination algorithm is compared to several states of the art image fusion approaches including Intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) image fusion; stationary wavelets transform image fusion based on the average weight fusion rule (SWT-AW) and the image fusion based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO). The experimental results used MODIS satellite series with spatial resolutions 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km, which are low spatial resolution and multispectral images; and Pan image of SPOT satellite is high spatial resolution 10 m to produce synthetic imagery at SPOT spatial resolutions and MODIS multispectral resolution at the same time. The experimental results prove that the proposed remote sensing image fusion approach can illustrate a better performance than the other approaches. The experimental results show that the approach offers up to 20% enhancement in Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), 1% enhancement in Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), 1% and 0.5% enhancement in entropy information (El) than best existing particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms over existing approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modified Superpixel Segmentation for Digital Surface Model Refinement and Building Extraction from Satellite Stereo Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Superpixels, as a state-of-the-art segmentation paradigm, have recently been widely used in computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite the effectiveness of these algorithms, there are still many limitations and challenges dealing with Very High-Resolution (VHR) satellite images especially in complex urban scenes. In this paper, we develop a superpixel algorithm as a modified edge-based version of Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC), which is here called ESLIC, compatible with VHR satellite images. Then, based on the modified properties of generated superpixels, a heuristic multi-scale approach for building extraction is proposed, based on the stereo satellite imagery along with the corresponding Digital Surface Model (DSM). First, to generate the modified superpixels, an edge-preserving term is applied to retain the main building boundaries and edges. The resulting superpixels are then used to initially refine the stereo-extracted DSM. After shadow and vegetation removal, a rough building mask is obtained from the normalized DSM, which highlights the appropriate regions in the image, to be used as the input of a multi-scale superpixel segmentation of the proper areas to determine the superpixels inside the building. Finally, these building superpixels with different scales are integrated and the output is a unified building mask. We have tested our methods on building samples from a WorldView-2 dataset. The results are promising, and the experiments show that superpixels generated with the proposed ESLIC algorithm are more adherent to the building boundaries, and the resulting building mask retains urban object shape better than those generated with the original SLIC algorithm.

TI  - Analysis of spatiotemporal variations of cloud fraction based on geographic characteristics over Iran
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of the present study is to provide a climatic description of spatiotemporal variations of cloud fractions based on geographic characteristics over Iran during daytimes. Analyses are performed on the basis of 15years of data collected from the MODIS instrument aboard Terra and Aqua satellites, data from 120 weather stations, ERA-Interim reanalysis, and geographic data (latitude, altitude, and vegetation cover). We have compared the consistency of MODIS monthly mean of cloud fractions aboard the Terra and Aqua with ERA-Interim and weather stations data. The results showed good agreement (R-2=up to 74%) between them but the data is more consistent during the cold months. Weather station data has a better overall agreement with MODIS compared to ERA-Interim. Temporal variations of cloud fraction showed maximum standard deviation in autumn for both satellite observations. Trend analyses applied to both data indicate non-significant trends for most months, although a significant decreasing trend of 2.2% per year during December and an increasing trend of 2.1% per year during May were observed. We found that the maximum and minimum monthly means of cloud fraction correspond to December to February (56 to 63%) and June-July-September (8 to 26%), respectively. Analysis of latitudinal forcing on cloud fraction showed that an increase in cloud fraction is coupled with an increase in latitude; this pattern is true only up to 31.5 degrees N in summer. The reverse pattern is related to the Asian Monsoon system over Iran in low latitudes. Topographic forcing in this mountainous area often leads to orographic convection in the elevations of 500-1500m during spring and autumn and coastal convection during summer. Vegetation also has a strong positive correlation with cloud fraction.

TI  - The Collection 6 MODIS burned area mapping algorithm and product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites have provided nearly two decades of global fire data. Here, we describe refinements made to the 500-m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas. Comparison of the C6 and C5.1 MCD64A1 products for fifteen years (2002-2016) on a regional basis shows that the C6 product detects considerably more burned area globally (26%) and in almost every region considered. The sole exception was in Boreal North America, where the mean annual area burned was 6% lower for C6, primarily as a result of a large increase in the number of small lakes mapped (and subsequently masked) at high latitudes in the upstream C6 input data. With respect to temporal reporting accuracy, 44% of the C6 MCD64A1 burned grid cells were detected on the same day as an active fire, and 68% within 2 days, which represents a substantial reduction in temporal uncertainty compared to the C5.1 MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 products. In addition, an areal accuracy assessment of the C6 burned area product undertaken using high resolution burned area reference maps derived from 108 Landsat image pairs is reported.

TI  - Role of genetic heart disease in sentinel sudden cardiac arrest survivors across the age spectrum
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) may be the sentinel expression of a sudden cardiac death-predisposing genetic heart disease (GHD). Although shown to underlie many unexplained SCAs in the young, the contribution of GHDs to sentinel SCA has never been quantified across the age spectrum. Thus, we sought to determine the contribution of GHDs in single-center referral cohort of non-ischemic SCA survivors.Methods and results: Retrospective analysis of 3037 patientswas used to identify all individuals who experienced a sentinel event of SCA. Following exclusion of patients with ischemic or complex congenital heart disease, cases were classified by clinical diagnoses. Overall, 180 (5.9%) referral patients experienced a sentinel SCA (average age at SCA 28 +/- 15 years, 99 females). An etiology was identified in 113/180 patients (62.8%) including channelopathies in 26.7%, arrhythmogenic bileaflet mitral valve prolapse in 10.6%, cardiomyopathies in 9.4%, other etiologies in 6.7%, acquired long QT syndrome in 6.7%, and multiple disorders in 2.8%. The remaining 67/180 (37.2%) cases were classified as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). Interestingly, the contribution of GHDs declined precipitously after the first decade of life [90.0% (age 0-9; n=20), 58.7% (age 10-19; n=46), 28.1% (age 20-29; n=32), 23.8% (age 30-39; n=42), 16.7% (age 40-49; n=24), and 12.5% (age 50+; n=16)].Conclusions: Within a referral population enriched for GHDs, the ability of a comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including genetic testing, to elucidate a root cause in non-ischemic SCA survivors declined with age. Although rare, GHDs can underlie SCA into adulthood and merit consideration across the age spectrum. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Although significant progress has been made in the understanding of melanoma pathophysiology and therapy, patients with metastatic melanoma still have a poor prognosis. The management of regional nodes remains a matter of debate. By replacing elective lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy has revolutionized the treatment of malignant melanoma. In this paper, the history of the procedure is traced, and the indication for completion lymphadenectomy after positive sentinel node biopsy is discussed in light of the recent studies that addressed this issue. The role of adjuvant therapies in the management of patients with stage III melanoma is also discussed.

TI  - Methodological proposal to assess plastic greenhouses land cover change from the combination of archival aerial orthoimages and Landsat data
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work outlines a methodological proposal to assess plastic covered greenhouses (PCG) land cover change from the combination of archival aerial orthoimages and Landsat data. In this way, landscape spatial metrics were semi-automatically derived to be used in the analysis of the spatial arrangement of PCG areas. The experimental process consisted of two main phases: (i) mapping PCG through a semi-automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach relying on segmentation plus non-parametric supervised classification; (ii) processing the PCG classified objects to yield different landscape spatial metrics. The case study has focused on two high density PCG sites located in south-eastern Spain. To analyse PCG land cover evolution, each study site was composed of three multi-temporal remote sensed datasets formed by the fusion of orthoimages (0) derived from archival aerial photography and temporally corresponding Landsat images (L). In terms of PCG mapping performance, the best results were obtained when using O + L datasets as complementary data to be used in a data fusion process. In addition, a new feature called "Greenhouse Detection Index" has been successfully developed and tested, yielding excellent results at the mapping phase. Finally, the semi-automatically extracted PCG land cover metrics, though depicting some variability, have reproduced the behaviour and temporal trend of the manually obtained ones (manual digitalisation) reasonably well. These results can be translated to an exponential reduction of time and cost for analysing long-term PCG land cover change. (C) 2018 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Taking the Perspective of Others: A Conceptual Model and Its Application to the Refugee Crisis
T2  - PEACE AND CONFLICT-JOURNAL OF PEACE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article offers a theoretical exploration of the psychological and social processes involved in perspective taking. Constructing the perspective of other people-that is, how they view themselves, others, and the world-requires perspective takers to mobilize both personal experiences and cultural resources. While these processes are rarely reflected upon in daily interactions with familiar others, they adopt a particular dynamic in the case of less familiar or stigmatized groups such as refugees. To unpack this dynamic, we propose the commitment model, which differentiates among essentialism, situationalism, identification, and repositioning in perspective taking. These categories are defined and exemplified with social media comments regarding refugees, their worldview, and imagined impact on host communities. By examining the different movements involved in perspective taking, we conclude that it is a multifaceted phenomenon that has different pragmatic consequences. It contributes to building more open societies but it can also lead to separating self and others, closing down dialogue and mutual understanding.

AB  - y The Association of Black Psychologists' (ABPsi) has embodied its mission within the context of the evolving discipline of Black Psychology. In its 50-year evolution, the association has evolved and expanded beyond its initial concerns to include an articulation of a science of Black human functioning, ergo an African-centered or African psychology. The nascent association called for a logic of human behavior, wellness, and illness from an African episteme and cultural worldview. Equivalent to a scientific revolution, the Black psychology discussion has evolved to a Pan-African discussion with a new cadre of debates emerging in the literature including among continental African scholars focusing on the existence, definition, and praxis of an African psychology. Over the course of this intellectual quest, ABPsi, aligned with its mission as a professional association, advanced several models of psychological theory and practice as well as strategies grounded in Black, African-centered, and/or Black psychology. A sample of these models and strategies are discussed through the lens of the association's evolving articulation of a science of Black human functioning.

TI  - Multidisciplinary Management of the Axilla in Patients with cT1-T2 N0 Breast Cancer Undergoing Primary Mastectomy: Results from a Prospective Single-Institution Series
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe after mapping of the axilla: radiotherapy or surgery (AMAROS) trial concluded that for patients with cT1-2 N0 breast cancer and one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), axillary radiotherapy (AxRT) provides equivalent locoregional control and a lower incidence of lymphedema compared with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The study prospectively assessed how often ALND could be replaced by AxRT in a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing mastectomy for cT1-2 N0 breast cancer.MethodsIn November 2015, our multidisciplinary group agreed to omit routine intraoperative SLN evaluation for cT1-2 N0 patients undergoing upfront mastectomy and potentially eligible for postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT), including those 60years of age or younger and those older than 60years with high-risk features. Patients with one or two positive SLNs on final pathology were reviewed to determine whether PMRT including the full axilla was an appropriate alternative to ALND.ResultsFrom November 2015 to December 2016, 154 patients met the study criteria, and 114 (74%) formed the final study cohort. Intraoperative SLN evaluation was omitted for 76 patients (67%). Of these patients, 20 (26%) had one or two positive SLNs, and 14 of these patients received PMRT+AxRT as an alternative to ALND. Three patients returned for ALND, and three patients were observed. On univariate analysis, tumor size, LVI, number of positive lymph nodes, and receipt of chemotherapy were associated with receipt of PMRT.ConclusionsFor the majority of patients with one or two positive SLNs, ALND was avoided in favor of PMRT+AxRT. With appropriate multidisciplinary strategies, intraoperative evaluation of the SLN and immediate ALND can be avoided for patients meeting the AMAROS criteria and eligible for PMRT.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The studies on agricultural droughts require long-term atmospheric, hydrological and meteorological data. On the other hand, today, the possibilities of using spectral data in environmental studies are indicated. The development of remote sensing techniques, increasing the spectral and spatial resolution of data allows using remote sensing data in the study of water content in the environment. The paper presents the results of the analysis of moisture content of soil-plant environment in the lowland areas of river valley using the spectral data from Sentinel-2. The analyses were conducted between February and November 2016. The spectral data were used to calculate the Normalize Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) which provided the information about the moisture content of the soil-plant environment. The analyses were performed only on grasslands, on 22 objects located in the research area in the Oder river valley between Malczyce and Brzeg Dolny, Poland. The NDVI values were correlated with the hydrological and meteorological parameters. The analyses showed spatial and temporal variability of the moisture conditions in the soil-plant environment showed by the NDVI variability and existence some relationships between the climatic and spectral indices characterizing the moisture content in the environment.

TI  - Radargrammetric approaches to the flat relief of the amazon coast using COSMO-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X datasets
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazonian coast consists of extensive flood plains and plateaus characterized by a high discharge of water and sediment from the Amazon River. This wide landscape occurs under a tropical climate with heavy rains and high cloud cover, making it unsuitable for conventional mapping based on optical images. Additionally, the flat relief and vegetation structure of the Brazilian Amazon coast define an incoherent to partially coherent behavior for the microwave signal, rendering radargrammetric models more suitable for the three-dimensional mapping of its surface. This study aimed to assess the digital surface models (DSMs) provided by Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) Stripmap datasets throughout the radargrammetric models from SARscape and Toutin. The DSMs were generated from SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data with an acquisition geometry that addressed the need for a compromise between the intersection angles and low temporal decorrelation. The radargrammetric SARscape and Toutin's models were developed from different amounts of stereo ground control points (SGCP). The generated DSMs were evaluated considering a set of 40 independent checkpoints (ICP) measured by GNSS in the field, in their entirety and disaggregated by coastal environment. The vertical accuracy was based on the estimation of the discrepancies, bias and precision (standard deviation and root mean square error RMSE), and the Taylor and Target diagrams were used for a more comprehensive comparison. In the vertical accuracy analysis using all ICPs measured in situ, the DSM obtained by the SARscape's model from the CSK SAR data resulted in the lowest RMSE (4.34 m) and mean discrepancy (0.05 m), but Toutin's model had the lowest standard deviation (2.58 m) of the discrepancies. The Taylor and Target diagrams showed fluctuations in accuracy that alternated the DSMs generated from the two types of SAR data, indicating that TSX produced more stable models and CSK produced better vertical accuracy. The Amazon Coastal Plateau and Fluvial Marine Terrace environments defined three-dimensional representations with lower RMSEs (better than 7.8 and 8.9 m, respectively), regardless of the type of SAR data or the radargrammetric model used. The worst performance, which was for the Fluvial Marine Plain, was influenced by the specific characteristics of this coastal environment, such as the structure of the mangrove vegetation and the shoreline. In general, the high resolution and good ability to revisit the SAR data used, together with the radargrammetric models, allowed for the accurate mapping of the flat relief of the Amazon coastal environments, providing detailed spatial information that can be acquired in severe rainfall conditions in a region of intense morphological dynamics.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in interventional oncology
T2  - ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has evolved from the use of agitated saline to second generation bioengineered microbubbles designed to withstand insonation with limited destruction. While only one of these newer agents is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use outside echocardiography, interventional radiologists are increasingly finding off-label uses for ultrasound contrast agents. Notably, these agents have an extremely benign safety profile with no hepatic or renal toxicities and no radiation exposure. Alongside diagnostic applications, CEUS has begun to develop its own niche within the realm of interventional oncology. Certainly, the characterization of focal solid organ lesions (such as hepatic and renal lesions) by CEUS has been an important development. However, interventional oncologists are finding that the dynamic and real-time information afforded by CEUS can improve biopsy guidance, ablation therapy, and provide early evidence of tumor viability after locoregional therapy. Even more novel uses of CEUS include lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node localization. Critical areas of research still exist. The purpose of this article is to provide a narrative review of the emerging roles of CEUS in interventional oncology.

TI  - Change detection in Landsat images based on local neighbourhood information
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a novel technique is proposed to detect the changes in bitemporal multispectral images. Utilisation of the local neighbourhood information in any image processing task may provide good noise immunity and reduces false alarms. Motivated by this, Otsu's thresholding of local information based approach is proposed in this work. It shows the effective performance in change detection of bitemporal Landsat images which suffer from different atmospheric and sunlight conditions. To get the local information around each pixel, both bitemporal images are partitioned into overlapping image blocks. Every block of the first image is concatenated with the corresponding block of the second image for each pixel position. Thus, the information of the concatenated block is considered as inter-block information. Further, Otsu's method is applied on the concatenated block for threshold calculation. Depending on the threshold, binary values are generated. Finally, binary values of both images for all bands are compared by XOR operation to detect it as the background i.e. unchanged pixel or foreground i.e. changed pixel. On the basis of majority class present in XOR output, binary change map is generated. Experiments conducted on Landsat images show that the proposed method provides better performance compared to reported techniques.

TI  - Present status of sentinel lymph node biopsy in cervical cancer
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, and seventh overall. This disease represents a medical, economic and social burden. In early FIGO stage patients (IA, IB1 and IIA1), nodal involvement is the most important prognostic factor. Imaging evaluation of nodal metastasis is of limited value. In order to determine lymph node involvement, allow loco-regional control of the disease, define the need for adjuvant radiotherapy and improve survival, standard surgery for early disease is radical hysterectomy with systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. However, this surgical treatment has risks and complications: longer operative time, larger blood loss, neurovascular or ureteral injury, lower-limb lymphedema, symptomatic lymphocysts, hydronephrosis. A method that allows to define the presence of regional metastasis with less morbidity and equal or greater precision is particularly relevant. The use of the sentinel lymph node biopsy is intended to reach that purpose. The present study reviews recent literature on the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in cervical cancer, analyzing its indications and contraindications, injection and detection techniques, tracers used, surgical and pathological approaches and its applicability in up-to-date clinical practice.

TI  - Extraction and analysis of geological lineaments combining a DEM and remote sensing images from the northern Baoji loess area
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological lineaments are important reactant of geological structure on the surface, and control the distribution of regional ground-water, geohazards, geothermal and earthquakes. The technology of geological lineaments extraction is of great significance for the analysis of regional plate movement and ore forming prognosis. However, the traditional methods are mainly based on the semi-automatic or manual visual interpretation, which consuming time and labor for the dependence on the rich professional experience and knowledge of the interpreter experts, and involving less in the special geomorphological regions. Taking Loess areas in northern Baoji as an example, this paper proposed a lineaments extraction algorithm based on tensor voting coupled Hough Transform, with the help of DEM and Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing images. Firstly, the best independent band combination of Landsat 8 OLI images for lineaments extraction were selected by using principal component analysis. Secondly, Gaussian high-pass filter was applied to sharpen the edge in the DEM and composite Landsat 8 OLI images. Linear boundary was extracted by tensor voting according to the conspicuousness of the vector sum superposition feature based on edge points. Finally, the Hough Transform was employed to search the edges and extracted the geological lineaments in this region. The experimental results showed that the orientation of lineaments was dominated by NW-SE and NE-SW, supplemented by NNW-SSE. Under the influence of the uplift of the eastern foot of Liupan Mountains and the southern margin of Ordos, the lineaments were mainly distributed over linear landforms, which were better consistent with previous studies about the direction of tectonics in this region. Compared with the segment tracing algorithm, this method has more applicability, efficiency, high practical value and scientific significance in the analysis of tectonic movement and evolution in special landform area.

TI  - Self-Similarity Constrained Sparse Representation for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusing a low-resolution hyperspectral (HS) image with the corresponding high-resolution multispectral image to obtain a high-resolution HS image is an important technique for capturing comprehensive scene information in both the spatial and spectral domains. Existing approaches adopt sparsity promoting strategy and encode the spectral information of each pixel independently, which results in noisy sparse representation. We propose a novel HS image super-resolution method via a self-similarity constrained sparse representation. We explore the similar patch structures across the whole image and the pixels with close appearance in the local regions to create global-structure groups and local-spectral super-pixels. By forcing the similarity of the sparse representations for pixels belonging to the same group and super-pixel, we alleviate the effect of the outliers in the learned sparse coding. Experiment results on benchmark datasets validate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both the quantitative metrics and visual effect.

TI  - Hurricane-Induced Changes in the Everglades National Park Mangrove Forest: Landsat Observations Between 1985 and 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Everglades National Park (ENP) has one of the largest mangrove forests in the United States, yet due to lack of data and methods, there has been no multidecadal record of detailed changes in its mangrove forests, not to mention their response to periodic hurricanes. Here, based on remote sensing spectroscopy, multisensor cross calibration, spectral normalization, and pixel unmixing, we develop a stepwise method to map distributions and changes of the ENP mangrove forests and other major wetlands cover types (marshes and hardwood hammocks) over the last three decades. The time series of Landsat-based results indicate statistically significant increasing trend from 1985 to 2017 in the total ENP mangrove coverage with a cumulative increase of 10.2%, which has increased in the inner coastline area but decreased in the outer coastline area. The mangrove coverage also decreased considerably in certain hurricane years (1992, 2005, and 2017), with the largest decrease of 644.9km(2) (46.5% of the mean mangrove area in normal years) occurring in 1993 after Hurricane Andrew. Yet, these large mangrove die-off areas gradually recovered to prehurricane levels 3-4years after the passage of major hurricanes. Results also indicate that while the mangrove forests were always damaged by hurricanes, the extent of the damage depended on wind speed, direction, and distance from maximum wind. The findings here could serve as baseline information for future restoration efforts of the ENP ecosystem, and the study also provides a method extendable to other coastal wetland regions.

TI  - The thin(ning) green line? Investigating changes in Kenya's seagrass coverage
T2  - BIOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of seagrass distribution is limited to a few well-studied sites and poor where resources are scant (e.g. Africa), hence global estimates of seagrass carbon storage are inaccurate. Here, we analysed freely available Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery to quantify contemporary coverage and change in seagrass between 1986 and 2016 on Kenya's coast. Using field surveys and independent estimates of historical seagrass, we estimate total cover of Kenya's seagrass to be 317.1 +/- 27.2 km(2), following losses of 0.85% yr(-1) since 1986. Losses increased from 0.29% yr(-1) in 2000 to 1.59% yr(-1) in 2016, releasing up to 2.17 Tg carbon since 1986. Anecdotal evidence suggests fishing pressure is an important cause of loss and is likely to intensify in the near future. If these results are representative for Africa, global estimates of seagrass extent and loss need reconsidering.

TI  - A Novel Phenology Based Feature Subset Selection Technique Using Random Forest for Multitemporal PolSAR Crop Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International-Association-for-Pattern-Recognition (IAPR) TC 7 Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing (PRRS)

AB  - Feature selection techniques intent to select a subset of features that minimizes redundancy and maximizes relevancy for classification problems in machine learning. Standard methods for feature selection in machine learning seldom take into account the domain knowledge associated with the data. Multitemporal crop classification studies with full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data ought to consider the changes in the scattering mechanisms with their phenological growth stages. Hence, it is desirable to incorporate these changes while determining a feature subset for classification. In this study, a random forest (RF) based feature selection technique is proposed that takes into account the changes in the physical scattering mechanism with crop phenological stages for multitemporal PolSAR classification. The partial probability plot, which is an attribute of RF, provides information about the marginal effect of a polarimetric parameter on the desired crop class. Moreover, it is used to identify the specific range of a parameter where the probability of the presence of a particular crop class is high. The proposed technique identifies features that change significantly with crop phenology. The selected features are the ones whose ranges show maximum separation amongst crop classes. Additionally, the feature subset is refined by eliminating correlated features. The E-SAR L-band dataset of the AgriSAR-2006 campaign over the Demmin test site in Germany is used in this study. The classification accuracy using the novel feature selection technique is 99.12%. This is nominally better than using the features obtained from a standard feature selection method used in RF, such as mean decrease Gini (98.73%) and mean decrease accuracy (98.68%) that do not take into account the information based on crop phenology.

TI  - Fluorescence-supported lymphography and extended pelvic lymph node dissection in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a prospective, randomized trial
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To demonstrate the benefits of fluorescence-supported extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) compared to regular ePLND in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.Methods 120 patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer were prospectively randomized (1:1): in the intervention group, indocyanine green (ICG) was injected transrectally into the prostate before docking of the robot. In both groups, ePLND was performed including additional dissection of fluorescent lymph nodes (LN) in the ICG group.Results After drop-out of two patients, 59 patients were allocated to the control (A) and intervention group (B) with a median PSA of 8,6 ng/ml. Median console time was 159 (A) vs. 168 (B) min (p=0.20) with a longer time for ICG-ePLND: 43 (A) vs. 55 min (B) (p=0.001). 2609 LN were found with significantly more LN after ICG-supported ePLND with a median of 25 vs. 17 LN in A (p<0.001). Nodal metastases were detected in 6 patients in A (25 cancerous LN) vs. 9 patients in B (62 positive LN) (p=0.40). In seven of nine patients, ICG-ePLND identified at least one cancer-positive LN (sensitivity 78%), 27 of 62 cancerous LN were fluorescent. Symptomatic lymphocele occurred in one patient in a and in three patients in b (p=0.62). After a median follow-up of 22.9 months, PSA levels were similar.Conclusions While ICG-ePLND seems to be beneficial for a better understanding of the lymphatic drainage and a more meticulous diagnostic approach, the sensitivity is not sufficient to recommend stand-alone ICG lymph node dissection.

TI  - Tropical Deforestation and Recolonization by Exotic and Native Trees: Spatial Patterns of Tropical Forest Biomass, Functional Groups, and Species Counts and Links to Stand Age, Geoclimate, and Sustainability Goals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We mapped native, endemic, and introduced (i.e., exotic) tree species counts, relative basal areas of functional groups, species basal areas, and forest biomass from forest inventory data, satellite imagery, and environmental data for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Imagery included time series of Landsat composites and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based phenology. Environmental data included climate, land-cover, geology, topography, and road distances. Large-scale deforestation and subsequent forest regrowth are clear in the resulting maps decades after large-scale transition back to forest. Stand age, climate, geology, topography, road/urban locations, and protection are clearly influential. Unprotected forests on more accessible or arable lands are younger and have more introduced species and deciduous and nitrogen-fixing basal areas, fewer endemic species, and less biomass. Exotic species are widespread-except in the oldest, most remote forests on the least arable lands, where shade-tolerant exotics may persist. Although the maps have large uncertainty, their patterns of biomass, tree species diversity, and functional traits suggest that for a given geoclimate, forest age is a core proxy for forest biomass, species counts, nitrogen-fixing status, and leaf longevity. Geoclimate indicates hard-leaved species commonness. Until global wall-to-wall remote sensing data from specialized sensors are available, maps from multispectral image time series and other predictor data should help with running ecosystem models and as sustainable development indicators. Forest attribute models trained with a tree species ordination and mapped with nearest neighbor substitution (Phenological Gradient Nearest Neighbor method, PGNN) yielded larger correlation coefficients for observed vs. mapped tree species basal areas than Cubist regression tree models trained separately on each species. In contrast, Cubist regression tree models of forest structural and functional attributes yielded larger such correlation coefficients than the ordination-trained PGNN models.

TI  - Increasing the Resolution of Ocean pCO<sub>2</sub> Maps in the South Eastern Atlantic Ocean Merging Multifractal Satellite-Derived Ocean Variables
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new methodology has been developed in order to improve the description of the spatial and temporal variability of not well-resolved oceanic variables from other well-observed high-resolution oceanic variables. The method is based on the cross-scale inference of information, incorporating the common features of different multifractal high-resolution variables into a coarser one. An exercise of validation of the methodology has been performed based on the outputs of coupled physical-biogeochemical Regional Ocean Modeling System adapted to the eastern boundary upwelling systems at two spatial resolutions. Once the algorithm has been proved to he effective in increasing the spatial resolution of modeled partial pressure of CO2 at the surface ocean (pCO(2)), we have investigated the capability of our methodology when it is applied to remote sensing data, focusing on the improvement of the temporal description. In this regard, we have inferred daily pCO(2) maps at high resolution (4 km, i.e., 1/24 degrees) fusing monthly pCO(2) data at low resolution (100 kin, i.e., 1 degrees) with the small-scale features contained in daily high-resolution maps of satellite sea surface temperature and Chlorophyll-a. The algorithm has been applied to the South Eastern Atlantic Ocean opening the possibility to obtain an accurate quantification of the CO2 fluxes in relevant coastal regions, such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems. Outputs of our algorithm have been compared with in situ measurements, showing that daily maps inferred from monthly products are in average 6 mu atm closer to the in situ values than the original coarser monthly maps. Furthermore, values of pCO(2) have been improved in points close to the coast with respect to the original input data.

TI  - Difficult travels: Delta plans don't land in the Chao Phraya delta
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand have large river deltas. The first three deltas have international commitments for so-called delta plans: large-scale national efforts to reshape deltas in light of future economic growth and climate change. Thailand's Chao Phraya delta has no such commitments. Why is this the case? This article proposes that Thailand's absence of a colonial past has retained a differently ordered institutional capacity and that Delta plans embed assumptions that fit poorly with a Thai worldview. The article relies on literature and adds original research collected on three separate field visits to Thailand.

TI  - Early assessment of crop yield from remotely sensed water stress and solar radiation data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) available for evapotranspiration is crucial for food security, given the significant inter annual yield variability of rainfed crops in large agricultural regions. Also, incoming solar radiation (Rs) influences the photosynthetic rate of vegetated surfaces and can affect productivity. The aim of this work is to evaluate the ability of crop water stress and Rs remotely sensed data to forecast yield at regional scale. Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) was computed as an indicator of crop water stress and soil moisture availability. TVDI during critical growth stage of crops was calculated from MODIS products: MODIS/AQUA 8-day composite LST at 1 km and 16-day composite vegetation index at 1 km. Rs data were obtained from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). The relationship between TVDI, Rs and yield of wheat, corn and soybean was analyzed. High R-2 values (0.55-0.82, depending on crop and region) were found in different agro-climatic regions of Argentine Pampas. Validation results showed the suitability of the model RMSE = 330-1300 kg ha(-1), Relative Error = 13-34%. However, results were significantly improved considering the most important factor affecting yield. Rs proved to be important for winter crops in humid areas, where incoming radiation can be a limiting factor. In semi-arid regions, soils with low water retention capacity and summer crops, crop water stress showed the best results. Overall, results reflected that the proposed approach is suitable for crop yield forecasting at regional scale several weeks previous to harvest.

TI  - Ductal carcinoma in situ current trends, controversies, and review of literature
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor, non-invasive malignancy confined within the basement membrane of the breast ductal system. There is a wide variation in the natural history of DCIS with an estimated incidence of progression to invasive ductal carcinoma being at least 13%-50% over a range of 10 or more years after initial diagnosis. Regardless of the treatment strategy, long-term survival is excellent. The controversy surrounding DCIS relates to preventing under-treatment, while also avoiding unnecessary treatments. In this article, we review the incidence, presentation, management options and surveillance of DCIS. Furthermore, we address several current controversies related to the management of DCIS, including margin status, sentinel node biopsy, hormonal therapy, the role of radiation in breast conservation surgery, and various risk stratification schemes.

TI  - Clinical results and costs of endovascular treatment in comparison with surgery in non ruptured aneurysms
T2  - NEUROCIRUGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: to evaluate the results and costs of surgical treatment against endovascular in non ruptured aneurysms.Material and methods: retrospective study of a consecutive series non ruptured aneurysms from a single-center treated endovascularly (EV) and surgically (SC). A descriptive study of demographic (age, sex) charqacteristics of the patients and the radiological aspects of the aneurysms have been carried out. Clinical results (GOS at 6 months), angiographic data (occlusion classification) and economic costs have been evaluated in both globally, and in each of the groups.Results: 89 patients treated between 2010 and 2015 were reviewed. Most of them were treated endovascularly (74%). There were no statiscally significant differences between EV and SC groups. 89% of the patients presented favourable GOS (4-5) at six months, being this percentage similar in both groups. Complete occlusion was much higher in SC group (96%) than in EV (55%). Retreatment rate was 24% in EV group and 0% in SC group. The retreatments were more frequent in anterior circulation aneurysms and bigger aneurysms (> 10 mm). The expenses in the SC group come mainly from hospital stay, meanwhile in the EV group is due to embolisation materials. The average length of stay (ALOS) are higher in SC group but costs of first admission are higher in EV group (14% more). When the costs of retreatments and follow up are included the costs of endovascular treatment is much higher than the surgical (61% more expensive).Conclusions: results of both types of treatment are comparable. The grade of aneurysmal occlusion of the SC group was higher than the EV, as well as the stability of the treatment, requiring fewer retreatments. Althoug the ALOS in SC group were longer, the costs of the EV group were significantly higher than the SC group due to the costs of embolisation materials, follow up that they need and the rate of retreatment. Adequate selection of candidates for endovascular coiling could improve angiographic outcomes, reduce retraction rates, and save costs. (C) 2018 Sociedad Espanola de Neurocirugia.

TI  - Further improvement in the control of bovine tuberculosis recurrence in Ireland
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing objective assessment of national bovine tuberculosis (bTB) policy in Ireland is important to monitor efforts towards improved bTB control. The study objective was to investigate temporal trends in the risk of herd recurrence. The study included all herds derestricted following a bTB episode ending in 1998, 2008 or 2012. The respective 'study periods' were up to the end of 2001 for 1998-derestricted herds, to the end of 2011 for 2008-derestricted herds, and to the end of 2015 for 2012-derestricted herds. A multivariable Cox proportional-hazard model was developed to examine time to next restriction. The results from the model showed a continuing significant decreasing trend in herd recurrence of bTB in Ireland from 1998 until 2015: herds derestricted in 2008 were 0.75 (95 per cent CI 0.68 to 0.82) times as likely to develop a further restriction compared with 1998 herds, and herds derestricted in 2012 were 0.85 (95per cent CI 0.76 to 0.95) times as likely as 2008 herds. However, despite significant improvements, recurrence of bTB remains a concern, with 30.2 per cent (95 per cent CI 28.0 to 32.4 per cent) of herds derestricted in 2012 being re-restricted over the subsequent three years. Further work is needed to address the two key drivers of herd recurrence, namely residual infection and local reinfection.

TI  - A novel co-training approach for urban land cover mapping with unclear Landsat time series imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat time-series (LTS) imagery shows potential for dynamic mapping in urban areas. However, unclear observations (clouds, cloud shadows, snow/ice, and SLC-off data) in the dataset inevitably restrict the efficacy of many of the state-of-the-art classifiers. In this work, we present a novel co-training classification approach consisting of two steps to cope with the unclear observations. Firstly, we develop a method called the MCCR classifier that deals with the unclear observations in an error-recoverable way. The clear observations are utilized to recover the unclear ones in the training samples by the use of the matrix completion (MC) algorithm, and the collaborative representation (CR) classifier is exploited to handle unclear observations in the unlabeled data. Secondly, considering that the random forest (RF) classifier is able to cope with contaminated data in an error tolerant way, a co-training approach (CotrRM) based on the RF and MCCR classifiers is also proposed to further improve the classification efficacy. The CotrRM method is executed by iteratively constructing semi-labeled training sets based on the crisp and soft predictions of the two individual classifiers on the unlabeled data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCCR classifier and CotrRM method, LTS imagery of the city of Wuhan (a metropolitan city of China) from four years (11 images from 2000, 16 images from 2005, 13 images from 2010, and 15 images from 2015) was adopted. The experiments showed that the MCCR classifier performs as well as the RF classifier for the mapping of urban land cover with contaminated LTS imagery. Moreover, the proposed CotrRM method has the ability to further improve the classification performance. The proposed approach can not only work effectively in the classification, but can also recover the unclear observations in the LTS imagery, courtesy of the MC algorithm. The overall accuracies of the land-cover changes between each two adjacent periods are all over 85%. Given the effectiveness and flexibility, the proposed method could also be applied in other unclear data classification.

TI  - An Analysis of Land-Use Change and Grassland Degradation from a Policy Perspective in Inner Mongolia, China, 1990-2015
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover changes have important effects on ecology, human systems, the environment, and policy at both global and regional scales. Thus, they are closely related to human activities. The extraction of more details about land-use change and grassland degradation is necessary to achieve future sustainable development in Inner Mongolia. The current study presents the patterns and processes of land-use changes over space and time, while also analyzing grassland degradation that is based on an analysis of land-use changes using a transition matrix, the Markov chain model and Moran's I index, and a combination of long-time-scale remote sensing data as the data source. The major results indicate the following. (1) In 1990-2015, 13% (123,445 km(2)) of the total study area, including eight land-use types, changed. Woodland increased the most and moderate grassland decreased the most. (2) Grassland degradation, which occupied 2.8% of the total area of Inner Mongolia, was the major land-use conversion process before 2000, while, after 2000, 8.7% of the total area was restored; however, grassland degradation may still be the major ecological issue in Inner Mongolia. (3) Environmental protection policies show a close relationship with land-use conversion.

TI  - Mapping the transition from pre-European settlement to contemporary soil conditions in the Lower Hunter Valley, Australia
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of soil security has been proposed with the dimensions of capability, condition, capital, connectivity, and codification of soil. However, it remains a challenge to accurately and efficiently assess the soil's capability and condition as a function of soil change. The idea of genoform and phenoform was proposed 20 years ago and recently revitalized. Herein, we were inspired by these concepts to develop a general approach and concepts of genosoils and phenosoils for distinguishing the soil changes within soil mapping units as affected by human activities. Across a 220 km(2) district with a diversity in landforms, parent materials, and land use types, we generated maps of Pre-European (soil classes that existed prior to agricultural development) soil classes using a digital soil mapping approach. Based on the land use change, Pre-European genosoils and present genosoils and phenosoils were identified and mapped within each of the Pre-European soil classes. The measured topsoil (0-10 cm) and subsoil (40-50 cm) properties have shown differences between the present genosoils and phenosoils. By objectively calculating the distances between the present genosoils and phenosoils in a principal component space using a recently published comprehensive soil classification system, several present phenosoils displayed significant differences among several soil properties (distance > 8% of overall distance) and were redefined as new genosoils. The approach has successfully mapped genosoils and phenosoils within Pre-European soil classes at the district scale and identified shifts between present genosoils and phenosoils. It showed potential in detecting areas of soil changes due to human activities. Future work is required to separate seasonal fluctuations from long-term variations in NDVI and improve land use classification using remote sensing data. The method developed here can be applied in areas without remnant vegetation to separate the soil condition from capability by gauging phenosoils against genosoils.

TI  - Displacement Monitoring and Health Evaluation of Two Bridges Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Displacement monitoring of large bridges is an important source of information concerning their health state. In this paper, a procedure based on satellite Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) data is presented to assess bridge health. The proposed approach periodically assesses the displacements of a bridge in order to detect abnormal displacements at any position of the bridge. To demonstrate its performances, the displacement characteristics of two bridges, the Nanjing-Dashengguan High-speed Railway Bridge (NDHRB, 1272 m long) and the Nanjing-Yangtze River Bridge (NYRB, 1576-m long), are studied. For this purpose, two independent Sentinel-1 SAR datasets were used, covering a two-year period with 75 and 66 images, respectively, providing very similar results. During the observed period, the two bridges underwent no actual displacements: thermal dilation displacements were dominant. For NDHRB, the total thermal dilation parameter from the PSI analysis was computed using the two different datasets; the difference of the two computations was 0.09 mm/degrees C, which, assuming a temperature variation of 30 degrees C, corresponds to a discrepancy of 2.7 mm over the total bridge length. From the total thermal dilation parameters, the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) were calculated, which were 11.26 x 10(-6)/degrees C and 11.19 x 10(-6)/degrees C, respectively. These values match the bridge metal properties. For NYRB, the estimated CTE was 10.46 x 10(-6)/degrees C, which also matches the bridge metal properties (11.26 x 10(-6)/degrees C). Based on a statistical analysis of the PSI topographic errors of NDHRB, pixels on the bridge deck were selected, and displacement models covering the entire NDHRB were established using the two track datasets; the model was validated on the six piers with an absolute mean error of 0.25 mm/degrees C. Finally, the health state of NDHRB was evaluated with four more images using the estimated models, and no abnormal displacements were found.

TI  - Postseismic Restoration of the Ecological Environment in the Wenchuan Region Using Satellite Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Landsat remote-sensing data combined with geological information extracted from ALOS and Sentinel-1A radar data, the ecological environment was evaluated in the years 2007, 2008, 2013, and 2017 through gray correlation analysis on the basis of the construction of the pressure-state-response model. The main objective of this research was to assess the ecological environment changes in Wenchuan County before and after the earthquake, and to provide reference for future social development and policy implementation. The grading map of the ecological environment was obtained for every year, and the ecological restoration status of Wenchuan County after the earthquake was evaluated. The results showed that the maximum area cover at a safe ecological level was over 46.4% in 2007. After the 2008 earthquake, the proportion of unsafe and very unsafe ecological levels was 40.0%, especially around the Lancang River and the western mountain area in Wenchuan County. After five years of restoration, ecological conditions were improved, up to 48.0% in the region. The areas at critically safe and above recovered to 85.5% in 2017 within nine years after the deadly Wenchuan earthquake of May 12, 2008. In this paper, we discuss the results of detailed analysis of ecological improvements and correlation with the degrees of pressure, state, and response layers of the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model.

TI  - Automatic Ship Detection Using the Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine from X-Band Sar Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an automatic ship detection method using the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) from X-band SAR satellite images is proposed. When using machine learning techniques, the most important points to consider are (i) defining the proper input neurons and (ii) selecting the correct training data. We focused on generating two optimal input data neurons that (i) strengthened ship targets and (ii) mitigated noise effects by image processing techniques, including median filtering, multi-looking, etc. The median filter and multi-look operations were used to reduce the background noise, and the median filter operation was also used to remove ships in an image in order to maximize the difference between the pixel values of ships and the sea. Through the root-mean-square difference calculation, most ship targets, even including small ships, were emphasized in the images. We tested the performance of the proposed method using X-band high-resolution SAR images including COSMO-SkyMed, KOMPSAT-5, and TerraSAR-X images. An intensity difference map and a texture difference map were extracted from the X-band SAR single-look complex (SLC) images, and then, the maps were used as input neurons for the ANN and SVM machine learning techniques. Finally, we created ship-probability maps through the machine learning techniques. To validate the ANN and SVM results, optimal threshold values were obtained by using the statistical approach and then used to identify ships from the ship-probability maps. Consequently, the level of recall achieved was greater than 90% in most cases. This means that the proposed method enables the detection of most ship targets from X-band SAR images with a reduced number of false detections from negative effects.

T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Written by associate editors of the Annals of Nuclear Medicine, this invited review article is intended to offer our readers a condensed global view on the high-quality research work that has been published in Europe last year. We have divided this article into five sections. The first three sections from the oncology category include [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) for therapy monitoring in malignant lymphoma, [F-18]fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET for hypoxia, and lymphoscintigraphy update. It is followed by a section on amyloid PET for Alzheimer's disease using [C-11]Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and [F-18]florbetapir from the neurology category. The final section reviews three original articles in the field of basic and translational molecular imaging regardless of the category, which investigated new PET tracers such as L-4-borono-2-[F-18]fluoro-phenylalanine (FBPA), O-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) and Cu-64-NOTA-pertuzumab in small animals. We hope that this review article will arouse greater interest in our readers in recent European research trends in the field of nuclear medicine.

TI  - Prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection among persons with hepatitis C virus infection: England, 2008-2014
T2  - HIV MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesMethodsIn persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HIV coinfection leads to faster progression to advanced liver disease. The aim of our study was to estimate diagnosed HIV prevalence among people with evidence of current HCV infection (polymerase chain reaction positive) and examine predictors of coinfection.Adults (15years old) with a current HCV infection reported to the Public Health England (PHE) sentinel surveillance of blood-borne viruses were linked to the PHE national HIV database using a deterministic methodology. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted.ResultsConclusionsBetween 2008 and 2014, 5.0% (999/20088) of adults with a current HCV infection were diagnosed with HIV coinfection. The majority acquired HIV through sex between men (441; 64.9%), followed by injecting drug use (153; 22.5%) and heterosexual contact (84; 12.4%). Of persons who were coinfected, 65.5% had been diagnosed with HIV infection >6months before their HCV diagnosis, 41.4% of whom had a negative anti-HCV test between their HIV and HCV diagnoses. In a multivariable model among persons with current HCV infection, an HIV diagnosis was more likely among men [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.60-4.16] and persons of black ethnicity (aOR 3.19; 95% CI 1.36-7.46), and less likely among older adults (aOR 0.85 per 10-year increase; 95% CI 0.79-0.92) and persons of Asian ethnicity (aOR 0.59; 95% CI 0.41-0.86).Our results indicate that the majority of diagnosed HIV and current HCV coinfections are among men who have sex with men. Safer sex campaigns should include awareness of transmission of HCV among MSM living with HIV.

AB  - This article provides an introduction to the special issue in the Journal of Black Psychology, commemorating the 50th anniversary of The Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi). A highlight is provided of the five articles that makeup this issue. Jamison takes a developmental approach in examining keys concepts, theories, and issues that have been or need to be addressed in African/Black psychology. In contrast, Cokley and Garba examine how Black psychology has had an impact on the field of psychology. Grills, Nobles, and Hill scrutinize the models and strategies of Black psychology, African psychology, African-centered, and Pan-African psychology that have been developed through ABPsi. Myers, Anderson, Lodge, Speight, and Queener present optimal conceptual theory, an alternative cultural paradigm based in the African worldview, and discuss its application therapeutically and pragmatically as a solution to global human challenges. Finally, as emerging scholars, Woodyard and Gadson provide a critical reflection of the impact on ABPsi on their personal and professional development.

TI  - Major changes in diatom abundance, productivity, and net community metabolism in a windier and dryer coastal climate in the southern Humboldt Current
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing global warming caused by climate change has been suggested to produce an intensification of up welling-favorable winds along the coast of south-central Chile due to a poleward displacement of the South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA). Here we explore the extent to which these changes have influenced water column properties, inorganic nutrients, primary production, diatom abundances and net community metabolism (GPP/CR) in these shelf waters. Our analysis is based on a monthly time series (2003-2013) of in situ oceanographic and biological observations and experiments to assess gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR) at a shelf station in central Chile (similar to 36.5 degrees S), along with ancillary data on alongshore wind variability, river outflow and MODIS-derived surface fluorescence (nFLH). A reduction in river outflow from 2007 onwards, forced remotely by the poleward displacement of the SPA, resulted in a cooler and saltier water column, with lower dissolved Si:N ratios (Si(OH)4: NO3-) and net community metabolism shifting from high net autotrophy (mean GPP/CR = 10.9 +/- 14) to a balance between production and respiration (GPP/CR = 1.17 +/- 0.6). A key finding was that most of the observed inter-annual variability in diatom abundance and primary production rates from 2003 to 2013 could be explained by two opposite trends: a significant intensification of upwelling-favorable winds during early spring (October-November) post-2009, and a sustained drop in freshwater discharged by the main local river during the same period. A combination of more intense equatorward winds and weaker stratification of the water column may have driven mixing and turbulence beyond the levels that are suitable for diatom growth when the upwelling period began (October-November), and subsequently may have enhanced the offshore transport of nutrients and productivity during late summer months (February-March). Patterns revealed by the analysis of monthly composites of normalized surface fluorescence (nFLH) are consistent with this interpretation. Further intensification of upwelling-favorable winds, combined with changes in the pattern of precipitation and river discharges, may have negative effects on the composition, productivity, and carbon export in shelf waters of this and other coastal upwelling

TI  - Oceanic Eddy Characteristics and Generation Mechanisms in the Kuroshio Extension Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kuroshio Extension region is well known for its strong eddy activity. In this paper, using satellite altimetry-measured sea surface height anomaly data from 1993 to 2012 in an extended Kuroshio Extension region (140-180 degrees E, 25-45 degrees N), we analyze eddy characteristics: eddy size, polarity, lifetime, intensity, trajectory, and spatial and temporal distributions. Using temperature and salinity vertical profiles measured by Argo floats, we examine the eddy impact on vertical stratification. During the 20-year period, 7,574 eddies are identified (based on following complete eddy trajectories) with a lifetime equal to or longer than 4weeks. The numbers of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are found to be approximately the same. The distribution of eddy sizes peaks at a radius of about 40km. The radius at the peak is at the same order as the first baroclinic deformation radius or the horizontal shear scale of the Kuroshio flow. The normalized eddy statistical characteristics show that eddies have different characteristics at different stages of their lifetimes. Among eddies with lifetimes longer than 50weeks, more anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies are found north (south) of 35 degrees N. In contrast, among eddies with lifetimes shorter than 20weeks, more cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddies are found north (south) of 35 degrees N. The asymmetric distribution of eddies suggests two different eddy generation mechanisms: (1) the development of meanders in the Kuroshio path leading to the pinch off of eddies with longer lifetime (larger size) and (2) horizontal shear instability (barotropic instability) leading to eddies of shorter life (smaller size). We further apply an eddy-resolved numerical product to quantitatively investigate the eddy generation mechanisms.Plain Language Summary We analyze eddy characteristics with 20-year satellite data and examine the eddy impact on vertical stratification. Besides, through the statistic result, we propose two eddy generation mechanisms: flow horizontal shear-induced eddy generation and the meander of flow path leading to the eddy generation. And then, we further apply an eddy-resolved numerical product to quantitatively investigate the eddy generation mechanisms.

TI  - The Impacts of Atmospheric and Surface Parameters on Long-Term Variations in the Planetary Albedo
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Planetary albedo (PA; shortwave broadband albedo) and its long-term variations, which are controlled in a complex way by various atmospheric and surface properties, play a key role in controlling the global and regional energy budget. This study investigates the contributions of different atmospheric and surface properties to the long-term variations of PA based on 13 years (2003-15) of albedo, cloud, and ice coverage datasets from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Single Scanner Footprint edition 4A product, vegetation product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and surface albedo product from the Cloud, Albedo, and Radiation dataset, version 2 (CLARA-A2). According to the temporal correlation analysis, statistical results indicate that variations in PA are closely related to the variations of cloud properties (e.g., cloud fraction, ice water path, and liquid water path) and surface parameters (e.g., ice/snow percent coverage and normalized difference vegetation index), but their temporal relationships vary among the different regions. Generally, the stepwise multiple linear regression models can capture the observed PA anomalies for most regions. Based on the contribution calculation, cloud fraction dominates the variability of PA in the mid-and low latitudes while ice/snow percent coverage (or surface albedo) dominates the variability in the mid-and high latitudes. Changes in cloud liquid water path and ice water path are the secondary dominant factor over most regions, whereas change in vegetation cover is the least important factor over land. These results verify the effects of atmospheric and surface factors on planetary albedo changes and thus may be of benefit for improving the parameterization of the PA and determining the climate feedbacks.

TI  - Error Source Analysis and Correction of GF-3 Polarimetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite is the first polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) satellite in China. With a designed in-orbit life of 8 years, it will provide large amounts of PolSAR data for ocean monitoring, disaster reduction, and many other applications. The polarimetric data quality is essential for all these applications, so the analysis and calibration of the polarimetric error sources are very important for GF-3. In this study, we established a full-link error model for GF-3 PolSAR system. Based on this model, we comprehensively analyzed the quantitative effects of the main error sources including the composition, figured out characteristics of the phase imbalance introduced by the antenna, and pointed out the error sources which have to be corrected. Furthermore, the polarimetric correction method for GF-3 PolSAR system is proposed. Finally, assisted by several external calibration experiments, polarimetric errors of GF-3 data are efficiently corrected during in-orbit-test phase.

TI  - Method for Mapping Rice Fields in Complex Landscape Areas Based on Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Network from HJ-1 A/B Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information about rice planting areas is essential for crop yield estimation, global climate change and agricultural resource management. In this study, we present a novel pixel-level classification approach that uses convolutional neural network (CNN) model to extract the features of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series curve for classification. The goal is to explore the practicability of deep learning techniques for rice recognition in complex landscape regions, where rice is easily confused with the surroundings, by using mid-resolution remote sensing images. A transfer learning strategy is utilized to fine tune a pre-trained CNN model and obtain the temporal features of the EVI curve. Support vector machine (SVM), a traditional machine learning approach, is also implemented in the experiment. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the two models. Results show that our model performs better than SVM, with the overall accuracies being 93.60% and 91.05%, respectively. Therefore, this technique is appropriate for estimating rice planting areas in southern China on the basis of a pre-trained CNN model by using time series data. And more opportunity and potential can be found for crop classification by remote sensing and deep learning technique in the future study.

TI  - The relationship between drought activity and vegetation cover in Northwest China from 1982 to 2013
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated drought activity and the relationship between drought and vegetation in Northwest China over the period 1982-2013 using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The indexes were, respectively, calculated from ground-based meteorological data and from remotely sensed satellite data. The spatial and temporal distributions of drought (SPEI) and of vegetation cover (NDVI) were compared using annual trends, and the relationships between these trends were analyzed. The results are: (1) Overall, Northwest China had a drought trend during the study period, although some a few regions show a significant wetness trend; (2) the mean annual NDVI fluctuates, but overall shows an increasing trend, particularly in some mountainous areas that have at least adequate water and vegetation cover, while unused land becomes degraded; (3) most regions show a positive correlation between SPEI and NDVI, although the western parts of the Tarim basin, Qaidam basin, and some regions in the southeastern part of study area show a negative correlation; and (4) the various regions respond differently to global climate change, but in general regions with more vegetation cover show increased vegetation growth, while regions with less vegetation cover are becoming degraded and thus more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.

AB  - Landsat-8 OLI imagery of Sokoto, Nigeria, was processed to emphasize the geology features and mineral potential of the area. Band ratios (4/2, 5/6, 6/7) were assigned to RGB. Band ratio 4/2 highlights ferric ion minerals, 5/6 emphasizes ferrous minerals, and 6/7 distinguishes iron oxide minerals from carbonate minerals. In a second technique, band ratio 6/7 was replaced with 7/5 order to accentuate clay minerals with high reflectance within band 7. The last technique evaluated in this study used spectral information from minimum noise fraction image to map surface geology. Supervised classification training sites were selected using five classes (clay, ironstone, alteration zone, water and vegetation). The band ratio classification using maximum likelihood classification was fairly accurate and matched the geologic map of the area, also showing an alteration zone that coincided with the migmatite-quartz/mica schist contact. The classified image was finally passed through a filtering effect for generalization of the data. This filtering effect was helpful in discriminating the pixels of ironstone and those of the alteration zone on the classified map. This study shows the distribution of classified earth-surface materials in Sokoto plain with the aid of supervised classification of Landsat-8 multispectral bands interpreted to reflect in-situ features.

TI  - Universal Lynch Syndrome Screening Should be Performed in All Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinomas
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lynch syndrome (LS) is defined by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, and affected patients are at high risk for multiple cancers. Reflexive testing for MMR protein loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently only recommended for colorectal and endometrial cancers, although upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is the third-most common malignancy in patients with LS. To study the suitability of universal MMR IHC screening for UTUC, we investigated MMR expression and microsatellite status in UTUC in comparison to bladder UC (BUC), and evaluated the clinicopathologic features of UTUC. We found that 9% of UTUC showed MMR IHC loss (8 MSH6 alone; 1 MSH2 and MSH6; 1 MLH1 and PMS2; n = 117) compared with 1% of BUC (1 MSH6 alone; n = 160) (P = 0.001). Of these, 4/10 (40%) of UTUC (3% overall; 3 MSH6 alone; 1 MLH1 and PMS2) and none (0%) of BUC had high microsatellite instability on molecular testing (P = 0.03). The only predictive clinicopathologic feature for MMR loss was a personal history of colorectal cancer (P = 0.0003). However, UTUC presents at a similar age to colon carcinoma in LS and thus UTUC may be the sentinel event in some patients. Combining our results with those of other studies suggests that 1% to 3% of all UTUC cases may represent LS-associated carcinoma. LS accounts for 2% to 6% of both colorectal and endometrial cancers. As LS likely accounts for a similar percentage of UTUC, we suggest that reflexive MMR IHC screening followed by microsatellite instability testing be included in diagnostic guidelines for all UTUC.

TI  - Comparison of Pre-Event VHR Optical Data and Post-Event PolSAR Data to Investigate Damage Caused by the 2011 Japan Tsunami in Built-Up Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining pre-disaster optical and post-disaster synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data is essential for the timely damage investigation because the availability of data in a disaster area is usually limited. This article proposes a novel method to assess damage in urban areas by analyzing combined pre-disaster very high resolution (VHR) optical data and post-disaster polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, which has rarely been used in previous research because the two data have extremely different characteristics. To overcome these differences and effectively compare VHR optical data and PolSAR data, a technique to simulate polarization orientation angles (POAs) in built-up areas was developed using building orientations extracted from VHR optical data. The POA is an intrinsic parameter of PolSAR data and has a physical relationship with building orientation. A damage level indicator was also proposed, based on the consideration of diminished homogeneity of POA values by damaged buildings. The indicator is the difference between directional dispersions of the pre and post-disaster POA values. Damage assessment in urban areas was conducted by using the indicator calculated with the simulated pre-disaster POAs from VHR optical data and the derived post-disaster PolSAR POAs. The proposed method was validated on the case study of the 2011 tsunami in Japan using pre-disaster KOMPSAT-2 data and post-disaster ALOS/PALSAR-1 data. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method accurately simulated the POAs with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 2.761 degrees and successfully measured the level of damage in built-up areas. The proposed method can facilitate efficient and fast damage assessment in built-up areas by comparing pre-disaster VHR optical data and post-disaster PolSAR data.

TI  - Distribution Statistics Preserving Post-Processing Method With Plot Level Uncertainty Analysis for Remotely Sensed Data-Based Forest Inventory Predictions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data-based models used in operational forest inventory usually give precise and accurate predictions on average, but they often suffer from systematic under- or over-estimation of extreme attribute values resulting in too narrow or skewed attribute distributions. We use a post-processing method based on the statistics of a proper, representative training set to correct the predictions and their probability intervals, attaining corrected predictions that reproduce the statistics of the whole population. Performance of the method is validated with three forest attributes from seven study sites in Finland with training set sizes from 50 to over 400 field plots. The results are compared to those of the uncorrected predictions given by linear models using airborne laser scanning data. The post-processing method improves the accuracy assessment linear fit between the predictions and the reference set by 35.4-51.8% and the distribution fit by 44.5-95.0%. The prediction root mean square error declines on the average by 6.3%. The systematic under- and over-estimation are reduced consistently with all training set sizes. The level of uncertainty is maintained well as the probability intervals cover the real uncertainty while keeping the average probability interval width similar to the one in uncorrected predictions.

Optical measurements were done at subauroral station Maimaga, and ionospheric measurements were fulfilled at subauroral stations Yakutsk and Zhigansk. Spatial location and intensity of red-arcs were detected by the meridional scanning photometer. The temperature of the neutral atmosphere was recorded by Fabry-Perot interferometer. It is shown that the temperature of the neutral atmosphere increases in the red arc region and changes in accordance with variations in the emission. On 02 December 1989 the neutral temperature increased by 500 K in the red arc relative to the undisturbed level determined for quiet days during the month. This evidences on the strong heating process in the red arc region. According to ionospheric and satellite data on 18 February 1999 the red arc was observed simultaneously with polarization jet development - fast westward plasma drift in the poleward electric field. The magnitude of this electric field was 50-80 mV/m. Due to frictional interaction of ions and neutrals, ions were heated up to 5000-6000 K and neutrals gain energy of some hundreds degrees.

M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this study is the phenomenon of digital society which being the object of many scientific disciplines, however, still remains outside the philosophical analysis. The urgency of this analysis is dictated by the need for a holistic study of the phenomenon, its panoramic representation in the light of modern social changes. In the study, along with the "digital society", the concepts of "numerical society", "numerical world" and "digital world", "digital dimension" are analyzed, their generic relationship with the concepts "number" and "figure" is established, and also worldview grounds, features and boundaries of the use of these concepts are studied. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study is the works of ancient, medieval and modern mathematicians and philosophers on the number as an instrument of knowledge of the world and society. The author primarily uses the principle of the unity of historical and logical analysis, and relies on the principle of comparativism. The conclusion is drawn that the concept of digital society is the modern state of the information society, while the predicate "digital" reflects the final, limiting state in the development of society and the world as a whole. Thus, modern man comes to antinomy-the desire to measure the unmeasurable.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article concerns the factors of the formation of communicative attitudes, linguistic security, and speech aggression in the media. Studying the language characteristics of modern society, the authors analyze regressive phenomena in the information and communication environment. The influence of journalistic texts on the worldview of readers of the modern press is manifested in the changing information background. Of particular interest is the influence of connotations on the media text and on postindustrial society in general. Considering the communicative process in the media taking into account the linguistic traditions, the connection of generations, ethnic unity, the authors identify specific ways of communication that evolve under the influence of a changing information environment. The relevance of the study consists in revealing the forms of manifestation of speech aggression in the texts of print media. Given that the perception of media text takes into account background information, it is assumed that negative communication patterns are being formed in the society, with special focus on the examples containing a violation of communicative and ethical norms. The practical importance of the study of the formation of communicative attitudes in the media is connected with the careful study of journalistic materials and the definition of the quality characteristics of means of influence on the audience of the media.

T2  - ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the vector-borne diseases rapidly increased due to climate change, we investigated the incidence of flavivirus occurrence among female mosquito species in urban and rural study sites in Daegu and Gunwi, South Korea using Realtime PCR. We collected more individuals and more species of mosquito in 2016 than in 2015. In 2015, we recorded a total of 22,033 mosquitoes (Trap Index, 224.8) representing 10 species from 5 genera, whereas in 2016, a total of 27,137 mosquitoes (Trap Index, 278.7) representing 13 species from 6 genera were collected. The number of mosquitoes in 2016 was higher in all study sites, except in the migratory bird habitats where the number decreased. Of the 14 species collected over the two years, Aedes vexans nipponii and Anopheles spp. were dominant in the cowsheds in rural farmland; Culex pipiens complex, in urban residential areas; and, Anopheles spp. and Cu. pipiens complex in migratory bird habitats caught in a black light trap. Cu. pipiens complex and Ae. albopictus in urban parks and Ae. albopictus and Armigeres subalbatus in migratory bird habitats were the dominant species caught in BG-sentinel traps. We found that the number of mosquitoes was highest during July-September. We analyzed 1,725 pools to detect flavivirus, where Chaoyang virus was detected among Ae. vexans niponii collected from cowsheds in rural farmland in 2016. The increased number of mosquitoes recorded in 2016 was mainly due to increased temperatures in the study areas, and reflected the change in study sites.

TI  - Geometric Correction for the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager from a Combination of Shoreline Matching and Frequency Matching
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geometric correction is fundamental in producing high quality satellite data products. However, the geometric correction for ocean color sensors, e.g., Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), is challenging because the traditional method based on ground control points (GCPs) cannot be applied when the shoreline is absent. In this study, we develop a hybrid geometric correction method, which applies shoreline matching and frequency matching on slots with shorelines and without shorelines, respectively. Frequency matching has been proposed to estimate the relative orientation between GOCI slots without a shoreline. In this paper, we extend our earlier research for absolute orientation and geometric correction by combining frequency matching results with shoreline matching ones. The proposed method consists of four parts: Initial sensor modeling of slots without shorelines, precise sensor modeling through shoreline matching, relative orientation modeling by frequency matching, and generation of geometric correction results using a combination of the two matching procedures. Initial sensor modeling uses the sensor model equation for GOCI and metadata in order to remove geometric distortion due to the Earth's rotation and curvature in the slots without shorelines. Precise sensor modeling is performed with shoreline matching and random sample consensus (RANSAC) in the slots with shorelines. Frequency matching computes position shifts for slots without shorelines with respect to the precisely corrected slots with shorelines. GOCI Level 1B scenes are generated by combining the results from shoreline matching and frequency matching. We analyzed the accuracy of shoreline matching alone against that of the combination of shoreline matching and frequency matching. Both methods yielded a similar accuracy of 1.2 km, which supports the idea that frequency matching can replace traditional shoreline matching for slots without visible shorelines.

TI  - Satellite-based mapping of dust erodibility in northeast Asia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Windblown dust originating in China and Mongolia causes health effects and agricultural damage in its source areas and causes Asian dust events in Japan. An early warning system that could be combined with weather forecasts would be helpful in preventing serious damage. However, it is difficult to specify source areas of dust with current dust modeling systems because land surface information, including vegetation coverage and land surface soil water content, is inadequate. To find and monitor dust source regions, a semi-real-time dust erodibility map was developed based on MODIS satellite data that focuses particularly on the threshold wind speed in a target area of northeast Asia including China and Mongolia (35 degrees-50 degrees N, 75 degrees-120 degrees E). The mapping system incorporates satellite data on snow cover, areas of frozen soil, surface soil water content, and vegetation cover.

T2  - CLINICS IN COLON AND RECTAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Squamous cell carcinomas of the anal canal and the anal margin are rare malignancies that are increasing in incidence. Patients with these tumors often experience delayed treatment due to delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis of the condition. Distinguishing between anal canal and analmargin tumors has implications for staging and treatment. Chemoradiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for anal canal squamous cell, with abdominoperineal resection reserved for salvage treatment in cases of persistent or recurrent disease. Early anal margin squamous cell carcinoma can be treated with wide local excision, but more advanced tumors require a combination of chemoradiation therapy and surgical excision.

TI  - Mapping Ecological Production and Benefits from Water Consumed in Agricultural and Natural Landscapes: A Case Study of the Pangani Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scarcity of information on the water productivity of different water, land, and other ecosystems in Africa, hampers the optimal allocation of the limited water resources. This study presents an innovative method to quantify the spatial variability of biomass production, crop yield, and economic water productivity, in a data scarce landscape of the Pangani Basin. For the first time, gross return from carbon credits and other ecosystem services are considered, in the concept of Economic Water Productivity. The analysis relied on the MODIS satellite data of 250 m and eight-day resolutions, and the SEBAL model, utilizing Monteith's framework for ecological production. In agriculture, irrigated sugarcane and rice achieved the highest water productivities in both biophysical and economic values. Rainfed and supplementary irrigated banana and maize productivities were significantly lower than the potential values, reflecting a wide spatial variability. In natural landscapes, forest and wetland showed the highest biomass production. However, the transition to economic productivity was low but showed the potential to increase significantly when non-market goods and services were considered. Spatially explicit information, from both biophysical and economic water productivity, provides a holistic outlook of the socio-environmental and the economic water values of a land-use activity, and can identify areas for improvement, and trade-offs in river basins.

T2  - MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper looks into specific aspects of university students' perception and understanding of Russian musical folklore, based on the balance of the categories of universality, particularity and singularity in the process of aesthetic education.Being a priority goal of present-day education policy in Russia, the aesthetic education of university students through folklore helps to ensure continuity of generations, development of the worldview and national identity. To analyze the efficiency of aesthetic education of university students through Russian musical folklore, the university has developed and piloted a model based on the interconnection of the teaching activities in the university.In this study, a number of surveys among 18-20-year-old students were carried out and analyzed within activity-based, ethno-educational, competence-based and environment-based approaches and principles of the aesthetic education. Statistical methods of testing and evaluating students' creative works were used. The following stages of aesthetic education of university students were identified: the information-oriented stage, the judgment-based stage, and the practical stage; the statistics shows that the model was efficient.The aesthetic education of university students through Russian musical folklore is related to the area of personally significant relationship within the "human being - nature - society" system. The process of studying this phenomenon involves the "past - present - future" plane and reflects the values of the folklore traditions in various periods of history.

TI  - Spiritual Siblings The Function of New Religions in Peoples Temple Doctrine
T2  - NOVA RELIGIO-JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND EMERGENT RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - For years after Peoples Temple ceased to exist, both scholars and the public debated the Temple's status as a new religious movement. These debates left out an important perspective: Jim Jones' own evaluation of the Temple's relation to new religions. This article uses Doug McAdam's work on social movement formation to organize Jones' commentary on new religions. Expanding Stephen Kent's concept of spiritual kinship lineage, this article argues that Jones identified the same political changes as giving rise to, as well as contesting, both Peoples Temple and various new religious movements. By identifying this plethora of reactions to the same political cause, Jones legitimated the Temple's worldview and subsequent mobilization. Moreover, Jones leveraged this kinship to avail himself of the variety of strategies utilized by these groups while pointing out their doctrinal, organizational, and political flaws, thus asserting the Temple's superiority in the process.

TI  - Environmental aspects and diseases related to immunosuppression in cetaceans: a concise review
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Review
AB  - The analysis of the health status of sentinel animals is a key element for the evaluation of ecosystem health conditions, since these animals respond to small and large scale changes in ecological factors and the quality of the environment. In the marine environment, the changes are systemic and accumulate impacts of coastal zones and oceanic activities, with aquatic mammals being species that reflect changes in biological and health parameters. For these animals several studies have reported an increase in the frequency and diversity of diseases, including infections by pathogens from the terrestrial environment. This increase may be related to impairment of the immune system activity of these organisms in response to potential synergistic factors. In cetaceans, immunosuppression may be caused by infection with viral agents, such as Morbillivirus, which induce severe lymphoid depletion and is responsible for several cases of mass mortality; chemical contamination, highlighting the organochlorines and trace elements (mainly mercury and cadmium); and even by chronic stress. Anthropic impacts are important stressors, and the consequences are more evident in animals of coastal habits, which leads to a constant release of glucocorticoid hormones and consequent lymphoid depletion, a mechanism similar to that occurring in terrestrial mammals. Immunosuppressed animals are susceptible to opportunistic diseases, some more severe and rare, with the risk of decline of populations. The objective of this review was to provide information on the aspects related to immunosuppression in cetaceans, associating etiological factors and pathological findings, and to highlight the relevance of the evaluation of the endocrine and immune system of marine animals as a reflection of the health status of marine ecosystems.

T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article devoted to the semantics of color epithets in the text of the Yakut heroic epic olonkho analysis, as well as to the peculiarities of their functioning in the epic text. An epithet, as an artistic and visual mean, has been attracting the interest of linguists since ancient times. Theoretical and methodological basis of the research consists of the works of A.N. Veselovsky, A.A. Potebnya, V.M. Zhirmunsky, V.Ya. Propp, S.Y. Neklyudov, S.L. Neveleva, as well as of the works of the Yakut scientists I.V. Pukhov, G.U. Ergis, P.A. Sleptsov, N.I. Filippova, V.V. Illarionov and other epics of the Russian Federation peoples researchers. The study of color epithets semantics and their functioning in the text of the Yakut heroic epic olonkho has the purpose of expanding linguistic knowledge about national-cultural specifics of the Yakuts, saved in the epic of olonkho. The relevance of this work lies in the fact that the subject of research - color epithets - is a significant part of the epithet layer in the olonkho text, thus, study of them contributes to a systematic analysis of the vocabulary of the Yakut heroic epic olonkho as a whole. Color epithets are a set of color adjectives "" white, "" black, "" red, "" scarlet, "" yellow, "" gray, "" green/light blue/blue. The object of the research is based on the texts of academic editions of "Nyurgun Bootur the Swift" olonkho by K.G. Orosin, "Kyys Debiliye" olonkho by N.P. Burnashev, "Mighty Er Sogotokh" by V.O. Karataev and "Obstinate Kulun Kullustur" by I.G. Timofeev-Teploukhov. At the initial stage, in the paper used the methods of computer analysis for the selection of color epithets from the olonkho text array, further, to characterize the color epithets and the determined words - methods of dictionary definitions analysis, as well as methods of quantitative, descriptive, contextual and comparative analysis. As shown by the study, color epithets are used in the text of the Yakut olonkho in the description of literally all elements of the epic narrative: time, place, appearance, clothing of heroes, weapons of heroes, their emotions and magical properties. It is established that the informativeness of color epithets, inherent into the semantics of the word and revealed in the combinations of color epithets with determined words, is very large - they express the worldview of the Yakuts, their attitude to the world, their assessment of the environment.

TI  - Treatise on the tectonic geomorphology of active faults: The significance of using a universal digital elevation model
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the importance of the accuracy of six digital elevation models (DEMs), in the calculation of the geomorphic indices and the classification of an active fault in the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. Four of the DEMs used are based on public and global satellite imageries, the SRTM90, SRTM30, ASTER and ALOS. The other two are national DEMs: the Greek Cadastral DEM and the topographic maps of 1:5000. We applied in each DEM, for drainage basins oriented perpendicular to the fault, a series of geomorphic indices such as the drainage basin shape (Bs), the asymmetry factor (AF), the stream length-gradient index (SL), and the valley floor width to valley height ratio (Vf). These indices are used worldwide for fault activity classification. The indices calculated in the selected DEMs are compared with results from the Greek Cadastral DEM. Bs values range from 1.6 to 5.9 suggesting variably active basins, elongated according to Drainage Basin Form (RF) calculations. AF suggests systematic tilt down to the east or west. These three indices show high variability between different DEMs. Values of SL are relatively high close to the fault trace and range from 10 to 4500 and their visualization shows different narrow or inclusive patterns. Vf values range between 0.04 and 5.00 corresponding to an almost inactive fault when based on the SRTM 90 DEM to highly active using the Cadastral DEM. Our results suggest that the globally available ALOS products are quite accurate for the purposes of the tectonic geomorphology.

It theorizes the ambiguous role of the media in a populist worldview, with regard to anti-media populism and the reaction of non-populist media to right-wing populism. Conclusions as to the more general links between populism and the media are drawn and the present analysis is contextualized as part of a more encompassing research program on this relationship.

TI  - Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Capabilities for Binary Classification of Polar Mesocyclones in Satellite Mosaics
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar mesocyclones (MCs) are small marine atmospheric vortices. The class of intense MCs, called polar lows, are accompanied by extremely strong surface winds and heat fluxes and thus largely influencing deep ocean water formation in the polar regions. Accurate detection of polar mesocyclones in high-resolution satellite data, while challenging, is a time-consuming task, when performed manually. Existing algorithms for the automatic detection of polar mesocyclones are based on the conventional analysis of patterns of cloudiness and they involve different empirically defined thresholds of geophysical variables. As a result, various detection methods typically reveal very different results when applied to a single dataset. We develop a conceptually novel approach for the detection of MCs based on the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). As a first step, we demonstrate that DCNN model is capable of performing binary classification of 500 x 500 km patches of satellite images regarding MC patterns presence in it. The training dataset is based on the reference database of MCs manually tracked in the Southern Hemisphere from satellite mosaics. We use a subset of this database with MC diameters falling in the range of 200-400 km. This dataset is further used for testing several different DCNN setups, specifically, DCNN built from scratch, DCNN based on VGG16 pre-trained weights also engaging the Transfer Learning technique, and DCNN based on VGG16 with Fine Tuning technique. Each of these networks is further applied to both infrared (IR) and a combination of infrared and water vapor (IR + WV) satellite imagery. The best skills (97% in terms of the binary classification accuracy score) is achieved with the model that averages the estimates of the ensemble of different DCNNs. The algorithm can be further extended to the automatic identification and tracking numerical scheme and applied to other atmospheric phenomena that are characterized by a distinct signature in satellite imagery.

TI  - Effect of Secondary Circulations on the Surface-Atmosphere Exchange of Energy at an Isolated Semi-arid Forest
T2  - BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation in semi-arid regions can potentially enhance the global carbon sink by increasing the terrestrial biomass. However, the survival of planted forests under such extreme environmental conditions is not guaranteed a priori, and critically depends on the surface-atmosphere exchange of energy. We investigate the pine forest Yatir in Israel, an example of a man-made semi-arid ecosystem, by means of large-eddy simulations. We focus on the interaction between surface-atmosphere exchange and secondary circulations that couple the isolated forest to the surrounding shrubland. The large-eddy simulations feature a grid resolution that resolves the forest canopy in several layers, and are initialized by satellite data and Doppler lidar, eddy-covariance and radiosonde measurements. We perform three large-eddy simulations with different geostrophic wind speeds to investigate the influence of those wind speeds on the surface-atmosphere exchange. We reproduce the measured mean updrafts above the forest and mean downdrafts above the shrubland, which increase in strength with decreasing geostrophic wind speed. The largest updrafts emerge above the older, denser part of the forest, triggering secondary circulations. The spatial extent of these circulations does not cover the entire forest area, although we observe a reduced aerodynamic resistance in the regions of updraft. Our simulations indicate that the enhanced surface-atmosphere exchange of the Yatir forest is not sufficient to compensate for the increased net radiation, due to the lower albedo of the forest with respect to the surroundings, resulting in higher air temperatures inside the forest. However, the difference between the forest and shrubland temperatures decreases with increasing geostrophic wind speed due to reduction in the aerodynamic resistance.

TI  - Robust destriping method based on data-driven learning
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Destriping is the crucial first step of many multidetector imaging pipelines since the stripes greatly decrease the quality of obtained data and limit subsequent applications. It is also a severely ill-posed issue that estimates true gray value per pixel from a single stripe measurement. Existing approaches leverage hand-crafted filters or priors but show visually unsatisfactory results where some residual stripes still remain and the quantitative values of image data are lost. To address these problems, we propose a new data-driven method. We train a convolutional neural network on a large set of ground truth data instead of using hand-tuned filters. A UNet-like network is used to learn the regularity of complex stripe noise characteristics. To generate high-quality images, we combine a per-pixel loss and a perceptual loss to penalize mismatch between the network output and ground-truth images. Experiments show that our network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art destriping approaches in real-captured noise images of many imaging fields. Our code is available online at https://github.com/Kuangxd/DDL-SR.

TI  - Structural and Spectral Analysis of Cereal Canopy Reflectance and Reflectance Anisotropy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of agricultural areas is one of the most important topics for remote sensing data analysis, especially to assist food security in the future. To improve the quality and quantify uncertainties, it is of high relevance to understand the spectral reflectivity regarding the structural and spectral properties of the canopy. The importance of understanding the influence of plant and canopy structure is well established, but, due to the difficulty of acquiring reflectance data from numerous differently structured canopies, there is still a need to study the structural and spectral dependencies affecting top-of-canopy reflectance and reflectance anisotropy. This paper presents a detailed study dealing with two fundamental issues: (1) the influence of plant and canopy architecture changes due to crop phenology on nadir acquired cereal top-of-canopy reflectance, and (2) the anisotropic reflectance of cereal top-of-canopy reflectance and its inter-annual variations as affected by varying contents of biochemical constituents and changes on canopy structure across green phenological stages between tillering and inflorescence emergence. All of the investigations are based on HySimCaR, a computer-based approach using 3D canopy models and Monte Carlo ray tracing (drat). The achieved results show that the canopy architecture significantly influences top-of-canopy reflectance and the bidirectional reflectance function (BRDF) in the VNIR (visible and near infrared), and SWIR (shortwave infrared) wavelength ranges. In summary, it can be said that the larger the fraction of the radiation reflected by the plants, the stronger is the influence of the canopy structure on the reflectance signal. A significant finding for the anisotropic reflectance is that the relative row orientation of the cereal canopies is mapped in the 3D-shape of the BRDF. Summarised, this study provides fundamental knowledge for improving the retrieval of biophysical vegetation parameters of agricultural areas for current and upcoming sensors with large FOV (field of view) with respect to the quantification of uncertainties.

TI  - Satellite derived spatio-temporal characteristics of aerosol optical depths and cloud parameters over tropical Indian region
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is well suited for the seasonal and inter-annual study of the aerosols distribution and their effects over a long period of time. Daily averaged MODIS retrieved satellite (collection 5 level 3) AOD data has been used to investigate AOD distribution in spatio-temporal domain over Indian subcontinent for the three years period, 2008-2010. In 2008, the average value of AOD over Indian subcontinent was found to be similar to 0.37 +/- 0.088, whereas in 2009 and 2010, the mean values of AOD were estimated as similar to 0.32 +/- 0.075 and similar to 0.35 +/- 0.058 respectively. The study revealed that during the monsoon season of 2009, the AOD decreased sharply with the increase of days. The highest and lowest values of AOD for the year 2008 were found to be similar to 1.098 and similar to 0.219, whereas for the years of 2009 and 2010, these values of AOD over Indian subcontinent were estimated to be similar to 0.61, similar to 0.21 and similar to 0.76, similar to 0.19 respectively. For these three years period of 2008-2010, the cloud parameters such as cloud fraction (CF), water vapor (WV), cloud optical depth (COD), and cloud top temperature (CTT), were also estimated and spatially correlated with the aerosol optical depths over Indian region. Results have been compared with some of the significant and important investigations made by other workers on AOD and cloud parameter values over entire region of India.

TI  - A 13-year climatological study on the variations of aerosol and cloud properties over Kazakhstan from remotely sensed satellite observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Republic of Kazakhstan, by geographical and climatological conditions, is a key location for the characterization of atmospheric aerosols due to an unprecedented increase of aerosol's concentrations in the recent years. This study presents a 13-year (2003-2015) analysis of the spatiotemporal distributions and trends of aerosol and cloud properties derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua (Dark Target-DT) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over Kazakhstan. The spatial patterns of annual mean AOD were generally characterized with low (< 0.1), moderate (0.1-0.5) and high (> 035) AOD centers over Kazakhstan. The respective maximum and minimum values of AOD(550) were observed in July (0.22 +/- 0.07) and November (0.12 +/- 0.03), with an annual mean of 0.18 +/- 0.03. The seasonal mean values of AOD was noticed to be maximum (0.21 +/- 0.02) during summer and minimum (0.14 +/- 0.01) during autumn seasons. The inter-annual variations in AOD showed enhanced AOD values during 2012 (0.23) followed by 2014 (0.21) and low during 2003 (0.15) and 2004 (0.14). The spatial trend analysis revealed an increase in AOD over most parts of the study domain. Also, the most important cloud parameters such as cloud fraction (CF) and cloud effective radius (CER) were investigated to assess their relationship with the AOD over Kazakhstan. It was found that the CF and CER were negatively and positively correlated with AOD over most parts of the study domain attributed to the strong influence of dust and continental background aerosols, respectively. The backward trajectories obtained from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model showed air parcels originating from the Barents Sea, Russia, Europe, China, and the mainland of Kazakhstan. The results derived from the present study gives a sense of aerosol and cloud properties, and form a basis for further research over this unique and unexplored landmass of the Asian Continent.

TI  - Remote Sensing Performance Enhancement in Hyperspectral Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images with hundreds of spectral bands have been proven to yield high performance in material classification. However, despite intensive advancement in hardware, the spatial resolution is still somewhat low, as compared to that of color and multispectral (MS) imagers. In this paper, we aim at presenting some ideas that may further enhance the performance of some remote sensing applications such as border monitoring and Mars exploration using hyperspectral images. One popular approach to enhancing the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images is pansharpening. We present a brief review of recent image resolution enhancement algorithms, including single super-resolution and multi-image fusion algorithms, for hyperspectral images. Advantages and limitations of the enhancement algorithms are highlighted. Some limitations in the pansharpening process include the availability of high resolution (HR) panchromatic (pan) and/or MS images, the registration of images from multiple sources, the availability of point spread function (PSF), and reliable and consistent image quality assessment. We suggest some proactive ideas to alleviate the above issues in practice. In the event where hyperspectral images are not available, we suggest the use of band synthesis techniques to generate HR hyperspectral images from low resolution (LR) MS images. Several recent interesting applications in border monitoring and Mars exploration using hyperspectral images are presented. Finally, some future directions in this research area are highlighted.

TI  - Clinical Significance of Molecular Micrometastasis in the Sentinel Lymph Node of Early-stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Metastatic affectation of lymph node is the main prognostic factor in localized lung cancer. A pathologic study of the obtained samples, even after adequate lymphadenectomy, showed tumor relapses for 20% of stage I patients after oncological curative surgery. We evaluated the prognostic value of molecular micrometastasis in the sentinel lymph node of patients with early-stage lung cancer.Patients and Methods: The sentinel node was marked immediately after performing thoracotomy by peritumorally injecting 0.25 mCi of nanocoloid of albumin (Nanocol1) labeled with Tc-99m in 0.3 mL. Guided by a Navigator1 gammagraphic sensor, we proceeded to its resection. The RNA of the tissue was extracted, and the presence of genes CEACAM5, BPIFA1, and CK7 in mRNA was studied. The significant association between the presence of micrometastasis, clinicopathologic characteristics, and patients' outcome was assessed.Results: Eighty-nine stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer patients were included in the study. Of the 89 analyzed sentinel lymph nodes, 44 (49.4%) were positive for CK7, 24 (26.9%) for CEACAM5, and 17 (19.1%) for BPIFA1, whereas 10 (11.2%) were positive for the 3 analyzed genes. A survival analysis showed no significant relation between the presence of molecular micrometastasis in the sentinel node and patients' progression.Conclusions: The molecular analysis of the sentinel node in patients with early-stage lung cancer shows node affectation in cases staged as stage I/II by hematoxylin-eosin or an immunohistochemical analysis. However, this nodal affectation was not apparently related to patients' outcome.

TI  - Identification of typical diurnal patterns for clear-sky climatology of surface urban heat islands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the diurnal dynamics of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) is an indispensable step towards their full interpretation at multiple time scales. However, because of the tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data, the climatology, variety, and taxonomy of diurnal SUHI (DSUHI) patterns remain largely unknown for numerous cities with different bioclimates. By combining daily MODIS LST data with a newly developed four -parameter diurnal temperature cycle(DTC) model, we selected 354 Chinese megacities located in different bioclimatic zones to examine the characteristics of the DSUHI descriptors and systematically investigate the prevalent DSUHI temporal patterns.The DSUHI variations demonstrate that both the daily maximum and minimum SUHI intensity (SUHII) can occur during most periods of the day, although these intensities are more likely to occur in the early morning and noon/afternoon. Our results also reveal that both strong SUHIs (SUHII > 3 K) and surface urban cool islands (SUCIs) (SUHII < 0 K) are more prevalent than those identified directly through the four MODIS transits. According to the SUHI dynamics, five typical DSUHI temporal patterns are identified: standard-spoon, weak spoon, quasi-spoon, inverse-spoon, and straight-line patterns. A gradient was found with spoon-like patterns (DSUHI dynamics typically with a daytime valley and a roughly constant trend or a small peak at night) in North China and inverse-spoon (DSUHI dynamics with a typical daytime peak and a constant trend at night) or straight-line patterns (DSUHI dynamics virtually unchanged all day) in South China. The DSUHI shapes were found to be greatly controlled by the urban-rural contrast in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and urban geometry. Our results not only advance our understanding of the diurnal climatology of SUHIs but also provide a basis for urban surface heat mitigation by identifying the possible timing of the mitigation requirement.

TI  - On the Use of Satellite Sentinel 2 Data for Automatic Mapping of Burnt Areas and Burn Severity
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss the preliminary tools we devised for the automatic recognition of burnt areas and burn severity developed in the framework of the EU-funded SERV_FORFIRE project. The project is focused on the set up of operational services for fire monitoring and mitigation specifically devised for decision-makers and planning authorities. The main objectives of SERV_FORFIRE are: (i) to create a bridge between observations, model development, operational products, information translation and user uptake; and (ii) to contribute to creating an international collaborative community made up of researchers and decision-makers and planning authorities. For the purpose of this study, investigations into a fire burnt area were conducted in the south of Italy from a fire that occurred on 10 August 2017, affecting both the protected natural site of Pignola (Potenza, South of Italy) and agricultural lands. Sentinel 2 data were processed to identify and map different burnt areas and burn severity levels. Local Index for Statistical Analyses LISA were used to overcome the limits of fixed threshold values and to devise an automatic approach that is easier to re-apply to diverse ecosystems and geographic regions. The validation was assessed using 15 random plots selected from in situ analyses performed extensively in the investigated burnt area. The field survey showed a success rate of around 95%, whereas the commission and omission errors were around 3% of and 2%, respectively. Overall, our findings indicate that the use of Sentinel 2 data allows the development of standardized burn severity maps to evaluate fire effects and address post-fire management activities that support planning, decision-making, and mitigation strategies.

TI  - Distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> in Western Pacific, Studied Using Isotope Data Made in Taiwan, OCO-2 Satellite Retrievals, and CarbonTracker Products
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess sources and processes that affect the variability of CO2 at local to regional scales, we have analyzed the mixing ratio [CO2] and stable isotopic compositions (delta C-13 and delta O-18) of atmospheric CO2 for three years (2014-2016) in urban and sub-urban areas in Taipei, Taiwan. The data are compared with those from some background sites, viz., Lulin, Mauna Loa, and Minamitorishima, to evaluate how local emissions affect CO2 level regionally. [CO2] over the urban and sub-urban stations are significantly higher than that observed at the three aforementioned remote sites mainly due to local emissions, which partly mask the seasonal cycle caused by photosynthesis and respiration. Likewise, significantly low delta C-13 and delta O-18 values observed at two Taipei stations also point to anthropogenic emissions. The seasonal cycles in [CO2] and in the isotopic compositions are retrieved using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method. Regional impact is assessed using CO2 products from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite, the NOAA/EARL CarbonTracker project, and meteorological data from European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast-Interim. We found that besides local emissions, Taiwan is largely affected by external CO2 in winter and spring originated from north, west and southwest landmasses. In winter air masses with elevated CO2 concentrations, originated in eastern China influence Taipei. In spring season, about 2 ppmv enhancement in CO2 observed at the top of Lulin, a high mountain station (2.8km), could be linked to CO2 produced by biomass burning in the southeast Asian countries and transported to the region by easterly winds.Plain Language Summary We presented CO2 mixing ratio and stable isotope data, measured for more than three years in an urban and a sub-urban station in Taipei to identify their sources and asses the spatial heterogeneity and their influence on a regional scale. We also combined ground based observation by NOAA at a high mountain station in the central Taiwan with Orbital Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) satellite data, Carbon Tracker data and ECMWF wind data to identify the long-range transported CO2 over the region in different seasons. We showed that Taiwan and its surrounding regions are affected by CO2 from Eastern China in winter and south-east Asia in spring. The winter season pollutants are due to anthropogenic emissions in China and is transported by the strong winter monsoon. During the spring time, easterlies carry pollutants produced by massive biomass burning along with fossil fuel combustion in the south Asian countries.

AB  - The cutaneous melanoma has been regarded as rare disease entity in Korea for long time but it shows a silent growth recently. Furthermore the management of cutaneous melanoma including staging system, surgical principle, sentinel lymph node biopsy and subsequent complete node dissection and, most importantly, immunotherapy and target therapy against cutaneous melanoma recently. The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is steadily increasing in Korea but its increase is rapid recent 2 decades to 4.3 times and should be greater soon according to the steeper increase of life expectancy. New staging system proposed by American Joint Committee on Cancer (2017) includes changes in individual TNM category and stage groups, particularly from a prognostic viewpoint. Dermoscopy has been successfully introduced in the differential diagnosis of pigmented skin lesion focusing on cutaneous melanoma by non-invasive simple diagnostic tool. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was a issue of long debate whether survival benefit is real or not. Temporary conclusion about this question is reached after two large scale studies and immediate complete node dissection should be performed in a certain situations. Most important change is drug therapy focusing on immunotherapy and target therapy. Braf- and MEK-inhibitor, immune checkpoint inhibitor and PD-1 blocker has been proved to be effective as a sole or combination regimen against advanced and/or high-risk adjuvant setting of cutaneous melanoma. In conclusion, these remarkable changes will be reviewed shortly here.

TI  - Validation of mobile <i>in situ</i> measurements of dairy husbandry emissions by fusion of airborne/surface remote sensing with seasonal context from the Chino Dairy Complex
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mobile in situ concentration and meteorology data were collected for the Chino Dairy Complex in the Los Angeles Basin by AMOG (AutoMObile trace Gas) Surveyor on 25 June 2015 to characterize husbandry emissions in the near and far field in convoy mode with MISTIR (Mobile Infrared Sensor for Tactical Incident Response), a mobile upwards-looking, column remote sensing spectrometer. MISTIR reference flux validated AMOG plume inversions at different information levels including multiple gases, GoogleEarth imagery, and airborne trace gas remote sensing data. Long-term (9-yr.) Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer satellite data provided spatial and trace gas temporal context.For the Chino dairies, MISTIR-AMOG ammonia (NH3) agreement was within 5% (15.7 versus 14.9 Gg yr(-1), respectively) using all information. Methane (CH4) emissions were 30 Gg yr(-1) for a 45,200 herd size, indicating that Chino emission factors are greater than previously reported.Single dairy inversions were much less successful. AMOG-MISTIR agreement was 57% due to wind heterogeneity from downwind structures in these near-field measurements and emissions unsteadiness. AMOG CH4, NH3, and CO2 emissions were 91, 209, and 8200 Mg yr(-1), implying 2480, 1870, and 1720 head using published emission factors. Plumes fingerprinting identified likely sources including manure storage, cowsheds, and a structure with likely natural gas combustion.NH3 downwind of Chino showed a seasonal variation of a factor of ten, three times larger than literature suggests. Chino husbandry practices and trends in herd size and production were reviewed and unlikely to add seasonality. Higher emission seasonality was proposed as legacy soil emissions, the results of a century of husbandry, supported by airborne remote sensing data showing widespread emissions from neighborhoods that were dairies 15 years prior, and AMOG and MISTIR observations. Seasonal variations provide insights into the implications of global climate change and must be considered when comparing surveys from different seasons. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evaluation of the Newly Released Worldwide AW3D30 DEM Over Typical Landforms of China Using Two Global DEMs and ICESat/GLAS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the accuracy of newly released global 1 arc-second advance land observing satellite (ALOS) world 3D-30 m (AW3D30) digital elevation model (DEM) over five validation samples of typical landforms across China using ICESat/GLAS (ice, cloud, and land elevation satellite/geoscience laser altimeter system) data. In comparison, shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) 1-arc second (SRTM1) and global DEM version 2 (GDEM2) are also considered. The result reveals that the RMSEs of mean horizontal shifts compared with SRTM1 and GDEM2 are 5.30 and 10.07 m in x-direction, 5.64 and 11.75 min y-direction, respectively. The vertical accuracy analysis shows that the AW3D30 offers the highest accuracy with RMSE of 4.81 m, followed by SRTM1 (5.86 m), and then by GDEM2 (14.14 m). Our result reveals that the vertical accuracy can be improved by horizontal alignment. The analysis suggests that terrain slopes and land cover types jointly affect the vertical accuracies of AW3D30 and the former is likely to have a greater impact than the latter. The results of hydrological potential assessment reveal that the drainage network derived from AW3D30 is more accurate than that from SRTM1 and GDEM2. However, all the DEMs exhibit river extraction limitations over the flat area due to the unresolved flow direction based on local elevation information alone. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the AW3D30 and recommends that applications requiring accurate Earth surface depictions should utilize AW3D30 over SRTM1 and GDEM2, as it presents the best accuracy among the freely available DEMs.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change Patterns of Coastlines in Xiangshan Harbor (Zhejiang, China) During the Past 40 Years
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As special and important landscape bodies, tidal inlets possess many coastal resources. Consideration of the maintenance and protection of coastline resources and the environment is a challenging research topic, i.e. how to reasonably and scientifically exploit and use coastal resources. In this study, multitemporal Landsat images were used to explore and quantify relationships between the intensity of human activities and coastline changes. Specifically, (1) the spatial location, length, and tortuosity of coastlines in Xiangshan Harbor (XH; Zhejiang Province, China) tidal inlets, from 1974 to 2014, were extracted from satellite images; (2) the coastline change indices and the intensity of human activities in the tidal inlet areas of XH were calculated and assessed; and (3) the relationships between coastline change characteristics and human activities during the past 40 years were explored and analyzed. The results demonstrated that, during the past four decades, as human activities have intensified, the natural coastlines in XH continuously shrank, whereas artificial coastlines increased and then gradually became stable. Various human activities have changed the morphology of local coastlines in XH, and the overall coastline tortuosity has been continuously reduced. The intensity of human activities increased from 1974 to 1998, and the intensity slowed after 1998. However, the impacts of human activities are extensive and almost cover the entire coastlines of the harbor. The correlations between the intensity of human activities and the overall length and tortuosity of the coastlines were significantly negative, which means that, as human activities intensified, the length and tortuosity of the coastlines decreased.

TI  - Association of Risk for Venous Thromboembolism With Use of Low-Dose Extended- and Continuous-Cycle Combined Oral Contraceptives A Safety Study Using the Sentinel Distributed Database
T2  - JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Continuous/extended cyclic estrogen use (84/7 or 365/0 days cycles) in combined oral contraceptives (COCs) could potentially expose women to an increased cumulative dose of estrogen, compared with traditional cyclic regimens (21/7 days cycle), and may increase the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE).OBJECTIVE To determine, while holding the progestogen type constant, whether the risk for VTE is higher with use of continuous/extended COCs than with cyclic COCs among women who initiated a COC containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Incident user retrospective cohort study of primarily commercially insured US population identified from the Sentinel Distributed Database. Participants were women aged 18 to 50 years at the time of initiating a study COC between May 2007 and September 2015. Using a propensity score approach and Cox proportional hazards regression models, we estimated the hazard ratios of VTE overall and separately by ethinyl estradiol dose and age groups.EXPOSURES Initiation of continuous/extended or traditional cyclic COCs containing ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel of any dose.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES First VTE hospitalization that occurred during the study follow-up, identified by an inpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code of 415.1, 415.1x, 453, 453.x, or 453.xx.RESULTS We identified 210 691 initiators of continuous/extended COCs (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [8.6] years) and 522 316 initiators of cyclic COCs (mean [SD] age, 28.8 [8.3] years), with a mean of 0.7 person-years at risk among continuous/extended and cyclic users. Baseline cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (7.2% vs 4.7%), gynecological conditions (39.7% vs 32.3%), and health services utilizationwere slightly higher among continuous/extended cyclic than cyclic COC users. Propensity score matching decreased the hazard ratio estimates from 1.84 (95% CI, 1.53-2.21) to 1.32 (95% CI, 1.07-1.64) for continuous/extended use compared with cyclic COC use. The absolute risk difference (0.27 per 1000 persons) and the incidence rate difference (0.35 cases per 1000 person-years [1.44 vs 1.09 cases per 1000 person-years]) between the 2 propensity score-matched cohorts remained low, which may not translate into a clinically significant risk differences between cyclic and noncyclic estrogen use.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Holding the progestogen type constant (levonorgestrel), we observed a slightly elevated VTE risk in association with continuous/extended COC use when compared with cyclic COC use. However, due to the small absolute risk difference and potential residual confounding, our findings did not show strong evidence supporting a VTE risk difference between continuous/extended and cyclic COC use.

AB  - The conventional target detection methods in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images usually utilize the clutter information via the clutter statistical modeling. However, it is difficult to select an appropriate clutter statistical distribution model for a real SAR image. To make full use of the clutter information while avoid the clutter statistical modeling, in this paper, we propose a novel target detection method based on the dual-domain sparse reconstruction saliency in SAR images. Considering the speckle noise in SAR images, we utilize not only the intensity information in image domain but also the structure information in feature domain. First, the image-domain saliency map is constructed via the sparse reconstruction on clutter templates extracted from pure clutter SAR images in the image domain with the pixel-level intensity information as the descriptor, and the potential target templates are obtained from this saliency map. Then, the feature-domain saliency map is constructed via the sparse reconstruction on both clutter and potential target templates in the feature domain with the superpixel-level locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) of pixel-level scale invariant feature transform features as the descriptor, where the LLC can describe the spatial and structural information in superpixel level. Finally, the aforementioned two saliency maps are integrated to make our method more robust to speckle noise, and then, the winner-take-all approach is applied to detect targets from the integrated saliency map. We evaluate the proposed method on the miniSAR data and the RADARSAT-2 data. On the miniSAR data, the proposed method is at least 5% higher in terms of AUC than the other saliency methods (i.e., the Itti's method, the SR method, the SVD method, and the JDSR method), and at least 20% higher in F1-score, 22% higher in figure of merit than the Gaussian constant false alarm rate (CFAR), the Gamma-CFAR, and the aforementioned saliency methods. On the RADARSAT-2 data, the proposed method also achieves better performance than the previously compared methods.

TI  - Precipitation Retrieval Using 118.75-GHz and 183.31-GHz Channels From MWHTS on FY-3C Satellite
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the focus is on precipitation rate retrieval using 118.75 and 183.31-GHz channels from the microwave humidity and temperature sounder (MWHTS) onboard the FY-3C satellite. These channels provide not only atmospheric humidity profile measurements but they also provide temperature profile measurements. These measurements play important roles detecting and retrieving precipitation rates. Data from the MWHTS and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42 are matched in time and space. Matched datasets are used to verify precipitation detection algorithms and precipitation rate retrieval algorithms. To retrieve the precipitation rate, the multiple linear regression algorithm and back propagation (BP) neutral network algorithm are applied in the ten models proposed in this paper. After detailed retrieval analysis between these two algorithms, advanced algorithms are presented this paper to improve the accuracy of the precipitation rate retrieval. In our algorithms, the correlation coefficient of the precipitation rate over the ocean can reach 0.82, the bias is approximately 0.07 mm/hr, and the root mean square error (RMSe) is less than 0.4 mm/hr. Over land, the correlation coefficient is approximately 0.73, the bias is 0.1 mm/hr, and the RMSe is less than 0.5 mm/hr. These results show that our retrieval algorithms improve the retrieval accuracy. Moreover, we study a number of typhoons and find that the FY-3C MWHTS works well to retrieve typhoon precipitation rates. The potential sensitivities of the temperature and humidity channels are analyzed, which can improve the retrieval accuracy and lay the foundation for further research.

TI  - A mixture emissivity analysis method for urban land surface temperature retrieval from Landsat 8 data
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from satellite imagery is one of the most practical ways to consistently monitor urban thermal environment. Given the heterogeneous nature of urban landscape, an implicit assumption should be considered in remotely sensed LST determinations that a mixed urban land cover aggregation is the combination of its constituent components. Currently, the common LST retrieval method which utilize emissivity measures estimated by NDVI threshold method (NDVITHM), including mono window (MW), single channel (SC), and split window algorithms (SW), does not take into account heterogeneity of pixels. While in this study, a new approach, the mixture analysis of emissivity (MAoE), is proposed to calculate temperature by estimating pixel emissivity from mixed land cover classes. We conduct a comparison of six approaches by the combinations of three LST retrieval algorithms with NDVITHM and MAoE respectively. The differences among strategies are characterized and analyzed by comparing LST estimates from Landsat 8 thermal images. The LST gradients derived from transect analysis are found consistently similar for combinations of two LST algorithms (MW and SC) and the two emissivity estimation algorithms (MAoE and NDVITHM). LSTs derived from SW algorithms using band 10 have the highest mean values, while the SC algorithms have moderate mean values and the MW algorithms have the lowest values. Standard deviations of estimated LST from MAoE are smaller compared with NDVITHM methods, SC retrieval algorithm with MAoE has the smallest standard deviation, and NDVITHM temperature estimation could be more impacted by different land use land cover types.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Luojia 1-01 satellite, launched on 2 June 2018, provides a new data source of nighttime light at 130 m resolution and shows potential for mapping urban extent. In this paper, using Luojia 1-01 and VIIRS nighttime light imagery, we compared several methods for extracting urban areas, including Human Settlement Index (HSI), Simple Thresholding Segmentation (STS) and SVM supervised classification. According to the accuracy assessment, the HSI method using LJ1-01 data had the best performance in urban extent extraction, which presented the largest Kappa Coefficient value, 0.834, among all the results. For the urban areas extracted by VIIRS based HSI method, the largest Kappa Coefficient value was 0.772. In contrast, the largest Kappa Coefficient values obtained by STS method were 0.79 and 0.7512 respectively when using LJ1-01 and VIIRS data, while for SVM method the values were 0.7829 and 0.7486 when using Landsat-LJ and Landsat-VIIRS composite data respectively. The experimented results demonstrated that the utilization of nighttime light imagery can largely improve the accuracy of urban extent extraction and LJ1-01 data, with a higher resolution and more abundant spatial information, can lead to better identification results than its predecessors.

TI  - Learning Source-Invariant Deep Hashing Convolutional Neural Networks for Cross-Source Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the urgent demand for remote sensing big data analysis, large-scale remote sensing image retrieval (LSRSIR) attracts increasing attention from researchers. Generally, LSRSIR can he divided into two categories as follows: uni-source LSRSIR (US-LSRSIR) and cross-source LSRSIR (CS-LSRSIR). More specifically, US-LSRSIR means the inquiry remote sensing image and images in the searching data set come from the same remote sensing data source, whereas CS-LSRSIR is designed to retrieve remote sensing images with a similar content to the inquiry remote sensing image that are from a different remote sensing data source. In the literature, US-LSRSIR has been widely exploited, but CS-LSRSIR is rarely discussed. In practical situations, remote sensing images from different kinds of remote sensing data sources are continually increasing, so there is a great motivation to exploit CS-LSRSIR. Therefore, this paper focuses on CS-LSRSIR. To cope with CS-LSRSIR, this paper proposes source-invariant deep hashing convolutional neural networks (SIDHCNNs), which can be optimized in an end-to-end manner using a series of well-designed optimization constraints. To quantitatively evaluate the proposed SIDHCNNs, we construct a dual-source remote sensing image data set that contains eight typical land-cover categories and 10000 dual samples in each category. Extensive experiments show that the proposed SIDHCNNs can yield substantial improvements over several baselines involving the most recent techniques.

TI  - Preliminary assessment of 20-m surface albedo retrievals from sentinel-2A surface reflectance and MODIS/VIIRS surface anisotropy measures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based retrievals of land surface albedo at 20-m resolution are generated by coupling the surface reflectances from the recently launched Sentinel-2A satellite with surface anisotropy information (as described by Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function, BRDF) from either the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) or the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The intrinsic black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) values of the surface are derived at the six shortwave spectral bands of Sentinel-2A's Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI). A specific set of narrow-to-broadband conversion coefficients is derived from radiative transfer simulations and presented for the generation of broadband albedos. Initial evaluation uses well-calibrated ground-based albedo measurements by pyranometers mounted on the towers at seven sites of the Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD). Over those sites where pyranometer measurement footprints are not spatially representative of the landscape covered by the satellite pixels (i.e., spatially nonrepresentative) at the grid scales (500 m to 1 km) of the MODIS and VIIRS products, the finer-resolution Sentinel 2A albedos manifested a pronounced decrease in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean bias in the evaluation against the ground-based data as compared to the coarser resolution albedo products of MODIS and VIIRS. This decrease occurs because the 20-m Sentinel-2A albedo values are better able to resolve the spatial details of surface albedo within the ground-based instrument footprints than the coarser resolution sensors. This preliminary evaluation also demonstrates the consistency of the Sentinel-2A albedo results whether using the MODIS BRDF or the VIIRS BRDF products for the surface anisotropy information. The RMSEs and mean biases of the Sentinel-2A albedos over all the seven validation sites are both within the accuracy requirement of 0.05 absolute albedo units for satellite derived albedo products. This study, to generate Sentinel-2A MSI albedo with either MODIS or VIIRS BRDFs, extends previous efforts of Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI albedo and enhances the continuity of finer-resolution albedo data. Such long-term and higher resolution records of surface albedo improve the investigations into the changes and drivers of local/regional surface energy balance over heterogeneous regions and increasingly fragmented landscapes across the globe due to natural and human-induced land cover changes.

T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the potential of integrating fractal texture with spectral information on urban landscape characterization by the maximum likelihood image classifier. The fractal texture was first derived from the red band of a Landsat ETM+ image by applying the triangular prism algorithm at different window sizes. The quality of the twenty-five resultant texture bands were then analyzed by fourteen approaches at both of the pre- and post-classification stages. Results showed all evaluations employed at the pre-classification stage are useful to screen out texture bands more useful than others to facilitate the later supervised image classification. This texture information is observed useful only for classifying medium- and low- density residential categories. The window size leading to the best overall classification accuracy is identified as 31 x 31, implying this scale should be kept as a guideline for future studies if a similar methodology is adopted.

TI  - Phytoplankton size structure in the western South China Sea under the influence of a 'jet-eddy system'
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A northeastward jet in the western South China Sea (SCS) usually induces phytoplankton blooms during summertime. This jet is often sandwiched by a cyclonic eddy in the north and an anticyclonic eddy in the south. Using in situ and satellite data, the present study analyzes the combined impact of the northeastward jet and two eddies on the phytoplankton size structure (PSS) from August to September 2014. Generally, picophytoplankton is the major size fraction in surface water, contributing 73% of the total chlorophyll a concentration. The data showed that a high chlorophyll a belt (av. 0.29 +/- 0.18 mu g L-1) with a large percentage of microphytoplankton (av. 14%) appeared in the northeastward jet. Meanwhile, similar chlorophyll a concentrations were observed in the cyclonic (av. 0.072 +/- 0.019 mu g L-1) and anticyclonic eddies (av. 0.087 +/- 0.02 mu g L-1), but microphytoplankton contributed 6.7% more in the anticyclonic eddy. Below the surface, however, the dominant size of phytoplankton switched from pico to nano and micro with increasing depth. In contrast to the observations at the surface, the jet and anticyclonic eddy presented a lower microphytoplankton contribution than the cyclonic eddy. Horizontally, advection of coastal upwelling water by the northeastward jet enhanced the growth of phytoplankton and influenced the surface PSS. Meanwhile, divergence/convergence in cyclonic/anticyclonic eddy interaction with the northeastward jet formed the high chlorophyll a belt at the edge of the eddy and increased the microphytoplankton contribution through water mass transport and mixing. Nutrient supply and weakening of the light intensity below the surface layer synergistically influenced the concentration and size structure of phytoplankton in the cyclonic/anticyclonic eddies at different depths. Finally, this study proposed a jet-eddy system' to explain summer spatial characteristics of PSS in the western SCS. Source water (riverine and coastal upwelling water) that feeds the jet-eddy system' is another key factor affecting phytoplankton biomass and its size structure.

TI  - INSM1 Is More Sensitive and Interpretable than Conventional Immunohistochemical Stains Used to Diagnose Merkel Cell Carcinoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an extremely aggressive skin cancer that must be distinguished from other basaloid cutaneous neoplasms that have different treatments and prognoses. This is sometimes challenging in small shave specimens, crushed samples, lymph nodes, and core needle biopsies. Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) immunohistochemistry is a sensitive nuclear marker of neuroendocrine differentiation. INSM1 staining was performed on 56 MCC (47 primary tumors, 9 nodal metastases), 50 skin control cases that included basal cell carcinomas, basaloid squamous cell carcinomas, Bowen disease, sebaceous neoplasms, melanoma, and B-cell lymphomas, and 28 lymph node control cases that included metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, melanomas, squamous cell carcinomas, lymphomas, and adenocarcinomas. Percent of staining nuclei (0, <25%, 25% to 50%, 50% to 75%, >75%) and intensity (weak, moderate, strong) were recorded for each sample. All 56 MCC expressed INSM1. By comparison, synaptophysin, CK20, and chromogranin were expressed in 96%, 92%, and 32% of MCC, respectively. While the 3 conventional markers showed significant variability in staining intensity and distribution, INSM1 stained >75% tumor nuclei in 89% of MCC and 50% to 75% of tumor nuclei in 11%. Staining intensity was strong in 85% and moderate in 15%. None of the 50 cutaneous basaloid non-MCC neoplasms in the control group stained with INSM1, and among the lymph node controls 5 of 5 neuroendocrine neoplasms expressed INSM1, confirming that INSM1 staining cannot distinguish MCC from metastatic extracutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. INSM1 holds promise as a neuroendocrine marker that can distinguish MCC from its mimickers in the skin and improve detection of sentinel lymph node metastases.

TI  - Simulating the post-fire net primary production restoration and its affecting factors by using MTCLIM and 3PGS model in Genhe forest region, Northeast China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a major disturbance factor in Daxing' anling region, with important impacts on carbon balance of forest ecosystems. Fire severity and the distinction of microclimates induced by different topography are the primary factors driving the restoration of post-fire net primary productivity ( NPP). In this study, we examined the influence of fire severity and topographic factors on the restoration of forest NPP in the Genhe forest region. The spatial and temporal restoration process of post-fire NPP were simulated by combining with MTCLIM and 3PGS model based on multiyear Landsat TM satellite ( 2008-2012) and climate ( 1980-2010) data. The results showed that the 3PGS-MTCLIM model could precisely estimate the spatial distribution of NPP at small scales, with a good correlation between simulated and observed values (R-2 = 0.828). The percentage of declined NPP in the year following the fire ranged 43%-80%, and the average NPP recovery period for this region was about 10 years by comparing pre- and post-fire NPP. Fire severity had significant impacts on post-fire recovery. The stronger the fire intensity, the longer the recovery period was needed. The NPP recovered relatively slower after a period of fast-speed recovery. Among the three topographic factors, elevation was the strongest one affecting forest NPP restoration, followed by slope and aspect.

TI  - Urbanization effect on spatiotemporal thermal patterns and changes in Hangzhou (China)
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) shows thermal intensification in urban areas compared to surrounding areas. Land surface temperature (LST) has been widely applied in assessing UHI. However, due to limitations of the LST retrieval method, few researchers attempted to track the long-term dynamics of UHI and their responses to progressive urbanization process based on Landsat series data. In this study, we improved the retrieval method to extract the average UHI intensity of Hangzhou city core in 1990-2010, and explored the dynamics of UHI composition and configuration in response to urbanization. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was applied to calculate the average UHI intensity in the study area. Hangzhou city core was heating up in study period with extensive conversions from neutral and cool area to heated area. The expansion of heated area initially radiated from the original urban core in linear configuration, and subsequently expanded to infill areas away from the core by replacing neutral and cool area. The significant differences in average UHI intensity between different land use and land cover (LULC) types can be observed: urban land had the highest value whereas forest and water body registered the lowest. The expansion of urban land at the expense of natural land had exceeded a threshold to induce spillover of heat energy from the former to the latter. The findings can inform nature-based solutions to optimize the thermal environment and livability of fast-growing subtropical cities.

TI  - Spatial and temporal scales of chlorophyll variability using high-resolution glider data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Southern Ocean, increasing evidence from recent studies is highlighting the need for high-resolution sampling at fine spatial (meso- to sub-mesoscale) and temporal scales (intra-seasonal) in order to understand longer-term variability of phytoplankton and the controlling physical and biogeochemical processes. Here, highresolution glider data (3 hourly, 2 km horizontal resolution) and satellite ocean colour data (2-4 km) from the Sub-Antarctic zone (SAZ) were used to 1) quantify the dominant scales of variability of the glider time series, 2) determine the minimum sampling frequency required to adequately characterise the glider time series and 3) discriminate how much of the variability measured with a glider is the result of temporal variations versus spatial patchiness. Results highlight the important role of signals shorter than 10 days in characterising surface chlorophyll (chl-a) variability, particularly in spring (97%) and to a lesser degree in summer (27%). These small scales of variability were also evident in the physical indices of SST, wind stress and mixed layer depth. Further analysis revealed that sampling at high frequencies (< 10 days) are required to adequately resolve and characterise the seasonal and intra-seasonal mean state and variability of chl-a in the SAZ. Spatial analysis found that surface chl-a is patchier than surface temperature, as previously found in the North Atlantic. In addition, our seasonal analyses found that patchiness at smaller scales decreases in summer (relative to spring) indicative of a more homogeneous phytoplankton distribution. A spring comparison of the glider and concurrent satellite data at similar spatial scales suggests that the chl-a variability captured by the glider is generally larger than observed in the remote sensing images and may be driven by daily fluctuations.

TI  - Improvement of yeast activity in frozen dough by wheat gluten and amylopectin
T2  - Shengwu Jiagong Guocheng
M3  - Article
AB  - Yeast activity is crucial for the quality of frozen dough. In order to improve the yeast activity in frozen dough , frozen dough was prepared using low strength wheat flour added with different amount of water (55. 0-65. 0 g per 100 g wheat flour) ,gluten (0-5. 0 g per 100 g wheat flour) and amylopectin (0-5. 0 g per 100 g wheat flour ). The effects of water, gluten and amylopectin on yeast fermentation ability and cell growth were investigated , and the relationship between yeast fermentation ability and cell growth was discussed. Ingredient formulation for frozen dough was optimized via response surface experiments.The yeast fermentation ability of frozen dough was improved by a moderate dose of water, gluten and amylopectin. When the living cell population of yeast was 2. 0x 10(10) per 100 g wheat flour in fresh dough , it increased to a level in the range of 6. 35 x 10(10)-9. 13 x 10(10) per 100 g wheat flour after fermentation. The yeast fermentation ability of frozen dough (F-Y) increased linearly with increasing living cell population after fermentation (N-AC) ,and their relationship could be expressed by the equation F-Y = 51. 5N(AC) +272. 5.With the formulation of a water dose at 58. 7 g per 100 g wheat flour, a gluten dose at 3. 9 g per 100 g wheat flour, an amylopectin dose at 3. 6 g per 100 g wheat flour, the yeast fermentation ability of frozen dough reached a maximal value of (758 +/- 5. 8) mL, which was higher than (710 +/- 8. 4) mL of fresh dough control and (680 +/- 9. 2) mL of frozen dough control.The technical data and information provided by the present study are useful for the formulation design of frozen dough.

TI  - Scaling Effect of Fused ASTER-MODIS Land Surface Temperature in an Urban Environment
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is limited research in land surface temperatures (LST) simulation using image fusion techniques, especially studies addressing the downscaling effect of LST image fusion. LST simulation and associated downscaling effect can potentially benefit the thermal studies requiring both high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study simulated LSTs based on observed Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST imagery with Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, and investigated the downscaling effect of LST image fusion at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 250, 500, and 1000 m spatial resolutions. The study area partially covered the City of Los Angeles, California, USA, and surrounding areas. The reference images (observed ASTER and MODIS LST imagery) were acquired on 04/03/2007 and 07/01/2007, with simulated LSTs produced for 4/28/2007. Three image resampling methods (Cubic Convolution, Bilinear Interpolation, and Nearest Neighbor) were used during the downscaling and upscaling processes, and the resulting LST simulations were compared. Results indicated that the observed ASTER LST and simulated ASTER LST images (date 04/28/2007, spatial resolution 90 m) had high agreement in terms of spatial variations and basic statistics based on a comparison between the observed and simulated ASTER LST maps. Urban developed lands possessed higher LSTs with lighter tones and mountainous areas showed dark tones with lower LSTs. The Cubic Convolution and Bilinear Interpolation resampling methods yielded better results over Nearest Neighbor resampling method across the scales from 15 to 1000 m. The simulated LSTs with image fusion can be used as valuable inputs in heat related studies that require frequent LST measurements with fine spatial resolutions, e.g., seasonal movements of urban heat islands, monthly energy budget assessment, and temperature-driven epidemiology. The observation of scale-independency of the proposed image fusion method can facilitate with image selections of LST studies at various locations.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Loess Landslide Inventory Mapping with C-, X- and L-Band SAR Datasets-A Case Study of Heifangtai Loess Landslides, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique is a well-developed remote sensing tool which has been widely used in the investigation of landslides. Average deformation rates are calculated by weighted averaging (stacking) of the interferograms to detect small-scale loess landslides. Heifangtai loess terrace, Gansu province China, is taken as a test area. Aiming to generate multi-temporal landslide inventory maps and to analyze the landslide evolution features from December 2006 to November 2017, a large number of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets acquired by L-band ascending ALOS/PALSAR, L-band ascending and descending ALOS/PALSAR-2, X-band ascending and descending TerraSAR-X and C-band descending Sentinel-1A/B images covering different evolution stages of Heifangtai terrace are fully exploited. Firstly, the surface deformation of Heifangtai terrace is calculated for independent SAR data using the InSAR technique. Subsequently, InSAR-derived deformation maps, SAR intensity images and a DEM gradient map are jointly used to detect potential loess landslides by setting the appropriate thresholds. More than 40 active loess landslides are identified and mapped. The accuracy of the landslide identification results is verified by comparison with published literatures, the results of geological field surveys and remote sensing images. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the landslides during the last 11 years are revealed for the first time. Finally, strengths and limitations of different wavelength SAR data, and the effects of track direction, geometric distortions of SAR images and the differences in local incidence angle between two adjacent satellite tracks in terms of small-scale loess landslides identification, are analyzed and summarized, and some suggestions are given to guide the future identification of small-scale loess landslides with the InSAR technique.

TI  - Using a Linear Unmixing Method to Improve Passive Microwave Snow Depth Retrievals
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite microwave radiometer measurements have been used to extract snow depth information for approximately three to four decades. However, the coarse spatial resolution of satellite microwave radiobrightness observations affects the snow depth retrieval accuracy and hinders the application of snow depth data in studies on water, energy, and carbon cycles. Therefore, snow depth measurements require better spatial resolution to improve the retrieval accuracy and enhance the resolution of the data. In this paper, an improved linear unmixing method is proposed to improve the accuracy of existing methods and downscale brightness temperatures from satellite observations to improve snow depth estimates. Tests conducted on a dataset consisting of both simulated and satellite data show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The unmixing method is then applied to FengYun-3B satellite/microwave radiation imager measurements for snow depth retrievals, and the resulting snow depths are compared with weather station observations from January to February 2011. The results show that the snow depth estimated from downscaled brightness temperatures performs better than the original data and presents higher correlations and lower root mean square errors.

TI  - Time Evolution of the Cloud Response to Moisture Intrusions into the Arctic during Winter
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Northward fluxes of moisture and sensible heat into the Arctic affect the atmospheric stability, sea ice and snow cover, clouds, and surface energy budget. Intense moisture fluxes into the Arctic are called moisture intrusions; some can lead to basinwide increases in downward longwave radiation (DLR) at the surface, called downward infrared (IR) events. Using the ERA-Interim reanalysis from 1990 to 2016, this study investigated the time evolution of cloud amount and cloud properties and their impact on the surface radiation fluxes in response to Arctic moisture intrusions and downward IR events during winter for better understanding of the Arctic moisture intrusions. A composite analysis revealed several key features: moisture intrusions produce more clouds and higher cloud liquid and ice water content; positive cloud amount anomalies can persist for over 10 days over the Arctic Ocean during downward IR events; positive high-level and middle-level cloud anomalies are evident in the early stage, and positive low-level cloud anomalies are evident in the late stage. Greater clear-sky DLR and longwave cloud radiative forcing (CRF) over the Arctic Ocean accompany the greater all-sky DLR during the downward IR events. Greater clear-sky DLR can be attributed to higher air temperatures and higher total column water vapor, while greater longwave CRF is the result of larger cloud amount and cloud water content. Longwave CRF anomalies account for approximately 40% of the all-sky DLR anomalies.

TI  - Multispectral Bathymetry via Linear Unmixing of the Benthic Reflectance
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry is important to shallow coral reef management. Remote sensing is one of the most important techniques for mapping bathymetry. For instance, multispectral remote sensing images have been widely used to map bathymetry of coral reefs. These physically based methods, which are able to retrieve bathymetry, water column inherent optical properties (IOPs), and benthic reflectance simultaneously, generally can achieve good bathymetry results. However, there are strong limitations when facing the scenarios of mixing benthic reflectance for bathymetry with multispectral images. In this study, aiming at handling the mixing phenomenon on the use of multispectral remote sensing images for mapping bathymetry, we propose a new unmixing-based method, namely unmixing-based multispectral optimization process exemplar method (UMOPE). The new method incorporates endmember variability with a linear combination of three fixed endmembers and the relaxation of the sum-to-one constrained. UMOPE was validated with two existing methods with in situ data and a World View-2 image in the South China Sea. Results from in situ data show that the proposed method performs the best, with the smallest absolute root mean square error (RMSE)(2.26 m) and the best agreement (R-2 = 0.91) between the measured and estimated water depth. Moreover, results from WV-2 imagery demonstrate the superior performance for the UMOPE at depth range from about 9 to 26 m. Furthermore, since the errors from IOPs can propagate to bathymetry, we further take this issue into account by analyzing the rule of influence of bottom on IOPs. Finally, the result of benthic classification map from UMOPE is shown.

TI  - Toward a Methodology for Estimating Coastal Extreme Sea Levels From Satellite Altimetry
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work represents the first attempt to study the behavior of sea level extreme events nearshore using satellite altimetry data. A novel approach based on the application of a nonstationary extreme model to nontidal residual monthly maxima from remote data is presented. With the aim of countering the lack of accuracy, an extreme scale factor to correct satellite data is defined. The extreme scale factor depends on local morphology and its definition makes use of the information provided by 14 tide gauges along the North American East Coast. The methodology is validated using eight additional tide gauge records along the study region. Low differences on values associated to high return periods using satellite and tide gauge data input are found for all the validated locations. Besides, a regional study of the climate variability of extreme sea levels from satellite is also presented. The found climate patterns strongly agree with the historical climate variations from in situ data. Results show a great potential of this approach, especially at those locations where in situ information is not available.Plain Language Summary Despite the great development of satellite altimetry during the last decade, satellite data have not been used to undertake an analysis of sea level extreme events nearshore yet. In this context, this work represents the first attempt to do that, presenting a methodology based on the use of satellite data to generate a coastal nontidal residual extreme sample and the application of a nonstationary statistical model to study its behavior. The methodology is applied along the North American East Coast, using 14 tide gauge records to compare the outcomes. Here we found differences in the extreme distribution obtained using remote and in situ data as input. Thus, with the aim of countering the lack of accuracy, an extreme scale factor to correct the extreme distribution from satellite data is defined. The application of the extreme scale factor at eight additional tide gauges allows to significantly reduce the error obtained using satellite data. Besides, an application of this methodology which consists in developing a climate study is also presented. The proposed methodology shows a great potential for its application with predictive purposes at those locations where there is not presence of tide gauges, which implies a huge impact for a wide range of applications.

TI  - Vegetation Indices Do Not Capture Forest Cover Variation in Upland Siberian Larch Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal forests are changing in response to climate, with potentially important feedbacks to regional and global climate through altered carbon cycle and albedo dynamics. These feedback processes will be affected by vegetation changes, and feedback strengths will largely rely on the spatial extent and timing of vegetation change. Satellite remote sensing is widely used to monitor vegetation dynamics, and vegetation indices (VIs) are frequently used to characterize spatial and temporal trends in vegetation productivity. In this study we combine field observations of larch forest cover across a 25 km(2) upland landscape in northeastern Siberia with high-resolution satellite observations to determine how the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are related to forest cover. Across 46 forest stands ranging from 0% to 90% larch canopy cover, we find either no change, or declines in NDVI and EVI derived from PlanetScope CubeSat and Landsat data with increasing forest cover. In conjunction with field observations of NDVI, these results indicate that understory vegetation likely exerts a strong influence on vegetation indices in these ecosystems. This suggests that positive decadal trends in NDVI in Siberian larch forests may correspond primarily to increases in understory productivity, or even to declines in forest cover. Consequently, positive NDVI trends may be associated with declines in terrestrial carbon storage and increases in albedo, rather than increases in carbon storage and decreases in albedo that are commonly assumed. Moreover, it is also likely that important ecological changes such as large changes in forest density or variable forest regrowth after fire are not captured by long-term NDVI trends.

TI  - Evaluation of Collection-6 MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product Using Multi-Year Ground Measurements in an Arid Area of Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) products are widely used in ecology, hydrology, vegetation monitoring, and global circulation models. Compared to the collection-5 (C5) LST products, the newly released collection-6 (C6) LST products have been refined over bare soil pixels. This study aims to evaluate the C6 MODIS 1-km LST product using multi-year in situ data covering barren surfaces. Evaluation using all in situ data shows that the MODIS C6 LSTs are underestimated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.59 K for the site in the Gobi area, 3.05 K for the site in the sand desert area, and 2.86 K for the site in the desert steppe area at daytime. For nighttime LSTs, the RMSEs are 2.01 K, 2.88 K, and 1.80 K for the three sites, respectively. Both biases and RMSEs also show strong seasonal signals. Compared to the error of C5 1-km LSTs, the RMSE of C6 1-km LST product is smaller, especially for daytime LSTs, with a value of 2.24 K compared to 3.51 K. The large errors in the sand desert region are presumably due to the lack of global representativeness of the magnitude of emissivity adjustment and misclassification for the barren surface causing error in emissivities. It indicates that the accuracy of the MODIS C6 LST product might be further improved through emissivity adjustment with globally representative magnitude and accurate land cover classification. From this study, the MODIS C6 1-km LST product is recommended for applications.

TI  - Object-Based Plastic-Mulched Landcover Extraction Using Integrated Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic mulching on farmland has been increasing worldwide for decades due to its superior advantages for improving crop yields. Monitoring Plastic-Mulched Land-cover (PML) can provide essential information for making agricultural management decisions and reducing PML's eco-environmental impacts. However, mapping PML with remote sensing data is still challenging and problematic due to its complicated and mixed characteristics. In this study, a new Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach has been proposed to investigate the potential for combined use of Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) Multi-spectral data to extract PML. Based on the ESP2 tool (Estimation of Scale Parameter 2) and ED2 index (Euclidean Distance 2), the optimal Multi-Resolution Segmentation (MRS) result is chosen as the basis of following object-based classification. Spectral and backscattering features, index features and texture features from S1 and S2 are adopted in classifying PML and other land-cover types. Three machine-learning classifiers known as the-Classification and Regression Tree (CART), the Random Forest (RF) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) are carried out and compared in this study. The best classification result with an overall accuracy of 94.34% is achieved by using spectral, backscattering, index and textural information from integrated S1 and S2 data with the SVM classifier. Texture information is demonstrated to contribute positively to PML classifications with SVM and RF classifiers. PML mapping using SAR information alone has been greatly improved by the object-based approach to an overall accuracy of 87.72%. By adding SAR data into optical data, the accuracy of object-based PML classifications has also been improved by 1-3%.

TI  - Design, Optimization and Verification of a Dual Band Circular Polarization Selective Structure
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a nonresonant, dual-band circular polarization selective structure (CPSS) for satellite communication applications in the K - and K a-bands. The structure consists of multiple layers of cascaded anisotropic sheets, with printed meander lines, separated by low permittivity spacers. It reflects right-handed CP and transmits left-handed CP in the lower frequency band. In the upper frequency band, the opposite polarization selectivity is achieved. The theory of dual-band CP selectivity from cascaded anisotropic sheets is presented. The separation between the frequency bands of operation is shown to be governed by the relative rotation between subsequent layers. An optimization routine for synthesizing dual-band CPSSs from predefined design requirements is introduced, utilizing several different optimization algorithms. A simulated design is presented, which fulfills the strict requirements of insertion loss and return loss less than 0.5 dB, and axial ratio less than 0.78 dB, in the frequency bands 17.7-20.2 and 27.5-30.0 GHz. A prototype of the optimized design is fabricated and characterized experimentally both in transmission and reflection. Good agreement is observed between simulated and experimental results. This type of structure is a potential candidate for implementation in dual-band multiple spot beam systems utilizing frequency and polarization reuse schemes.

TI  - Direct Impacts of Climate Change and Indirect Impacts of Non-Climate Change on Land Surface Phenology Variation across Northern China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) is a sensitive indicator of climate change. Understanding the variation in LSP under various impacts can improve our knowledge on ecosystem dynamics and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. Over recent decades, LSP derived from remote sensing data and climate change-related variation of LSP have been widely reported at the regional and global scales. However, the smoothing methods of the vegetation index (i.e., NDVI) are diverse, and discrepancies among methods may result in different results. Additionally, LSP is affected by climate change and non-climate change simultaneously. However, few studies have focused on the isolated impacts of climate change and the impacts of non-climate change on LSP variation. In this study, four methods were applied to reconstruct the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) dataset to choose the best smoothing result to estimate LSP. Subsequently, the variation in the start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) under isolated impacts of climate change were analyzed. Furthermore, the indirect effects of isolated impacts of non-climate change were conducted based on the differences between the combined impact (the impacts of both climate change and non-climate change) and isolated impacts of climate change. Our results indicated that the Savitzky-Golay method is the best method of the four for smoothing EVI in Northern China. Additionally, SOS displayed an advanced trend under the impacts of both climate change and non-climate change (hereafter called the combined impact), isolated impacts of climate change, and isolated impacts of non-climate change, with mean values of -0.26, -0.07, and -0.17 days per year, respectively. Moreover, the trend of SOS continued after 2000, but the magnitudes of changes in SOS after 2000 were lower than those that were estimated over the last two decades of the twentieth century (previous studies). EOS showed a delayed trend under the combined impact and isolated impacts of non-climate change, with mean values of 0.41 and 0.43 days per year, respectively. However, EOS advanced with a mean value of -0.16 days per year under the isolated impacts of climate change. Furthermore, the absolute mean values of SOS and EOS trends under the isolated impacts of non-climate change were larger than that of the isolated impacts of climate change, indicating that the effect of non-climate change on LSP variation was larger than that of climate change. With regard to the relative contribution of climatic factors to the variation in SOS and EOS, the proportion of solar radiation was the largest for both SOS and EOS, followed by precipitation and temperature.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrievals in Aeolian Sand Mining Areas Using Temporal, Single-Polarization, High-Resolution SAR
T2  - FREQUENZ
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the soil moisture are a key factor in the deterioration of the ecological environment caused by mining geological disasters. In this study, which presents a case study of the arid and semi-arid aeolian sand mining area along the Inner Mongolia-Shaanxi Province boundary, a method for retrieving the soil moisture based on RADARSAT-2 SAR scattering data and Terra MODIS surface reflectance data was proposed. The retrieval of RADARSAT-2 mainly used the Alpha approximation model based on the change detection technique, a model proposed by Balenzano et al., which can effectively decouple the impact of surface vegetation and roughness on radar backscattering coefficient, when the volume scattering is not dominant. Using 12 periods of RADARSAT-2 HH polarization data in conjunction with the Alpha approximation model, a matrix equation was constructed, which contains 11 equations and 12 unknowns. To solve this underdetermined system, a bounded linear least-squares optimization was adopted. Once the unknowns were determined, the relative dielectric constant could be analytically derived and then the soil moisture could be estimated by using the dielectric mixing model and compared with the MODIS retrieval results based on the spatial feature method. Finally, the DInSAR results of RADARSAT-2 were used to investigate the effects of high-intensity underground mining activities on the surface soil moisture. The study found that the RADARSAT-2 soil moisture estimates demonstrated good consistency with the MODIS retrieval results. Among four comparison groups, the maximum correlation coefficient was 0.599, and the highest proportion of sampling points for which the absolute error was less than 3% was 55.6%. The absolute error of all of the sampling points did not exceed 10%, which demonstrates the reliability of the RADARSAT-2 retrieval results. A comparison among the 72 soil moisture values from six mining subsidence areas and corresponding non-subsidence areas in the study area in 2012 showed that 38 soil moisture values from the non-subsidence areas were higher than those from the subsidence areas. These values accounted for 53% of the total, indicating that high-intensity mining activities have a certain negative impact on the surface soil moisture, although this impact is slightly insignificant.

TI  - Can otoliths of <i>Genidens genidens</i> (Cuvier 1829) (Siluriformes: Ariidae) reveal differences in life strategies of males and females?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of the growth parameters of a species is an indispensable requirement for understanding its biology and consequently the management of its fishery. In fisheries science, calculations of longevity, mortality rates and stock-assessment models depend on the availability of growth data. Genidens genidens, one of the most common ariid species in Brazil, is a potential sentinel species for biomonitoring in Guanabara Bay, one of the country's most degraded estuarine ecosystems. The present study investigated the growth parameters of G. genidens, providing supporting information for its management. Individuals were measured, sexed, and the number of rings in the lapillus otolith counted. The periodicity in the formation of the rings was determined by the monthly ratio of the edge type. Individuals from 0 to 11.5years old were captured, including some that were older than previously reported. Our results showed that this species forms two growth rings per year, one in summer and the other in winter; the summer ring is formed one month later in males than in females, due to the period of oropharyngeal incubation of the offspring. Sexual dimorphism was also observed in the growth rate: males grow faster, and consequently reach smaller sizes than females. We can conclude that the parental care carried out by males and the high energy expenditure in forming the large oocytes by females mark the otoliths and reveal life-cycle particularities differently in each sex.

TI  - Relating Spatiotemporal Patterns of Forest Fires Burned Area and Duration to Diurnal Land Surface Temperature Anomalies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are a major source of ecosystem disturbance. Vegetation reacts to meteorological factors contributing to fire danger by reducing stomatal conductance, thus leading to an increase of canopy temperature. The latter can be detected by remote sensing measurements in the thermal infrared as a deviation of observed land surface temperature (LST) from climatological values, that is as an LST anomaly. A relationship is thus expected between LST anomalies and forest fires burned area and duration. These two characteristics are indeed controlled by a large variety of both static and dynamic factors related to topography, land cover, climate, weather (including those affecting LST) and anthropic activity. To investigate the predicting capability of remote sensing measurements, rather than constructing a comprehensive model, it would be relevant to determine whether anomalies of LST affect the probability distributions of burned area and fire duration. This research approached the outlined knowledge gap through the analysis of a dataset of forest fires in Campania (Italy) covering years 2003-2011 against estimates of LST anomaly. An LST climatology was first computed from time series of daily Aqua-MODIS LST data (product MYD11A1, collection 6) over the longest available sequence of complete annual datasets (2003-2017), through the Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) algorithm. HANTS was also used to create individual annual models of LST data, to minimize the effect of varying observation geometry and cloud contamination on LST estimates while retaining its seasonal variation. LST anomalies where thus quantified as the difference between LST annual models and LST climatology. Fire data were intersected with LST anomaly maps to associate each fire with the LST anomaly value observed at its position on the day previous to the event. Further to this step, the closest probability distribution function describing burned area and fire duration were identified against a selection of parametric models through the maximization of the Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit. Parameters of the identified distributions conditional to LST anomaly where then determined along their confidence intervals. Results show that in the study area log-transformed burned area is described by a normal distribution, whereas log-transformed fire duration is closer to a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The parameters of these distributions conditional to LST anomaly show clear trends with increasing LST anomaly; significance of this observation was verified through a likelihood ratio test. This confirmed that LST anomaly is a covariate of both burned area and fire duration. As a consequence, it was observed that conditional probabilities of extreme events appear to increase with increasing positive deviations of LST from its climatology values. This confirms the stated hypothesis that LST anomalies affect forest fires burned area and duration and highlights the informative content of time series of LST with respect to fire danger.

TI  - Incidence Angle Dependence of HH-Polarized C- and L-Band Wintertime Backscatter Over Arctic Sea Ice
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) incidence angle has a significant effect on the microwave backscatter from sea ice. This paper investigates the incidence angle dependence of C- and L-band HH-polarized microwave backscatter coefficient over Arctic first-year sea ice (FYI) and multiyear sea ice (MYI) in winter. Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array type L-band SAR (L-hand) and RADARSAT-2 (C-hand) images are used to derive ice type-specific incidence angle dependencies calculated using linear regression models. For L-hand, mean ice type-specific incidence angle dependencies for FYI and MYI are -0.21 and -0.30 dB/1 degrees, respectively; and for C-band, they are -0.22 and -0.16 dB/1 degrees, respectively. To validate our results, we calculated root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) by comparing the ice type-specific dependence from 2010 with individual dependencies from 2009 based on ice types and frequencies. The RMSD is found to be smaller than the standard deviation of ice typespecific dependencies for both frequencies. The RMSD values for the L-band incidence angle dependencies are 0.03 and 0.04 dB/1 degrees for FYI and MYI, respectively. For C-band, the RMSD values for the FYI and MYI dependencies are 0.03 and 0.01 dB/1 degrees, respectively. Subsequently, we demonstrate that after applying incidence angle normalization, the variability of C- and L-band SAR backscatter reduces and separability of ice types increase substantially.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing in Monitoring Unsustainable Wetlands: Case Study Hamun Wetland
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring wetland as one of the important parts of the global ecosystem is necessary for conservational programs. But, usually, collecting in situ data is restricted in these areas because of their remote locations, vast area and dynamic conditions. Remote sensing provides a cost effective tool to investigate hydrological patterns and the seasonal trend of changes in wetlands. In this paper, Land-use/land-cover change during water inundation period of Hamun wetland was investigated in order to determine change trend during this period. Hamun wetland is an unsustainable ecosystem, and monitoring this wetland is essential for conservation goals. This trend is critical for decision makers in order to plan the conservational scheme in all unsustainable ecosystems. To reach this objective, the land-use/land-cover maps during inundation period of Hamun were produced using Landsat 8 time series images. The results of accuracy assessment showed the classification of water and vegetation have the highest accuracy (94% and 93%, respectively). And the accuracy of plants in the water classes was the lowest (water-veg=89.9%, veg-water 1=88.8%, veg-water 2=87.6%). This means the higher misclassification is in determining the vegetation in the water. Then, the changes in the land-cover classes in relation to wetland inundation were investigated. Results of land-use/land-cover change illustrate the regions that were suitable for water birds but lost their suitability when the wetland dried out. These areas are crucial for water bird's conservation. Satellite data determined these areas with acceptable accuracy.

T2  - STUDIA GEOTECHNICA ET MECHANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to compare the prediction performances of three statistical methods, namely, information value (IV), weight of evidence (WoE) and frequency ratio (FR), for landslide susceptibility mapping (ISM) at the east of Constantine region. A detailed landslide inventory of the study area with a total of 81 landslide locations was compiled from aerial photographs, satellite images and field surveys. This landslide inventory was randomly split into a testing dataset (70%) for training the models, and the remaining (30%) was used for validation purpose. Nine landslide-related factors such as slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, distance to streams, lithology, distance to lineaments, precipitation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and stream density were used in the landslide susceptibility analyses. The inventory was adopted to analyse the spatial relationship between these landslide factors and landslide occurrences. Based on IV, WoE and FR approaches, three landslide susceptibility zonation maps were categorized, namely, "very high, high, moderate, low, and very low". The results were compared and validated by computing area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). From the statistics, it is noted that prediction scores of the FR, IV and WoE models are relatively similar with 7132%, 73.95% and 79.07%, respectively. However, the map, obtained using the WoE technique, was experienced to be more suitable for the study area. Based on the results, the produced ISM can serve as a reference for planning and decision-making regarding the general use of the land.

We named this type of prescribing legacy prescribing. Commonly prescribed drugs with legacy prescribing potential include antidepressants, bisphosphonates, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We evaluated the proportion of legacy prescribing within these drug classes.METHODS We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected data from the McMaster University Sentinel and Information Collaboration (MUSIC) Primary Care Practice Based Research Network, located in Hamilton, Ontario. All adult patients (aged 18 or older) in the MUSIC data set during 2010-2016 were included (N = 50,813). We calculated rates of legacy prescribing of antidepressants (prescription longer than 15 months), bisphosphonates (longer than 5.5 years), and PPIs (longer than 15 months).RESULTS The proportion of patients having a legacy prescription at some time during the study period was 46% (3,766 of 8,119) for antidepressants, 14% (228 of 1,592) for bisphosphonates, and 45% (2,885 of 6,414) for PPIs. Many of these patients held current prescriptions. The mean duration of prescribing for all legacy prescriptions was significantly longer than that for non-legacy prescriptions (P <.001). Concurrent legacy prescriptions for both antidepressants and PPIs was common, signaling a potential prescribing cascade.CONCLUSIONS The phenomenon of legacy prescribing appears prevalent. These data demonstrate the potential of legacy prescribing to contribute to unnecessary polypharmacy, providing an opportunity for system-level intervention in primary care with enormous potential benefit for patients.

TI  - Land degradation and restoration in the arid and semiarid zones of China: Quantified evidence and implications from satellites
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantified information on land degradation and restoration is needed to support policies for sustainable ecosystem management and socioeconomic development. The arid and semiarid zones of China (ASZC) have experienced significant land degradation, and in response to such degradation, multiple ecological projects were implemented. In this study, remote sensing was used to identify degrading areas and where the degraded areas have been restored from 1990 in this ecologically sensitive region. Specifically, we integrated datasets from the ChinaCover and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products to characterize changes in vegetation, ecosystems, and environmental conditions. The results confirmed that deforestation, desertification, grassland degradation, wetland loss, and the encroachment upon farmlands were notable in the ASZC. Agricultural activity has cultivated extensive areas of natural ecosystems (46,474 km(2)). The expansion of built-up lands in terms of national policies has destroyed large areas of natural (5,487 km(2)) and agricultural (4,138 km(2)) ecosystems and continually results in negative impacts on ecological conservation. China has restored some lands (7,732 km(2) from farmlands and 24,904 km(2) from barren lands) and improved ecosystems, as characterized by increases in the normalized different vegetation index, leaf area index, net primary productivity, and gross primary productivity values in the ASZC, especially after the implementation of many ecological projects. However, it is also necessary to document the conclusions and lessons from these projects to guide future ecological policies and projects in the context of the substantial new challenges facing the protection of this ecologically sensitive environment.

TI  - Snow-Covered Soil Temperature Retrieval in Canadian Arctic Permafrost Areas, Using a Land Surface Scheme Informed with Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-latitude areas are very sensitive to global warming, which has significant impacts on soil temperatures and associated processes governing permafrost evolution. This study aims to improve first-layer soil temperature retrievals during winter. This key surface state variable is strongly affected by snow's geophysical properties and their associated uncertainties (e.g., thermal conductivity) in land surface climate models. We used infrared MODIS land-surface temperatures (LST) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures (Tb) at 10.7 and 18.7 GHz to constrain the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), driven by meteorological reanalysis data and coupled with a simple radiative transfer model. The Tb polarization ratio (horizontal/vertical) at 10.7 GHz was selected to improve snowpack density, which is linked to the thermal conductivity representation in the model. Referencing meteorological station soil temperature measurements, we validated the approach at four different sites in the North American tundra over a period of up to 8 years. Results show that the proposed method improves simulations of the soil temperature under snow (Tg) by 64% when using remote sensing (RS) data to constrain the model, compared to model outputs without satellite data information. The root mean square error (RMSE) between measured and simulated Tg under the snow ranges from 1.8 to 3.5 K when using RS data. Improved temporal monitoring of the soil thermal state, along with changes in snow properties, will improve our understanding of the various processes governing soil biological, hydrological, and permafrost evolution.

TI  - After the fall: did coffee plants in Puerto Rico survive the 2017 hurricanes?
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017. According to initial estimates, 90% of coffee plants were destroyed. We surveyed damage to coffee plants in 81 plots throughout the coffee-growing area of west-central Puerto Rico; we used the change in the Landsat derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Delta NDVI) to estimate damage to vegetation in coffee farms. Delta NDVI values ranged from 0 to 0.36. Almost half of all plots had Delta NDVI <= 0.17 and had less than 20% damaged plants, whereas twelve plots in six municipalities were severely hit and had >= 80% plants damaged. Damage varied greatly among plots and even within plots. Probability of damage was significantly higher in sites with north- and south-facing slopes than in sites with eastand west-facing slopes. Neither minimum distance from the center of Hurricane Maria, altitude, precipitation nor maximum wind speeds were related to extent of damage. Coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) populations decreased after the hurricanes but recovered quickly. Understanding patterns of damage and their causes may help suggest ways to protect the coffee industry from future natural disasters.

TI  - A New Deep Generative Network for Unsupervised Remote Sensing Single-Image Super-Resolution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution (SR) brings an excellent opportunity to improve a wide range of different remote sensing applications. SR techniques are concerned about increasing the image resolution while providing finer spatial details than those captured by the original acquisition instrument. Therefore, SR techniques are particularly useful to cope with the increasing demand remote sensing imaging applications requiring fine spatial resolution. Even though different machine learning paradigms have been successfully applied in SR, more research is required to improve the SR process without the need of external high-resolution (HR) training examples. This paper proposes a new convolutional generator model to super-resolve low-resolution (LR) remote sensing data from an unsupervised perspective. That is, the proposed generative network is able to initially learn relationships between the LR and HR domains throughout several convolutional, downsampling, hatch normalization, and activation layers. Then, the data are symmetrically projected to the target resolution while guaranteeing a reconstruction constraint over the LR input image. An experimental comparison is conducted using 12 different unsupervised SR methods over different test images. Our experiments reveal the potential of the proposed approach to improve the resolution of remote sensing imagery.

TI  - Evolution of adjuvant treatment in endometrial cancer-no evidence and new questions?
T2  - STRAHLENTHERAPIE UND ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose For endometrial cancer (EC), clinical and pathological risk factors are taken to triage patients and estimate their prognosis. Lymph node involvement (pN+), lymphovascular space involvement (LSVI), grading, age of the patients, and T classification are internationally accepted parameters for treatment decisions.Materials and methods Studies on adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy, and chemoradiation are discussed against the background of risk stratification and clinical decision-making in early-to-advanced stage endometrial cancer. Recent publications on adjuvant treatment in high-risk disease and its implications for the patients with regard to expected oncologic benefit and treatment-related toxicity are discussed.Results Surgery is the mainstay of treatment of EC patients. Well-differentiated tumors and early disease (FIGO IA) should be followed up without further treatment. In FIGO I stage without risk factors, VBT remains the standard treatment after surgery. FIGO I, II patients with one or more risk factors (MI >= 50%, Grading[G]3, age >60 years, LVSI) benefit from external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in terms of survival. There are no data of acceptable quality demonstrating that chemotherapy is superior to radiation in locally advanced carcinomas. Therefore, even in locally advanced disease (FIGO III, IV), EBRT remains the standard of care after surgery. EBRT contributes to the very low rate of local relapses and better DFS in these patients and should not be replaced by chemotherapy only. Whether and which subgroups of patients benefit from an additional (concomitant and/or adjuvant) chemotherapy in terms of disease-free survival remains a controversial issue. The recently published PORTEC-3 trial could not create clear evidence. With a high rate of isolated tumors cells and micrometastases in the specimens, the increasing use of unvalidated sentinel concepts in endometrial cancer raises more questions with regard to indications for adjuvant treatment.Summary and perspectives In the future, integrated genomic characterization of tumors might be helpful for treatment individualization in the adjuvant setting.

T2  - ECONOMIC GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - WorldView 3 (WV3) standard 2A visible near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) data of Mountain Pass, California, were calibrated to reflectance and used to map rock types and minerals using true- and false-color composite images, band ratios, and logical operator algorithms. VNIR true-color composite (V5 = red, V3 = green, and V2 = blue) and band ratio imagery were useful for mapping Fe3+-rich Proterozoic gneiss, the Aztec Sandstone, and carbonatite rocks in the Sulphide Queen rare earth element (BEE) mine pit but were unable to map neodymium-rich rocks due to low spectral resolution at VNIR wavelengths and overlap of BEE spectral absorption features with those of Fe3+-bearing minerals.SWIR false-color composite images, band ratio grayscale images, band ratio false-color composite images, and logical operator-derived mineral maps were able to map muscovite-rich Proterozoic granitic gneiss and Jurassic hydrothermally altered granites using the Al-O-H spectral absorption feature, chlorite-epidote-rich Protercrzoic schist and Jurassic skarn deposits using the ferrous iron and Fe, Mg-O-H spectral absorption features, and calcite-rich Paleozoic limestone and dolomite-rich Paleozoic dolostone using the CO32- spectral absorption feature. In addition, logical operator algorithms were able to discriminate Fe-bearing muscovite from muscovite in the polymetallic (gold and silver) Morning Star mine, which supports previous studies that suggest Fe-bearing muscovite is closely associated with mineralization.

TI  - Optimizing a remote sensing production efficiency model for macro-scale GPP and yield estimation in agroecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data are increasingly used to provide consistent eco-physiological information over large areas through time. Production efficiency models (PEMs) estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) as a function of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, which is derived from Earth observation. GPP can be summed over the growing season and adjusted by a crop-specific harvest index to estimate yield. Although PEMs have many advantages over other crop yield models, they are not widely used, because performance is relatively poor. Here, a new PEM is presented that addresses deficiencies for macro-scale application: Production Efficiency Model Optimized for Crops (PEMOC). It was developed by optimizing functions from the literature with GPP estimated by eddy covariance flux towers in the United States. The model was evaluated using newly developed Earth observation products and county-level yield statistics for major crops. PEMOC generally performed better at the field and county level than another commonly used PEM, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP (MOD17). PEMOC and MOD17 estimates of GPP had an R-2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) over the growing season of 0.71-0.89 (9.87-17.47 g CO2 d(-1)) and 0.59-0.83 (6.86-22.20 g CO2 d(-1)) with flux tower GPP. PEMOC produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.70 (0.52), 0.60 (0.61), and 0.62 (0.59), while MOD17 produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.65 (0.57), 0.53 (0.66), and 0.65 (0.57) with corn, soybean, and winter wheat crop yield anomalies. The sample size of rice was small, so yields were compared directly. PEMOC and MOD17 produced R(2)s and RMSE of 0.53 (3.42 t h(-1)) and 0.40 (4.89 t ha(-1)). The most sizeable model improvements were seen for C-3 and C-4 crops during emergence/senescence and peak season, respectively. These improvements were attributed to C-3 and C-4 partitioning, optimized temperature and moisture constraints, and an evapotranspiration-based soil moisture index.

TI  - COTTON VEGETATION INDICES UNDER DIFFENTENT CONTROL METHODS OF RAMULARIA LEAF SPOT
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to correlate treatments using fungicides to different vegetation indices in response to effects caused by ramularia leaf spot (Ramularia areola). The experiment was carried out in the municipality of Chapadao do Sul, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in the harvest 2016/2017, and consisted of a randomized blocks design, with 17 treatments and four replications. Data were obtained from the Sequoia 4.0 passive sensor and the Green Seeker LT 200 active sensor. From the information recorded by the sensors, nine vegetation indices were generated and compared with the area under the curve of disease progression, plant height, yield, and agronomic efficiency, in 17 different treatments of fungicide products. Treatments responded differently to the product applied. The SAVI index (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), obtained from the band in the red spectral range, presented higher correlation to AACPD, agronomic efficiency, and yield. The NDVI index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) had a higher correlation to plant height and SR (simple ratio), both using the wavelength in the red spectral range.

TI  - Second molar intrusion: Continuous arch or loop mechanics?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Our aim was to compare the load systems produced by rectangular loops and continuous arch mechanics on intrusion of a maxillary second molar. Methods: An orthodontic appliance was passively bonded from second molar to second molar on a patient's model fixed to an orthodontic force tester. The second molars were extruded by 3 mm, and 2 mechanics systems were compared: beta-titanium rectangular loops and super-elastic nickel-titanium continuous arch. Vertical (Fz) and mesial (Fy) forces, and tipping moments around the buccal axis (Mx) at the tubes were collected at every 0.5 mm of deactivation. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to detect differences between mechanics. The net Mx was also estimated at the center of resistance of each molar.Results: Significant differences were found between the mechanics at the tubes, except for the Mx in the first molar, and more importantly, at the centers of resistance of the molars: Fz forces were greater in the continuous arch than in the rectangular loops, which, on the other hand, produced lower Fy forces than the continuous arch. In the second molar, net Mx was low initially and changed with deactivation. In the continuous arch, net Mx decreased from -3.6 N.mm of mesial crown tipping to clinically insignificant levels after 2 mm of deactivation. In the first molar, net Mx was lower on the rectangular loop than on the continuous arch during the first 2 mm of deactivation and became similar in the last millimeter of deactivation. Additionally, the net Mx decreased with deactivation with both mechanics. Conclusion: Both mechanics can intrude the second molars. Although the rectangular loop produced less tipping in large deflections, the continuous arch was a better approach when less intrusion was required.

TI  - Seasonal and interannual assessment of cloud cover and atmospheric constituents across the Amazon (2000-2015): Insights for remote sensing and climate analysis
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative assessment of cloud cover and atmospheric constituents improves our ability to exploit the climate feedback into the Amazon basin. In the 21st century, three droughts have already occurred in the Amazonia (e.g. 2005, 2010, 2015), inducing regional changes in the seasonal patterns of atmospheric constituents. In addition to climate, the atmospheric dynamic and attenuation properties are long-term challenges for satellite-based remote sensing of this ecosystem: high cloudiness, abundant water vapor content and biomass burning season. Therefore, while climatology analysis supports the understanding of atmospheric variability and trends, it also offers valuable insights for remote sensing applications. In this study, we evaluate the seasonal and interannual variability of cloud cover and atmospheric constituents (aerosol loading, water vapor and ozone content) over the Amazon basin, with focus on both climate analysis and remote sensing implications. We take the advantage of new atmosphere daily products at 1 km resolution derived from Multi-Angle Implementation for Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm developed for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. An intercomparison of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV) showed quantitative information with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.81. Our results show distinct regional patterns of cloud cover across the Amazon basin: northwestern region presets a persistent cloud cover ( > 80%) throughout the year, while low cloud cover (0-20%) occurs in the southern Amazon during the dry season. The cloud-free period in the southern Amazon is followed by an increase in the atmospheric burden due to fire emissions. Our results reveal that AOD records are changing in terms of area and intensity. During the 2005 and 2010 droughts, the positive AOD anomalies (delta > 0.1) occurred over 39.03% (240.3 million ha) and 27.14% (165.99 million ha) of total basin in the SON season, respectively. In contrast, the recent 2015 drought occurred towards the end of year (October through December) and these anomalies were observed over 23.72% (145 million ha) affecting areas in the central and eastern Amazon - unlike previous droughts. The water vapor presents high concentration values (4.0-5.0 g cm(-2)) in the wet season (DJF), while we observed a strong spatial gradient from northwestern to southeastern of the basin during the dry season. In addition, we also found a positive trend of water vapor content (similar to 0.3 g/cm(2)) between 2000 and 2015. The total ozone typically varies between 220 and 270 DU, and it has a seasonal change of similar to 25-35 DU from wet season to dry season caused by large emissions of ozone precursors and long-range transport. Finally, while this study contributes to climatological analysis of atmospheric constituents, the remote sensing users can also understand the regional constraints caused by atmospheric attenuation, such as high aerosol loading and cloud obstacles for surface observations.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Completion Lymph Node Dissection for Melanoma
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statementThis review critically evaluates recent trials which have challenged the practice of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for melanoma patients diagnosed with regional metastasis by positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Two trials in the last 2years, DeCOG-SLT and MSLT-II, found no significant differences in melanoma-specific survival between patients, whether they received immediate CLND or observation after positive SLNB, despite decreases in nodal recurrence achieved by dissection. These trials together disfavor routine CLND in most patients after positive SLNB. However, their conclusions are limited by study populations which overall harbored a lower burden of SLN disease. Special attention needs to be given to patients who do have higher risk disease, with SLN tumor burdens exceeding 1mm in diameter, for whom CLND may remain both prognostic and therapeutic. Current guidelines thus recommend either CLND or careful observation after positive SLNB after appropriate risk stratification of patients. While a decline in CLND is inevitable, treatment of stage III melanoma is witnessing the concurrent rise of effective adjuvant therapies. PD-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, or combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for V600E or K mutant melanoma, which were previously available to only trial patients with completely resected stage III disease, are now approved for use in patients with positive SLNB alone. Providers are better equipped than ever to treat clinically occult, regional metastatic disease with SLNB followed by adjuvant therapy for most patients, but should take steps to avoid undertreatment of high-risk patients who may proceed to disease relapse or progression.

TI  - Congenital abnormalities in calves associated with Peaton virus infection in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Peaton virus (PEAV; family Peribunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus) appears to be capable of producing congenital malformations in ruminants; however, its pathogenicity remains unknown given its relatively low incidence. We evaluated the relationship between congenital abnormalities of calves and PEAV infection by serologic, epidemiologic, pathologic, and virologic investigations using specimens from 31 malformed calves in the years 1996-2016 in Japan. Antibody testing was carried out for known teratogenic viruses, including Akabane, Aino, Chuzan, and bovine viral diarrhea viruses, in the precolostral sera of these abnormal calves, but all results were negative. However, all 31 malformed calves were positive for antibodies against PEAV. A PEAV-specific gene was amplified from central nervous system tissues from a stillborn calf delivered in April 2007, and its nucleotide sequence was identical with that of PEAV isolated from healthy sentinel cattle in September 2006. These findings indicate that PEAV can cause bovine congenital anomalies.

TI  - Incremental History of the Congenital Heart Surgeons' Society (2014-2018)
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL FOR PEDIATRIC AND CONGENITAL HEART SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of the first 41 years of the Congenital Heart Surgeons Society (CHSS) was recorded in 2015 which chronicled the metamorphosis of a small informal meeting into a mature organization with bylaws, officers, committees, funded research, the Kirklin-Ashburn Fellowship, and a vision to become the premier organization of congenital heart surgery in North America. Chief among these transformations was the implementation and development of the CHSS Data Center. Member participation, fellowship education, and significant outcomes research have been the hallmark of the CHSS. This incremental historical review highlights continued CHSS sentinel advances. Fifty-three CHSS Data Center manuscripts have been published. Citation scores (number of literature citations that each manuscript has accrued) have been collated and analyzed by cohort study. The average citation score for all manuscripts was 75.4 +/- 76.3 (range: 1-333). The Kirklin/Ashburn Fellowship continues to thrive with academic achievements and generous contributions to the endowment. The World Journal of Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery has been adopted as the official organ of the CHSS. A Past President's Dinner has been inaugurated serving as a senior advisory committee to the Executive Council. Toronto Work Weekends continue. Congenital Heart Surgeons Society growth has accrued to 159 active members and 82 institutional members. Future considerations include the size, content, and duration of the annual meeting; the potential for increased membership; and political penetrance into national cardiothoracic governing organizations regarding committee appointments, executive council representation, and education initiatives. Congenital Heart Surgeons Society has achieved numerous advances during this incremental period.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of the limitations of near-infrared imaging in detecting axillary sentinel lymph nodes in primary breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the performance of near-infrared imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) with the radioisotope (ISO) method to detect sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in breast cancer, to analyze predictive factors for negative ICG identification. The study included 122 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using the combined ISO and ICG technique for primary breast cancer. We assessed the putative association between pathologic/clinical variables and ICG failure to detect SLNs. The ISO identification rate was 96.7% and ICG identification 81.9%. Overweight patients or presence of macrometastasis in SLNB were associated with the risk of ICG failing to detect SLNs (P = 0.02).

TI  - Rapid Coastal Forest Decline in Florida's Big Bend
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems throughout the world are increasingly vulnerable to degradation as a result of accelerating sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion, more frequent and powerful extreme weather events, and anthropogenic impacts. Hardwood swamp forests in the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast (USA) are largely devoid of the latter, but have degraded rapidly since the turn of the 21st Century. Photographs of the forest, collected on the ground since 2009, were used to guide an analysis of a 60 km(2) study area using satellite images. The images confirm that the coastal forest area declined 0.60% from 1982 to 2003, but degraded rapidly, by 7.44%, from 2010 to 2017. The forest declined most rapidly along waterways and at the coastal marsh-forest boundary. Additional time series of aerial-photographs corroborated the onset of degradation in 2010. Degradation continued through 2017 with no apparent recovery. Previous research from the area has concluded that increased tidal flooding and saltwater intrusion, of the coastal plain, represent a chronic stress driving coastal forest decline in this region, but these drivers do not explain the abrupt acceleration in forest die-off. Local tide gage data indicate that sea-level rise is 2 mm yr(-1) and accelerating, while meteorological data reveal at least two short-term cold snap events, with extreme temperatures exceeding the reported temperature threshold of local vegetation (-10 degrees C) between January 2010 and January 2011, followed by more extremes in 2016. The Big Bend hardwood forest experienced acute cold snap stress during the 2010-2017 period, of a magnitude not experienced in the previous 20 years, that compounded the chronic stress associated with sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. This and other coastal forests can be expected to suffer further widespread and lasting degradation as these stresses are likely to be sustained.

TI  - Multidisciplinary treatment strategies in high-risk resectable melanoma: Role of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Stage III melanoma encompasses a range of disease burdens, including microscopic foci of metastatic melanoma in a sentinel lymph node; bulky, clinically detected lymphadenopathy; and in-transit dermal metastases. After initial surgical management, patients with stage III melanoma at highest risk for recurrence are most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. Novel therapies that have improved the disease response rates and long-term survival of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma have now been evaluated in the adjuvant setting, with the goal of eliminating residual microscopic disease to improve relapse-free and overall survival. Alternatively, implementing systemic therapies in the neoadjuvant setting for bulky, clinically detected disease can potentially limit surgical morbidity and improve understanding of an individual's response to applied therapy. With multiple therapeutic approaches currently under evaluation for adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of high-risk melanoma, establishing optimal treatment regimens, appropriate clinical endpoints, and treatment risk-benefit profiles has become increasingly challenging. There is also a critical need to identify and validate biomarkers predictive of melanoma patient outcomes or treatment efficacy. This article provides an overview of current clinical evidence and ongoing trials of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in this rapidly evolving area of oncology.

TI  - Effects of the 2016 February minor sudden stratospheric warming on the MLT and ionosphere over Eastern Siberia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the results of studying the behavior of parameters of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) and the ionosphere over the Eastern Siberia region during a minor winter sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in early February 2016. We used the data from spectrometric measurements of OH ((6-2), 834.0 nm, similar to 87 km) and O-2 At ((0-1), 864.5 nm, similar to 94 kin), emissions from the Geophysical Observatory at the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (51.8 degrees N, 103.1 degrees E, Tory). These emissions originate at the MLT heights. We also used the vertical sounding data on the peak electron density (NmF2), and on the peak height (hmF2). These data were obtained with the DPS-4 Irkutsk ionosonde (52.3 degrees N, 104.3 degrees E). For the analysis, we also involved the MIS Aura satellite data of measuring vertical temperature profiles and the MERRA reanalysis data.We found the MLT and ionospheric signatures for the 2016 February SSW. At the MLT heights, the OH and O-2 emissions intensities increased by a factor of similar to 2 and similar to 3, respectively, and the temperature fell by similar to 20 K. Analyzing the mesopause temperature variability and comparing the mean seasonal values showed an essential increase in the wave activity at the MLT. At the F2-region ionospheric heights, we revealed significant (up to similar to 80%) NmF2 positive disturbances in the postmidnight hours and an essential increase (up to similar to 2 times relative to root-mean-square values) in the amplitudes of the tidal component of the NmF2 disturbance. The results of the study show that a minor SSW may significantly impact the state of the MLT and the ionosphere at midlatitudes.

TI  - Multispectral-Fluorescence Imaging as a Tool to Separate Healthy from Disease-Related Lymphatic Anatomy During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - To reduce the invasive nature of extended pelvic lymph node (LN) dissections in prostate cancer, we have developed a multispectral-fluorescence guidance approach that enables discrimination between prostate-draining LNs and lower-limb-draining LNs. Methods: In 5 pigs, multispectral-fluorescence guidance was used on da Vinci Si and da Vinci Xi robots. The animals received fluorescein into the lower limb and indocyanine green-nanocolloid into the prostate. Results: Fluorescein was detected in 29 LNs (average of 3.6 LNs/template), and indocyanine green-nanocolloid was detected in 12 LNs (average of 1.2 LNs/template). Signal intensities appeared equal for both dyes, and no visual overlap in lymphatic drainage patterns was observed. Furthermore, fluorescein supported both the identification of leakage from damaged lymphatic structures and the identification of ureters. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the differences in lymphatic flow pattern between the prostate and lower limbs could be intraoperatively distinguished using multispectral- fluorescence imaging.

TI  - Strategic Significance of English in Self-Education of the Students of Socio-humanitarian Specialities for Fundamentalization of University Education
T2  - MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the English language significance in self-education of the students of socio-humanitarian specialities for fundamentalization of university education. The aim of the article is to track and validate the influence of the English language knowledge on the effectiveness of self-education of a future specialist in the process of fundamentalization of academic learning. Combination of self-education with a high level of knowledge of English for fundamentalization of education at a high school allows students to successfully implement their expertise both in the changing conditions of the modern world and in future professional activities. Our hypothesis that self-education contributes to formation of students' scientific worldview on the basis of critical analysis of contemporary English scientific literature was verified by the experiment which was conducted in November 2017 in the form of a sociological survey of the first year students specializing in "Social Work" on the basis of the Ternopil National Economic University (30 people) and the Ternopil National Pedagogical University (14 people) who studied English at the secondary school. The analysis of the respondents' answers confirmed students' persuasion that reading of professional foreign literature in English would allow to get access to contemporary international scientific achievements in the field of future professional activity, and thus to acquire comprehensive knowledge. The final results of the study convincingly prove that students of both universities read foreign-language professional literature in order to familiarize themselves with modern world achievements in the field of social and human sciences (33.4% of respondents (6 people) in each the group). English is also used for finding useful information to expand own professional outlook (50% of respondents in each group (9 people)). It is concluded that teachers need to direct the educational motivation of students to expand their vocational thinking, as a significant part of respondents are aware of the prospects that knowledge of English may open in acquiring professionally significant information.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Chlorophyll-A in Case II Waters: A Novel Approach With Improved Accuracy Over Widely Implemented Turbid Water Indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new semianalytical algorithm was formulated to retrieve chlorophyll-a (CHL) in optically complex waters using in situ data set of coastal waters of eastern Arabian Sea. The algorithm was derived using CHL index of the form, x = (R-rs((1))(-1)-R-rs((2))(-1)) x R-rs((3)). The first wavelength ((1)) represents the secondary peak of CHL, while the second wavelength ((2)) and third wavelength ((3)) were delineated using a radiative transfer model and partial derivative analysis of hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, respectively. Further iteration of three wavelengths between 600 and 700 nm resulted in a two-wavelength index, x = (R-rs((1))(-1)-R-rs((2))(-1)) x R-rs((2)). This was further regressed with CHL data initially used for three wavelength index. The final form of algorithm, Goa University Case II (GUC2), c(MCHL)=113.112x(3)-58.408x(2)+8.669x - 0.0384, was validated with in situ CHL ranging between 0.11 and 25.56 g/L, resulted in a strong correlation r(2) = 0.99, RMSE = 0.30, and bias = 0.03. A comparison with NIR-Red two-band, three-band, four-band, synthetic chlorophyll index, and normalized difference chlorophyll index pointed to the nonsuitability of turbid water indices in different water types of the study area. For the first time, a CHL algorithm has been tested successfully in water types outside the region of its formulation. A pixel-to-pixel validation of GUC2-derived MERIS CHL with NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset and Satellite Coastal and Oceanography Research data set resulted in correlation, bias, and RMSE of 0.90, -0.0013, and 1.2499, respectively. Furthermore, GUC2 was successfully tested in Chesapeake Bay for accurate retrieval of CHL from stations with varying turbidity levels.Plain Language Summary Chlorophyll-a (CHL) in coastal and inland water bodies is an index of productivity and has huge implications for identifying fishing zones, eutrophication, hypoxia, and climate change studies. Although, spatiotemporal coverage of Earth via optical remote sensors have long been available, a method to accurately generate CHL in a wide variety of coastal and inland water types (areas prone to human interaction) for a synoptic analysis was desiderated. To address this concern, a new method (an optical algorithm) is developed that when applied to remotely sensed data produced accurate results when compared with widely used indices. The accurate monitoring of CHL is a boost to local fisherman in identifying region of high fishery resources, which enable better catch with less economy and efforts. Thus, this paper depicts the application of space technology to the livelihood of common man.

TI  - Total Water Storage in Small Islands Using Multi-satellite Products: The case of Cyprus
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's longest international undersea water pipeline has recently been laid from southern Turkey to Northern Cyprus to address the water scarcity problems in the Cyprus Island. When completed, the project will add 19.8 million gallons of water annually for drinking and irrigation. Moreover, it will spur further development in the Turkish area divided from Greek community for four decades. Under such circumstances, satellite remote sensing provides a unique tool to evaluate the water policy for the entire island. The objective of this study is, therefore, to examine the potential of satellite-based remote sensing hydrologic models covering a small-scale Mediterranean island, which is under drought conditions. Satellite-based measurements such as GRACE (total water storage), TRMM (precipitation) and MODIS (evapotranspiration) data over a 1 degrees-1 degrees grid together with related information from global hydrological model, specifically WGHM and GLDAS, were collected for this purpose.

TI  - Absolute Calibration of the European Sentinel-3A Surface Topography Mission over the Permanent Facility for Altimetry Calibration in west Crete, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents calibration results for the altimeter of Sentinel-3A Surface Topography Mission as determined at the Permanent Facility for Altimetry Calibration in west Crete, Greece. The facility has been providing calibration services for more than 15 years for all past (i.e., Envisat, Jason-1, Jason-2, SARAL/AltiKa, HY-2A) and current (i.e., Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B, Jason-3) satellite altimeters. The groundtrack of the Pass No.14 of Sentinel-3A ascends west of the Gavdos island and continues north to the transponder site on the mountains of west Crete. This pass has been calibrated using three independent techniques activated at various sites in the region: (1) the transponder approach for its range bias, (2) the sea-surface method for the estimation of altimeter bias for its sea-surface heights, and (c) the cross-over analysis for inspecting height observations with respect to Jason-3. The other Pass No.335 of Sentinel-3A descends from southwest of Crete to south and intersects the Gavdos calibration site. Additionally, calibration values for this descending pass are presented, applying sea-surface calibration and crossover analysis. An uncertainty analysis for the altimeter biases derived by the transponder and by sea-surface calibrations is also introduced following the new standard of Fiducial Reference Measurements.

TI  - Quality of primary palliative care for older people with mild and severe dementia: an international mortality follow-back study using quality indicators
T2  - AGE AND AGEING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: measuring the quality of primary palliative care for older people with dementia in different countries is important to identify areas where improvements can be made.Objective: using quality indicators (QIs), we systematically investigated the overall quality of primary palliative care for older people with dementia in three different countries.Design/setting: a mortality follow-back survey through nation-and region-wide representative Sentinel Networks of General Practitioners (GPs) in Belgium, Italy and Spain. GPs registered all patient deaths in their practice. We applied a set of nine QIs developed through literature review and expert consensus. Subjects: patients aged 65 or older, who died non-suddenly with mild or severe dementia as judged by GPs (n = 874).Results: findings showed significantly different QI scores between Belgium and Italy for regular pain measurement (mild dementia: BE = 44%, IT = 12%, SP = 50% | severe dementia: BE = 41%, IT = 9%, SP = 47%), acceptance of approaching death (mild: BE = 59%, IT = 48%, SP = 33% | severe: BE = 41%, IT = 21%, SP = 20%), patient-GP communication about illness (mild: BE = 42%, IT = 6%, SP = 20%) and involvement of specialised palliative services (mild: BE = 60%, IT = 20%, SP = 77%). The scores in Belgium differed from Italy and Spain for patient-GP communication about medical treatments (mild: BE = 34%, IT = 12%, SP = 4%) and repeated multidisciplinary consultations (mild: BE = 39%, IT = 5%, SP = 8% | severe: BE = 36%, IT = 10%, SP = 8%). The scores for relative-GP communication, patient death outside hospitals and bereavement counselling did not differ between countries.Conclusion: while the countries studied differed considerably in the overall quality of primary palliative care, they have similarities in room for improvement, in particular, pain measurement and prevention of avoidable hospitalisations.

TI  - Management Decisions Made by Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners in Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma Patients: Impact of a 31-Gene Expression Profile Test
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance: The 31 gene-expression profiling test (31-GEP) has been shown to provide useful prognostic information in patients with cutaneous melanoma. The test dichotomizes patients into lower risk (Class 1) or higher risk (Class 2) for melanoma metastasis. Previous studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of the test in impacting dermatologists' management decisions. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners (PA/NPs) account for a significant portion of dermatologic providers. The impact of a 31-GEP assay on clinical management has not been evaluated in this group.Objective: To determine the impact of 31-GEP test results on management decisions made by dermatology PA/NPs for cutaneous melanoma patients.Design, Setting, and Participants: 164 PA/NPs attending a national dermatology conference completed an online survey designed to determine the impact of 31-GEP test results on management decisions in a variety of clinical situations. Participants answered a series of questions related to six melanoma patient vignettes, each featuring different patient and lesion characteristics.Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of PA/NPs who would recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx) or further imaging for each patient vignette (without 31-GEP results, with a lower risk result, or with a higher risk result). The effect of the test results on the follow-up intervals recommended by PA/NPs was also examined.Results: In the majority of cases, a lower risk 31-GEP test result led to a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of PA/NPs who would recommend SLNBx, imaging, or quarterly follow-up. Conversely, a higher risk 31-GEP result significantly altered management toward increased intensity (more recommendations for SLNBx, imaging, or quarterly follow-up) in all cases.Conclusions and Relevance: The results of a 31-GEP test appear to significantly impact management decisions made by dermatology PA/NPs regarding SLNBx, acquisition of imaging, and follow-up for patients with cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Species-Level Vegetation Mapping in a Himalayan Treeline Ecotone Using Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding ecological patterns and response to climate change requires unbiased data on species distribution. This can be challenging, especially in biodiverse but extreme environments like the Himalaya. This study presents the results of the first ever application of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery for species-level mapping of vegetation in the Himalaya following a hierarchical Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) method. The first level of classification separated green vegetated objects from the rest with overall accuracy of 95%. At the second level, seven cover types were identified (including four woody vegetation species). For this, the suitability of various spectral, shape and textural features were tested for classifying them using an ensemble decision tree algorithm. Spectral features alone yielded similar to 70% accuracy (kappa 0.66) whereas adding textural and shape features marginally improved the accuracy (73%) but at the cost of a substantial increase in processing time. Contrast in plant morphological traits was the key to distinguishing nearby stands as different species. Hence, broad-leaved versus fine needle leaved vegetation were mapped more accurately than structurally similar classes such as Rhododendron anthopogon versus non-photosynthetic vegetation. Results highlight the potential and limitations of the suggested UAS-GEOBIA approach for detailed mapping of plant communities and suggests future research directions.

TI  - 3-D magnetic inversion and satellite imagery for the Um Salatit gold occurrence, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Um Salatit is a gold occurrence situated in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt. The studied area is characterized by an intensive imbrication zone of serpentinites and metavolcanic rocks. The integrated use of aeromagnetic and spectral reflectance remote sensing data has proved effective for mapping geology related to ore deposits. Spectral reflectance maps have been produced to discriminate various rocks, such as serpentinites, gabbros, and metavolcanic rocks. 3-D inversion of aeromagnetic data acquired over the Um Salatit study area produced a 3-D magnetic susceptibility model showing magnetic bodies surrounded by less magnetic host rock. The magnetic features are elongated ENE-WSW parallel to the major thrust fault and mapped the Um Salatit serpentinized rocks. Remote sensing data allow investigating surficial geological features and mapping the mineralized areas. Remote results, in conjunction with 3-D inversion of aeromagnetic data, demonstrate that gold occurrence in the study area was effectively restricted to the highly magnetic zone interpreted as host rocks.

TI  - Change detection for Lake Burullus, Egypt using remote sensing and GIS approaches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Burullus is the second largest natural coastal lake in Egypt. It has an economic importance for fish yield. However, several anthropogenic activities such as industrial, agriculture, and reclamation activities lead to a deterioration of its water quality and a decrease of the water body area of the lake. This study aims to detect the spatiotemporal changes of Lake Burullus in the period 1972-2015 using 12 Landsat {(1,3-MSS), (4,5-TM), and (7-ETM+)} imageries and water indices approach. To extract water feature from imageries, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Water Ratio Index (WRI) were applied. The NDWI was applied to the MSS imageries. For other TM and ETM+ imageries, the WRI was applied. Obtained results show a significant decrease in the water area of the Lake Burullus, where it lost about (49%) of its surface area during the period from the year 1972 to the year 2015. A rapid decrease in the lake surface area was noticed through the period from 1972 to 1984. A prediction model was built depending on the calculated water area of the lake. Finally, the multi-temporal maps of the lake surface area are overlaid to produce a map for the changes of the lake surface area using Geographic Information System (GIS).

TI  - Assessing flood inundation mapping through estimated discharge using GIS and HEC-RAS model
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water discharge is the main parameter in hydraulic modeling for flood hazard assessment. However, the unavailability of data on discharge and observed river morphologies resulted in erroneous calculations and irregularities in flood inundation mapping. The objectives of this study are (i) to investigate uncertainties of hydraulic parameters (width, cross-sectional depth, and channel slope) used in discharge equation and (ii) to examine the influence of estimate discharge on water extent and flood depth with different boundary conditions on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) and modified IFSAR DEMs. Sensitivity analysis was conducted with the Monte Carlo simulation method to generate random data combinations. Bjerklie's equation was used to calculate discharge based on the three variables, and Manning's n was substituted into the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model. TerraSAR-X was used to distinguish existing flood water bodies and normal water extent. The uncertainty of the combined variables was assessed with the likelihood measures such as F-statistic, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency which compares observed and predicted inundated area as well as flood water depth simulated using the HEC-RAS model.

TI  - Review of the Use of Remote Sensing for Monitoring Wildfire Risk Conditions to Support Fire Risk Assessment in Protected Areas
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Fire risk assessment is one of the most important components in the management of fire that offers the framework for monitoring fire risk conditions. Whilst monitoring fire risk conditions commonly revolved around field data, Remote Sensing (RS) plays key role in quantifying and monitoring fire risk indicators. This study presents a review of remote sensing data and techniques for fire risk monitoring and assessment with a particular emphasis on its implications for wildfire risk mapping in protected areas. Firstly, we concentrate on RS derived variables employed to monitor fire risk conditions for fire risk assessment. Thereafter, an evaluation of the prominent RS platforms such as Broadband, Hyperspectral and Active sensors that have been utilized for wildfire risk assessment. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness in obtaining information that has operational use or immediate potentials for operational application in protected areas (PAs). RS techniques that involve extraction of landscape information from imagery were summarised. The review concludes that in practice, fire risk assessment that consider all variables/indicators that influence fire risk is impossible to establish, however it is imperative to incorporate indicators or variables of very high heterogeneous and "multi-sensoral or multivariate fire risk index approach for fire risk assessment in PA.

TI  - Coherent Change Detection for Multipass SAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the detection, from a stack of repeated-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, of such changes causing a target to completely lose the correlation between one epoch and another. This can he the consequence of human activities, such as construction, destruction, and agricultural activities, and also be the consequence of hazards, such as earthquake, landslides, or flooding, to buildings or terrains. The millimetric sensitivity of SAR makes it valuable for detecting such changes. This paper approaches two coherent change detection methods: a space coherent, time incoherent one and a full space and time coherent one, both based on the generalized likelihood ratiob (LR) test. A preliminary validation of the method is provided by processing two Sentinel-1 data stacks of 2016 Central Italy earthquake and by comparing the results with the map of damaged buildings in Amatrice and Accumoli made by Copernicus Emergency Management Service.

TI  - Aridity Induces Nonlinear Effects of Human Disturbance on Precipitation-Use Efficiency of Iberian Woodlands
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of ecosystem degradation are pervasive worldwide and increasingly concerning under the present context of global changes in climate and land use. Theoretical studies and empirical evidence increasingly suggest that drylands are particularly prone to develop nonlinear functional changes in response to climate variations and human disturbance. Precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) represents the ratio of vegetation production to precipitation and provides a tool for evaluating human and climate impacts on landscape functionality. Holm oak (Quercus ilex) woodlands are one of the most conspicuous dry forest ecosystems in the western Mediterranean basin and present a variety of degraded states, due to their long history of human use. We studied the response of Iberian holm oak woodlands to human disturbance along an aridity gradient (that is, semi-arid, dry-transition and sub-humid conditions) using PUE estimations from enhanced vegetation index (EVI) observations of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Our results indicated that PUE decreased linearly with disturbance intensity in sub-humid holm oak woodlands, but showed accelerated, nonlinear reductions with increased disturbance intensity in semi-arid and dry-transition holm oak sites. The impact of disturbance on PUE was larger for dry years than for wet years, and these differences increased with aridity from sub-humid to dry-transition and semi-arid holm oak woodlands. Therefore, aridity may also interact with ecosystem degradation in holm oak woodlands by reducing the landscape ability to buffer large changes in vegetation production caused by climate variability.

TI  - Surgeon Attitudes Toward the Omission of Axillary Dissection in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 study demonstrated the safety of sentinel node biopsy alone in clinically node-negative women with metastases in 1 or 2 sentinel nodes treated with breast conservation. Little is known about surgeon perspectives regarding when axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be omitted.OBJECTIVES To determine surgeon acceptance of ACOSOG Z0011 findings, identify characteristics associated with acceptance of ACOSOG Z0011 results, and examine the association between acceptance of the Society of Surgical Oncology and American Society for Radiation Oncology negative margin of no ink on tumor and surgeon preference for ALND.DESIGN, SETTING. AND PARTICIPANTS A survey was sent to 488 surgeons treating a population-based sample of women with early-stage breast cancer (N = 5080). The study was conducted from July 1. 2013, to August 31, 2015.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Surgeons were categorized as having low, intermediate, or high propensity for ALND according to the outer quartiles of ALND scale distribution. A multivariable linear regression model was used to confirm independent associations.RESULTS Of the 488 surgeons invited to participate, 376 (77.0%) responded and 359 provided complete information regarding propensity for ALND derived from 5 clinical scenarios. Mean surgeon age was 53.7 (range, 31-80) years; 277 (73.7%) were male; 142 (37.8%) treated 20 or fewer breast cancers annually and 108 (28.7%) treated more than 50. One hundred seventy-five (49.0%) recommended ALND for 1 macrometastasis. Of low-propensity surgeons who recommended ALND, only 1(1.1%) approved ALND for any nodal metastases compared with 69 (38.6%) and 85 (95.5%) of selective and high-propensity surgeons (P < .001), respectively. In multivariable analysis, lower ALND propensity was significantly associated with higher breast cancer volume (21-50: -0.19; 95% CI, -0.39 to 0.02; >51: -0.48; 95% CI, -0.71 to -0.24; P < .001), recommendation of a minimal margin width (1-5 mm: -0.10; 95% CI, -0.43 to 0.22; no ink on tumor: -0.53; 95% CI, -0.82 to -0.24; P < .001), participation in a multidisciplinary tumor board (1%-9%: -0.25; 95% CI, -0.55 to 0.05; >9%: -0.37; 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.11; P = .02), and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results site (-0.18; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01; P = .04).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study shows substantial variation in surgeon acceptance of more limited surgery for breast cancer, which is associated with higher breast cancer volume and multidisciplinary interactions, suggesting the potential for overtreatment of many patients and the need for education targeting lower-volume breast surgeons.

TI  - GEOGRAPHY OF PLANTS IN THE NEW WORLD: HUMBOLDT'S RELEVANCE IN THE AGE OF BIG DATA
T2  - ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant geography seeks to describe the patterns of species distributions and understand the underlying mechanisms. The foundation of the field is attributed to Alexander von Humboldt following the broad-scale insights he gained on his explorations of the New World two centuries ago. Today, in the age of "Big Data," advances in methods and data availability allow us to better assess the complex drivers of species distributions. In this essay, we give an overview of the relevant legacy of Humboldt in the field of plant geography. Comparing the foremost insights and approaches of Humboldt's time and of today, we highlight areas in which major changes have taken place and areas in which Humboldt's approach is still relevant. We present advances in the description and understanding of plant geography, which have changed our entire worldview to a much more dynamic one. Further, we present some of the outstanding challenges of the field, and how solving them requires going back to the "Humboldtian" approach to science, i.e., combining precise, quantitative empirical studies with a holistic approach. Finally, we discuss how our recognition of the planetary impact of humans in the Anthropocene means that much of our research is no longer exclusively driven by curiosity, but also by the societal need to make predictions of ecosystem responses to environmental change. There is thus a strong need for combining quantitative empiricism with a holistic perspective to address the complex challenges of the current epoch.

TI  - Arctic-Wide Sea Ice Thickness Estimates From Combining Satellite Remote Sensing Data and a Dynamic Ice-Ocean Model with Data Assimilation During the CryoSat-2 Period
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting the complementary character of CryoSat-2 and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite sea ice thickness products, daily Arctic sea ice thickness estimates from October 2010 to December 2016 are generated by an Arctic regional ice-ocean model with satellite thickness assimilated. The assimilation is performed by a Local Error Subspace Transform Kalman filter coded in the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework. The new estimates can be generally thought of as combined model and satellite thickness (CMST). It combines the skill of satellite thickness assimilation in the freezing season with the model skill in the melting season, when neither CryoSat-2 nor Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity sea ice thickness is available. Comparisons with in situ observations from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project, Ice Mass Balance Buoys, and the NASA Operation IceBridge demonstrate that CMST reproduces most of the observed temporal and spatial variations. Results also show that CMST compares favorably to the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System product and even appears to correct known thickness biases in the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. Due to imperfect parameterizations in the sea ice model and satellite thickness retrievals, CMST does not reproduce the heavily deformed and ridged sea ice along the northern coast of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Greenland. With the new Arctic sea ice thickness estimates sea ice volume changes in recent years can be further assessed.Plain Language Summary Sea ice plays a crucial role in climate changes; however, sea ice thickness is difficult to measure directly from space. The novel satellite thickness products from CryoSat-2 and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity have complementary characters, which facilitate the assimilation into the model to generate a new Arctic thickness record in this study. Also, benefitting from the model dynamics and sea ice concentration assimilation, the new data can further cover the melting seasons when satellite thickness data are unavailable. Compared to the in situ observations, the new thickness data show some advantages over the statistically merged satellite product CS2SMOS and Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System thickness product.

TI  - Extraction of low cost houses from a high spatial resolution satellite imagery using Canny edge detection filter
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its democratic dispensation in 1994, the South African government enacted a number of legislative and policy interventions aimed at availing equal housing opportunities to the previously marginalized citizens. Mismanagement and unreliable reporting has been widely reported in publicly funded housing programmes which necessitated the government to audit and monitor housing development projects in municipalities using more robust and independent methodologies. The objective of this study was therefore to test and demonstrate the effectiveness of high spatial resolution satellite imagery in validating the presence of government funded houses using an object-oriented classification technique that applies a Canny edge detection filter. The results of this study demonstrate that object-orientated classification applied on pan-sharpened SPOT 6 satellite imagery can be used to conduct a reliable inventory and validate the number of houses. The application of the multi-resolution segmentation and Canny edge detection filtering technique proved to be an effective means of mapping individual houses as shown by the high detection accuracy of 99% and quality percentage of 96%.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of English Idioms Translation Into Russian In Mass Media
T2  - MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The work is devoted to the comparative analysis of English phraseological unit translation into Russian in the mass media and presented in student graduate work. Phraseological units play a special role in a worldview creation. They analyzed the features of journalistic texts and the methods of English phraseological unit translation and reproduction. They indicated the trends of these means and methods practical application. In this paper, the translation of English phraseological units into Russian is considered in the media as a special type of translation activity, the main types of translation are analyzed, the characteristics of phraseological unit translation are described. The system approach is applied: The semantic structure of PU is represented as a microsystem, all elements of which are in close connection and interact with each other. The translation of a newspaper-publicistic style is characterized by certain specific features that the translator must take into account during translation. The use of idioms in headlines helps to attract the reader's attention and interest him without revealing the content of the article text. The study revealed that translators apply the methods of English phraseological unit translation most often using the equivalent in their native language, descriptive translation, replacement and permutation methods, and tracing. The reliability of the research results is based on the sample analysis of English idioms. The work contributes to the development of translation theory.

TI  - FCM Approach of Similarity and Dissimilarity Measures with α-Cut for Handling Mixed Pixels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) classifier has been studied with 12 similarity and dissimilarity measures: Manhattan distance, chessboard distance, Bray-Curtis distance, Canberra, Cosine distance, correlation distance, mean absolute difference, median absolute difference, Euclidean, Mahalanobis, diagonal Mahalanobis and normalised squared Euclidean distance. Both single and composite modes were used with a varying weight constant (m*) and also at different -cuts. The two best single measures obtained were combined to study the effect of composite measures on the datasets used. An image-to-image accuracy check was conducted to assess the accuracy of the classified images. Fuzzy error matrix (FERM) was applied to measure the accuracy assessment outcomes for a Landsat-8 dataset with respect to the Formosat-2 dataset. To conclude, FCM classifier with Cosine measure performed better than the conventional Euclidean measure. But, due to the incapability of the FCM classifier to handle noise properly, the classification accuracy was around 75%.

AB  - Terrestrial water storage (TWS), a sum total of water stored on or beneath the earth's surface, transits in response to hydroclimatic processes such as precipitation, evapo-transpiration, runoff etc. and serves an indicator of hydrological condition of a region. We analyse spatio-temporal variance of water storage in Krishna Basin, India, derived from in-situ groundwater data and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data in order to determine physical causes of variations, and compare the variance with climatic factors such as Cumulative Rainfall Departure (CRD) and drought index i.e. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). GRACE satellite based TWS is found to reflect insitu groundwater changes and also shows a relationship with drought patterns as indicated by a good correlation with SPI. The largest part of TWS represents seasonal flux, and at an interannual scale, TWS depicts spatio-temporal variability in response to drought index viz. SPI. We infer that the groundwater storage derived from GRACE time-variable gravity solutions can be utilised to complement in-situ observations at basin scale and it reflects climatic forcing quite well.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of leaf characteristics on spectral signatures of savannah woody species on remotely sensed imagery
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody species on savannahs provide nutrition to wildlife and livestock ungulates. Understanding of woody leaf reflectance would benefit the application of remote sensing in analysis of these rangelands. This study sought to establish the influence of the leaf characteristics of size (leaf form) and chlorophyll content on the spectral reflectance characteristics of savannah woody species. The ability of optical remotely-sensed imagery to identify these two leaf characteristics and use them to determine the woody content of savannahs was then assessed. Two species that represented narrow leaf and broad leaf savannah woody species were studied: Acacia tortilis (renamed Vachellia tortilis) and Ziziphus mucronata, respectively. Forty seven woody individuals representing these species were sampled in north-western South Africa. Chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI) and spectral reflectance were determined in-situ using a chlorophyll meter, a canopy analyser and spectroradiometer, respectively. A SPOT 6 NAOMI image acquired at a time of year when grass reflectance was excluded from the spectral signature of non-senescent vegetation was used. The image data were converted to reflectance (%), and the green and near infrared (NIR) reflectance of the field-sampled trees on the image were correlated with the in-situ data. The results showed that the woody species differed significantly in their chlorophyll content and green reflectance, but only the NIR reflectance of the broad leaf species correlated strongly with a leaf characteristic, LAL From the results it is concluded that LAI is the more reliable leaf characteristic for analysing the characteristics of savannahs in terms of woody content.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of lightning activity over J&K region and its relationship with topography, vegetation cover, and absorbing aerosol index (AAI)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal variation of lightning activity over the Jammu and Kashmir province has been studied in the present research using LIS data for the period of 12 years (2001-2013). In addition, the association of lightning activity with the elevation range, vegetation cover, and absorbing aerosol index (AAI) has been studied using the LULC data of MODIS, elevation data of SRTM DEM and multi-sensor AAI data (GOME-1, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2 and OMI). It was observed through the analysis of data sets that the J&K region which lies in the Himalayan range experiences very high frequency of lightning occurrences in entire India. The lightning frequency is much higher towards the south-western side of J&K region at an altitude range of 300-1600 m. It was observed that the mixed forests and croplands contribute more towards the higher occurrence of the lightning activity. Furthermore, it has been discerned that there is a positive correlation between the Mean Monthly flash density (FD) and Mean Monthly Absorbing aerosol index (AAI) with a correlation coefficient of 0.61 and an increase in FD and AAI was observed in summer months and decreases towards the onset of spring to winter. The comparison between the AAI and FD indicates that the spatial distribution of the two components has alike features over southwestern portion, with maximum values in the summer months and decrease upto the winter season. The findings of the present study suggest that the elevation range, Absorbing Aerosol Index along with the type of LULC plays an important role in a linkage with the occurrence of higher lightning activities in J&K region.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We report long-term continuous phenological and sky images taken by time-lapse cameras through the Phenological Eyes Network (http://www.pheno-eye.org. Accessed 29 May 2018) in various ecosystems from the Arctic to the tropics. Phenological images are useful in recording the year-to-year variability in the timing of flowering, leaf-flush, leaf-coloring, and leaf-fall and detecting the characteristics of phenological patterns and timing sensitivity among species and ecosystems. They can also help interpret variations in carbon, water, and heat cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, and be used to obtain ground-truth data for the validation of satellite-observed products. Sky images are useful in continuously recording atmospheric conditions and obtaining ground-truth data for the validation of cloud contamination and atmospheric noise present in satellite remote-sensing data. We have taken sky, forest canopy, forest floor, and shoot images of a range of tree species and landscapes, using time-lapse cameras installed on forest floors, towers, and rooftops. In total, 84 time-lapse cameras at 29 sites have taken 8 million images since 1999. Our images provide (1) long-term, continuous detailed records of plant phenology that are more quantitative than in situ visual phenological observations of index trees; (2) basic information to explain the responsiveness, vulnerability, and resilience of ecosystem canopies and their functions and services to changes in climate; and (3) ground-truthing for the validation of satellite remote-sensing observations.

TI  - Study on carbon dioxide atmospheric distribution over the Southwest Indian Ocean islands using satellite data: Part 1-Climatology and seasonal results
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forests of the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO) islands States are large carbon sinks. Rapid population growth in these islands is responsible for deforestation, which in turn is the main source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study is divided into two parts: The present study (Part 1) describes the seasonal vertical and surface spatial distribution of CO2 over the SWIO islands and the temporal variation of surface CO2 concentrations using data measured by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on board the Aura Satellite. The CO2 hotspots over these islands were identified and assessed to determine if they were associated with deforestation and forest degradation anthropogenic activities. Areas of minimum or low CO2 atmospheric loading were also identified, and investigated to determine if they coincided with strong sink areas. Atmospheric CO2 concentration was building-up from summer to spring. The spatial extent of CO2 hotspots was found to increase from summer to spring. Over the study region, semi-permanent stable layers at 700 hPa and 500 hPa were shown to separate the troposphere into three layers of CO2. Furthermore, surface CO2 levels over all the study areas were found to be increasing during the period of the investigation. Part 2 of this study demonstrates the influence of meteorology and associated air transport on atmospheric CO2 distribution over the study region.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This investigation is a follow-up to the 3-dimensional distribution analysis of atmospheric CO2 and its surface temporal variation over the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO) islands (part 1). Here, we demonstrate the influence of meteorology and the associated air transport on CO2 spatial and vertical distribution determined in part 1. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories (HYSPLIT) atmospheric model backward trajectories were used to determine the long-range air transport impacting on SWIO islands CO2 atmospheric loading, and to trace the origin of the air masses impacting on the atmosphere of SWIG islands. This study shows that meteorology and long-range air transport results in accumulation or dilution of atmospheric CO2 at various sites on the SWIO islands and this depends on the source region and type of air flow. Long-range air transport from different source regions at the upper atmospheric levels between the 700 and 500 hPa stable layers and the layer above 500 hPa is found to strengthen the inhomogeneity in the vertical distribution of CO2, caused by the decoupling effect of the upper atmosphere stable layers. This long-range air transport is also found to involve intercontinental air transport.

TI  - Evaluation of nonwoven fabrics for nasal wipe sampling for influenza A virus in swine
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) is a zoonotic pathogen threatening animal and public health; therefore, detection and monitoring of IAV in animal populations are critical components of a surveillance program. Swine are important hosts of IAV, wherein the virus can undergo rapid evolution. Several methods (i.e., nasal swabs, nasal wipes, and oral fluids) have been used to collect samples from swine for IAV surveillance. We utilized nasal wipes made from cotton gauze and multiple, polyester or mixed polyester fabrics to compare performance in the molecular detection and isolation of IAV. In vitro experiments revealed that no polyester or mixed polyester fabric was superior to cotton gauze for molecular IAV detection; however, 3 polyester or mixed polyester fabrics yielded significantly more viable IAV than cotton. In a field trial, both cotton gauze and the polyester or mixed polyester fabric yielded similar proportions of IAV isolates from swine. The results indicate that cotton gauze remains a practical and useful material for swine nasal wipes.

TI  - Greenhouse Crop Identification from Multi-Temporal Multi-Sensor Satellite Imagery Using Object-Based Approach: A Case Study from Almeria (Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A workflow headed up to identify crops growing under plastic-covered greenhouses (PCG) and based on multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data is developed in this article. This workflow is made up of four steps: (i) data pre-processing, (ii) PCG segmentation, (iii) binary pre-classification between greenhouses and non-greenhouses, and (iv) classification of horticultural crops under greenhouses regarding two agronomic seasons (autumn and spring). The segmentation stage was carried out by applying a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm on the pre-processed WorldView-2 data. The free access AssesSeg command line tool was used to determine the more suitable multi-resolution algorithm parameters. Two decision tree models mainly based on the Plastic Greenhouse Index were developed to perform greenhouse/non-greenhouse binary classification from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A time series, attaining overall accuracies of 92.65% and 93.97%, respectively. With regards to the classification of crops under PCG, pepper in autumn, and melon and watermelon in spring provided the best results (F around 84% and 95%, respectively). Data from the Sentinel-2A time series showed slightly better accuracies than those from Landsat 8.

TI  - PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF RADIATION DOSE TO PATIENTS FROM CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES IN TANZANIA
T2  - RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although contemporary cardiac X-ray exams are typically set so benefits outweighs the risk, the growing use and increasing complexity of the cardiovascular interventional radiological (CVIR) procedures does increase the risk of radiation-related tissue effects and stochastic effects to the individual patients and the population. In view of these radiological concerns there is a need to investigate factors that influence the doses received by the patients and enable optimisation needed. The air kerma area product (KAP), cumulative air kerma (CAK) and fluoroscopy time (FT) to patients from two major CVIR procedures: coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), were obtained from two major hospitals in Tanzania. The CAK and KAP were determined using ionisation chambers equipped in each angiographic unit. The median values of the KAP, CAK and FT for the CA procedures were 37.8 Gy cm(2), 425.5 mGy and 7.6 min, respectively, while for the PCI were 86.5 Gy cm(2), 1180.3 mGy and 19.0 min, respectively. The overall differences among individual KAP, CAK and FT values across the two hospitals investigated differed by factors of up to 33.5, 58.7 and 26.3 for the CA, while for the PCI procedures differed by factors of up to 10.9, 25.3 and 13.8, respectively. The mean values of KAP and FT for both CA and PCI were mostly higher than those reported values for Ireland, Belgium, Greece, France, China and Australia. The third quartiles of the KAP, CAK and FT for both CA and PCI were relatively above the preliminary diagnostic reference levels proposed by the IAEA, DIMOND III and SENTINEL. The observed substantial variations of mean values of technical parameters and patient doses (KAP, CAK and FT values) observed for the CA and PCI procedures inter and intra-hospitals were mainly explained by the complexity of the CVIR procedures, the nature of pathology, patient-specific characteristics, the variation in levels of skills and experiences among IC personnel, and the different procedural protocols employed among interventional cardiologists and hospitals. The observed great variations of procedural protocols and patient doses within and across the hospitals and relative higher dose than reported values from the literature call for the need to optimise radiation dose to patient from IC procedures.

TI  - A Comparison of Imputation Approaches for Estimating Forest Biomass Using Landsat Time-Series and Inventory Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of forest biomass at the landscape scale can be achieved by integrating data from field plots with satellite imagery, in particular data from the Landsat archive, using k-nearest neighbour (kNN) imputation models. While studies have demonstrated different kNN imputation approaches for estimating forest biomass from remote sensing data and forest inventory plots, there is no general agreement on which approach is most appropriate for biomass estimation across large areas. In this study, we compared several imputation approaches for estimating forest biomass using Landsat time-series and inventory plot data. We evaluated 18 kNN models to impute three aboveground biomass (AGB) variables (total AGB, AGB of live trees and AGB of dead trees). These models were developed using different distance techniques (Random Forest or RF, Gradient Nearest Neighbour or GNN, and Most Similar Neighbour or MSN) and different combinations of response variables (model scenarios). Direct biomass imputation models were trained according to the biomass variables while indirect biomass imputation models were trained according to combinations of forest structure variables (e.g., basal area, stem density and stem volume of live and dead-standing trees). We also assessed the ability of our imputation method to spatially predict biomass variables across large areas in relation to a forest disturbance history over a 30-year period (1987-2016). Our results show that RF consistently outperformed MSN and GNN distance techniques across different model scenarios and biomass variables. The lowest error rates were achieved by RF-based models with generalized root mean squared difference (gRMSD, RMSE divided by the standard deviation of the observed values) ranging from 0.74 to 1.24. Whereas gRMSD associated with MSN-based and GNN-based models ranged from 0.92 to 1.36 and from 1.04 to 1.42, respectively. The indirect imputation method generally achieved better biomass predictions than the direct imputation method. In particular, the kNN model trained with the combination of basal area and stem density variables was the most robust for estimating forest biomass. This model reported a gRMSD of 0.89, 0.95 and 1.08 for total AGB, AGB of live trees and AGB of dead trees, respectively. In addition, spatial predictions of biomass showed relatively consistent trends with disturbance severity and time since disturbance across the time-series. As the kNN imputation method is increasingly being used by land managers and researchers to map forest biomass, this work helps those using these methods ensure their modelling and mapping practices are optimized.

TI  - A spatial and temporal analysis of forest dynamics using Landsat time-series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding forest dynamics at the landscape scale is critical given the demands of sustainable forest management and climate change mitigation. This study proposes an approach for holistically characterising and analysing forest dynamics across large areas and long-time periods using information derived from Landsat time series. To achieve this, we first developed a two-phase classification process to predictively map (1) disturbance and recovery levels and (2) disturbance causal agents for multiple detected disturbance events. The model explanatory data included a range of trajectory-based metrics derived from Landsat time-series, while model training and validation data were derived from a human-interpreted reference dataset. While previous studies have often described forest dynamics using some specific spectral change metrics, we demonstrated an ensemble approach to map disturbance and recovery trends (by treating them as a single metric) and to characterise not only abruptly occurring change events (e.g., clear-fell logging and wildfire) but also events of low severity (e.g., prescribed burning and selective logging). In addition, we adopted a space-time data cube concept to simultaneously report both newly detected disturbance events (detected disturbances) as well as events that have previously occurred but are ongoing (ongoing disturbances). This ongoing element of forest dynamics is often under-reported. The method was tested over 3.7 million ha of public land sclerophyll forests, where multiple disturbance events have occurred over the last 30 years (1987-2016). Our models of disturbance and recovery levels obtained overall accuracies of 78.6% and 72.3% for primary and secondary disturbance events, respectively. The overall accuracies for the models of disturbance causal agents were 80.7% and 73.0%, respectively. The data cube reported an average annual disturbance rate of 4.2% per year. This was dominated by newly detected disturbance (2.7% per year) as distinct from ongoing disturbance that was, however, considerable (1.5% per year). Our approach presented herein can improve the understanding of forest dynamics over long time periods and large areas and has potential for supporting land managers.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Cities often experience high air pollution and noise levels and lack of natural outdoor environments, which may be detrimental to health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of air pollution, noise, and blue and green space on premature all-cause mortality in Barcelona using a mega cohort approach. Methods: Both men and women of 18 years and above registered on 1 January 2010 by the Sistema d'Informacio pel Desenvolupament de la Investigacio en Atencio Primaria (SIDIAP) and living in the city of Barcelona were included in the cohort and followed up until 31 December 2014 or until death (n = 2,939,067 person years). The exposure assessment was conducted at the census tract level (n = 1061). We assigned exposure to long term ambient levels of nitrogen dioxides (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), between 2.5 mu m and 10 mu m (PM2.5-10, i.e., coarse particulate matter), less than 10 mu m (PM10) and PM2.5 light absorption (hereafter referred to as PM2.5 absorbance) based on land use regressions models. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was assigned based on remote sensing data, percentage green space and blue space were calculated based on land use maps and modelled road traffic noise was available through the strategic noise map for Barcelona. Results: In this large prospective study (n = 792,649) in an urban area, we found a decreased risk of all-cause mortality with an increase in green space measured as NDVI (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.97 per 0.1) and increased risks of mortality with an increase in exposure to blue space (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06 per 1%), NO2 (HR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02 per 5 ug/m(3)) but no risk with noise (HR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.98-1.02 per 5 dB(A)). The increased risks appeared to be more pronounced in the more deprived areas. Results for NDVI, and to a lesser extent NO2, remained most consistent after mutual adjustment for other exposures. The NDVI estimate was a little attenuated when NO2 was included in the model. The study had some limitations including e.g., the assessment of air pollution, noise, green space and socioeconomic status (SES) on census tract level rather than individual level and residual confounding. Conclusion: This large study provides new insights on the relationship between green and blue space, noise and air pollution and premature all-cause mortality.

TI  - Synergistic Use of UAV and USV Data and Petrographic Analyses for the Investigation of Beachrock Formations: A Case Study from Syros Island, Aegean Sea, Greece
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Up until the last ten years, remote sensing data and especially high-resolution satellite data and airphotos were mainly used in shallow water mapping. The evolution and low cost of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides a new tool for coastal area monitoring. This paper presents the synergistic use of a small commercial UAV and an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for beachrock mapping in Syros Island, Greece. RGB images collected with a quadcopter were processed using Structure from Motion (SFM) photogrammetry in order to create digital surface models (DSMs) and orthophotos of the coastline. A beachrock lying in shallow waters was detected and mapped using the UAV derived products. At the same time, a USV equipped with a compact side scan sonar (SSS) and bathymetric sonar system, provided the shape of the beachrock by mosaicking the backscatter strength of the SSS. In order to evaluate the results of the UAV and USV data derivatives, the beachrock perimeter and its depth were also mapped using a differential global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. During the fieldwork, samples from the beachrock were collected and analyzed in the laboratory. The mineralogical composition of the bulk samples was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Further petrographic study was also performed by petrographic polarizing microscope, macroscope, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Beachrock samples are classified as fine to medium grain sandstones and conglomerates. The mineral compositions of their grains and lithoclasts reflect the bedrocks of Syros Island (mainly metamorphic rocks) while a micritic high-Mg calcite constitutes the cement of these rocks.

TI  - Statistical Study of Phase Relationship Between Magnetic and Plasma Pressures in the Near-Earth Nightside Magnetosphere Using the THEMIS-E Satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributions of plasma and magnetic pressures are the basic information to investigate macroscopic dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere. Several studies have been made on magnetic and plasma pressures and macroscopic plasma instabilities in the magnetosphere. However, correlation between magnetic and plasma pressure variations has not been statistically investigated. In this paper, we analyze the statistical characteristics of the phase relationships between variations of magnetic and plasma pressures at frequencies of 4-15 mHz using 2 years of the THEMIS-E satellite data in the nightside magnetosphere. Spectral peaks with coherence greater than 0.85 between magnetic and plasma pressures for 1-hr time segments were selected. The average occurrence rates of the phase relationships are antiphase (within +/- 10 degrees from 180 degrees), 39.75%; in-phase (within +/- 10 degrees from 0 degrees), 0.73%; and other phases (10-170 degrees), 49.83%. For the other-phase events, the phase differences are much closer to antiphase rather than to in-phase. Thus, we conclude that the two pressure variations tend to be antiphase. The antiphase and in-phase relationships are observed mainly at radial distances outside 8 R-E and inside 8 R-E, respectively. The high occurrence region of antiphase relationship is in the dawnside during magnetically quiet times and shifts to dusk side at active times defined as Dst < -10 nT. The occurrence rates of the phase relationships do not change significantly depending on the AE and Dst indices, plasma beta, and IMF-B-z. Based on these results, we discuss the correspondence between the phase relationships and the possible magnetohydrodynamic force balances that can produce these phase relationships.

TI  - More Than Meets the Eye: Using Sentinel-2 to Map Small Plantations in Complex Forest Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many tropical forest landscapes are now complex mosaics of intact forests, recovering forests, tree crops, agroforestry, pasture, and crops. The small patch size of each land cover type contributes to making them difficult to separate using satellite remote sensing data. We used Sentinel-2 data to conduct supervised classifications covering seven classes, including oil palm, rubber, and betel nut plantations in Southern Myanmar, based on an extensive training dataset derived from expert interpretation of WorldView-3 and UAV data. We used a Random Forest classifier with all 13 Sentinel-2 bands, as well as vegetation and texture indices, over an area of 13,330 ha. The median overall accuracy of 1000 iterations was >95% (95.5%-96.0%) against independent test data, even though the tree crop classes appear visually very similar at a 20 m resolution. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 data, which are freely available with very frequent (five day) revisits, are able to differentiate these similar tree crop types. We suspect that this is due to the large number of spectral bands in Sentinel-2 data, indicating great potential for the wider application of Sentinel-2 data for the classification of small land parcels without needing to resort to object-based classification of higher resolution data.

TI  - Potential and Limitations of Open Satellite Data for Flood Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool to map flooded areas. In recent years, the availability of free satellite data significantly increased in terms of type and frequency, allowing the production of flood maps at low cost around the world. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for flood mapping, based only on free satellite images and open-source software. The proposed methods are suitable to be applied by the community involved in flood hazard management, not necessarily experts in remote sensing processing. As case studies, we selected three flood events that recently occurred in Spain and Italy. Multispectral satellite data acquired by MODIS, Proba-V, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1 were used to detect flooded areas using different methodologies (e.g., Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, SAR backscattering variation, and supervised classification). Then, we improved and manually refined the automatic mapping using free ancillary data such as the digital elevation model-based water depth model and available ground truth data. We calculated flood detection performance (flood ratio) for the different datasets by comparing with flood maps made by official river authorities. The results show that it is necessary to consider different factors when selecting the best satellite data. Among these factors, the time of the satellite pass with respect to the flood peak is the most important. With co-flood multispectral images, more than 90% of the flooded area was detected in the 2015 Ebro flood (Spain) case study. With post-flood multispectral data, the flood ratio showed values under 50% a few weeks after the 2016 flood in Po and Tanaro plains (Italy), but it remained useful to map the inundated pattern. The SAR could detect flooding only at the co-flood stage, and the flood ratio showed values below 5% only a few days after the 2016 Po River inundation. Another result of the research was the creation of geomorphology-based inundation maps that matched up to 95% with official flood maps.

TI  - Lymph flow guided irradiation of regional lymph nodes in patients with cervical cancer: Preliminary analysis of scintigraphic data
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate patterns of lymph flow from primary lesions in patients with cervical cancer and to determine how useful for radiotherapy planning this information can be.Materials and methods: SPECT-CT visualization of sentinel (SLN) lymph nodes (LNs) was performed in 36 primary patients with IB-IIB cervical cancer. The acquisition started 120-240 min after 4 peritumoral injections of 99mTc-radiocolloids (150-300 MBq in 0.4-1 ml). We determined localization of LN with uptake of radiocolloids, type of lymph flow (mono-, bi-lateral) and lymph flow patterns (supraureteral paracervical, infraureteral paracervical and directly to para-aortic LNs).Results: SLNs were visualized in 31 of 36 women. Bilateral lymph-flow was detected in 22 (71%), monolateral - in the other 9 (29%) cases. The distribution of SLNs was as follows: external iliac - 64.5%, internal iliac - 54.8%, obturator - 32.2%, common iliac - 35.5% and pre-sacral 3.2%. Para-aortic LNs were visualized in 5 (16.1%) patients. The supraureteral paracervical pattern of lymph flow was identified in 22, infraureteral paracervical - in 4 and their combination - in the other 5 women.Conclusion: Visualization of an individual pattern of lymph flow from primary cervical cancer can be considered as a promising tool for optimization of the volume of irradiated regional LNs.

TI  - Improving Land Cover Classifications with Multiangular Data: MISR Data in Mainland Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we deal with the application of multiangular data from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) sensor for studying the effect of surface anisotropy and directional information on the classification accuracy for different land covers with different rate of disaggregation classes (from four to 35 different classes) from a Mediterranean bioregion in Iberian, Spain. We used various MISR band groups from nadir to blue, green, red, and NIR channels at nadir and off-nadir. The MISR data utilized here were provided by the L1B2T product (275 m spatial resolution) and belonged to two different orbits. We performed 23 classifications with the k-means algorithm to test multiangular data, number of clusters, and iteration effects. Our findings confirmed that the multiangular information, in addition to the multispectral information used as the input of the k-means algorithm, improves the land cover classification accuracy, and this improvement increased with the level of disaggregation. A very large number of clusters produced even better improvements than multiangular data.

TI  - Nanoparticle-Conjugate TLR7/8 Agonist Localized Immunotherapy Provokes Safe Antitumoral Responses
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Localized therapeutic modalities that subvert the tumor microenvironment from immune-suppressive to pro-immunogenic can elicit systemic antitumor immune responses that induce regression of directly treated as well as nontreated distal tumors. A key toward generating robust antitumor T cell responses is the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumor microenvironment. Treatment with agonists triggering various pattern recognition receptors is very efficient to activate DCs, yet suffers from the induction of serious immune-related adverse effects, which is closely linked to their unfavorable PK/PD profile causing systemic immune activation and cytokine release. Here, it is reported that nanoparticle conjugation of a highly potent TLR7/8 agonist restricts immune activation to the tumor bed and its sentinel lymph nodes without hampering therapeutic antitumor efficacy. On a mechanistic level, it is confirmed that localized treatment with a nanoparticle-conjugated TLR7/8 agonist leads to potent activation of DCs in the sentinel lymph nodes and promotes proliferation of tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, therapeutic improvement upon combination with anti-PDL1 checkpoint inhibition and Flt3L, a growth factor that expands and mobilizes DCs from the bone marrow, is demonstrated. The findings provide a rational base for localized tumor engineering by nanomedicine strategies that provide spatial control over immune-activation.

TI  - An operational workflow to assess rice nutritional status based on satellite imagery and smartphone apps
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen fertilization plays a key role in rice productivity and environmental impact of rice-based cropping systems, as well as on farmers' income, representing one of the main cost items of rice farming. Average nitrogen use efficiency in rice paddies is often very low (about 30%), leading to groundwater contamination, greenhouse gases emission, and economic losses for farmers. The resulting pressure on many actors in the rice production chain has generated a need for operational tools and techniques able to increase nitrogen use efficiency. We present an operational workflow for producing nitrogen nutritional index (NNI) maps at sub-field scale based on the combined use of high-resolution satellite images and ground-based estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and plant nitrogen concentration (PNC, %) data collected using smart apps. The workflow was tested in northern Italy. The analysis reveals that vegetation indices are satisfactorily correlated with LAI (r(2) > 0.77, p < 0.01) and PNC (r(2) > 0.55, p < 0.01); whereas most patterns of NNI maps are coherent with the available information on soil texture and performed agro-practices. Key features of the proposed approach are (i) the time and cost-effectiveness for producing NNI maps even in operational contexts and (ii) the full exploitation of smart scouting techniques to drive field data acquisitions using smartphones as sensors. The use of operational, free -of charge products from Sentinel-2 for real-time field monitoring to potentially support variable rate fertilizations is also discussed.

TI  - Survival outcomes and interval between lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB in cutaneous melanoma- findings of a large prospective cohort study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in cutaneous melanoma (CM) is performed to identify patient at risk of regional and distant relapse. We hypothesized that timing of lymphoscintigraphy may influence the accuracy of SLNB and patient outcomes.Methods: We reviewed prospective data on patients undergoing SLNB for CM at a large university cancer-center between 2008 and 2015, examining patient and tumor demographics and time between lymphoscintigraphy (LS) and SLNB. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed disease-specific (DSS) and overall-survival (OS), stratified by timing of IS. Cox multivariate regression analysis assessed independent risk factors for survival.Results: We identified 1015 patients. Median follow-up was 45 months (IQR 26-68 months). Univariate analysis showed a 6.8% absolute DSS (HR 1.6 [1.03-2.48], p = 0.04) benefit and a 10.7% absolute OS (HR 1.64 [1.13-2.38], p = 0.01) benefit for patients whose SLNB was performed < 12 h of LS (n = 363) compared to those performed >12 h (n = 652). Multivariate analysis identified timing of LS as an independent predictor of OS (p = 0.007) and DSS (p = 0.016) when competing with age, sex, Breslow thickness (BT) and SLN status. No difference in nodal relapse rates (5.2% v 4.6%; p = 0.67) was seen. Both groups were matched for age, sex, BT and SLN status.Conclusion: These data have significant implications for SLNB services, suggesting delaying SLNB >12 h after LS using a Tc99-labelled nanocolloid has a significant negative survival impact for patients and should be avoided. We hypothesise that temporal tracer migration is the underlying cause and advocate further trials investigating alternative, 'stable' tracer-agents.

TI  - Scaled deployment of Wolbachia to protect the community from dengue and other Aedes transmitted arboviruses.
T2  - Gates open research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: A number of new technologies are under development for the control of mosquito transmitted viruses, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika that all require the release of modified mosquitoes into the environment. None of these technologies has been able to demonstrate evidence that they can be implemented at a scale beyond small pilots. Here we report the first successful citywide scaled deployment of Wolbachia in the northern Australian city of Townsville. Methods: The wMel strain of Wolbachia was backcrossed into a local Aedes aegypti genotype and mass reared mosquitoes were deployed as eggs using mosquito release containers (MRCs). In initial stages these releases were undertaken by program staff but in later stages this was replaced by direct community release including the development of a school program that saw children undertake releases. Mosquito monitoring was undertaken with Biogents Sentinel (BGS) traps and individual mosquitoes were screened for the presence of Wolbachia with a Taqman qPCR or LAMP diagnostic assay. Dengue case notifications from Queensland Health Communicable Disease Branch were used to track dengue cases in the city before and after release. Results: Wolbachia was successfully established into local Ae. aegypti mosquitoes across 66 km in four stages over 28 months with full community support. A feature of the program was the development of a scaled approach to community engagement. Wolbachia frequencies have remained stable since deployment and to date no local dengue transmission has been confirmed in any area of Townsville after Wolbachia has established, despite local transmission events every year for the prior 13 years and an epidemiological context of increasing imported cases. Conclusion: Deployment of Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti populations can be readily scaled to areas of ~60km quickly and cost effectively and appears in this context to be effective at stopping local dengue transmission.

TI  - Gastric outlet obstruction caused by metastatic tumor of the stomach originating from primary breast cancer: A case report
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The most common sites of breast cancer metastasis are the bone, liver, lung and brain, while gastrointestinal metastasis from breast cancer is rare. We herein present the case of a 68-year-old woman who was admitted to our department with nausea and appetite loss. The patient's medical history included right mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy 5 years earlier for invasive lobular carcinoma, measuring 6.2 cm in greatest diameter, without lymphovascular invasion. Two years after the surgery, the patient developed brain metastasis and underwent metastasectomy to control the neurological symptoms, including unsteadiness and asthenia. After the second surgery, the patient received systemic chemotherapy using S-1, followed by bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. However, due to bevacizumab-related cardiotoxicity, the treatment was switched to eribulin. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy, an elevated lesion was identified in the antrum, causing severe narrowing of the gastric outlet. Biopsy and histological examination of the tumor revealed infiltration of the gastric wall by undifferentiated neoplastic cells with poor adhesion, morphologically similar to invasive lobular carcinoma, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for estrogen receptor, mammaglobin and GATA3. Finally, F-18-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography imaging revealed FDG uptake across the thickness of the antral wall. The patient was diagnosed with gastric metastasis from the original breast cancer and subsequently underwent endoscopic self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement. There were no procedure-related adverse events, and the patient remained alive under best supportive care 4 months after SEMS placement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of gastric outlet obstruction caused by metastatic breast carcinoma managed by SEMS placement. While such a diagnosis is rare, clinicians treating patients with gastric metastases should be aware of possible gastric outlet obstruction and SEMS placement as an effective palliative intervention.

TI  - Combining Landsat observations with hydrological modelling for improved surface water monitoring of small lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small reservoirs represent a critical water supply to millions of farmers across semi-arid regions, but their hydrological modelling suffers from data scarcity and highly variable and localised rainfall intensities. Increased availability of satellite imagery provide substantial opportunities but the monitoring of surface water resources is constrained by the small size and rapid flood declines in small reservoirs. To overcome remote sensing and hydrological modelling difficulties, the benefits of combining field data, numerical modelling and satellite observations to monitor small reservoirs were investigated. Building on substantial field data, coupled daily rainfall-runoff and water balance models were developed for 7 small reservoirs (1-10 ha) in semi arid Tunisia over 1999-2014. Surface water observations from MNDWI classifications on 546 Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI sensors were used to update model outputs through an Ensemble (n = 100) Kalman Filter over the 15 year period. The Ensemble Kalman Filter, providing near-real time corrections, reduced runoff errors by modulating incorrectly modelled rainfall events, while compensating for Landsat's limited temporal resolution and correcting classification outliers. Validated against long term hydrometric field data, daily volume root mean square errors (RMSE) decreased by 54% to 31200 m(3) across 7 lakes compared to the initial model forecast. The method reproduced the amplitude and timing of major floods and their decline phases, providing a valuable approach to improve hydrological monitoring (NSE increase from 0.64 up to 0.94) of flood dynamics in small water bodies. In the smallest and data-scarce lakes, higher temporal and spatial resolution time series are essential to improve monitoring accuracy.

CP  - British-Society-for-Parasitology (BSP) Autumn Symposium on The Multidisciplinarity of Parasitology - Host-Parasite Evolution in an Ever Changing World
CL  - Linnean Soc, London, ENGLAND
AB  - Monitoring vectors is relevant to ascertain transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF). This may require the best sampling method that can capture high numbers of specific species to give indication of transmission. Gravid anophelines are good indicators for assessing transmission due to close contact with humans through blood meals. This study compared the efficiency of an Anopheles gravid trap (AGT) with other mosquito collection methods including the box and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention gravid, light, exit and BioGent-sentinel traps, indoor resting collection (IRC) and pyrethrum spray catches across two endemic regions of Ghana. The AGT showed high trapping efficiency by collecting the highest mean number of anophelines per night in the Western (4.6) and Northern (7.3) regions compared with the outdoor collection methods. Additionally, IRC was similarly efficient in the Northern region (8.9) where vectors exhibit a high degree of endophily. AGT also showed good trapping potential for collecting Anopheles melas which is usually difficult to catch with existing methods. Screening of mosquitoes for infection showed a 0.80-3.01% Wuchereria bancrofti and 2.15-3.27% Plasmodium spp. in Anopheles gambiae. The AGT has shown to be appropriate for surveying Anopheles populations and can be useful for xenomonitoring for both LF and malaria.

TI  - Observing Multimodal Ocean Wave Systems by a Multiscale Analysis of Polarimetric SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new methodology is here presented for the assessment of deep water multimodal ocean wave systems using polarimetric Radarsat-2 imagery. To separate wave systems in multimodal cases and evaluate their statistics individually, the new approach uses a multiscale processing scheme together with the mean square slope statistics theory of ocean waves, which has been originally developed from optical and radar altimetry sensors. Moreover, it was possible to classify the wave systems as wind driven or "pure" swell. The results show a reasonable agreement with data by a nearby metocean buoy. More C-band polarimetric SAR imagery is required to fully validate the methodology with well collocated wave buoys. We reckon that this new approach, being a fast and independent satellite algorithm to assess multimodal ocean wave systems, could contribute to several coastal/oceanic engineering applications and monitoring systems.

TI  - Fencing solves human-wildlife conflict locally but shifts problems elsewhere: A case study using functional connectivity modelling of the African elephant
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Fencing is one of the most common methods of mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. At the same time, fencing is considered one of the most pressing threats emerging in conservation globally. Although fences act as barriers and can cause population isolation and fragmentation over time, it is difficult to quantitatively predict the consequences fences have for wildlife.2. Here, we model how fencing designed to mitigate human-elephant conflict (HEC) on the Borderlands between Kenya and Tanzania will affect functional connectivity and movement corridors for African elephants. Specifically, we (a) model functional landscape connectivity integrating natural and anthropogenic factors; (b) predict seasonal movement corridors used by elephants in non-protected areas; and (c) evaluate whether fencing in one area can potentially intensify human-wildlife conflicts elsewhere.3. We used GPS movement and remote sensing data to develop monthly step-selection functions to model functional connectivity. For future scenarios, we used an ongoing fencing project designed for HEC mitigation within the study area. We modelled movement corridors using least-cost path and circuit theory methods, evaluated their predictive power and quantified connectivity changes resulting from the planned fencing.4. Our results suggest that fencing will not cause landscape fragmentation and will not change functional landscape connectivity dramatically. However, fencing will lead to a loss of connectivity locally and will increase the potential for HEC in new areas. We estimate that wetlands, important for movement corridors, will be more intensively used by the elephants, which may also cause problems of overgrazing. Seasonal analysis highlights an increasing usage of non-protected lands in the dry season and equal importance of the pinch point wetlands for preserving overall function connectivity.5. Synthesis and applications. Fencing is a solution to small-scale human-elephant conflict problems but will not solve the issue at a broader scale. Moreover, our results highlight that it may intensify the conflicts and overuse of habitat patches in other areas, thereby negating conservation benefits. If fencing is employed on a broader scale, then it is imperative that corridors are integrated within protected area networks to ensure local connectivity of affected species.

TI  - THE PLOT AND IMAGE CONCRETIZATION OF THE CONCEPT <i>RUS</i>' IN SONNETS BY G.V. GOLOKHVASTOV
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is devoted to the little-studied heritage of G.V. Golokhvastov, the most talented representative of the poetry of Russian "Americans", who formed an active creative community in the beginning of the 20th century in New York. (V. Ilyashenko, D. Magoula, E. Christians). The article contains a description, analysis and interpretation of the invariant concept "Rus-, which determines the figurative and symbolic content of the Russian civilization as a whole in Golokhvastov's sonnets. Sonnets expressing the content and ideological foundations of Russian civilization form two cycles in the poet's work: (1) sonnets on subjects from the historical past of Russia and (2) sonnets of intimate and personal content. The sonnets of the first ("Rendezvous", "King and King", "Princess Sophia", "Winner and Defeated", "Victory", "Candle", "Under the Spittle") are based on historical events that determined the cultural and historical appearance of Russia from ancient times to the middle of the 20th century, and their heroes are real historical figures, the Russian rulers. In the sonnets, Russian civilization is represented in the form of a community, united by a responsible lord, a large-scale national goal and deed. Associates of the "sovereign" are the power of the spirit, greatness, exclusivity. The sonnet "Under the Spitting" with the image of Alexander II adds nobility, sacrifice, generosity and humanity to the stable associates. The second cycle contains sonnets with intimate and personal subjects from the author's past and present. In sonnets on themes of the author's past ("Winter Way"," Winter"," Friends"," On Country Roads"," Memory", etc.), the concept "Rus- is entered in personal memories and is represented by pictures of the childhood or youth of the lyrical hero. Such sonnets show an idyllic picture of Rus'-Russia. The lyrical hero associates pictures of the ancestral estate with Russia, which is a place of full life for the mind and soul of the lyrical hero (identical to the author). The sonnets on the topics from the "real" life time of the author ("Exodus", "On a Fracture", "In the City", "In Exile", "Sleepless Hours", "Street", etc.) are filled with imagery and semantics of the concept sphere "Rus, expressed in the invariant opposition "own" "alien" which creates the unique identity of Russia. The concept with its properties of timelessness and outwardness is transformed into a sacralized mythological space in which the mere fact of death is implicitly denied, and life is the highest value beautiful, free and happy. The semantic field of the concept "Rus in the sonnets of each type consists of associates with positive meanings: greatness, strength, exclusivity, sacrifice, nobility, generosity and humanity in the sphere of relations with the foreign world; dream, life, joy, carelessness, freedom in the sphere of spiritual life of the individual. Variations of associates of the concept "Rus directly depend on the state of mind of the lyric hero: the fuller it is included in the surrounding "alien" reality, the more dramatic is his worldview, and, accordingly, the more idyllic is the qualitative description of Russia.

TI  - Measuring Urban Land Cover Influence on Air Temperature through Multiple Geo-Data-The Case of Milan, Italy
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate issues are nowadays one of the most pressing societal challenges, with cities being identified among the landmarks for climate change. This study investigates the effect of urban land cover composition on a relevant climate-related variable, i.e., the air temperature. The analysis exploits different big geo-data sources, namely high-resolution satellite imagery and in-situ air temperature observations, using the city of Milan (Northern Italy) as a case study. Satellite imagery from the Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and RapidEye missions are used to derive Local Climate Zone (LCZ) maps depicting land cover compositions across the study area. Correlation tests are run to investigate and measure the influence of land cover composition on air temperature. Results show an underlying connection between the two variables by detecting an average temperature offset of about 1.5 degrees C between heavily urbanized and vegetated urban areas. The approach looks promising in investigating urban climate at a local scale and explaining effects through maps and exploratory graphs, which are valuable tools for urban planners to implement climate change mitigation strategies. The availability of worldwide coverage datasets, as well as the exclusive use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), provide the analysis with a potential to be empowered, replicated, and improved.

TI  - Radiometric Correction of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A Scenes Using Drone Imagery in Synergy with Field Spectroradiometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this research is to apply unmanned aerial system (UAS) data in synergy with field spectroradiometry for the accurate radiometric correction of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery. The central hypothesis is that imagery acquired with multispectral UAS sensors that are well calibrated with highly accurate field measurements can fill in the scale gap between satellite imagery and conventional in situ measurements; this can be possible by sampling a larger area, including difficult-to-access land covers, in less time while simultaneously providing good radiometric quality. With this aim and by using near-coincident L8 and S2 imagery, we applied an upscaling workflow, whereby: (a) UAS-acquired multispectral data was empirically fitted to the reflectance of field measurements, with an extensive set of radiometric references distributed across the spectral domain; (b) drone data was resampled to satellite grids for comparison with the radiometrically corrected L8 and S2 official products (6S-LaSRC and Sen2Cor-SNAP, respectively) and the CorRad-MiraMon algorithm using pseudo-invariant areas, such as reflectance references (PIA-MiraMon), to examine their overall accuracy; (c) then, a subset of UAS data was used as reflectance references, in combination with the CorRad-MiraMon algorithm (UAS-MiraMon), to radiometrically correct the matching bands of UAS, L8, and S2; and (d) radiometrically corrected L8 and S2 scenes obtained with UAS-MiraMon were intercompared (intersensor coherence). In the first upscaling step, the results showed a good correlation between the field spectroradiometric measurements and the drone data in all evaluated bands (R-2 > 0.946). In the second upscaling step, drone data indicated good agreement (estimated from root mean square error, RMSE) with the satellite official products in visible (VIS) bands (RMSEVIS < 2.484%), but yielded poor results in the near-infrared (NIR) band (RMSENIR > 6.688% was not very good due to spectral sensor response differences). In the third step, UAS-MiraMon indicated better agreement (RMSEVIS < 2.018%) than the other satellite radiometric correction methods in visible bands (6S-LaSRC (RMSE < 2.680%), Sen2Cor-SNAP (RMSE < 2.192%), and PIA-MiraMon (RMSE < 3.130%), but did not achieve sufficient results in the NIR band (RMSENIR < 7.530%); this also occurred with all other methods. In the intercomparison step, the UAS-MiraMon method achieved an excellent intersensor (L8-S2) coherence (RMSEVIS < 1%). The UAS-sampled area involved 51 L8 (30 m) pixels, 143 S2 (20 m) pixels, and 517 S2 (10 m) pixels. The drone time needed to cover this area was only 10 min, including areas that were difficult to access. The systematic sampling of the study area was achieved with a pixel size of 6 cm, and the raster nature of the sampling allowed for an easy but rigorous resampling of UAS data to the different satellite grids. These advances improve human capacities for conventional field spectroradiometry samplings. However, our study also shows that field spectroradiometry is the backbone that supports the full upscaling workflow. In conclusion, the synergy between field spectroradiometry, UAS sensors, and Landsat-like satellite data can be a useful tool for accurate radiometric corrections used in local environmental studies or the monitoring of protected areas around the world.

TI  - Unusual Sites of Metastatic and Benign I 131 Uptake in Patients with Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma.
T2  - Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is the most common pathological type of thyroid carcinoma, which includes papillary and follicular subtypes. DTC is usually indolent, characterized by good prognosis, and long-term survival. Total thyroidectomy is the mainstay of treatment in DTC which is followed by diagnostic whole body 131I (WBI) scan. Like other primary malignancies of the head and neck, DTC follows a consistent pattern of spread in the cervical LNs. The central compartment, level VI and VII, is the first sentinel node followed by spread to the lateral compartments levels II-V, followed by the contralateral side. Inspite of nodal involvement, DTC usually have a favourable outcome. Presence of extrapulmonary distant metastases could predict a poor prognosis for high-dose 131I therapy. However, distant metastasis occurs often as a grave event and mortality rates vary depending on metastatic sites.AIM AND OBJECTIVES: A range of rare 131I concentrating DTC deposits in sella, orbit, choroid, skeletal muscles, liver, skin, costochondral soft tissue, pancreas and kidney, and a few benign 131I concentrating sites are being depicted.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Metastatic sites from DTC can be easily identified by performing a whole body 131I (WBI) scan along with a stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) estimation (TSH >30 uIU/ml). Apart from thyroid and thyroid-related diseases, certain benign non-thyroidal pathologies can concentrate radioiodine (131I). From 13,000 of our patients who underwent radioiodine scan for thyroid cancer, we have selected a few cases of 131I concentrating benign and malignant lesions for illustration.RESULTS: Out of 13000 DTC patients who underwent whole body 131I scintigraphy in our department from Jan 2007 till Mar 2018, 25 patients revealed benign sites of 131I uptake. 61 % patients had residual thyroid tissue with or without associated nodal involvement. Remaining patients had distant metastases. Rare sites of functioning thyroid metastases and benign sites of I 131 uptake have been selected for illustration.CONCLUSION: Apart from the WBI (two-dimensional, planar) images, single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) has been incremental in localizing benign lesions which greatly depends on their location. This pictorial review highlights the need to create an awareness to detect metastatic deposits of DTC at unexpected sites. Otherwise patients will need further investigation to rule out unsuspected sites of functioning distant metastases.

TI  - Automated Geospatial Models of Varying Complexities for Pine Forest Evapotranspiration Estimation with Advanced Data Mining
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The study goal was to develop automated user-friendly remote-sensing based evapotranspiration (ET) estimation tools: (i) artificial neural network (ANN) based models, (ii) ArcGIS-based automated geospatial model, and (iii) executable software to predict pine forest daily ET flux on a pixel- or plot average-scale. Study site has had long-term eddy-flux towers for ET measurements since 2006. Cloud-free Landsat images of 2006-2014 were processed using advanced data mining to obtain Principal Component bands to correlate with ET data. The regression model's r(2) was 0.58. The backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) models provided a testing/validation average absolute error of 0.18 and 0.15 Wm(-2) and average accuracy of 81% and 85%, respectively. ANN models though robust, require special ANN software and skill to operate; therefore, automated geospatial model (toolbox) was developed on ArcGIS ModelBuilder as user-friendly alternative. ET flux map developed with model tool provided consistent ET patterns for landuses. The software was developed for lay-users for ET estimation.

TI  - Landscape-Scale Aboveground Biomass Estimation in Buffer Zone Community Forests of Central Nepal: Coupling In Situ Measurements with Landsat 8 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of forest productivity status is an important indicator of the amount of biomass accumulated and the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the carbon cycle. However, accurate and up-to-date information on forest biomass and forest succession remain rudimentary within natural forests. This study sought to understand and establish the potential of a new-generation sensor in estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) stored in the natural forest, also known as community forest' or buffer zone community forest (BZCF), in the Parsa National Park, Nepal. The utility of the 30-m resolution Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and in situ data was tested using two statistical approaches, namely multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF). The analysis was done based on four computational procedures. These included spectral bands, vegetation indices and pooled dataset (spectral bands + vegetation indices), and model selected important variables. AGB estimation based on pooled data showed that the RF algorithm produced better results when compared to the use of the MLR model. For instance, the RF model estimated AGB with an R-2 value of 0.87 and a root mean square error of 20.50 t ha(-1), as well as an R-2 value of 0.95 and a RMSE of 13.3 t ha(-1) when using selected important variables. Comparatively, the MLR using pooled data produced an R-2 value of 0.56 and RMSE value of 37.01 t ha(-1). The RF model selected Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation index (OSAVI), Simple ratio (SR), Modified simple ratio (MSR), and Normalized difference Vegetation index (NDVI) as the most important variables for estimating AGB, whereas MLR selected band 5 and SR. These findings demonstrate the relevance of the relatively new Landsat 8 sensor in the estimation of AGB in community buffer zones.

TI  - Impacts of certification, uncertified concessions, and protected areas on forest loss in Cameroon, 2000 to 2013
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest fragmentation are leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Protected areas have been the leading conservation policy response, yet their scale and scope remain inadequate to meet biodiversity conservation targets. Managed forest concessions increasingly have been recognized as a complement to protected areas in meeting conservation targets. Similarly, programs for voluntary third-party certification of concession management aim to create incentives for logging companies to manage forests more sustainably. Rigorous evidence on the impacts from large-scale certification programs is thereby critical, yet detailed field observations are limited, temporally and spatially. Remotely-sensed data, in contrast, can provide repeated observations over time and at a fine spatial scale, albeit with less detail. Using the Global Forest Change dataset, we examine annual forest loss in Cameroon during 2000-2013 to assess the impact of Forest Stewardship Council certification, as well as uncertified logging concessions and national parks. We use panel regressions that control for the effects of unobserved factors that vary across space or time. We find low forest loss inside the boundaries of each management intervention, with < 1% lost over the study period. Yet those low levels of loss appear to be influenced more by a sites proximity to drivers of deforestation, such as distances to population centers or roads, than by national parks, uncertified concessions, or certification. The exception is that if a site faces high deforestation pressure, uncertified logging concessions appear to reduce forest loss. This may reflect private companies' incentives to protect rights to forest use. Such an influence of private logging companies could provide a foundation for future impacts from certification upon rates of forest loss, at least within areas that are facing elevated deforestation pressures.

TI  - The impact of different doses of indocyanine green on the sentinel lymph-node mapping in early stage endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAim of the study is to evaluate the impact of different doses of indocyanine green (ICG) on the sentinel lymph-node (SLN) mapping in endometrial cancer (EC).Materials and methodsA retrospective analysis of EC patients undergoing a laparoscopic SLN mapping at two institutions was performed. Two different injection protocols were used (protocol # 1: 5mg/ml and a volume of 8ml; protocol # 2: 1.25mg/ml and a volume of 4ml). In every case, the injection was intracervical. The laparoscopic equipment adopted was the same among both institutions. Overall and bilateral detection rates (DR) and median number of retrieved SLNs were calculated. At uni- and multivariate analysis factors (including ICG dose) associated with DR and number of detected SLNs were investigated.ResultsOverall, 168 patients were included. The overall and bilateral DR were 96.3 and 84.5%. Median number of removed SLNs was 3 (0-18). In 56% of the patients, a median number of 6 (1-93) non-SLNs (NSLNs) were removed. Seventeen (10.1%) patients had metastatic SLNs. At multivariate analysis, no factors were associated with bilateral DR. ICG dose was the only factor associated with number of removed SLNs at multivariate analysis.ConclusionA larger dose of ICG is associated with a higher number of retrieved SLNs but not with an increased bilateral DR.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Incidence of basal and squamous cell carcinoma is increasing among Korean. With increasing this incidence we need to attend the management and prevention of these cutaneous malignancies. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin malignancy. Sun exposure is the most important environmental cause of BCC. Daily sun protection especially avoiding sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. provides most effective prevention against chronic ultraviolet-induced skin damage. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors are used locally advanced and metastatic BCC lesions in Korea. Until recently, there are no reports whether it developed resistance of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors with advanced BCC in Korean patients. Among malignant skin tumors, 19.1 degrees AD were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The incidence of SCC was rapidly increased over the past years. However, the incidence rate of SCC in Japan has not been changed from the period 1976-1980 to 1986-1990. Sentinel lymph node biopsy for SCC did not provide diagnostic value. Bowen's disease and Erythroplasia of Queyrat are considered as carcinoma in situ of the skin. Erythroplasia of Queyrat have worse prognosis with a higher rate of malignant degeneration. Dermoscopy may helpful tool in assisting the noninvasive diagnosis of carcinoma in situ of the skin.

TI  - Multi-Spectral Ship Detection Using Optical, Hyperspectral, and Microwave SAR Remote Sensing Data in Coastal Regions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The necessity of efficient monitoring of ships in coastal regions has been increasing over time. Multi-satellite observations make it possible to effectively monitor vessels. This study presents the results of ship detection methodology, applied to optical, hyperspectral, and microwave satellite images in the seas around the Korean Peninsula. Spectral matching algorithms are used to detect ships using hyperspectral images with hundreds of spectral channels and investigate the similarity between the spectra and in-situ measurements. In the case of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm is used to discriminate the vessels from the backscattering coefficients of Sentinel-1B SAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR2 images. Validation results exhibited that the locations of the satellite-detected vessels showed good agreement with real-time location data within the Sentinel-1B coverage in the Korean coastal region. This study presented the probability of detection values of optical and SAR-based ship detection and discussed potential causes of the errors. This study also suggested a possibility for real-time operational use of vessel detection from multi-satellite images based on optical, hyperspectral, and SAR remote sensing, particularly in the inaccessible coastal regions off North Korea, for comprehensive coastal management and sustainability.

TI  - Prediction of Drought on Pentad Scale Using Remote Sensing Data and MJO Index through Random Forest over East Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapidly developing droughts, including flash droughts, have frequently occurred throughout East Asia in recent years, causing significant damage to agricultural ecosystems. Although many drought monitoring and warning systems have been developed in recent decades, the short-term prediction of droughts (within 10 days) is still challenging. This study has developed drought prediction models for a short-period of time (one pentad) using remote-sensing data and climate variability indices over East Asia (20 degrees-50 degrees N, 90 degrees-150 degrees E) through random forest machine learning. Satellite-based drought indices were calculated using the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The real-time multivariate (RMM) Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) indices were used because the MJO is a short timescale climate variability and has important implications for droughts in East Asia. The validation results show that those drought prediction models with the MJO variables (r similar to 0.7 on average) outperformed the original models without the MJO variables (r similar to 0.4 on average). The predicted drought index maps showed similar spatial distribution to actual drought index maps. In particular, the MJO-based models captured sudden changes in drought conditions well, from normal/wet to dry or dry to normal/wet. Since the developed models can produce drought prediction maps at high resolution (5 km) for a very short timescale (one pentad), they are expected to provide decision makers with more accurate information on rapidly changing drought conditions.

TI  - Extensive gypsy moth defoliation in Southern New England characterized using Landsat satellite observations
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern New England is currently experiencing the first major gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) defoliation event in nearly 30years. Using a novel approach based on time series of Landsat satellite observations, we generated consistent maps of gypsy moth defoliation for 2015 (first year of the outbreak), 2016 (second year of outbreak), and 2017 (third year of outbreak). Our mapped results demonstrate that the defoliation event continued through the 2017 growing season. Moreover, the affected area more than doubled in extent each year and expanded radially to encompass 4386km(2) of forested area in Rhode Island, eastern Connecticut, and central Massachusetts. The current gypsy moth outbreak is believed to be the result of a series of unusually dry springs in 2014, 2015, and 2016, which suppressed Entomophaga maimaiga, a fungal mortality agent that has historically reduced gypsy moth impacts in this region. The continuation and marked expansion of the outbreak in 2017 despite average spring rainfall suggests that caterpillars were active early in the growing season, and mortality from the fungus likely peaked after significant defoliation had already occurred. Our Landsat time series approach represents an important new source of data on spatial and temporal patterns in gypsy moth defoliation, and continued satellite-based monitoring will be essential for tracking the progress of this and other gypsy moth outbreaks.

T2  - PSIKHOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with prospects of psycholinguistic studies of discourse at the present stage of science and practice development. The characteristic of discourse approach is given, the current directions of research connected with various aspects of discourse organization and its functioning in society are reviewed. It is shown that trends in the development of this science area will be determined in many ways: by the influence of growing attention to the diversity of contexts and communicative situations, by the consideration of the psychological characteristics of communication partners, by the interest in the process of interaction and discourse effects, and also by the impact of globalization and technological changes. The development of researches on discourse types that appear because of new information technologies (SMS discourse, post-event discourse in the Internet, etc.) is projected. Personological and ethnopsycholinguistic studies on the discursive indicators of personal characteristics, ethnocultural specificity of discourse and intercultural understanding are likely to be elaborated. Discursive abilities are claimed to be equally important subject in communication studies. At the same time, the growing role of communication brings to the forefront issues of conversational strategies, tactics, and their definitions that as a whole might determine the prospects for studying interactions (live/online) in different spheres of life and optimization of conversation management. Various approaches to studying discourse effects and conceptualization of worldview in discourse are considered to be promising and practically relevant as well as research on how improve a foreign language and discursive skills. The future results might help to provide for both human-computer interaction and information-psychological security. The integrating role of cognitive studies on discourse, which brings psycholinguistics closer to neurosciences, is emphasized.

TI  - Analyzing the Mediterranean Water Cycle Via Satellite Data Integration
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water cycle components are being retrieved by an increasing number of satellite missions. However, the monitoring of the water cycle by satellite Earth Observations is still a challenge. Data sets suffer from numerous systematic and random errors and they are often not coherent with each other. We focus here on the Mediterranean basin, one of the regions most sensitive to climate change. A satellite-based analysis of the water cycle is undertaken using a collection of available satellite data sets. Our satellite data set combination uses a simple bias correction and weighted average, and provides a better water budget closure results than any raw satellite data set. Our almost purely satellite data set allows to better describe the full water cycle, not only over the continents, but also in the atmosphere and over the ocean. The limitation/possibilities of this satellite multi-component data set are described: (1) although improved, the water cycle is still not closed by satellite data and the satellite community should focus on this issue, (2) our combined data set shows good coherency with the ERA-I reanalysis which is the reference so far, both in terms of seasonal climatology and long-term trends. This means that, even if the water budget is not yet closed by satellite data, our monitoring of the water cycle using satellite observations is improving, even over complex regions such as the Mediterranean basin.

TI  - The VIIRS Sea-Ice Albedo Product Generation and Preliminary Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice albedo feedback amplifies climate change signals and thus affects the global climate. Global long-term records on sea-ice albedo are important to characterize the regional or global energy budget. As the successor of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) started its observation from October 2011 on S-NPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership). It has improved upon the capabilities of the operational Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and provides observation continuity with MODIS. We used a direct estimation algorithm to produce a VIIRS sea-ice albedo (VSIA) product, which will be operational in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) S-NPP Data Exploration (NDE) version of the VIIRS albedo product. The algorithm is developed from the angular bin regression method to simulate the sea-ice surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) from physical models, which can represent different sea-ice types and vary mixing fractions among snow, ice, and seawater. We compared the VSIA with six years of ground measurements at 30 automatic weather stations from the Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE) and the Greenland Climate Network (GC-NET) as a proxy for sea-ice albedo. The results show that the VSIA product highly agreed with the station measurements with low bias (about 0.03) and low root mean square error (RMSE) (about 0.07) considering the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) requirement is 0.05 and 0.08 at 4 km scale, respectively. We also evaluated the VSIA using two datasets of field measured sea-ice albedo from previous field campaigns. The comparisons suggest that VSIA generally matches the magnitude of the ground measurements, with a bias of 0.09 between the instantaneous albedos in the central Arctic and a bias of 0.077 between the daily mean albedos near Alaska. The discrepancy is mainly due to the scale difference at both spatial and temporal dimensions and the limited sample size. The VSIA data will serve for weather prediction applications and climate model calibrations. Combined with the historical observations from MODIS, current S-NPP VIIRS, and NOAA-20 VIIRS observations, VSIA will dramatically contribute to providing high-accuracy routine sea-ice albedo products and irreplaceable records for monitoring the long-term sea-ice albedo for climate research.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigates the suitability of Sentinel-1 data product of C-band frequency (5.36 GHz) in the estimation of terrestrial biomass. The experiment was carried out in the Perambular District, Tamil Nadu, India. The model DPSVI (Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index) was proposed based on the pattern of scatter plot constructed between the backscattering coefficient of VV (sigma(0)(vv)) and VH (sigma(0)(vh)) imageries in which the pixels representing the surface features such as vegetation, soil, and water bodies were distributed according to the theory 'Degree of Depolarization (DOP)'. The model was developed by proposing and integrating three crucial parameters (i) Inverse Dual-Pol Diagonal Distance (IDPDD) (ii) Vertical Dual De-polarization Index (VDDPI) and (iii) sigma(0)(vh) which are highly influential towards biomass extraction. The model was executed for two different seasons (wet and dry) from 2015 to 2017. The resultant output was tested with Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel 2, and the field observed Above Ground Biomass (AGB) from 50 sampling locations to demonstrate the theoretical and in-situ potential of the proposed model. The resultant product of the DPSVI has shown the acceptable R-2 value of 0.75 for the dry season and 0.73 for the wet season with NDVI and got R-2 value of 0.73 for the dry and R-2 value of 0.70 for the wet season with AGB which manifested that the proposed model was an effective indicator of terrestrial vegetation irrespective of seasons.

TI  - Development of Information Evaluation System for Smart City Planning Using Geoinformatics Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a continuous process, which transforms the traditional setup into the modern era. Uneven population growth over the next 3decades is expected in cities. In this context, the new technology-based solutions are desirable, which can provide more efficient and robust approaches for urban infrastructure planning. Keeping these visions, the smart city concept is evolving in the developing countries like India, which appears a new paradigm of systematic intelligent urban infrastructure planning in the city. This research work comprises of grids-based, eight different land use and infrastructure-related information evaluation systems namely urban settlements information evaluation system, water resource information evaluation system, urban green space information evaluation system, intelligent transportation information evaluation system, basic infrastructure information evaluation system, power distribution information evaluation system, telecommunication mast information evaluation system and city surveillance information evaluation system for the development of smart city priority zones in the Bhopal city, capital of Madhya Pradesh, India. The LISS IV and Cartosat 1 sensor digital Image data along with ancillary data were used. The GPS survey was carried out to confirm ground realities, and digital intelligent map was prepared for various utilities after integration of thematic layers. The geostatistical analysis and weights-based methods were used for the creation of information evaluation system for city planning. The investigation of results have shown that various parameters related to smart city planning can be analyzed in a more efficient manner by dividing the area into an appropriate size grid. The spatial integration of information evaluation systems were carried out and areas were divided into low-, medium- and high-priority zones. These prominent categories such as high-priority zones covered the 14% of the study area, similarly medium-priority zones covered the 34% of the study area and low-priority zones covered the 52% of the study area. This research work investigations are very useful for the formulation of new strategic plans, in order to achieve better land use and infrastructure features utilization for the smart city planning.

TI  - Tree Species Classification with Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 program provides the opportunity to monitor terrestrial ecosystems with a high temporal and spectral resolution. In this study, a multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data set was used to classify common tree species over a mature forest in central Sweden. The tree species to be classified were Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus silvestris), Hybrid larch (Larix x marschlinsii), Birch (Betula sp.) and Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Four Sentinel-2 images from spring (7 April and 27 May), summer (9 July) and fall (19 October) of 2017 were used along with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. A variable selection approach was implemented to find fewer and uncorrelated bands resulting in the best model for tree species identification. The final model resulting in the highest overall accuracy (88.2%) came from using all bands from the four image dates. The single image that gave the most accurate classification result (80.5%) was the late spring image (27 May); the 27 May image was always included in subsequent image combinations that gave the highest overall accuracy. The five tree species were classified with a user's accuracy ranging from 70.9% to 95.6%. Thirteen of the 40 bands were selected in a variable selection procedure and resulted in a model with only slightly lower accuracy (86.3%) than that using all bands. Among the highest ranked bands were the red edge bands 2 and 3 as well as the narrow NIR (near-infrared) band 8a, all from the 27 May image, and SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands from all four image dates. This study shows that the red-edge bands and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 are of importance, and confirms that spring and/or fall images capturing phenological differences between the species are most useful to tree species classification.

TI  - Real-Time Prediction of Crop Yields From MODIS Relative Vegetation Health: A Continent-Wide Analysis of Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing countries often have poor monitoring and reporting of weather and crop health, leading to slow responses to droughts and food shortages. Here, I develop satellite analysis methods and software tools to predict crop yields two to four months before the harvest. This method measures relative vegetation health based on pixel-level monthly anomalies of NDVI, EVI and NDWI indices. Because no crop mask, tuning, or subnational ground truth data are required, this method can be applied to any location, crop, or climate, making it ideal for African countries with small fields and poor ground observations. Testing began in Illinois where there is reliable county-level crop data. Correlations were computed between corn, soybean, and sorghum yields and monthly vegetation health anomalies for every county and year. A multivariate regression using every index and month (up to 1600 values) produced a correlation of 0.86 with corn, 0.74 for soybeans, and 0.65 for sorghum, all with p-values less than 10(-6). The high correlations in Illinois show that this model has good forecasting skill for crop yields. Next, the method was applied to every country in Africa for each country's main crops. Crop production was then predicted for the 2018 harvest and compared to actual production values. Twenty percent of the predictions had less than 2% error, and 40% had less than 5% error. This method is unique because of its simplicity and versatility: it shows that a single user on a laptop computer can produce reasonable real-time estimates of crop yields across an entire continent.

We use satellite data on night light luminosity at municipality and electoral district level as a proxy for economic activity, applying synthetic control methods for estimation. For the average World Cup municipality, we find significantly positive, short-run effects before the tournament, corresponding to a reduction of unemployment by 1.3 percentage points. At the electoral district level, we reveal distinct effect heterogeneity, where especially investments in transport infrastructure are shown to have long-lasting, positive effects, particularly in rural areas.

TI  - Improving the Seasonal Representation of ASCAT Soil Moisture and Vegetation Dynamics in a Temperate Climate
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous validation studies have demonstrated the accuracy of the Metop-A ASCAT soil moisture (SM) product, although over- and underestimation during different seasons of the year suggest a need for improving the retrieval algorithm. In this study, we analyzed whether adapting the vegetation characterization based on global parameters to regional conditions improves the seasonal representation of SM and vegetation optical depth (tau). SM and t are retrieved from ASCAT using both a seasonal (mean climatological) and a dynamic vegetation characterization that allows for year-to-year changes. The retrieved SM and tau are compared with in situ and satellite SM, and with vegetation products (SMAP, AMSR2, and SPOT-VGT/PROBA-V). The study region is set in an agricultural area of Lower Austria that is characterized by heterogeneous land cover and topography, and features an experimental catchment equipped with a SM network (HOAL SoilNet). We found that a stronger vegetation correction within the SM retrieval improves the SM product considerably (increase of the Spearman correlation coefficient r(s) by 0.15 on average, and r(s) comparable to SMAP and AMSR2). The vegetation product derived with a dynamic vegetation characterization compares well to the reference datasets and reflects vegetation dynamics such as start and peak of season and harvest. Although some vegetation effects cannot be corrected by the adapted vegetation characterization, our results demonstrate the benefits of a parameterization optimized for regional conditions in this temperate climate zone.

TI  - A Novel Hybrid Swarm Optimized Multilayer Neural Network for Spatial Prediction of Flash Floods in Tropical Areas Using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery and Geospatial Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are widely recognized as one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world, therefore prediction of flash flood-prone areas is crucial for public safety and emergency management. This research proposes a new methodology for spatial prediction of flash floods based on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and a new hybrid machine learning technique. The SAR imagery is used to detect flash flood inundation areas, whereas the new machine learning technique, which is a hybrid of the firefly algorithm (FA), Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation, and an artificial neural network (named as FA-LM-ANN), was used to construct the prediction model. The Bac Ha Bao Yen (BHBY) area in the northwestern region of Vietnam was used as a case study. Accordingly, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database was constructed using 12 input variables (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, toposhade, stream density, rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, and lithology) and subsequently the output of flood inundation areas was mapped. Using the database and FA-LM-ANN, the flash flood model was trained and verified. The model performance was validated via various performance metrics including the classification accuracy rate, the area under the curve, precision, and recall. Then, the flash flood model that produced the highest performance was compared with benchmarks, indicating that the combination of FA and LM backpropagation is proven to be very effective and the proposed FA-LM-ANN is a new and useful tool for predicting flash flood susceptibility.

TI  - ORNAMENTATION OF CERAMICS FROM STRUCTURES OF SHELOMOK II SETTLEMENT
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its widespread nature and applicability of statistical comparison methods, ceramics is one of the essential elements in cultural attribution of monuments and general description of an ancient culture. The analysis focuses on ornaments. The article describes remnants of ceramic tableware from Shelomok II, a settlement of the Early Iron Age (Tomsk District, Tomsk Oblast). Being important for understanding the history of the Upper Ob region, this monument has been studied repeatedly since the 1970s. A variety of artifacts, including armaments, equestrian equipment, bronze casting, and artifacts that shed light on the worldview of the ancient local population, have been analysed. Results of this analysis have been published in sufficient detail. As for the ceramic items discovered in Shelomok, the fmdings are published only on the basis of excavations in 1972, 1973 and, partly, 2001. This article compares ornaments of ceramics from six excavated hollows and a cultural horizon of the archaeological monument Shelomok II. The analysis is aimed at giving a general description of these ornaments using statistical comparison methods. Based on the results of the study, ten groups of ornaments (78 compositions) can be identified. The classification is based on the presence or absence of pearls in ornamentation. Groups 1-4 include vessels with ornaments consisting of pearls in combination with other elements (61.4%). Group 1 includes two subgroups A and B. Subgroup A is represented by ornaments with pure pearls, which encircle a vessel in one row (17.4%). Subgroup B comprises vessels decorated with pearls that are separated by specific elements (holes, carved lines, combs, triangles) in a single row (12.4%). Group 2 includes pearls and impressions of triangular and square sticks (16% of vessels). Group 3 is represented by pearls with comb impressions (7%). Group 4 comprises pearls with carved lines (8.9%). Groups 5 and 6 include through holes and pierced pearls in combination with other elements (7.7%). Groups 1-6 (ornamentation of vessels with pearls, pierced pearls and through holes) account for 75.6% of the vessels. Utensils from the cultural horizon and the hollows are similar in terms of ornamentation: utensils with pearls, pierced pearls and through holes make up 78% in the cultural horizon and 75.6% in the hollows. The other four groups, which do not have pearls, pierced pearls or through holes in ornamentation, account for 24.4% of the vessels. The analysis of the ceramics in individual structures revealed some specific features of ornamentation, which can be explained by several reasons: purpose of structures (dwellings, production facilities, buildings of worship), family and marital relations, the presence of foreign population (other than local residents), other ethnic and cultural components from different archaeological cultures. In general, the author has concluded that this ornamentation of ceramic vessels is typical of the Early Iron Age cultures located in southern taiga, forest-steppe and steppe zones of Western and Southern Siberia. This conclusion confirms that the Shelomok culture, including one of its monuments, Shelomok II settlement, can be attributed to these cultures.

TI  - The Role of Close Relationships in Terror Management: A Systematic Review and Research Agenda
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Terror management theory outlines how humans seek self-esteem and worldview validation to manage death-related anxiety. Accumulating evidence reveals that close relationships serve a similar role. However, to date, there has been no synthesis of the literature that delineates when close relationships buffer mortality concerns, under what conditions, on which specific outcomes, and for whom. This systematic review presents over two decades of research to address these questions. Findings from 73 reviewed studies revealed that close relationships serve an important role in buffering death-related anxiety. A range of dispositional and situational moderating factors influence either the activation or inhibition of relational strivings to manage heightened death awareness, the most influential being attachment, gender, and relationship-contingent self-esteem. These findings were integrated into an overarching model that highlights some of the conditions under which mortality salience (MS) influences relational outcomes. We conclude by highlighting a range of theoretical and methodological concerns to be addressed by future research.

TI  - Accelerated partial breast irradiation with perioperative multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy-A feasibility study
T2  - BRACHYTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of high-dose-rate perioperative multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in selected patients with early breast cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Perioperative multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy for APBI has been used at our department since 2012 for patients with low-risk breast cancer. Interstitial catheters were inserted perioperatively via hollow needles immediately following tumorectomy with sentinel node biopsy. APBI started on Day 6 after surgery. The prescribed dose was 34 Gy (10 fractions of 3.4 Gy bid). Hormonal therapy was prescribed in all cases.RESULTS: Between June 2012 and December 2017, 125 patients were scheduled for APBI. Of these, APBI was not performed in 12 patients (9.6%) due to adverse prognostic factors identified on the definitive biopsy. We observed wound dehiscence in 2/113 cases (1.8%), inflammatory complications requiring antibiotics in 7/113 cases (6.2%), transient Grade I radiodermatitis in 6/113 patients (4.4%), and seroma which resolved spontaneously in 3/113 patients (2.7%). With median followup of 39 months (range 3.3-75.3) no relapses were observed. No late complications in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 3 or higher were documented. Cosmetic outcome in patients with followup > 2 years was excellent or good in 92%.CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results show that the perioperative multicatheter interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy for APBI in selected patients with early breast cancer is feasible. This treatment schedule reduces treatment duration, spares the patients of repeated anesthesia, and enables precise application of the afterloading tubes under direct visual control.

TI  - The Intensity of Wildfires in Fire Emissions Estimates
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for estimating direct wildfire emissions that considers fire intensity based on infrared radiation data from the Terra/MODIS satellite is proposed. In Siberia, we experimentally established that low intensity fires cover 47 +/- 13% of the total area; that with moderate intensity, 42 +/- 10%; and that with high-intensity, 10 +/- 6%. The average value of wildfire emissions in Siberia is estimated at 83 +/- 21 ?g C/yr (2002-2016), which is considerably lower than the values determined by standard procedure (112 +/- 25 ?g C/yr). Based on the trend of long-term dynamics of fire emissions in Siberia, a probable level of emissions in 2100 is calculated when implementing climate scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.0, and RCP8.5 (220, 700, and 2300 ?g C/yr, respectively).

TI  - The rationale for and long-term outcome of incomplete axillary staging in elderly women with primary breast cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The proportion of elderly women diagnosed with breast cancer is rising. Standard treatment, including axillary staging, is often not given to these patients. This study aimed to investigate reasons to omit any surgical axillary staging or to refrain from completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) after positive-sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); so-called "incomplete staging". Furthermore, the impact of incomplete staging on regional control and survival in patients aged 75 or older was evaluated.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted including all primary breast cancer patients aged 75 or older, diagnosed between 2001 and 2008, and documented by the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Patients with incomplete staging were compared to patients with complete axillary staging. Survival analyses were used to determine the risk of local, regional and distant recurrence and overall survival.Results: In total, 1467 of 2116 (69%) patients were considered eligible, of whom 258 (17.2%) had incomplete axillary staging. For 93 patients, diagnosed in 6 of the 10 hospitals in the NCR-area, examination of clinical records revealed that age, comorbidities and patient preferences were the main reason for omitting complete axillary staging. The 10-year axillary recurrence rate in these 93 patients was 5.2% (95% CI, 0.03-10.1). Of the 77 patients who had died, 64 (83%) died of non-breast-cancer-related causes. No significant difference in overall survival was observed between patients with or without complete axillary staging.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the omission of complete axillary staging is common in selected elderly breast cancer patients with >= 2 comorbidities, with no apparent impact on regional control and 10-year overall survival.

TI  - Estimating Evapotranspiration in a Post-Fire Environment Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the hydrological cycle, evapotranspiration (ET) transfers moisture from the land surface to the atmosphere and is sensitive to disturbances such as wildfires. Ground-based pre- and post-fire measurements of ET are often unavailable, limiting the potential to understand the extent of wildfire impacts on the hydrological cycle. This research estimated both pre- and post-fire ET using remotely sensed variables and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Input variables (land surface temperature, modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, normalized burn ratio, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, albedo and vegetation types) were used to train and develop 56 combinations that yielded 33 unique SVM models to predict actual ET. The models were trained to predict a spatial ET, the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), for the 2003 Coyote Fire in San Diego, California (USA). The optimal SVM model, SVM-ET6, required six input variables and predicted ET for fifteen years with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 8.43 mm/month and a R-2 of 0.89. The developed model was transferred and applied to the 2003 Old Fire in San Bernardino, California (USA), where a watershed balance approach was used to validate SVM-ET6 predictions. The annual water balance for ten out of fifteen years was within +/- 20% of the predicted values. This work demonstrated machine learning as a viable method to create a remotely-sensed estimate with wide applicability for regions with sparse data observations and information. This innovative work demonstrated the potential benefit for land and forest managers to understand and analyze the hydrological cycle of watersheds that experience acute disturbances based on this developed predictive ET model.

TI  - The long-term prognostic impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma: a prospective study with 10-year follow-up
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) is widely accepted for staging of melanoma patients. It has been shown that clinico-pathological features such as Breslow thickness, ulceration, age, and sex are better predictors of relapse and survival than SLN status alone. The aims of this study were to evaluate the long-term (10-year) prognostic impact of SLNB and to determine predictive factors associated with SLN metastasis, relapse, and melanoma specific mortality (MSM).Methods: This was a prospective observational study on 289 consecutive patients with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent SLNB from January 2000 to December 2007, and followed until January 2014, at an Italian academic hospital.Results: SLN was positive in 64 patients (22.1%). The median follow-up was 116 months (79-147 months). Ten-year disease-free survival and melanoma specific survival were poor in patients with positive SLN (58.7% and 66.4%, respectively). Only the increasing Breslow thickness resulted independently associated to an increased risk of SLN metastasis. Cox regression analysis showed that a Breslow thickness >2 mm was an independent predictor of relapse, and male sex and Breslow thickness >2 mm was a predictor of MSM. At 10 years, SLN metastasis was not significantly associated to either relapse or MSM.Conclusion: After the fifth year of follow-up, SLN metastasis is not an independent predictive factor of relapse or mortality which are mainly influenced by the characteristics of the primary tumor and of the patient. Patients with a Breslow thickness >2 mm regardless of the SLN status should be considered at high risk for 10-year relapse and mortality.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment for Detection and Monitoring of Coastline Dynamics with Temporal RADARSAT Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to detect coastline changes using temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for the state of Kelantan, Malaysia. Two active images, namely, RADARSAT-1 captured in 2003 and RADARSAT-2 captured in 2014, were used to monitor such changes. We applied noise removal and edge detection filtering on RADARSAT images for preprocessing to remove salt and pepper distortion. Different segmentation analyses were also applied to the filtered images. Firstly, multiresolution segmentation, maximum spectral difference and chessboard segmentation were performed to separate land pixels from ocean ones. Next, the Taguchi method was used to optimise segmentation parameters. Subsequently, a support vector machine algorithm was applied on the optimised segments to classify shorelines with an accuracy of 98% for both temporal images. Results were validated using a thematic map from the Department of Survey and Mapping of Malaysia. The change detection showed an average difference in the shoreline of 12.5 m between 2003 and 2014. The methods developed in this study demonstrate the ability of active SAR sensors to map and detect shoreline changes, especially during low or high tides in tropical regions where passive sensor imagery is often masked by clouds.

TI  - Predictors of electric vehicle adoption: An analysis of potential electric vehicle drivers in Austria
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), such as purchase price, range limitation, and charging infrastructure are diminishing, sales growth has still fallen short of industry expectations. As industry and governments have an interest in counteracting this negative trend by incentivizing EV purchasing, a better understanding of potential EV adopters and drivers of early adoption becomes paramount for designing effective and efficient incentive schemes. Therefore, drawing on a representative survey of Austrian citizens, this study analyzes early adopters, potential adopters, and non-adopters of EVs. Findings indicate that psychological and, to a lesser extent, socio-demographic factors play a significant role in predicting EV adoption. Non-adopters are more likely to have an individualistic and less egalitarian worldview, and also, compared to early adopters, to fall short in terms of pro-environmental and pro-technological attitude. Further, early adopters are inclined to live in regions with EV policy incentives. Using cluster analysis, this study identifies four groups of potential EV adopters based on their evaluation of EV purchasing and non-purchasing motives. The potential-adopter segments differ considerably in their socio-demographic and psychological characteristics, as well as in their preferences for policy incentives. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of effective policy schemes and marketing measures.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite aerosol retrievals with in situ aircraft and ground measurements: Contribution of relative humidity
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of relative humidity (RH) on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) was investigated based on in-situ aircraft and ground observations of aerosol and RH from 2007 to 2010 in Beijing, China. The profiles of dry aerosol particle number and size distributions with diameter ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 mu m as well as RH were observed during aircraft measurement. The calculated AOD based on aircraft observed dry aerosol particles is lower than MODIS AOD under high RH, but consistent with MODIS AOD after accounting for the aerosol hygroscopic growth effect. A comparison of ground PM2.5 and MODIS AOD further shows that the ratio of PM2.5 concentration to AOD decreases with RH. These results collectively suggest that a strong aerosol hygroscopic growth effect on AOD. The averaged contribution of RH (hygroscopic growth) on AOD are estimated as 37% and 22% respectively based on in-situ aircraft and ground measurements, and hence aerosol concentration would be overestimated if the aerosol hygroscopic growth effect is neglected. As a result, it should be cautious with the applications of AOD in studying the complex relationships between aerosol and its climatic effects.

TI  - Using Landsat-8 Images for Quantifying Suspended Sediment Concentration in Red River (Northern Vietnam)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the trends in the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in riverine surface water enables better understanding of the hydromorphological properties of its watersheds and the associated processes. Thus, it is critical to identify an appropriate method to quantify spatio-temporal variability in SSC. This study aims to estimate SSC in a highly turbid river, i.e., the Red River in Northern Vietnam, using Landsat 8 (L8) images. To do so, in situ radiometric data together with SSC at 60 sites along the river were measured on two different dates during the dry and wet seasons. Analyses of the in situ data indicated strong correlations between SSC and the band-ratio of green and red channels, i.e., r-squared = 0.75 and a root mean square error of similar to 0.3 mg/L. Using a subsample of in situ radiometric data (n = 30) collected near-concurrently with one L8 image, four different atmospheric correction methods were evaluated. Although none of the methods provided reasonable water-leaving reflectance spectra (rho(w)), it was found that the band-ratio of the green-red ratio is less sensitive to uncertainties in the atmospheric correction for mapping SSC compared to individual bands. Therefore, due to its ease of access, standard L8 land surface reflectance products available via U.S. Geological Survey web portals were utilized. With the empirical relationship derived, we produced Landsat-derived SSC distribution maps for a few images collected in wet and dry seasons within the 2013-2017 period. Analyses of image products suggest that (a) the Thao River is the most significant source amongst the three major tributaries (Lo, Da and Thao rivers) providing suspended load to the Red River, and (b) the suspended load in the rainy season is nearly twice larger than that in the dry season, and it correlates highly with the runoff (correlation coefficient = 0.85). Although it is demonstrated that the atmospheric correction in tropical areas over these sediment-rich waters present major challenges in the retrievals of water-leaving reflectance spectra, the study signifies the utility of band-ratio techniques for quantifying SSC in highly turbid river waters. With Sentinel-2A/B data products combined with those of Landsat-8, it would be possible to capture temporal variability in major river systems in the near future.

AB  - Oil spill detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images plays a crucial role in oil slick monitoring on the sea surface. In addition to oil spills, SAR images incorporate a large number of similar phenomena called "lookalikes". Choosing a method of discriminating between oil spills and lookalikes with high accuracy is a necessity. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed for discrimination between oil spills and lookalikes, which consists of the following four main parts. 1) Dark spot detection in SAR images. 2) Shape-based feature extraction of oil spills and lookalikes selected from dark spots in the previous stage. 3) Feature transformation using the NMF algorithm. 4) Classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it was tested on the several real SAR images. This algorithm was able to provide promising results for both dark spot detection and oil spill classification. The average error rate of dark spot detection for a typical image was 1.31% and it could discriminate between oil spills and lookalikes with an average accuracy of 96.31% using feature transformation modes after transforming the features and classifying them using the K-nearest neighbor classifier.

TI  - An Unsupervised Classification Algorithm for Multi-Temporal Irrigated Area Mapping in Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sound water resources planning and management requires adequate data with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. This is especially true in the context of irrigated agriculture, which is one of the main consumptive users of the world's freshwater resources. Existing remote sensing methods for the management of irrigated agricultural systems are often based on empirical cropland data that are difficult to obtain, and that put into question the transferability of mapping algorithms in space and time. Here we implement an automatic irrigation mapping procedure in Google Earth Engine that uses surface reflectance satellite imagery from different sensors. The method is based on unsupervised training of a pixel-by-pixel classification algorithm within image regions identified through unsupervised object-based segmentation, followed by multi-temporal image analysis to distinguish productive irrigated fields from non-productive and non-irrigated areas. Ground-based data are not required. The final output of the mapping algorithm are monthly and annual irrigation maps (30 m resolution). The novel method is applied to the Central Asian Chu and Talas River Basins that are shared between upstream Kyrgyzstan and downstream Kazakhstan. We calculate the development of irrigated areas from 2000 to 2017 and assess the classification results in terms of robustness and accuracy. Based on seven available validation scenes (in total more than 2.5 million pixels) the classification accuracy is 77-96%. We show that on the Kyrgyz side of the Talas basin, the identified increasing trends over the years are highly significant (23% area increase between 2000 and 2017). In the Kazakh parts of the basins the irrigated acreages are relatively stable over time, but the average irrigation frequency within Soviet-era irrigation perimeters is very low, which points to a poor physical condition of the irrigation infrastructure and inadequate water supply.

TI  - Confronting Soil Moisture Dynamics from the ORCHIDEE Land Surface Model With the ESA-CCI Product: Perspectives for Data Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays a key role in water, carbon and energy exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere. Therefore, a better representation of this variable in the Land-Surface Models (LSMs) used in climate modelling could significantly reduce the uncertainties associated with future climate predictions. In this study, the ESA-CCI soil moisture (SM) combined product (v4.2) has been confronted to the simulated top-first layers/cms of the ORCHIDEE LSM (the continental part of the IPSL Earth System Model) for the years 2008-2016, to evaluate its potential to improve the model using data assimilation techniques. The ESA-CCI data are first rescaled to match the climatology of the model and the signal representative depth is selected. Results are found to be relatively consistent over the first 20 cm of the model. Strong correlations found between the model and the ESA-CCI product show that ORCHIDEE can adequately reproduce the observed SM dynamics. As well as considering two different atmospheric forcings to drive the model, we consider two different model parameterizations related to the soil resistance to evaporation. The correlation metric is shown to be more sensitive to the choice of meteorological forcing than to the choice of model parameterization. Therefore, the metric is not optimal in highlighting structural deficiencies in the model. In contrast, the temporal autocorrelation metric is shown to be more sensitive to this model parameterization, making the metric a potential candidate for future data assimilation experiments.

TI  - Appraisal of the groundwater balance components from multi-remote sensing datasets in a semi-arid region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-arid regions across the globe are fronting water crises, signaling a challenge to ensure future water security. Given the high inter-seasonal rainfall variability and unrestrained groundwater extraction, the precise quantification of groundwater flow components in an aquifer system is a priority. To address this challenge, we used high-resolution remote sensing (RS) data (Landsat and IRS) and GIS modeling (SEBAL, ArcCN) to spatially quantify major groundwater balance (GWB) components, viz., evapotranspiration (ET), rainfall recharge (R), surface runoff (Q), groundwater extraction (PG), irrigation return flow (IRF), and ultimately changes in groundwater storage (S) in a small semi-arid crystalline representative watershed. Results show that a total of similar to 230mm of groundwater is extracted during 2008-2009, creating a negative impact on the groundwater resource, which is further enhanced by limited recharge and high ET. A decrease of approximately 65mm in groundwater storage is observed in a single hydrological year, and given a very low specific yield, this decrease will introduce large water level decline. The study establishes that declining groundwater level in the watershed is a direct result of over-extraction, and owing to this scenario, efficient irrigation and land use policies are suggested as potential approaches to minimize extraction specifically in the dry season. Our methodology provides a systematic assessment of vital GWB components at a high spatial resolution and an insight on various sustainable mitigation methods. This methodology is useful in the planning and management of groundwater resources, particularly in water-stressed areas.

TI  - It's not easy assessing greenness: A comparison of NDVI datasets and neighborhood types and their associations with self-rated health in New York City
T2  - HEALTH & PLACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that exposure to greenness benefits health, but studies assess greenness differently. We hypothesize greenness-health associations vary by exposure assessment method. To test this, we considered four vegetation datasets (three Normalized Difference Vegetation Index datasets with different spatial resolutions and a finely-resolved land cover dataset), and six aggregation units (five radial buffer sizes and self-described neighborhoods) of each dataset. We compared associations of self-rated health and these metrics of greenness among a sample of New York City residents. Associations with self-rated health varied more by aggregation unit than by vegetation dataset; larger buffers and self-described neighborhoods showed more positive associations. Researchers should consider spatial exposure misclassification in future greenness and health research.

TI  - Evaluation of Sensor and Environmental Factors Impacting the Use of Multiple Sensor Data for Time-Series Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many remote sensing sensors operate in similar spatial and spectral regions, which provides an opportunity to combine the data from different sensors to increase the temporal resolution for short and long-term trend analysis. However, combining the data requires understanding the characteristics of different sensors and presents additional challenges due to their variation in operational strategies, sensor differences and environmental conditions. These differences can introduce large variability in the time-series analysis, limiting the ability to model, predict and separate real change in signal from noise. Although the research community has identified the factors that cause variations, the magnitude or the effect of these factors have not been well explored and this is due to the limitations with the real-world data, where the effects of the factors cannot be separated. Our work mitigates these shortcomings by simulating the surface, atmosphere, and sensors in a virtual environment. We modeled and characterized a deciduous forest canopy and estimated its at-sensor response for the Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel 2 (S2) sensors using the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) modeled atmosphere. This paper presents the methods, analysis and the sensitivity of the factors that impacts multi-sensor observations for temporal analysis. Our study finds that atmospheric compensation is necessary as the variation due to the atmosphere can introduce an uncertainty as high as 40% in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products used in change detection and time-series applications. The effect due to the differences in the Relative Spectral Response (RSR) of the two sensors, if not compensated, can introduce uncertainty as high as 20% in the NDVI products. The view angle differences between the sensors can introduce uncertainty anywhere from 9% to 40% in NDVI depending on the atmospheric compensation methods. For a difference of 5 days in acquisition, the effect of solar zenith angle can vary between 4% to 10%, depending on whether the atmospheric attenuations are compensated or not for the NDVI products.

TI  - Short-term effects of desert and non-desert PM10 on mortality in Sicily, Italy
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Increased PM10 concentrations are commonly observed during Saharan dust advections. Limited epidemiological evidence suggests that PM10 from anthropogenic and desert sources increase mortality. We aimed to evaluate the association between source-specific PM10 (non-desert and desert) and cause-specific mortality in Sicily during 2006-2012 period.Methods: Daily PM10 concentrations at 1-km(2) were estimated in Sicily using satellite-based data, fixed monitors and land use variables. We identified Saharan dust episodes using meteorological models, back-trajectories, aerosol maps, and satellite images. For each dust day, we estimated desert and non-desert PM10 concentrations. We applied a time-series approach on 390 municipalities of Sicily to estimate the association between PM10 (non-desert and desert) and daily cause-specific mortality.Results: 33% of all days were affected by Saharan dust advections. PM10 concentrations were 8 mu g/m(3) higher during dust days compared to other days. We found positive associations of both non-desert and desert PM10 with cause-specific mortality. We estimated percent increases of risk (IR%) of non-accidental mortality equal to 2.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.4, 3.1) and 3.8% (3.2, 4.4), per 10 mu g/m(3) increases in non-desert and desert PM10 at lag 0-5, respectively. We also observed significant associations with cardiovascular (2.4% [1.3, 3.4] and 4.5% [3.8, 5.3]) and respiratory mortality (8.1% [6.8, 9.5], and 6.3% [5.4, 7.2]). We estimated higher effects during April-September, with IR% = 4.4% (3.2, 5.7) and 6.3% (5.4, 7.2) for non-desert and desert PM10, respectively.Conclusions: Our results confirm previous evidence of harmful effects of desert PM10 on non-accidental and cardio-respiratory mortality, especially during the warm season.

TI  - Assessing Pasture Degradation in the Brazilian Cerrado Based on the Analysis of MODIS NDVI Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Around 55% of all Brazilian cattle production is located in the Cerrado biome, which also contains the largest pasture area in Brazil. Previous studies indicated that about 60% of these pastures were degraded by 2010. However, up-to-date and more precise estimates are necessary to access the extent and degree of degradation of the Cerrado pastures, since these areas constitute strategic land reserves for both livestock intensification and soybean expansion. Therefore, in this study, we estimated the area of degraded pastures in the Cerrado by analyzing the trends of cumulative NDVI anomalies over time used as a proxy for pasture degradation. The generated slope surface was segmented into two classes, comprising non-degraded and degraded pastures, which were correlated with socio-economic and biophysical variables. According to our study, around 46% of the Cerrado pastures are currently degraded, encompassing 37 million hectares, mostly in areas with a cattle carrying capacity below 1.0 AU ha(-1). These areas, distributed in the northwest Cerrado, mostly within the Brazilian states of MaranhAo, Piaui, and Bahia (i.e., Matopiba region), tend to be associated with decreasing rainfall patterns and low investments in soil conservation practices. The degraded areas also tend to be concentrated in municipalities with low human development indices (HDI).

TI  - Importance of Remotely-Sensed Vegetation Variables for Predicting the Spatial Distribution of African Citrus Triozid (<i>Trioza erytreae</i>) in Kenya
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Citrus is considered one of the most important fruit crops globally due to its contribution to food and nutritional security. However, the production of citrus has recently been in decline due to many biological, environmental, and socio-economic constraints. Amongst the biological ones, pests and diseases play a major role in threatening citrus quantity and quality. The most damaging disease in Kenya, is the African citrus greening disease (ACGD) or Huanglongbing (HLB) which is transmitted by the African citrus triozid (ACT), Trioza erytreae. HLB in Kenya is reported to have had the greatest impact on citrus production in the highlands, causing yield losses of 25% to 100%. This study aimed at predicting the occurrence of ACT using an ecological habitat suitability modeling approach. Specifically, we tested the contribution of vegetation phenological variables derived from remotely-sensed (RS) data combined with bio-climatic and topographical variables (BCL) to accurately predict the distribution of ACT in citrus-growing areas in Kenya. A MaxEnt (maximum entropy) suitability modeling approach was used on ACT presence-only data. Forty-seven (47) ACT observations were collected while 23 BCL and 12 RS covariates were used as predictor variables in the MaxEnt modeling. The BCL variables were extracted from the WorldClim data set, while the RS variables were predicted from vegetation phenological time-series data (spanning the years 2014-2016) and annually-summed land surface temperature (LST) metrics (2014-2016). We developed two MaxEnt models; one including both the BCL and the RS variables (BCL-RS) and another with only the BCL variables. Further, we tested the relationship between ACT habitat suitability and the surrounding land use/land cover (LULC) proportions using a random forest regression model. The results showed that the combined BCL-RS model predicted the distribution and habitat suitability for ACT better than the BCL-only model. The overall accuracy for the BCL-RS model result was 92% (true skills statistic: TSS = 0.83), whereas the BCL-only model had an accuracy of 85% (TSS = 0.57). Also, the results revealed that the proportion of shrub cover surrounding citrus orchards positively influenced the suitability probability of the ACT. These results provide a resourceful tool for precise, timely, and site-specific implementation of ACGD control strategies.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater nitrate contamination hazard in a semi-arid region by using integrated parametric IPNOA and data-driven logistic regression models
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater hazard assessments involve many activities dealing with the impacts of pollution on groundwater, such as human health studies and environment modelling. Nitrate contamination is considered a hazard to human health, environment and ecosystem. In groundwater management, the hazard should be assessed before any action can be taken, particularly for groundwater pollution and water quality. Thus, pollution due to the presence of nitrate poses considerable hazard to drinking water, and excessive nutrient loads deteriorate the ecosystem. The parametric IPNOA model is one of the well-known methods used for evaluating nitrate content. However, it cannot predict the effect of soil and land use/land cover (LULC) types on calculations relying on parametric well samples. Therefore, in this study, the parametric model was trained and integrated with the multivariate data-driven model with different levels of information to assess groundwater nitrate contamination in Saladin, Iraq. The IPNOA model was developed with 185 different well samples and contributing parameters. Then, the IPNOA model was integrated with the logistic regression (LR) model to predict the nitrate contamination levels. Geographic information system techniques were also used to assess the spatial prediction of nitrate contamination. High-resolution SPOT-5 satellite images with 5 m spatial resolution were processed by object-based image analysis and support vector machine algorithm to extract LULC. Mapping of potential areas of nitrate contamination was examined using receiver operating characteristic assessment. Results indicated that the optimised LR-IPNOA model was more accurate in determining and analysing the nitrate hazard concentration than the standalone IPNOA model. This method can be easily replicated in other areas that have similar climatic condition. Therefore, stakeholders in planning and environmental decision makers could benefit immensely from the proposed method of this research, which can be potentially used for a sustainable management of urban, industrialised and agricultural sectors.

TI  - Investigating the impact of overlying vegetation canopy structures on fire radiative power (FRP) retrieval through simulation and measurement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire radiative power (FRP) retrievals are now routinely made from polar and geostationary instruments, providing a means to estimate fuel consumption and trace gas and aerosol emissions directly from remotely sensed observations. This study presents the first investigation of the impact of vegetation canopy structure (percentage canopy cover and leaf area index, LAI) on FRP retrievals, based on 3D radiative transfer model simulations. The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is used to simulate above-canopy observations made through 3D vegetation canopies with different structural arrangements, under which a centrally positioned uniform landscape fire is burning. The vegetation canopy is modelled in two ways, as an opaque structure and as a hybrid turbid medium. The percentage canopy cover in each simulated scene is varied between 5 and 95%, and the FRP retrieved above the canopy is found to decrease in proportion to percentage canopy cover when the canopy is opaque, a finding that is in agreement with a series of small scale outdoor measurements conducted to evaluate the realism of the simulations. However, when the canopy is modelled as a turbid medium, which is in some ways a more realistic representation of a real 'gappy' vegetation canopy, the degree of FRP interception occurring at any particular canopy cover decreases by similar to 14%, due to some fire emitted thermal energy being transmitted through the canopy gaps. The simulations also reveal the impact of canopy LAI on above-canopy FRP retrievals, reducing these by 6% when both canopy cover and LAI are low (5% and < 1.0 respectively), but by up to 92% when canopy cover and scene LAI are high (95% and similar to 8 respectively). We use the derived relationships between FRP interception and canopy structure, along with MODIS LAI and percentage tree cover data, to adjust 2004-2012 fire radiative energy (FRE) estimates calculated from FRP data collected by the geostationary Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument. The adjusted annual FRE is on average 15% greater than estimated, and is characterized by low inter-annual variability as result of the majority of fire activity occurring in areas where percentage tree cover remains below 40%. Landscape burning occurs more frequently in areas of higher tree cover in southern hemisphere rather than northern hemisphere Africa, leading to a larger annual FRE adjustment (18.5% compared to 16.3%). This study illustrates the impact that canopy interception has on FRP for the first time at the satellite scale, and over Africa demonstrates a large but temporally consistent underestimation which can be accounted for using LAI and percentage tree cover metrics when estimating fuel consumption and atmospheric emissions from the FRP retrievals.

TI  - Predation pressure by birds and arthropods on herbivorous insects affected by tropical forest restoration strategy
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions is a key component of ecological restoration on degraded tropical forest lands. One of these functions, regulation of herbivorous insects by predators, shapes tropical communities through cascading trophic effects. An improved understanding of how predation pressure on herbivorous insects varies with reforestation strategy, management decisions, and landscape context would guide restoration practice. We measured predation pressure by birds and arthropods on dummy caterpillars in five forest types in Panama. These land covers represent natural and managed forest conditions: non-native monoculture plantation, native multispecies plantation, young natural forest succession, secondary gallery forest, and old-growth forest. We also placed dummy caterpillars in residential countryside, a heavily disturbed nonforest land cover. In three land covers, we surveyed bird communities to examine the relationship between predator abundance and predation pressure. Predation pressure from birds was lowest in the intensively managed plantations and highest in land covers with structurally complex vegetation: successional forest, gallery forest, and residential countryside. In the non-native plantation, bird predation increased with proximity to gallery forest. We found strong correspondence between bird abundance and bird attacks on dummy caterpillars. Arthropod predation pressure was highest in the native plantation but, unlike bird predation pressure, did not vary strongly by land cover. Our results suggest that ecosystem functions by insectivorous birds can be enhanced on reforestation lands by incorporating unmanaged areas and tolerating nonplanted understory vegetation. We recommend that, regardless of management objectives, forest managers adopt a holistic approach to reforestation to facilitate recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of the impact of a major mining wastewater disaster on the turbidity of the Doce River plume off the eastern Brazilian coast
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In November 2015, the Doce River basin was struck with Brazil's worst environmental disaster: the collapse of an iron ore mining waste water dam delivering about 60 Mm(3) of contaminated mud that traveled from its headwaters to the Atlantic Ocean. We analyzed the impact of the tailings dam failure on the turbidity of the Doce River plume and coastal waters based on remote sensing methods applied to Landsat and MODIS-Aqua imagery. Turbidity maps were obtained using a semi-analytical algorithm that uses a two band (i.e., red and near infrared) selection scheme to optimize the retrieval for a wide range of turbidity levels. The dam failure occurred in the context of a severe hydrological drought, but despite the abnormally low streamflow the turbidity front of the Doce River plume at the coast peaked to levels above 1000 FNU after the disaster. With subsequent rainfall-runoff events, the deposited mud within the river-estuary system continued to be washed out and cause high turbidity levels with extensive plumes over the coastal zone. The high turbidity (>20 FNU) plume front reached 11 km off the coast towards the southern shelf, the moderate turbidity plume (10-20 FNU) reached 39 km, and the low turbidity plume (<5 FNU) exceeded 75 km. Changes on the dominant wind pattern from NE to S, inverted the river plume direction towards the northern shelf, but the high turbidity plume stayed near the mouth (<5 km). The mud deposited from the disaster in the inner shelf remained a source of fine sediment resuspension for the coastal front turbidity during 2016 and 2017, with the intensification of coastal resuspension processes during the winter season. The combination of higher spatial and temporal resolutions of Landsat and MODIS-Aqua imagery, respectively, with auxiliary in situ stream flow and turbidity measurements allowed disentangling the impacts caused by the tailings dam failure from the natural sources of suspended sediment that influence the variability of coastal water turbidity.

TI  - Combining Camera Relascope-Measured Field Plots and Multi-Seasonal Landsat 8 Imagery for Enhancing the Forest Inventory of Boreal Forests in Central Russia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study considers a forest inventory for the mean volume, basal area, and coniferous/deciduous mapping of a large territory in central Siberia (Russia), employing a camera relascope at arbitrary sized sample plots and medium resolution satellite imagery Landsat 8 from the leaf-on and leaf-off seasons. The research bases are on field plots and satellite data that are acquired for the real operational forest inventory, performed for industrial purposes during summer-fall 2015. Sparse Bayesian regression was used to estimate linear regression models between field-measured variables and features derived from satellite data. Coniferous/deciduous mapping was done, applying maximum likelihood classification. The study reported the root mean square error for the mean volume and basal area under 25% for both the plot level and compartment level. The overall accuracy of the forest-type classification in coniferous, mixed coniferous/deciduous, and deciduous classes was 71.6%. The features of Landsat 8 images from both seasons were selected in almost every model, indicating that the use of satellite imagery from different seasons improved the estimation accuracy. It has been shown that the combination of camera relascope-based field data and medium-resolution satellite imagery gives accurate enough results that compare well with previous studies in that field, and provide fast and solid data about forests of large areas for efficient investment decision making.

TI  - The Unexpected Rapid Intensification of Tropical Cyclones in Moderate Vertical Wind Shear. Part I: Overview and Observations
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - A satellite-based investigation is performed of a class of tropical cyclones (TCs) that unexpectedly undergo rapid intensification (RI) in moderate vertical wind shear between 5 and 10 m s(-1) calculated as 200-850-hPa shear. This study makes use of both infrared (IR; 11 m) and water vapor (WV; 6.5 m) geostationary satellite data, the Statistical Hurricane Prediction Intensity System (SHIPS), and model reanalyses to highlight commonalities of the six TCs. The commonalities serve as predictive guides for forecasters and common features that can be used to constrain and verify idealized modeling studies. Each of the TCs exhibits a convective cloud structure that is identified as a tilt-modulated convective asymmetry (TCA). These TCAs share similar shapes, upshear-relative positions, and IR cloud-top temperatures (below -70 degrees C). They pulse over the core of the TC with a periodicity of between 4 and 8 h. Using WV satellite imagery, two additional features identified are asymmetric warming/drying upshear of the TC relative to downshear, as well as radially thin arc-shaped clouds on the upshear side. The WV brightness temperatures of these arcs are between -40 degrees and -60 degrees C. All of the TCs are sheared by upper-level anticyclones, which limits the strongest environmental winds to near the tropopause.

TI  - Generalized Hierarchical Model-Based Estimation for Aboveground Biomass Assessment Using GEDI and Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in remote sensing (RS) technology have made several sources of auxiliary data available to support forest inventories. Thus, a pertinent question is how different sources of RS data should be combined with field data to make inventories cost-efficient. Hierarchical model-based estimation has been proposed as a promising way of combining: (i) wall-to-wall optical data that are only weakly correlated with forest structure; (ii) a discontinuous sample of active RS data that are more strongly correlated with structure; and (iii) a sparse sample of field data. Model predictions based on the strongly correlated RS data source are used for estimating a model linking the target quantity with weakly correlated wall-to-wall RS data. Basing the inference on the latter model, uncertainties due to both modeling steps must be accounted for to obtain reliable variance estimates of estimated population parameters, such as totals or means. Here, we generalize previously existing estimators for hierarchical model-based estimation to cases with non-homogeneous error variance and cases with correlated errors, for example due to clustered sample data. This is an important generalization to take into account data from practical surveys. We apply the new estimation framework to case studies that mimic the data that will be available from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission and compare the proposed estimation framework with alternative methods. Aboveground biomass was the variable of interest, Landsat data were available wall-to-wall, and sample RS data were obtained from an airborne LiDAR campaign that produced simulated GEDI waveforms. The results show that generalized hierarchical model-based estimation has potential to yield more precise estimates than approaches utilizing only one source of RS data, such as conventional model-based and hybrid inferential approaches.

TI  - Mapping and monitoring of the structure and function of rangeland ecosystems in central Zagros, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study sought to investigate the feasibility of using field data and remote sensing structural and functional indices in the evaluation and monitoring of semi-steppe rangelands of Isfahan Province, Iran. The study area was first divided into 40 sub-catchments, and rangeland conditions in each sub-catchment were classified into three classes using the four-factor method (FFM). Landsat TM and OLI images for 1987 and 2015 were obtained, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. The structure of the area was evaluated using landscape function analysis (LFA) and rangeland landscape metrics. Rangeland function was also assessed and statistically compared using LFA and the leakiness index (LI). In order to clarify the effects of climate and management on rangeland function, changes in the standardized precipitation index (SPI) were computed and monitored at different intervals. The results indicated the reduction of structural indices, rangeland conditions, and patch sizes over time. Structural metrics suggested the fragmentation of the rangelands with 40-60% canopy cover and the development of rangelands with 0-20%. The structural changes affected rangeland function, and thus reduced the functions of the studied sub-catchments over the 28-year period (p<0.05). The trend of SPI revealed several periods of drought with different intensities and durations. Reduced precipitation caused structural changes and further decreased function in 2015. According to the obtained results, the combined field-based and remotely sensed approach applied in this research can be used to assess and monitor the functionality and structure of semi-steppe rangeland ecosystems at sub-catchment scale.

TI  - Planning by intentional communities: An understudied form of activist planning
T2  - PLANNING THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is about intentional communities choosing a lifestyle outside the mainstream. It is explained why their planning is a sort of activist planning and often a case of radical planning. Planning by intentional communities differs from most activist neighbourhood planning by closer relation to a deviating worldview or ideology. The permanent insistence on non-conformity makes planning processes involving both government and intentional community cases of agonist planning. Activist planning theory has not studied how the thousands of dedicated activists living in intentional communities plan the development of their area. The article starts such an investigation by studying Svartlamon in Trondheim, Norway. It is an urban intentional community for social change, housing some 240 individuals. The activists have used planning strategically to mobilize and build external support, to frame the cooperation with the municipality and to establish a legal underpinning of the intentional community. The following questions are answered: Are the goals of the activists clearly reflected in the plans? How are the activists involved in the planning? Are the planning ideas of the intentional community well received by the municipality?

TI  - Predictive value of Keetch-Byram Drought Index for cereal yields in a semi-arid environment
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological drought indices associated with soil moisture status have potential for varying applications including predictive power for crop yields estimation. The Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) was initially developed to estimate forest flammability, based on quantification of the moisture deficiency in upper soil layer as a function of daily precipitation and maximum air temperature. In this study, we characterized the utility of KBDI to accurately trace and monitor vegetation change and crop yield fluctuation in a semi-arid environment. It is tried to find any temporal association for both the 16-day MODIS-derived NDVI and KBDI from 2002 to 2012 and the correlation between KBDI and wheat and barley yield from 1984 to 2010. Correlation between KBDI and NDVI showed a general seasonal pattern with strongest correlation in mid-growing season, but this varied across study locations. Warmer locations with very sparse vegetation showed weaker association between KBDI and NDVI. Although a robust correlation between KBDI and winter cereal crop yield was not achieved based on winter (wet and cold season) data, spring cereal crop yield was correlated with KBDI.

TI  - Assessing Cropland Area in West Africa for Agricultural Yield Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of cultivated area and crop yield are critical to our understanding of agricultural production and food security, particularly for semi-arid regions like the Sahel of West Africa, where crop production is mainly rain-fed and food security is closely correlated with the inter-annual variations in rainfall. Several global and regional land cover products, based on satellite remotely-sensed data, provide estimates of the agricultural land use intensity, but the initial comparisons indicate considerable differences among them, relating to differences in the satellite data quality, classification approaches, and spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we quantify the accuracy of available cropland products across Sahelian West Africa using an independent, high-resolution, visually interpreted sample dataset that classifies all points across West Africa using a 2-km sample grid (similar to 500,000 points for the study area). We estimate the quantity and allocation disagreements for the cropland class of eight land cover products in five Western Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal). The results confirm that coarse spatial resolution (300 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) land cover products have higher disagreements in mapping the fragmented agricultural landscape of the Western Sahel. Earlier products (e.g., GLC2000) are less accurate than recent products (e.g., ESA CCI 2013, MODIS 2013 and GlobCover 2009). We also show that two of the finer spatial resolution maps (GFSAD30, and GlobeLand30) using advanced classification approaches (random forest, decision trees, and pixel-object combined) are currently the best available products for cropland identification. However, none of the eight land cover databases examined is consistent in reaching the targeted 75% accuracy threshold in the five Sahelian countries. The majority of currently available land cover products overestimate cultivated areas by an average of 170% relative to the cropland area in the reference data.

TI  - Mass Balance Estimation of Dokriani Glacier in Central Indian Himalaya Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dokriani Glacier is regarded as one of the important glaciers of Bhagirathi River basin, which fed river Ganges. The length of the glacier is about 4.6km, and snout elevation is about 4028mm.s.l. The mass balance of this glacier was calculated using field-based measurements for few years during 1994 to 2000. However, due to remote and poor accessibility, the field-based measurements could not continue; thus, remote sensing-based methods become useful tool to estimate the long-term mass balance of the glacier. In this study, glacier mass balance has been determined using accumulation area ratio (AAR) method. Remote sensing data sets, e.g. Landsat TM, ETM+and OLI, have been used to estimate AAR for different years from 1994 to 2014. An attempt has also been made to develop a mathematical relationship between remote sensing-derived AAR and field-observed mass balance data of the glacier. Further, this relationship has been used to estimate mass balance of the glacier for different years using remote sensing-derived AAR. Estimated mass balance was validated from ground-observed mass balance for few years. The field-observed and remote sensing-derived mass balance data are compared and showed high correlation. It has been observed that AAR for the Dokriani Glacier varies from 0.64 to 0.71. Mass balance of the glacier was observed between -15.54cm and -50.95cm during the study period. The study highlights the application of remote sensing in mass balance study of the glaciers and impact of climate change in glaciers of Central Indian Himalaya.

AB  - Objective: This study was to investigate the differences in the types, frequency, and perspectives of self-reported adverse events reported following simulation encounters between students enrolled in two Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) programs: accelerated option (AO-BSN) or traditional (T-BSN) and by role (participant or observer) during simulation.Methods: This study analyzed 6994 adverse event reports entered by students through the simulated adverse event reporting system.Results: The AO-BSN students reported a higher percentage of adverse events coded as errors. In contrast the T-BSN students reported more near misses and sentinel events. Further, the T-BSN students significantly reported more fall related errors, while AO-BSN students reported more confidentiality breach errors. Participants reported more medication errors, whereas observers reported more airway and fall categorized errors.Conclusion: The vantage from which adverse events are viewed and educational track appear to alter slightly the perceptions of the precipitating factors leading to committed or observed adverse events.

TI  - Can integrated 18F-FDG PET/MR replace sentinel lymph node resection in malignant melanoma?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo compare the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-fluordesoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT), 18F-FDG PET/magnetic resonance (18F-FDG PET/MR) and 18F-FDG PET/MR including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in the detection of sentinel lymph node metastases in patients suffering from malignant melanoma.Material & MethodsFifty-two patients with malignant melanoma (female: n=30, male: n=22, mean age 50.516.0 years, mean tumor thickness 2.281.97mm) who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and subsequent PET/MR & DWI for distant metastasis staging were included in this retrospective study. After hybrid imaging, lymphoscintigraphy including single photon emission computed tomography/CT (SPECT/CT) was performed to identify the sentinel lymph node prior to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). In a total of 87 sentinel lymph nodes in 64 lymph node basins visible on SPECT/CT, 17 lymph node metastases were detected by histopathology. In separate sessions PET/CT, PET/MR, and PET/MR & DWI were assessed for sentinel lymph node metastases by two independent readers. Discrepant results were resolved in a consensus reading. Sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values and negative predictive values were calculated with histopathology following SPECT/CT guided SLNB as a reference standard.Results p id=Par3 Compared with histopathology, lymph nodes were true positive in three cases, true negative in 65 cases, false positive in three cases and false negative in 14 cases in PET/CT. PET/MR was true positive in four cases, true negative in 63 cases, false positive in two cases and false negative in 13 cases. Hence, we observed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 17.7, 95.6, 50.0 and 82.3% for PET/CT and 23.5, 96.9, 66.7 and 82.3% for PET/MR. In DWI, 56 sentinel lymph node basins could be analyzed. Here, the additional analysis of DWI led to two additional false positive findings, while the number of true positive findings could not be increased.Conclusion p id="Par4 In conclusion, integrated 18F-FDG PET/MR does not reliably differentiate N-positive from N-negative melanoma patients. Additional DWI does not increase the sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET/MR. Hence, sentinel lymph node biopsy cannot be replaced by 18F-FDG-PE/MR or 18F-FDG-PET/CT.

TI  - Mobile device application for monitoring cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms using Sentinel-3 satellite Ocean and Land Colour Instruments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB) cause human and ecological health problems in lakes worldwide. The timely distribution of satellite-derived cyanoHAB data is necessary for adaptive water quality management and for targeted deployment of water quality monitoring resources. Software platforms that permit timely, useful, and cost-effective delivery of information from satellites are required to help managers respond to cyanoHABs. The Cyanobacteria Assessment Network (CyAN) mobile device application (app) uses data from the European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) in near real-time to make initial water quality assessments and quickly alert managers to potential problems and emerging threats related to cyanobacteria. App functionality and satellite data were validated with 25 state health advisories issued in 2017. The CyAN app provides water quality managers with a user-friendly platform that reduces the complexities associated with accessing satellite data to allow fast, efficient, initial assessments across lakes.

TI  - Multicenter study comparing oncologic outcomes between two nodal assessment methods in patients with deeply invasive endometrioid endometrial carcinoma: A sentinel lymph node algorithm versus a comprehensive pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To compare oncologic outcomes in the staging of deeply invasive endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) using a sentinel lymph node algorithm (SLN) versus pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy to the renal veins (LND); to compare outcomes in node-negative cases.Methods. At two institutions, patients with deeply invasive (>= 50% myometrial invasion) EEC were identified. One institution used LND (2004-2008), the other SLN (2005-2013). FIGO stage IV cases were excluded. Clinical characteristics and follow-up data were recorded.Results. 176 patients were identified (LND, 94; SLN, 82). SLN patients were younger (p = 0.003) and had more LVSI (p < 0.001). 9.8% in the SLN and 29.8% in the LND cohorts, respectively, received no adjuvant therapy (p < 0.001). There was no association between type of assessment and recurrence; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR; LND vs. SLN) 0.87 (95%CI 0.40, 1.89) PFS. After controlling for age and adjuvant therapy, there was no association between assessment method and OS (aHR 2.54; 95%CI 0.81, 7.91). The node-negative cohort demonstrated no association between survival and assessment method: aHR 0.69 (95%CI 0.23, 2.03) PFS, 0.81 (95%CI 0.16, 422) OS. In the node-negative cohort, neither adjuvant EBRT+/-IVRT (HR 1.63; 95%CI 0.18, 14.97) nor adjuvant chemotherapy+/-EBRT+/-IVRT (HR 0.49; 95%CI 0.11, 2.22) were associated with OS, compared to no adjuvant therapy or IVRT-only.Conclusion. Use of an SLN algorithm in deeply invasive EEC does not impair oncologic outcomes. Survival is excellent in node-negative cases, irrespective of assessment method. Adjuvant chemotherapy in node-negative patients does not appear to impact outcome. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vegetation Cover, Tidal Amplitude and Land Area Predict Short-Term Marsh Vulnerability in Coastal Louisiana
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of coastal marshes is a topic of great concern, because these habitats provide tangible ecosystem services and are at risk from sea-level rise and human activities. In recent years, a significant effort has gone into understanding and modeling the relationships between the biological and physical factors that contribute to marsh stability. Simulation-based process models suggest that marsh stability is the product of a complex feedback between sediment supply, flooding regime and vegetation response, resulting in elevation gains sufficient to match the combination of relative sea-level rise and losses from erosion. However, there have been few direct, empirical tests of these models, because long-term datasets that have captured sufficient numbers of marsh loss events in the context of a rigorous monitoring program are rare. We use a multi-year dataset collected by the Coastwide Reference Monitoring System that includes transitions of monitored vegetation plots to open water to build and test a predictive model of near-term marsh vulnerability. We found that despite the conclusions of previous process models, elevation change had no ability to predict the transition of vegetated marsh to open water. However, we found that the processes that drive elevation change were significant predictors of transitions. Specifically, vegetation cover in prior year, land area in the surrounding 1km(2) (an estimate of marsh fragmentation) and the interaction of tidal amplitude and position in tidal frame were all significant factors predicting marsh loss. This suggests that (1) elevation change is likely better a predictor of marsh loss at timescales longer than we consider in this study and (2) the significant predictive factors affect marsh vulnerability through pathways other than elevation change, such as resistance to erosion. In addition, we found that, while sensitivity of marsh vulnerability to the predictive factors varied spatially across coastal Louisiana, vegetation cover in prior year was the best single predictor of subsequent loss in most sites followed by changes in percent land and tidal amplitude. The model's predicted land loss rates correlated well with land loss rates derived from satellite data, although agreement was spatially variable. These results indicate (1) monitoring the loss of small-scale vegetation plots can inform patterns of land loss at larger scales, (2) the drivers of land loss vary spatially across coastal Louisiana, and (3) relatively simple models have potential as highly informative tools for bioassessment, directing future research and management planning.

TI  - Forest Cover and Vegetation Degradation Detection in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area Using BFAST Monitor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover and vegetation degradation was monitored across the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA) in southern Africa and the performance of three different methods in detecting degradation was assessed using reference data. Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) Monitor was used to identify potential forest cover and vegetation degradation using Landsat Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) time series data. Parametric probability-based magnitude thresholds, non-parametric random forest in conjunction with Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) time series, and the combination of both methods were evaluated for their suitability to detect degradation for six land cover classes ranging from closed canopy forest to open grassland. The performance of degradation detection was largely dependent on tree cover and vegetation density. Satisfactory accuracies were obtained for closed woodland (user's accuracy 87%, producer's accuracy 71%) and closed forest (user's accuracy 92%, producer's accuracy 90%), with lower accuracies for open canopies. The performance of the three methods was more similar for closed canopies and differed for land cover classes with open canopies. Highest user's accuracy was achieved when methods were combined, and the best performance for producer's accuracy was obtained when random forest was used.

TI  - FORECAST OF METALLIC MINERAL RESOURCE DEPOSITS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SHOCK-EXPLOSIVE TECTONICS AND USE OF THE EARTH REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - NEWS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN-SERIES OF GEOLOGY AND TECHNICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors propose a new technology for regional and local (large-scale) mineral deposit forecast based on the principles of shock-explosive tectonics (SET) and remote sensing data (RS).The forecast of mineral deposits should be carried out using remote sensing data in conjunction with the huge amount of information on the location of known and proven mineral deposit fields in the geological space. Recent studies show that mineral deposit fields are often connected with ring structures, both endogenous and cosmogenic. Years of research has shown that the overwhelming majority of mineral deposit fields is confined to the concentric zones of the earth crust expansion-decompression, which accompanies cosmogenic ring structures of various sizes.Blocks of mutual overlay of the earth's crust expansion-decompression, neighboring astroblems and giablems (giant astroblems), are spaces most promising for the localization of mineral deposits. The zones of the earth's crust expansion-decompression are separated by zones of compression that are devoid or almost devoid of accumulations of minerals.The analysis of the solid minerals spatial allocation confirms this idea. On the basis of the proposed forecasting technology, new local prospective areas have been distinguished. Within these areas the discovery of deposits which are to fill the depleted ore base in the Zhezkazgan area is expected.

TI  - Value of SPECT/CT for Sentinel Lymph Node Localization in the Parotid and External Jugular Chain
T2  - OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging may aid in the localization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in cutaneous head and neck malignancy and has been rigorously evaluated for deep cervical lymph nodes. The purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of SPECT/CT for preoperative localization of nodal basins superficial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, with comparison to deep nodal basins of the neck. Study Design Retrospective review. Setting Tertiary care center. Subjects and Methods SPECT/CT images obtained preoperatively for patients undergoing SLN biopsy for cutaneous head and neck malignancy between June 2015 and June 2016 were reviewed by a blinded nuclear medicine physician and head and neck surgeon. SPECT/CT imaging was compared to intraoperatively determined SLN location via gamma probe. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined and compared for superficial (external jugular [EJ] and parotid) nodes vs level II nodes. Results Fifty-three patients were included in the study. Most had cutaneous melanoma (69.8%). The PPV of EJ/parotid node identification by SPECT/CT imaging was 85.7%, specificity was 88.9%, and sensitivity was 69.2%. Comparatively, the PPV for level II nodes was 76.9%, specificity was 50%, and sensitivity was 85.7%. No significant difference in SPECT/CT predictive value was identified between EJ/parotid and level II node identification (P > .05). Conclusion SPECT/CT imaging has strong specificity and positive predictability for preoperative localization of SLN superficial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle in cutaneous head and neck malignancy. SPECT/CT imaging may be a useful radiographic aid for preoperative SLN mapping in this patient population.

TI  - Modeling cumulative defensive resource allocation against a strategic attacker in a multi-period multi-target sequential game
T2  - RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper fills a literature gap by investigating the strategic interactions between an attacker and a defender with a multi-period multi-target game. At each period, the defender allocates a limited amount of defensive resources over multiple targets, and the attacker assigns some attack probabilities to those targets. We consider four scenarios where the defender could be either myopic or long-sighted, and the defense could be carried over to future periods or not. Our analyses characterize the defender's optimal allocations in these four scenarios and develop a n algorithm to identify the optimal allocations. We find that increases in defense carryover could lead to less allocation to defended targets from the second period at equilibrium, and lead to defending more targets. To gather empirical evidence regarding one key function of the model - success probability of attack, we conduct statistical analysis based on datasets from Global Terrorism Database, which is provided by National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) and the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant allocations from FY 2004 to FY 2012. We conclude that in general, effects of defense resources on reducing success probability of attack are mixed due to scarcity of terrorism data.

TI  - <i>3D</i> Modelling of Urban Area Using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a newly-developed remote sensing technology that works in all weather and independent of daylight. Recent satellite designs such as TerraSAR-x, which have resolutions of a couple of meters and sub-meters, have provided appropriate data for modelling and monitoring of urban areas. Image classification and height information extraction is possible considering the nature of SAR data. In this paper, a proper classification method for high-resolution SAR images has been used in urban areas. This classifier is based on statistical models. First, statistical models that are well adapted to urban SAR images are selected. Initial labelling is performed using the maximum likelihood method. A method based on Markov random fields is applied to improve the results by considering neighbourhood information. Meanwhile, topographic information is extracted using the phase difference obtained from SAR interferometry. After classification and height extraction, the homogeneous regions consisting of locations with similar objects are determined. The homogeneous region adjacency graph are generated using vectors containing classification information, extracted objects, height of pixels forming each region, and information on the neighbouring areas. Height and classification information are then merged by assigning height conditions based on the nature of objects and optimizing an energy function. The results obtained, including buildings, streets, and corner reflectors, are easily recognizable. The overall accuracy is improved from 57% in the initial classification to 95% in the employed procedure. Moreover, the accuracy of height estimation is about 2.74m, which is acceptable for height estimations of buildings with more than one floor.

TI  - Multisensor Data Synergy of Terra-MODIS, Aqua-MODIS, and Suomi NPP-VIIRS for the Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth and Land Surface Reflectance Properties
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel multisensor synergy method, using data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua as well as Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, is presented to retrieve optical atmosphere-surface properties. By adopting three-sensor observations' synergy, the proposed method can grasp the multitemporal characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the multidirectional characteristics of surface reflectance. In addition, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) can be derived at daily scale by adopting the novel shape function constrained BRDF retrieval (SFCBR) method. The 550-nm AOD retrieval result of the proposed method is validated by AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurement at Beijing, XiangHe, Noto, and Gwangju_GIST sites with R-2 equaling to 0.78, 0.75, 0.70, and 0.75, respectively. Compared with MODIS/VIIRS AOD official product, the proposed method shows higher coverage rate (especially in AERONET Beijing site with approximately 50% increase) with comparative accuracy. The expected error of the retrieved AOD from the proposed method is estimated as Delta tau = +/--0.05 +/- 0.24 tau. The correlation coefficients of BRDF-derived albedo time series between the proposed method and MODIS BRDF/Albedo product can reach up to 0.85 with an obvious improvement in temporal resolution by adopting an SFCBR method. The average relative differences of BRDF shape function between the retrieval result and MODIS BRDF/Albedo product in all directions equal to 0.026, 0.036, 0.037, and 0.016 in AERONET Beijing, XiangHe, Noto, and Gwangju_GIST sites, respectively.

TI  - Mudflat aquaculture labeling for infrared remote sensing images via a scanning convolutional network
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mudflat areas, e.g. the enclosures of coastal inter-tidal regions, are sometimes used for breeding fish and other aquatic life, which is important for the aquaculture industry. As the difference of the wave reflectance between water and land structures of the infrared band is much higher than that of the visible band, infrared remote sensing technique is more suitable for automatically monitoring the mudflat aquaculture. This paper proposes a fast pixel-wise labeling method called scanning convolutional network (SCN) for mudflat aquaculture area detection with infrared remote sensing images. SCN improves the traditional fully convolutional network (FCN) by replacing convolution layers with scanning convolution modules (SCM) and a feature pyramid design, which simultaneously learns large scale sea-land environmental features and mudflat structure details with less computational costs. A set of Landsat-8 satellite images, with three visible bands and three infrared bands, are used to evaluate the proposed method. SCN shows a faster processing speed and a higher labeling accuracy than any other state of the art labeling methods.

TI  - The behavior of deep convective clouds over the warm pool and connection to the Walker circulation
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As the deep convective clouds (DCCs) over the western Pacific and Indian Ocean warm pool may play different roles in the climate system, variations in DCC properties over these two sectors are investigated and compared. The DCC intensity and area varies more significantly in the Indian Ocean than the western Pacific sector, while the DCC frequency is comparable in both sectors at the seasonal scale. Although the Indian Ocean sector is strongly dominated by the seasonal evolution, the interannual variations in the two sectors are comparable for all three DCC properties (frequency, intensity, and area). Besides, Walker circulation is closely correlated with the interannual variability of DCCs in both sectors. The Walker circulation strengthens (weakens) as the DCCs shift eastward (westward) over the Indian Ocean sector and westward (eastward) over the western Pacific sector. When more or stronger DCCs occur over the Indian Ocean sector (western Pacific sector), the Walker circulation becomes stronger (weaker) and shifts westward (eastward). Interestingly, the response of the Walker circulation to DCC variability over the warm pool is asymmetry. The asymmetry response of the Walker circulation to the negative and positive DCC anomaly may be related to the non-linearity internal variability of the atmosphere. DCCs over the Indian Ocean sector have a much weaker nonlinear correlation with the Walker circulation than DCCs over the western Pacific sector.

TI  - Why Children have Rights: Children Rights in Janusz Korczak's Education Philosophy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHILDRENS RIGHTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Children are a weak part of society. They suffer injustice, their voice is unheard, their property is not theirs and they depend on adults in all aspects of their life. Even today, children are victims of war crimes, street violence, sexual abuse, hard labour, lack of proper education and insufficient life conditions. Their rights remain an unfulfilled promise.We claim that children have rights, but what does it mean? Of course, we love our children, the challenge is not to define what we gracefully give but what children's rights are, regardless of our own feelings? How can we substantiate the claim that children have rights? The legacy of Janusz Korczak, world-known children's rights advocate (1878-1942), may help us in this task.Korczak's education legacy portrays a cluster of inspiring ideas: children are not people-in-the-making, but human beings here-and-now, they deserve our respect and respect implies ultimate rights. Korczak was not only a theoretician, but also an educationalist in practice who structured his children's houses as democratic communities, directed by a children's parliament, court, newspaper and other community common spaces of discussion and learning.A major question remains: how we connect Korczak's fragmented and isolated educational ideas and practices, each one inspiring and powerful on its own, into one integrated worldview? Can we connect all the dots into a meaningful picture that substantiates the claim that children have unconditional rights as human beings and not only as an arbitrary gesture of the adults? This study suggests that all of Korczak's ideas and practices fit into the context of Greek philosophy and Korczak appears as a modern Stoic.His Stoicism gives ground to the idea of children's dignity and children's rights as an immediate outcome of this dignity. In the infinity of the cosmos, there is no hierarchy of being. In this context, children have rights like any other human being.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the phenomenology and content of the entrepreneurial culture as an educational resource for training future specialists in market economy. The authors reveal the attributive features of the entrepreneurial culture, which characterize it as being business, creative, initiative, innovative, need-sensitive, predictive, pragmatic, labor-saving, competitive-productive, communicative, contractual, free, responsible-trusting and socially-oriented. Presenting the educational potential of the entrepreneurial culture the authors define its specific functions such as: informative-cognitive, organizing, transformative-creative, identifying, consolidating, representative-symbolic, aesthetic, worldview, moral and ethical. The didactic model of students' introduction to the entrepreneurial culture was developed. It provides three areas of training: professional-business, communicative, as well as moral-ethical. The authors suggest using active methods of teaching including business and role-play games, case studies, trainings, business situations, method of training firm, online business games, club work, etc. as forms and methods of teaching students. Within the scope of experimental work, the authors distinguish four groups of pedagogical conditions of students' involving to the entrepreneurial culture: organizational, didactic, methodological and educational.

TI  - Effect of watershed land use on water quality: a case study in Corrego da Olaria Basin, Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The water quality is related to the hydrologic and limnologic properties of ground and surface water, and significant efforts have been made to monitor water sources to understand the effects of land use changes in agricultural areas, with significant socioeconomic activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the qualitative aspects of surface water in subbasins related to land use. Samples were analyzed in terms of physical and chemical parameters on monthly discrete water quality sampling in four representative sites at first order subbasin streams, located at the Polo Regional Centro Norte, Pindorama County, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The land use classification was made by visual detection technique in a multispectral satellite data obtained from LandSat8- spectral bands of the OLI sensor. The watershed was classified into major land cover/use classes and overlay maps generated in ArcGIS 10 indicated a significant shift from natural vegetation to agriculture activities. Water quality monitoring was according to the brazilian protocol and the results were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The values obtained differ significantly at each sampling point - subbasins, reflecting the effects of land use on water quality. Soil conservation management is important to optimize soil use in order to contribute to the control of water pollution and the formulation of a public policy is necessary for the conservation of water and soil resources.

TI  - Ineffectiveness of local zoning to reduce regional loss and fragmentation of wintering habitat for white-tailed deer
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use zoning and regulations are frequently used to protect habitat for species threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Habitat protection, however, is rarely followed by habitat monitoring; consequently, knowledge about the efficacy of zoning as a species conservation tool is limited. We used a time series of Landsat satellite imagery (1975-2007) to quantify habitat changes in and adjacent to 187 areas zoned on private, commercial forestlands to protect habitat for wintering white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Maine. Near the northern edge of their geographic range where snow can restrict mobility and access to forage, white-tailed deer depend on mature conifer forests as wintering habitat. Our primary objective was to evaluate effectiveness of land-use zoning to conserve and prevent fragmentation of mature conifer forest. Between 1975 and 2007, the incidence rate of timber harvesting in zoned areas was high (97%). Cumulative area harvested (25%) and the associated reduction of mature conifer forest (13%) that resulted from stand-replacing harvests were considerably lower in zoned areas, indicating that regulations were successful at limiting timber harvests within zones. Reduction of mature conifer forest within unzoned 2-km buffers surrounding protected areas was considerably higher (45%). Remaining patches of mature conifer forest became increasingly fragmented, with a greater than 3-fold increase in number of patches and greater than 80% reduction in mean patch area. Regenerating forest increased from 5% to 36% in the landscapes surrounding zones, and although it can offer important browse, travel across young forest is costly for deer during periods of deep snow. Circa 2007, approximately 55% of the mature conifer forest present across our study area in 1975 remained, and our results suggest that less than 50% of the regenerating areas harvested in mature conifer forest will return to conifer dominance. Forest type conversion will, thus, extend effects of habitat fragmentation into the future. Areas protected for wintering deer collectively represent only 2% of the forested land base in our study area, and we conclude that habitat protection focused solely on those narrowly-defined zones has been ineffective at achieving regional conservation of winter habitat for deer. This study demonstrates how remote sensing can be used to overcome the difficulty of monitoring protected forest areas, and exemplifies the need for monitoring to understand the long-term benefits of zoning as a means of wildlife habitat conservation.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Two Different Urban Landscapes Using Satellite Images and Landscape Metrics
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to compare landscape metrics of two different cities having distinct landscape characteristics by using up-to-date, very high resolution SPOT 6/7 images-derived and thematically extensive urban land cover/use (LCLU) maps produced from object based classification approach. Object based classification method was applied to 1.5 m resolution SPOT images in conjunction with some opensource geoinformation in order to create accurate urban LCLU maps. Landscape metrics were calculated using detailed land cover/use classes and comparisons were conducted for two different city landscapes; one having huge industrialized areas and another with urban sites and archeological city residences which was declared as World Cultural Heritage. Patch Density (PD), Edge Density (ED), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Euclidean Nearest Neighbor Distance Distribution (ENN_MN), Area-Weighted Mean Fractal Dimension Index (FRAC_AM) and Contagion (CONTAG) metrics were calculated for two cities using these land cover/use maps. Analyzes of urban areas with landscape metrics allowed objective evaluations to define the structure of urban areas and representation of differences or similarities in the spatial structure of different urban regions.

TI  - Urban green space availability in Bathinda City, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to investigate and map the spatial distribution of urban green spaces (UGSs) in Bathinda City, India. Since urban green spaces affect the quality of life and provide various ecological, socio-cultural and economic benefits to a city, the spatial distribution of UGSs and per capita availability deserve greater consideration in urban planning and research. The UGSs are extracted from freely available Sentinel 2 image with spatial resolutions of 10m (blue, green, red, and near infrared bands). The result indicates that the planned urban setups have higher area under UGSs as compared to the rest of the city. Analysis and intra-city comparison (ward wise) of distribution of green spaces and per capita availability indicate that there is an inequitable distribution of UGSs in Bathinda City. The study also attempts to accentuate the scope of green initiatives in the various wards of the city to ensure the well-being of people.

TI  - Elevated Black Carbon Concentrations and Atmospheric Pollution around Singrauli Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plants (India) Using Ground and Satellite Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropospheric NO2 concentration from OMI AURA always shows high concentrations of NO2 at a few locations in India, one of the high concentrations of NO2 hotspots is associated with the locations of seven coal-fired Thermal Power plants (TPPs) in Singrauli. Emissions from TPPs are among the major sources of black carbon (BC) soot in the atmosphere. Knowledge of BC emissions from TPPs is important in characterizing regional carbonaceous particulate emissions, understanding the fog/haze/smog formation, evaluating regional climate forcing, modeling aerosol optical parameters and concentrations of black carbon, and evaluating human health. Furthermore, elevated BC concentrations, over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and the Himalayan foothills, have emerged as an important subject to estimate the effects of deposition and atmospheric warming of BC on the accelerated melting of snow and glaciers in the Himalaya. For the first time, this study reports BC concentrations and aerosol optical parameters near dense coal-fired power plants and open cast coal mining adjacent to the east IGP. In-situ measurements were carried out in Singrauli (located in south-east IGP) at a fixed site about 10 km from power plants and in transit measurements in close proximity to the plants, for few days in the month of January and March 2013. At the fixed site, BC concentration up to the 95 mu gm(-3) is observed with strong diurnal variations. BC concentration shows two maxima peaks during early morning and evening hours. High BC concentrations are observed in close proximity to the coal-fired TPPs (>200 mu gm(-3)), compared to the outside domain of our study region. Co-located ground-based sunphotometer measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) show strong spatial variability at the fixed site, with AOD in the range 0.38-0.58, and the highest AOD in the range 0.7-0.95 near the TPPs in transit measurements (similar to the peak of BC concentrations). Additionally, the Angstrom exponent was found to be in the range 0.4-1.0 (maximum in the morning time) and highest in the proximity of TPPs (similar to 1.0), suggesting abundance of fine particulates, whereas there was low Angstrom exponent over the surrounding coal mining areas. Low Angstrom exponent is characterized by dust from the unpaved roads and nearby coal mining areas. MODIS derived daily AOD shows a good match with the MICROTOPS AOD. The CALIPSO derived subtypes of the aerosol plot shows that the aerosols over Singrauli region are mainly dust, polluted dust, and elevated smoke. The preliminary study for few days provides information about the BC concentrations and aerosol optical properties from Singrauli (one of the NO2 hotspot locations in India). This preliminary study suggests that long-term continuous monitoring of BC is needed to understand the BC concentrations and aerosol optical properties for better quantification and the estimation of the emission to evaluate radiative forcing in the region.

TI  - New approaches to pharmacosurveillance for monitoring prescription frequency, diversity, and co-prescription in a large sentinel network of companion animal veterinary practices in the United Kingdom, 2014-2016
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pharmaceutical agents (PAs) are commonly prescribed in companion animal practice in the United Kingdom. However, little is known about PA prescription on a population-level, particularly with respect to PM authorised for human use alone prescribed via the veterinary cascade; this raises important questions regarding the efficacy and safety of PM prescribed to companion animals. This study explored new approaches for describing PA prescription, diversity and co-prescription in dogs, cats and rabbits utilising electronic health records (EHRs) from a sentinel network of 457 companion animal-treating veterinary sites throughout the UK over a 2-year period (2014-2016).A novel text mining-based identification and classification methodology was utilised to semi-automatically map practitioner-defined product descriptions recorded in 918,333 EHRs from 413,870 dogs encompassing 1,242,270 prescriptions; 352,730 EHRs from 200,541 cats encompassing 491,554 prescriptions, and 22,526 EHRS from 13,398 rabbits encompassing 18,490 prescriptions respectively. PA prescription as a percentage of booked consultations was 65.4% (95% confidence interval, CI, 64.6-66.3) in dogs; in cats it was 69.1% (95% CI, 67.9-70.2) and in rabbits, 56.3% (95% CI, 54.7-57.8). Vaccines were the most commonly prescribed PM in all three species, with antibiotics, antimycotics, and parasiticides also commonly prescribed. PA prescription utilising products authorised for human use only (hence, 'human-authorised') comprised 5.1% (95% CI, 4.7-5.5) of total canine prescription events; in cats it was 2.8% (95% CI, 2.6-3.0), and in rabbits, 7.8% (95% CI, 6.5-9.0). The most commonly prescribed human-authorised PA in dogs was metronidazole (antibiotic); in cats and rabbits it was ranitidine (H-2 histamine receptor antagonist). Using a new approach utilising the Simpson's Diversity Index (an ecological measure of relative animal, plant etc. species abundance), we identified differences in prescription based on presenting complaint and species, with rabbits generally exposed to a less diverse range of PAs than dogs or cats, potentially reflecting the paucity of authorised PAs for use in rabbits. Finally, through a novel application of network analysis, we demonstrated the existence of three major co-prescription groups (preventive health; treatment of disease, and euthanasia); a trend commonly observed in practice.This study represents the first time PA prescription has been described across all pharmaceutical families in a large population of companion animals, encompassing PAs authorised for both veterinary and human-only use. These data form a baseline against which future studies could be compared, and provides some useful tools for understanding PA comparative efficacy and risks when prescribed in the varied setting of clinical practice.

TI  - Prediction of Residual Nodal Disease at Completion Dissection Following Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionWhile recent trial data have demonstrated no survival benefit to immediate completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) disease in melanoma, prediction of non-SLN disease may help risk-stratify patients for more intensive observation of the nodal basin.Patients and MethodsA retrospective cohort of patients with positive SLN biopsy (SLNB) who underwent CLND was identified (1996-2016). A risk score for likelihood of CLND-positive disease was developed based on factors associated with presence of CLND metastases identified on logistic regression. Survival outcomes were analyzed.ResultsAmong 312 patients with positive SLN, 192 underwent CLND and had complete pathologic data for evaluation. The median age of the study cohort was 53years [interquartile range (IQR) 43-66years], and 112 (58%) were male. Thirty-one (16%) had non-SLN metastatic disease on CLND. The four factors independently associated with CLND positivity and thus included in the risk score were Breslow thickness3mm [odds ratio (OR) 2.56, p=0.047], presence of primary tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (OR 0.33, p=0.013),2/3 positive-to-total SLN ratio (OR 4.35, p=0.003), and combined subcapsular and parenchymal metastatic SLN location or metastatic deposit1mm (OR 4.45, p=0.013). The four-point risk score predicted CLND positivity well with area under the curve of 0.82 (0.80-0.85). Increasing risk score was independently associated with increasingly worse melanoma-specific survival [hazard ratio (HR)=1.54, p=0.001].ConclusionsLikelihood of residual nodal disease after positive SLNB and survival can be predicted from primary tumor and SLN characteristics. High-risk patients may warrant more intensive surveillance of the nodal basin to reduce risk of loss of regional control.

TI  - Fenestration of the Basilar Artery Associated with Aneurysm Treated by the Support of a Temporary Bridging Device-Comaneci: A Case Report
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fenestration of the basilar artery is a segmental duplication of the vessel due to nonfusion of the embryonal arteries and is the second most common vascular disjunction. Here, we present a single case example demonstrating the utility of the temporary bridging device Comaneci as a new option in the endovascular treatment of ruptured basilar artery aneurysms associated with fenestrations.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old female patient presented to our hospital with a 3-month history of frequent multiple sentinel severe headaches. At the time of hospitalization, the patient was neurologically intact with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. There was no evidence of focal neurologic deficits or cranial nerve lesions, but there was discrete neck stiffness and a diagnosed saccular aneurysm associated with a fenestration of the basilar artery. After multidisciplinary discussion involving neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists and taking into consideration the patient's clinical presentation and previous history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as the morphology of the posterior circulation aneurysm, endovascular treatment of the basilar fenestration aneurysm was deemed appropriate or simply use was chosen.CONCLUSIONS: Our case results are similar to previously published good results of endovascular coiling and add information regarding the relatively new Comaneci device, which helped to achieve considerable packing density of the aneurysmal sac. Using this device lowers the risk of peri- and postoperative complications. We believe that this technique is safer and better than the balloon-assisted and stent-assisted coiling in ruptured case scenarios of wideneck aneurysms in the posterior circulation.

T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation represents a life-critical energy and hydrologic exchange between the Earth's atmosphere and its surface. As such, knowledge of where, when and how much rain and snow falls is essential for scientific research and societal applications. Building on the 17-year success of the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory (GPM-CO) is the first US National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) satellite mission specifically designed with sensors to observe the structure and intensities of both rain and falling snow. The GPM-CO has proved to be a worthy successor to TRMM, extending and improving high-quality active and passive microwave observations across all times of day. The GPM-CO launched in early 2014, is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), with sensors that include the NASA-provided GPM Microwave Imager and the JAXA-provided Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar. These sensors were devised with high accuracy standards enabling them to be used as a reference for inter-calibrating a constellation of partner satellite data. These inter-calibrated partner satellite retrievals are used with infrared data to produce merged precipitation estimates at temporal scales of 30 min and spatial scales of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees. Precipitation estimates from the GPM-CO and partner constellation satellites, provided in near real time and later reprocessed with all ancillary data, are an indispensable source of precipitation data for operational and scientific users. Advances have been made using GPM data, primarily in improving sensor calibration, retrieval algorithms, and ground validation measurements, and used to further our understanding of the characteristics of liquid and frozen precipitation and the science of water and hydrological cycles for climate/weather forecasting. These advances have extended to societal benefits related to water resources, operational numerical weather prediction, hurricane monitoring, prediction, and disaster response, extremes, and disease.

TI  - Natural history of pain associated with melanoma surgery
T2  - PAIN REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: After excision of a primary malignant melanoma (MM), treatment of stage IB or higher MM consists of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). If malignant cells are identified, a complete lymph node dissection (CLND) can be performed.Objective: To determine the natural history of pain and sensory changes after MM surgery.Methods: We prospectively followed 39 patients (29 SLNB-only, 2 CLND-only, and 8 CLND preceded by SLNB) from before inguinal or axillary surgery through 6 months after surgery on measures of pain intensity, sensory symptoms, allodynia, and questionnaires of anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing.Results: No patient had pain preoperatively. Ten days after surgery, 35% had surgical site pain after SLNB-only compared with 90% after CLND (P < 0.003); clinically meaningful pain (Visual Analogue Scale >= 30 mm/100 mm) was reported by 3% of patients after SLNB-only compared with 40% after CLND (P < 0.001). At 6 months, all SLNB-only patients were pain-free. By contrast, 4 of 7 in the SLNB + CLND group still had pain (P < 0.002). At 6 months, symptoms of altered sensation or numbness were reported by 32% and 42% of SLNB-only patients, and by 67% and 67% of patients undergoing CLND surgery (both P > 0.05).Conclusion: Acute pain is more common after CLND surgery. Undergoing SLNB followed by more invasive CLND surgery may increase the likelihood of pain at 6 months. Persistent sensory symptoms typical of those associated with nerve injury are more common after CLND. Surgery for MM is a good model for studying the natural history of postsurgical pain and sensory changes.

TI  - Equatorial Counter Electrojet Longitudinal and Seasonal Variablity in the American sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The equatorial electrojet occasionally reverses during morning and afternoon hours, leading to periods of westward current in the ionospheric E region that are known as counter electrojet (CEJ) events. We present the first analysis of CEJ climatology and CEJ dependence on solar flux and lunar phase for the Brazilian sector, based on an extensive ground-based data set for the years 2008 to 2017 from the geomagnetic observatory Tatuoca (1.2 degrees S, 48.5 degrees W), and we compare it to the results found for Huancayo (12.0 degrees S, 75.3 degrees W) observatory in the Peruvian sector. We found a predominance of morning CEJ events for both sectors. The afternoon CEJ occurrence rate in the Brazilian sector is twice as high as in the Peruvian sector. The afternoon CEJ occurrence rate strongly depends on season, with maximum rates occurring during the northern-hemisphere summer for the Brazilian sector and during the northern-hemisphere winter for the Peruvian sector. Significant discrepancies between the two sectors are also found for morning CEJ rates during the northern-hemisphere summer. These longitudinal differences are in agreement with a CEJ climatology derived from contemporary Swarm satellite data and can be attributed in part to the well-known longitudinal wave-4 structure in the background equatorial electrojet strength that results from nonmigrating solar tides and stationary planetary waves. Simulations with the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model show that the remaining longitudinal variability in CEJ during northern summer can be explained by the effect of migrating tides in the presence of the varying geomagnetic field in the South Atlantic Anomaly.

TI  - Satellite-based view of the aerosol spatial and temporal variability in the Cordoba region (Argentina) using over ten years of high-resolution data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based observations offer a unique opportunity to investigate the atmosphere and its changes over decadal time scales, particularly in regions lacking in situ and/or ground based observations. In this study, we investigate temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric particulate matter (aerosol) over the urban area of Cordoba (central Argentina) using over ten years (2003-2015) of high-resolution (1 km) satellite-based retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD). This fine resolution is achieved exploiting the capabilities of a recently developed inversion algorithm (Multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction, MAIAC) applied to the MODIS sensor datasets of the NASA-Terra and-Aqua platforms. Results of this investigation show a clear seasonality of AOD over the investigated area. This is found to be shaped by an intricate superposition of aerosol sources, acting over different spatial scales and affecting the region with different yearly cycles. During late winter and spring (August-October), local as well as near- and long-range transported biomass burning (BB) aerosols enhance the Cordoba aerosol load, and AOD levels reach their maximum values ( > 0.35 at 0.47 mu m). The fine AOD spatial resolution allowed to disclose that, in this period, AOD maxima are found in the rural/agricultural area around the city, reaching up to the city boundaries pinpointing that fires of local and near-range origin play a major role in the AOD enhancement. A reverse spatial AOD gradient is found from December to March, the urban area showing AODs 40-80% higher than in the city surroundings. In fact, during summer, the columnar aerosol load over the Cordoba region is dominated by local (urban and industrial) sources, likely coupled to secondary processes driven by enhanced radiation and mixing effects within a deeper planetary boundary layer (PBL). With the support of modelled AOD data from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA), we further investigated into the chemical nature of AOD. The results suggest that mineral dust is also an important aerosol component in Cordoba, with maximum impact from November to February. The use of a long-term dataset finally allowed a preliminary assessment of AOD trends over the Cordoba region. For those months in which local sources and secondary processes were found to dominate the AOD (December to March), we found a positive AOD trend in the Cordoba outskirts, mainly in the areas with maximum urbanization/population growth over the investigated decade. Conversely, a negative AOD trend (up to -0.1 per decade) is observed all over the rural area of Cordoba during the BB season, this being attributed to a decrease of fires both at the local and the continental scale.

TI  - Accuracy Estimation of the Modern Core Magnetic Field Models Using DMA-Methods for Recognition of the Decreased Geomagnetic Activity in Magnetic Observatory Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA-PHYSICS OF THE SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A new approach to identify the signals of the Earth's main magnetic field (core field) based on the magnetic observatory data processing is suggested. The algorithms implemented in the approach are based on the Discrete mathematical analysis (DMA). The developed method is used to analyze the data from 49 midand low-latitude observatories of the INTERMAGNET network collected in 2011-2015. The results are compared with the classical method for determining the periods of low magnetic activity of external origin which is adopted by the International Association for Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA). The advantages of the suggested new approach are demonstrated. Based on the data records for the selected time intervals, the time series of the core field components and their secular variations are obtained for each observatory. These data are compared to the values predicted by the most accurate core field models: SIFM, CHAOS-6, and EMM-2015. The accuracy of the models is estimated using a set of statistical parameters: Pearson's coefficient of linear correlation, Spearman's and Kendall's coefficients of rank correlation, the mean and median values over the data sets, and the mean difference between the data obtained by the suggested method from observatory measurements and the model predictions.

TI  - A Mathematical Model of a Piezo-Resistive Eight-Beam Three-Axis Accelerometer with Simulation and Experimental Validation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A mathematical model of a sensor is vital to deeply comprehend its working principle and implement its optimal design. However, mathematical models of piezo-resistive eight-beam three-axis accelerometers have rarely been reported. Furthermore, those works are largely focused on the analysis of sensing acceleration in the normal direction, rather than in three directions. Therefore, a complete mathematical model of a piezo-resistive eight-beam three-axis accelerometer is developed in this paper. The validity of the mathematical model is proved by a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation. Furthermore, the accelerometer is fabricated and tested. The prime sensitivities of X, Y and Z axes are 0.209 mV/g, 0.212 mV/g and 1.247 mV/g at 160 Hz, respectively, which is in accord with the values obtained by the model. The reason why the prime sensitivity S-ZZ is bigger than S-XX and S-YY is explained. Besides, it is also demonstrated why the cross-sensitivities S-XZ and S-YZ exceed S-ZX and S-ZY. Compared with the FEM model, the developed model could be helpful in evaluating the performance of three-axis accelerometers in an accurate and rapid way.

TI  - Analysis of impacting factors on polarimetric SAR oil spill detection
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) oil spill detection parameters conformity coefficient (mu), Muller matrix parameters (vertical bar C vertical bar, B-0), the eigenvalues of simplified coherency matrix (lambda(nos)) and the influence of SAR observing parameters, ocean environment and noise level are investigated. Radarsat-2 data are used to make systematic analysis of polarimetric parameters for different incidences, wind speeds, noise levels and the ocean phenomena (oil slick and look likes). The influence of the SAR observing parameters, the ocean environment and the noise level on the typical polarimetric SAR parameter conformity coefficient has been analyzed. The results indicate that conformity coefficient cannot be simply used for oil spill detection, which represents the image signal to the noise level to some extent. When the signals are below the noise level for the oil slick and the look likes, the conformity coefficients are negative; while the signals above the noise level corresponds to positive conformity coefficients. For dark patches (low wind and biogenic slick) with the signal below the noise, polarization features such as conformity coefficient cannot separate them with oil slick. For the signal above the noise, the oil slick, the look likes (low wind and biogenic slick) and clean sea all have positive conformity coefficients, among which, the oil slick has the smallest conformity coefficient, the look likes the second, and the clean sea the largest value. For polarimetric SAR data oil spill detection, the noise plays a significant role. So the polarimetric SAR data oil spill detection should be carried out on the basis of noise consideration.

TI  - Segment-Based Spatial Analysis for Assessing Road Infrastructure Performance Using Monitoring Observations and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Road infrastructure is important to the well-being and economic health of all nations. The performance of road pavement infrastructure is sophisticated and affected by numerous factors and varies greatly across different roads. Large scale spatial analysis for assessing road infrastructure performance is increasingly required for road management, therefore multi-source factors, including satellite remotely sensed climate and environmental data, and ground-monitored vehicles observations, are collected as explanatory variables. Different from the traditional point or area based geospatial attributes, the performance of pavement infrastructure is the line segment based spatial data. Thus, a segment-based spatial stratified heterogeneity method is utilized to explore the comprehensive impacts of vehicles, climate, properties of road and socioeconomic conditions on pavement infrastructure performance. Segment-based optimal discretization is applied on discretizing segment-based pavement data, and a segment-based geographical detector is utilized to assess the spatial impacts of variables and their interactions. Results show that the segment-based methods can more reasonably and accurately describe the characteristics of line segment based spatial data and assess the spatial associations. The two major categories of factors associated with pavement damage are the variables of traffic vehicles and heavy vehicles in particular, and climate and environmental conditions. Meanwhile, the interactions between the explanatory variables in these two categories have much more influence than the single explanatory variables, and the interactions can explain more than half of the pavement damage. This study highlights the great potential of remote sensing based large scale spatial analysis of road infrastructures. The approach in this study provides new ideas for spatial analysis for segmented geographical data. The findings indicate that the quantified comprehensive impacts of variables are practical for wise decision-making for road design, construction and maintenance.

TI  - Using spectral reflectance to estimate leaf chlorophyll content of tea with shading treatments
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Some stresses are utilised to improve qualities of agricultural products. Low light stress increases the chlorophyll content of tea leaves, which improves appearance. Although chlorophyll content estimation is one of the most common applications of hyperspectral remote sensing, previous studies were based on measurements under relatively low stress conditions. In this study, two methods, machine learning algorithms and the inversion of a radiative transfer model, were evaluated using measurements from tea leaves with shading treatments. According to the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), PROSPECT-D inversion (RPD = 1.71-2.31) had the potential for quantifying chlorophyll content, although it required some improvements. Overall, the regression models based on machine learning had high performances. The kernel-based extreme learning machine had the highest performance with a root mean square error of 3.04 +/- 0.52 mu g cm(-2) and RPD values from 3.38 to 5.92 for the test set, which was used for assessing generalisation error.

TI  - A GEOBIA Approach for Multitemporal Land-Cover and Land-Use Change Analysis in a Tropical Watershed in the Southeastern Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern Amazon region has been intensively occupied by human settlements over the past three decades. To evaluate the effects of human settlements on land-cover and land-use (LCLU) changes over time in the study site, we evaluated multitemporal Landsat images from the years 1984, 1994, 2004, 2013 and Sentinel to the year 2017. Then, we defined the LCLU classes, and a detailed "from-to" change detection approach based on a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was employed to determine the trajectories of the LCLU changes. Three land-cover (forest, montane savanna and water bodies) and three land-use types (pasturelands, mining and urban areas) were mapped. The overall accuracies and kappa values of the classification were higher than 0.91 for each of the classified images. Throughout the change detection period, similar to 47% (19,320 km(2)) of the forest was preserved mainly within protected areas, while almost 42% (17,398 km(2)) of the area was converted from forests to pasturelands. An intrinsic connection between the increase in mining activity and the expansion of urban areas also exists. The direct impacts of mining activities were more significant throughout the montane savanna areas. We concluded that the GEOBIA approach adopted in this study combines the advantages of quality human interpretation and the capacities of quantitative computing.

AB  - In considering the 'Populist Responses to Austerity and Cultural Change: Brexit, Trumpism and Beyond', there is a temptation, even a degree of comfort, in depicting 2016 as a kind of deviant moment in which non-elite anger and anxiety fueled an outburst of anti-progressive energy and the electoral victory of demagogues. The proposition put forth in this essay is that leadership scholarship is itself culpable. Transformational leadership, the dominant theme of that discourse, relies on the individual leader as an exceptional individual capable, even obliged, to reshape the worldview of followers in order to align them with the leader's approach. By favoring an appeal to emotions over a rational exchange of positions, by assuming the superiority of one set of values over any others, by denying the validity of differing and/or conflicting interests, and by asserting authority based on hierarchical position rather than informed choice and consent, transformational leadership veered closely to our understanding of demagogues. Unintended though it may be, the dominant discourse becomes engrained as a 'regime of truth' into a pervasive, highly problematic social norm. Leadership scholars must accept a degree of responsibility and reconsider romantic notions of leadership in order to advance alternatives, not only to Trump and his particular agenda but also to the problematic assumptions embedded in and wider effects entwined with leadership thought.

TI  - Remote Sensing Is Changing Our View of the Coast: Insights from 40 Years of Monitoring at Narrabeen-Collaroy, Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach, located on the Northern Beaches of Sydney along the Pacific coast of southeast Australia, is one of the longest continuously monitored beaches in the world. This paper provides an overview of the evolution and international scientific impact of this long-term beach monitoring program, from its humble beginnings over 40 years ago using the rod and tape measure Emery field survey method; to today, where the application of remote sensing data collection including drones, satellites and crowd-sourced smartphone images, are now core aspects of this continuing and much expanded monitoring effort. Commenced in 1976, surveying at this beach for the first 30 years focused on in-situ methods, whereby the growing database of monthly beach profile surveys informed the coastal science community about fundamental processes such as beach state evolution and the role of cross-shore and alongshore sediment transport in embayment morphodynamics. In the mid-2000s, continuous (hourly) video-based monitoring was the first application of routine remote sensing at the site, providing much greater spatial and temporal resolution over the traditional monthly surveys. This implementation of video as the first of a now rapidly expanding range of remote sensing tools and techniques also facilitated much wider access by the international research community to the continuing data collection program at Narrabeen-Collaroy. In the past decade the video-based data streams have formed the basis of deeper understanding into storm to multi-year response of the shoreline to changing wave conditions and also contributed to progress in the understanding of estuary entrance dynamics. More recently, opportunistic' remote sensing platforms such as surf cameras and smartphones have also been used for image-based shoreline data collection. Commencing in 2011, a significant new focus for the Narrabeen-Collaroy monitoring program shifted to include airborne lidar (and later Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)), in an enhanced effort to quantify the morphological impacts of individual storm events, understand key drivers of erosion, and the placing of these observations within their broader regional context. A fixed continuous scanning lidar installed in 2014 again improved the spatial and temporal resolution of the remote-sensed data collection, providing new insight into swash dynamics and the often-overlooked processes of post-storm beach recovery. The use of satellite data that is now readily available to all coastal researchers via Google Earth Engine continues to expand the routine data collection program and provide key insight into multi-decadal shoreline variability. As new and expanding remote sensing technologies continue to emerge, a key lesson from the long-term monitoring at Narrabeen-Collaroy is the importance of a regular re-evaluation of what data is most needed to progress the science.

TI  - The role and performance of ground-based networks in tracking the evolution of the ozone layer
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 1980s, ground-based monitoring of the ozone layer played a key role in the discovery of the Antarctic Ozone Hole as well as in the first documentation of significant winter and spring long-term downward trends in the populated mid-latitude regions. The article summarizes the close-to-hundred-year-long history of ground-based measurements of stratospheric ozone, and more recent observations of constituents that influence its equilibrium. Ozone observations began long before the recognition of the impact of increasing emissions of manmade ozone-depleting substances on ozone and therefore on UV levels, human health, ecosystems and the Earth climate. The historical ozone observations prior to 1980s are used as a reference for the assessments of the state of the ozone layer linked to the enforcement of the Montreal Protocol. In this paper, we describe the worldwide monitoring networks and their ozone observations used to determine longterm trends with an accuracy of a few percent per decade. Since 1989, the ground-based monitoring activities have provided support for the amendments of the Montreal Protocol (MP). They include monitoring of (a) the ozone total column and the vertical distribution at global scale, (b) the ozone-depleting substances (ODS) related to the MP such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and their decomposition products in the stratosphere, and (c) the atmospheric species playing a role in ozone depletion, e.g., nitrogen oxides, water vapor, aerosols, polar stratospheric clouds. We highlight important accomplishments in the atmospheric monitoring performed by the Global Atmosphere Watch program (GAW) run under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and by the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). We also address the complementary roles of ground-based networks and satellite instruments. Highquality ground-based measurements have been used to evaluate ozone variabilities and long-term trends, assess chemistry climate models, and check the long-term stability of satellite data, including more recently the merged satellite time-series developed for the detection of ozone recovery at global scale, which might be further modified by climate change.

TI  - Forecasted homogenization of high Arctic vegetation communities under climate change
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Climate change results in increasing temperature and modified precipitation regimes in the High Arctic. Models can help anticipate the consequences on future biotic dynamics, e.g. vegetation. In rugged terrain, forecasts should consider fine-scale spatial variability in environmental conditions that are proximally linked to plant performance. Here, we forecasted Arctic plant community response to future climate change using high-resolution environmental variables. Location Methods Zackenberg in the High Arctic of Greenland. Using a combination of remote-sensing data and field measurements, we interpolated soil moisture and temperature at 1 m resolution together with spatial data on snow cover and solar radiation. We calibrated stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) with data from 200 vegetation plots. To explore the sensitivity of Arctic communities to climate change, we forecasted these models under simulated increases in temperature and changes (positive or negative) in snow cover and soil moisture, corresponding to more winter and/or summer precipitation and higher frequencies of summer droughts. Results Main conclusions S-SDMs associated with high-resolution environmental variables were able to reproduce the spatial variation in species richness and plant community structure along a mountain slope in Zackenberg. Model forecasts under climate change revealed that most species reacted to a combination of changes in soil moisture and temperature, and changes in these two variables resulted in an extensive restructuring of the distributions of species assemblages. In most scenarios, a gradual homogenization of communities was forecasted due to shrub expansion. Increasing temperatures and altered soil moisture were predicted to turn the currently highly heterogeneous tundra landscape at Zackenberg into homogenous dwarf-shrub tundra. Such homogenization of vegetation communities may have profound ramifications for species, interaction webs, and ecosystem processes via modifications to the surface albedo, energy and water balance, as well as snow accumulation and permafrost.

Hoarseness is vocal roughness and a possible manifestation of dysphonia. This article uses the broader term dysphonia because it reflects of a wide range of voice complaints, with or without vocal roughness. Dysphonia is often caused by benign conditions but may also be the sentinel symptom of a serious or progressive condition requiring immediate diagnosis and management. The role of laryngeal visualization in assessment and diagnosis for these patients is critical.

TI  - Satellite SAR interferometry for the improved assessment of the state of activity of landslides: A case study from the Cordilleras of Peru
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Peru landslides have been causing damages and casualties annually due to the high mountain relief and distinct seasonal precipitation distribution. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry represents one possibility for mapping surface deformation at fine spatial resolution over large areas in order to characterize aspects of terrain motion and potentially hazardous processes. We present land surface motion maps derived from satellite SAR interferometry (InSAR) for a part of the Santa River Basin between the Cordilleras Blanca and Negra around the city of Carhuaz in Peru. Using both Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and differential SAR Interferograms (DInSAR) from ALOS-1 PALSAR-1, ENVISAT ASAR, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 we mapped 42 landslides extending over 17,190,141 m(2) within three classes of activity (i.e. 0-2 cm/a, 2-10 cm/a and > 10 cm/a). A geomorphological inventory of landslides was prepared from optical satellite imagery and field experience and compared to the InSAR-based slope-instability inventory. The two approaches provide slightly different information about landslide spatial and temporal activity patterns, but altogether they can be combined for the assessment of the state of activity of landslides and possibly the development of hazard maps, which are not systematically available in this region. We conclude that ALOS PALSAR (1 and 2) and Sentinel-1 data have a high potential to derive high-quality surface deformation information of landslides in many mountainous regions worldwide due to their global and frequent acquisition strategies.

TI  - Spatial Prediction of Erosion Risk of a Small Mountainous Watershed Using RUSLE: A Case-Study of the Palar Sub-Watershed in Kodaikanal, South India
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - An erosion model using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) equation derived from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER G-DEM) and LANDSAT 8 is presented in the study. This model can be a cost-effective, quick and less labor-intensive tool for assessing erosion in small watersheds. It can also act as a vital input for the primary assessment of environmental degradation in the region, and can aid the formulation of watershed development planning strategies. The Palar River, which drains into Shanmukha Nadi, is a small mountain watershed. The town of Kodaikanal, a popular tourist attraction in Tamilnadu, forms part of this sub-watershed. This quaint, hill-town has been subjected to intense urbanization and exhaustive changes in its land use practices for the past decade. The consequence of this change is manifested in the intense environmental degradation of the region, which results in problems such as increased numbers of landslides, intense soil erosion, forest fires and land degradation. The nature of the terrain, high precipitation, and intense agriculture exponentially increase the rate of soil erosion. Spatial prediction of soil erosion is thereby a valuable and mandatory tool for sustainable land use practices and economic development of the region. A comprehensive methodology is employed to predict the spatial variation of soil erosion using the revised soil loss equation in a geographic information system (GIS) platform. The soil erosion susceptibility map shows a maximum annual soil loss of 3345 Mg.ha(-1).y(-1), which correlates with scrub forests, degraded forests, steep slopes, high drainage density and shifting cultivation practices. The erosion map shows that the central region is subjected to intense erosion while the inhabited southern part is less prone to erosion. A small patch of severe soil loss is also visible on the eastern part of the northern fringe. About 4% of the sub-watershed is severely affected by soil erosion and 18% falls within a moderate erosion zone. The growing demand for land and infrastructure development forces the shift of urbanization and agriculture to these less-managed spaces. In light of this scenario, the spatial distribution of erosion combined with terrain and hydro-morphometry can aid in sustainable development and promote healthy land use practices in the region.

TI  - Monitoring Coastal Reclamation Subsidence in Hong Kong with Distributed Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence has been a significant problem in land reclaimed from the sea, and it is usually characterized by a differential settlement pattern due to locally unconsolidated marine sediments and fill materials. Time series Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) techniques based on distributed scatterers (DS), which can identify sufficient measurement points (MPs) when point-wise radar targets are lacking, have great potential to measure such differential reclamation settlement. However, the computational time cost has been the main drawback of current distributed scatterer interferometry (DSI) for its applications compared to the standard PSI analysis. In this paper, we adopted an improved DSI processing strategy for a fast and robust analysis of land subsidence in reclaimed regions, which is characterized by an integration of fast statistically homogeneous pixel selection based (FaSHPS-based) DS detection and eigendecomposition phase optimization. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed DSI strategy in computational efficiency and deformation estimation reliability by applying it to two TerraSAR-X image data stacks from 2008 to 2009 to retrieve land subsidence over two typical reclaimed regions of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP). Compared with the state-of-the-art DSI methods, the proposed strategy significantly improves the computational efficiency, which is enhanced approximately 30 times in DS identification and 20 times in phase optimization. On average, the DSI strategy results in 7.8 and 3.7 times the detected number of MPs for HKIA and HKSP with respect to persistent scatter interferometry (PSI), which enables a very detailed characterization of locally differential settlement patterns. Moreover, the DSI-derived results agree well with the levelling survey measurements at HKIA, with a mean difference of 1.87 mm/yr and a standard deviation of 2.08 mm/yr. The results demonstrate that the proposed DSI strategy is effective at improving target density, accuracy and efficiency in monitoring ground deformation, particularly over reclaimed coastal areas.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations in water use efficiency and its drivers in China over the last three decades
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) reflects the intimately coupled relationship between the carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the inter-annual variation and its drivers of WUE are poorly understood at regional/global scale, due to either limited data availability or uncertainties in current data streams. In this study, we used process-based models simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) data to estimate the ecosystem WUE (eWUE, GPP/ET) in China for 1979-2012. The eWUE estimates were validated against eddy covariance-based values from 35 flux towers. The inter-annual variation of the eWUE was quantified and its responses to annual precipitation (AP), annual mean temperature (AMT), and annual mean leaf area index (AMLAI) were analyzed. The key findings were as follows. (i) The mean annual eWUE over China was 1.48 +/- 1.04 g C kg(-1) H2O and had a slightly increasing but not significant trend (7.32 x 10(-4)g C kg(-1) H2O yr(-1), p < 0.05) from 1979 to 2012. (ii) The spatial distribution of the eWUE trend showed large spatial variability. similar to 21.4% and similar to 19.0% of vegetated land in China had significant increasing and decreasing trends (Mann-Kendall test, p < 0.1), respectively. The increasing eWUE was mainly found in the northeast, southwest, and central areas of China, while the decreasing eWUE was mostly distributed in west China. (iii) The inter annual variation of the spatially averaged annual eWUE was negatively correlated with that of AP and AMT, and positively correlated with that of AMLAI. In similar to 41.4%, similar to 9.9%, and similar to 3.1% of vegetated land in China the inter annual variation of eWUE was dominated by the inter-annual variations of AP, AMT, and AMLAI, respectively. In most land of north China and west China the inter-annual variation of eWUE was dominated by the inter-annual variation of AP, while in central, east and south China all the AP, AMT, AMLAI, and other drivers played important roles.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of Ulva prolifera blooms and the corresponding influence on chlorophyll-a concentration in the Southern Yellow Sea, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's largest macroalgal blooms (MABs) caused by the Mai prolifera outbreaks have occurred every summer since 2007 in the Southern Yellow Sea, China. Accumulating evidence showed that MABs may deteriorate the regional marine environment and influence the growth of some primary producers such as phytoplankton. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of U. prolifera green tides and chlorophyll-a concentration in the Southern Yellow Sea in 2015 using satellite images obtained from HI-1 CCD, MODIS, and GOCI. The correlation between the distributions of U. prolifera abundance and chlorophyll-a concentration was analyzed quantitatively by setting up a series of 5 x 5 km experimental grids, and we also discussed the possible mechanisms about the influence of U. prolifera blooms on the other floating microalgae. The results showed that the development of U. prolifera blooms in the Southern Yellow Sea in 2015 could be featured as "appearance - development - outbreak - decline - disappearance", while the concentration of chlorophyll-a showed "increase - sharp decline - slow recovery - stabilization" from April to August. We also found that the concentration of chlorophyll-a had the following relationships with U. proliferu temporally: (1) the concentration of chlorophyll-a increased with the growth of U. prolifera from April to mid-May; (2) the chlorophyll-a concentration decreased sharply with the dramatically increased coverage of U. prolifera in June; and (3) the chlorophyll-a concentration slowly recovered and finally stabilized as U. prolifera decreased in July. Generally, there was a negative correlation between the occurrence of U. prolifera and chlorophyll-a concentration in the Southern Yellow Sea, China. Our results showed that the outbreak of U. prolifera does have a certain impact on the growth and reproduction of planktonic microalgae, and it suggests that U. pro lifera blooms have potentially altered the ecological balance in the coastal waters of the Southern Yellow Sea.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Logistic Regression Analysis along the Jinsha River and Its Tributaries Close to Derong and Deqin County, Southwestern China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the areas that are most susceptible to landslide occurrence, and to find the key factors associated with landslides along Jinsha River and its tributaries close to Derong and Deqin County. Thirteen influencing factors, including (a) lithology, (b) slope angle, (c) slope aspect, (d) TWI, (e) curvature, (f) SPI, (g) STI, (h) topographic relief, (i) rainfall, (j) vegetation, (k) NDVI, (1) distance-to-river, (m) and distance-to-fault, were selected as the landslide conditioning factors in landslide susceptibility mapping. These factors were mainly obtained from the field survey, digital elevation model (DEM), and Landsat 4-5 imagery using ArcGIS software. A total of 40 landslides were identified in the study area from field survey and aerial photos' interpretation. First, the frequency ratio (FR) method was used to clarify the relationship between the landslide occurrence and the influencing factors. Then, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to eliminate multiple collinearities between the 13 influencing factors and to reduce the dimension of the influencing factors. Subsequently, the factors that were reselected using the PCA were introduced into the logistic regression analysis to produce the landslide susceptibility map. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of the logistic regression analysis model. The landslide susceptibility map was divided into the following five classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The results showed that the ratios of the areas of the five susceptibility classes were 23.14%, 22.49%, 18.00%, 19.08%, and 17.28%, respectively. And the prediction accuracy of the model was 83.4%. The results were also compared with the FR method (79.9%) and the AHP method (76.9%), which meant that the susceptibility model was reasonable. Finally, the key factors of the landslide occurrence were determined based on the above results. Consequently, this study could serve as an effective guide for further land use planning and for the implementation of development.

TI  - Crop Leaf Area Index Retrieval Based on Inverted Difference Vegetation Index and NDVI
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI), an important parameter describing a crop canopy structure and its growth status, can he estimated from remote sensing data by statistical methods involving vegetation indices (VIs). This letter reports the development of a new VI, the inverted difference vegetation index (IDVI), for crop LAI retrieval. The IDVI can overcome the saturation issue of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at high LAI values and exhibits robust insensitivity to crop leaf water and chlorophyll content. By combining the IDVI and NDVI with a scaling factor, we constructed a novel statistical regression model with parameters that can he calibrated to a specific region to estimate the LAI. Validations on simulated data and in situ observations show that the proposed retrieval method with the IDVI is stable for low and high LAIs and obtains better results than the empirical method involving the NDVI at the regional scale. Findings in this letter will benefit future agricultural applications.

TI  - Evaluation of diurnal variation of GPM IMERG-derived summer precipitation over the contiguous US using MRMS data
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the accuracy of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), which provides merged microwave and infrared satellite precipitation estimates, over the contiguous US. The study focuses on diurnal variations in precipitation during a two-year summer period (June-August, 2014-2015). The normalized amplitude and phase of the diurnal cycle of IMERG are evaluated against those of ground reference from the Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system in terms of precipitation amount, frequency and intensity on a 1 degrees/1 hr scale. IMERG well captures large-scale regional features of the diurnal cycle of precipitation and overall agrees well with the reference for both diurnal and semidiurnal variations. The comparison results indicate that the IMERG precipitation estimates can be a reliable alternative to ground-based measurements even at the subdaily scale; however, region-specific data discrepancies are still observed. For instance, we reveal that IMERG substantially overestimates normalized amplitude of diurnal precipitation in the central US, while IMERG tends to underestimate diurnal variations over the mountain regions in the western and eastern US. In terms of phase, we find a significant difference in the timing of peak precipitation between convective and stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) over the Great Plains. This time shift is more apparent during the mature and dissipation stages of MCSs, which lead to relatively early peaks in the diurnal cycle of precipitation from IMERG. This phase bias implies a higher sensitivity of IMERG towards the convective regions of MCSs, supposedly because of the brightness temperature depression coming from ice particles aloft sampled by spaceborne passive microwave sensors. Such discrepancy between the actual and satellite-estimated precipitation timing can be challenging, e.g. when the satellite data are used to study subdaily precipitation processes or to validate numerical simulations. Consequently, our assessment of the IMERG performances highlights the need for improvements in the IMERG system.

AB  - The accuracy in land-cover classification using remotely sensed imagery can be increased using Bayesian methods that incorporate prior probabilities of classes. However, estimating these prior probabilities can be expensive and data intensive. We propose methods to improve the classification accuracy using Bayesian methods to classify ambiguous (or low-confidence) pixels, using only the remotely sensed imagery or existing land-covermaps to estimate prior probabilities. We propose a spatial method that predicts prior probabilities from the original image, and a temporal method that incorporates land-covermaps fromprevious years. We illustrate our methods with a neural network (NN) classifier on the U.S. state of Iowa to classify crops into corn/soybean/other using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. USDAcropland data layers were aggregated to the 250-m resolution of MODIS and used as ground truth, based on a cropland mask from the National Land Cover Database. Results show that the spatial-prior-adjustment method, which predicts prior probabilities for low-confidence pixels based on class percentages of initial NN classification, increased overall accuracy of low-confidence pixels between 2% and 3.3% over the standard NN classification. The temporal-prior-adjustment method, which uses crop classes from the previous six years to estimate prior probabilities for the current year, shows significantly greater accuracy improvement for low-confidence pixels (almost 7%) over the standard NN classification. Increased benefit of the temporal-prior-adjustment method relative to the spatial-prior-adjustment method is likely due to increased information from more ground truth data (from previous years) than the spatial method.

TI  - Real-time navigation system for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer patients using projection mapping with indocyanine green fluorescence
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Inability to visualize indocyanine green fluorescence images in the surgical field limits the application of current near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIR) systems for real-time navigation during sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the Medical Imaging Projection System (MIPS), which uses active projection mapping, for SLN biopsy.Methods A total of 56 patients (59 procedures) underwent SLN biopsy using the MIPS between March 2016 and November 2017. After SLN biopsy using the MIPS, residual SLNs were removed using a conventional NIR camera and/or radioisotope method. The primary endpoint of this study was identification rate of SLNs using the MIPS.Results In all procedures, at least one SLN was detected by the MIPS, giving an SLN identification rate of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 94-100%]. SLN biopsy was successfully performed without operating lights in all procedures. In total, 3 positive SLNs were excised using MIPS, but were not included in the additional SLNs excised by other methods. The median number of SLNs excised using the MIPS was 3 (range 1-7). Of procedures performed after preoperative systemic therapy, the median number of SLNs excised using the MIPS was 3 (range 2-6).Conclusions The MIPS is effective in detecting SLNs in patients with breast cancer, providing continuous and accurate projection of fluorescence signals in the surgical field, without need for operating lights, and could be useful in real-time navigation surgery for SLN biopsy.

TI  - Change Detection based on Stacked Generalization System with Segmentation Constraint
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection based on a multi-classifier ensemble system can take advantage of multiple classifiers to extract change information in remote sensing images. In this paper, an efficient heterogeneous ensemble algorithm, i.e., the stacked generalization (Sc) combined with image segmentation, is proposed to construct a simple multi-classifier ensemble system that can offer better detection accuracy with lower computational cost. Due to the rich spatial information in high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images, structure texture (morphological) and statistical texture features are extracted to construct the input data to the ensemble system along with spectral features. In addition, constrained analysis on segmented objects integrates the smaller heterogeneity segmentation map and pixel-wise change map to generate the final change map. The experiments were carried out on two ZY-3 and a QuickBird dataset. The results show that the proposed algorithm can integrate the advantages of both pixel-wise ensemble and object-oriented methods, and effectively improve the accuracy and stability of change detection.

TI  - Nonlinear Split-Window Algorithms for Estimating Land and Sea Surface Temperatures From Simulated Chinese Gaofen-5 Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a different thermal channel combination split-window (DTCC-SW) method to estimate the land surface temperature (LST) and sea ST (SST) from the Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data. A nonlinear combination of two adjacent channels CH8,20 (centered at 8.20 mu m) and CH8.63 (centered at 8.63 mu m) was proposed to estimate LST for low-emissivity surfaces. A nonlinear combination of two adjacent channels, CH10.80 (centered at 10.80 mu m) and CH11.95 (centered at 11.92 mu m), was developed to estimate LST and SST for high-emissivity surfaces under dry atmospheric conditions, and a nonlinear combination of two channels, CH8.63 and CH11.95, was used to estimate LST and SST for high-emissivity surfaces under wet atmospheric conditions. The numerical values of the DTCC-SW coefficients were obtained using a statistical regression method from synthetic data simulated with an accurate atmospheric radiative transfer model moderate spectral resolution atmospheric transmittance mode 5 over a wide range of atmospheric and surface conditions. The LST (SST), mean emissivity, and atmospheric water vapor content were divided into several tractable subranges to improve the fitting accuracy. The experimental results and the preliminary evaluation results showed that the root-mean-square error between the actual and estimated LSTs (SSTs) is less than 0.7 K (0.3 K), provided that the land surface emissivities are known, which indicates that the proposed DTCC-SW method can accurately estimate the LST and SST from the GF-5 TIR data.

TI  - A Comparison between the MODIS Product (MOD17A2) and a Tide-Robust Empirical GPP Model Evaluated in a Georgia Wetland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of tidal ecosystems in the global carbon budget, the relationships between environmental drivers and carbon dynamics in these wetlands remain poorly understood. This limited understanding results from the challenges associated with in situ flux studies and their correlation with satellite imagery which can be affected by periodic tidal flooding. Carbon dioxide eddy covariance (EC) towers are installed in only a few wetlands worldwide, and the longest eddy-covariance record from Georgia (GA) wetlands contains only two continuous years of observations. The goals of the present study were to evaluate the performance of existing MODIS Gross Primary Production (GPP) products (MOD17A2) against EC derived GPP and develop a tide-robust Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) based model to predict GPP within a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh on Sapelo Island, GA. These EC tower-based observations represent a basis to associate CO2 fluxes with canopy reflectance and thus provide the means to use satellite-based reflectance data for broader scale investigations. We demonstrate that Light Use Efficiency (LUE)-based MOD17A2 does not accurately reflect tidal wetland GPP compared to a simple empirical vegetation index-based model where tidal influence was accounted for. The NDMI-based GPP model was capable of predicting changes in wetland CO2 fluxes and explained 46% of the variation in flux-estimated GPP within the training data, and a root mean square error of 6.96 g C m(-2) in the validation data. Our investigation is the first to create a MODIS-based wetland GPP estimation procedure that demonstrates the importance of filtering tidal observations from satellite surface reflectance data.

TI  - Prognostic value of the systematic immune-inflammation index among patients with operable colon cancer A retrospective study
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The systematic immune-inflammation index (SII) has been used to predict the prognosis of patients with various cancers. This study aimed to determine whether the preoperative SII was associated with postoperative survival among patients with operable colon cancer.This retrospective study included 118 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects and 118 patients who underwent radical surgery for colon cancer between January 2011 and December 2013. The preoperative SII was calculated based on counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets in the peripheral blood. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationships between the SII and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration, average length of stay (ALOS), and medical costs during hospitalization. The chi(2) test or Fisher exact test was used to analyze the relationship between the preoperative SII and the postoperative survival rate.The median SII value was 667.75 among patients with colon cancer, which was higher than the value among healthy subjects. A high SII (>667.75) was associated with a large tumor size and advanced TNM stage, although it was not associated with age, sex, tumor location, or pathological grade. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the SII was positively correlated with serum CEA concentration, ALOS, and medical costs. Relative to a low SII, a high SII was significantly associated with a lower overall survival rate at 3 years and 5 years after surgery.The present study's findings suggest that the preoperative SII is a useful prognostic index for patients with operative colon cancer.

TI  - Improving tropical deforestation detection through using photosynthetic vegetation time series - (PVts-β)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new approach of change detection that reduces seasonality in time series by using Photosynthetic Vegetation Time Series (PVTS) from satellite images. With this approach, each pixel value represents at the subpixel level a fraction of the photosynthetic forest's activity. Our hypothesis is based on an assumption that photosynthetic vegetation fractions will remain constant until a disturbing agent (natural or anthropic) occurs. Using Landsat data, we compared our approach with the Carnegie Landsat Systems Analysis-Lite (CLASlite) approach and with the national reports of the Ministry of the Environment of Peru (MINAM). After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation events with a new detection method. Our approach (which was called PVts-beta) of detection is a simple method that does not model the seasonality and it only requires as inputs: i) the average and standard deviation of the time series of a pixel and ii) a threshold magnitude (beta) that was calibrated to detect deforestation events in tropical forests. For the PVts-beta approach, the results of calibration show that deforestation was optimally detected for beta = (5,6), higher or lower than this range, the biases favor to false detections and favor the omission of deforestation too. On the other hand, the overall accuracy for the PVts-beta approach was 91.1%, with an omission and commission of 8.3% and 0.5% respectively, while for CLASlite the overall accuracy was 79.2%, with an omission and commission of 20.8% and 0.0% respectively. The differences in the overall accuracy between the PVts-beta and CLASlite approach were significant, being atmospheric noise a main problem which CLASlite usually does not work optimally. The strength of our PVts-beta approach is the early detection at the subpixel level of deforestation events that, added to our new method of change detection explain the little omission obtained in the results. Therefore, the PVts-beta approach-that we propose here- provides the opportunity to monitoring deforestation events in tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data, and it can be used for near-real-time change detection monitoring without a doubt.

TI  - Meta-analysis of sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with initial biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer has the potential to achieve a pathological complete response in up to 40 per cent of patients, converting disease that was initially node-positive to node-negative. This has raised the question of whether sentinel lymph node biopsy could be an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection in these patients. The aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the accuracy and reliability of sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with initial biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer.Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science databases up to 30 April 2017. Inclusion criteria for studies were pathological confirmation of initial node-positive disease, and sentinel lymph node biopsy performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by axillary lymph node dissection.Results: A total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis (1921 patients in total). The pooled estimate of identification rate was 90 (95 per cent c.i. 87 to 93) per cent and the false-negative rate was 14 (11 to 17) per cent. In subgroup analysis, the false-negative rate with use of dual mapping was 11 (6 to 15) per cent, compared with 19 (11 to 27) per cent with single mapping. The false-negative rate was 20 (13 to 27) per cent when one node was removed, 12 (5 to 19) per cent with two nodes removed and 4 (0 to 9) per cent with removal of three or more nodes.Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer is accurate and reliable, but requires careful patient selection and optimal surgical techniques.

AB  - In this article, Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) altimeter data were used with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover maps to determine Aksehir Lake/wetland water levels, which dried up in 2008. Since the water level dropped below the gage in 2004, the ICESAT-MODIS (ICEM)-based lake water levels could not be compared with gage levels. Instead, combined use of Landsat satellite based lake surface area studies and Aksehir Lake bathymetry (LAB) enabled ICEM assessment. ICEM and LAB differences are between -0.09m and 0.32m and close to the standard deviations (s.d.) of pure ICESat-based studies (0.02m-0.27m). The minimum and maximum water surface elevation changes of ICEM between consecutive winter and spring are 0.30m and 1.35m and are in the historical range. ICEM showed highest s.d. during October 2005, when the wind velocities were highest.

TI  - Beefing Up Biosecurity: Survey of Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) Currently Threatening the Tennessee Beef Cattle Industry, and a Proposed Monitoring Strategy for Invasive Ticks
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne diseases are poised to devastate the North American cattle industry if infected ticks invade the country either by importation of an infested-animal or with natural host migration. Our research objectives were to identify sources for invasive-tick monitoring and use those sources to describe seasonal and regional impacts on infestation prevalence and burden of ticks on beef cattle. Throughout the state of Tennessee, we sampled 25% of the total herd size (or 10 animals) at three university-operated research and education centers (RECs) (sentinel sites), six livestock auctions (check-stations), and nine Extension agents at 21 producer locations (tick scouts) from 2015 to 2016. From 1,817 sampled cattle 740 ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) were collected including 573 Amblyomma americanum (L.) (77.4%), 125 A. maculatum Koch (16.9%), 35 Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (4.7%), and 3 Ixodes scapularis (Say) (0.4%). Western and middle Tennessee were significantly different in infestation prevalence and burden of A. maculatum. For A. maculatum and the species total, infestation prevalence and burden were greater in spring than fall. Auctions (check stations) and RECs (sentinels) had the greatest infestation prevalence of A. maculatum, and the greatest burden of A. maculatum and D. variabilis. High-risk locations clustered in western and middle Tennessee, with low-risk locations in middle and eastern Tennessee. Results from this study provide knowledge necessary to initiate control measures, including seasonal phenology and regional distribution of current tick threats. Use of RECs as sentinel sites and routine tick surveillance at livestock auctions serving as check stations should be used for mitigating invasive tick threats.

TI  - Modifying the Biogents Sentinel Trap to Increase the Longevity of Captured <i>Aedes aegypti</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is a vector of viruses causing dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever and subsequently pose a significant global threat to public health. While sampling live mosquitoes is useful for surveillance purposes, most traps targeting Aedes kill captured mosquitoes. The Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap, the gold standard for capturing Ae. aegypti, is one such trap. In our study, we modified the BGS trap to increase the survival of captured Ae. aegypti by replacing the trap's catch bag with a catch pot that protects mosquitoes from desiccation by airflow. A sucrose-soaked sponge or nucleic acid preservative card can also be placed inside the pot to enhance mosquito survival and augment arbovirus detection. These modifications to the BGS significantly increased the longevity of mosquitoes captured with weekly survivals of 93% in a semifield structure and 86% in the field. These high survival rates resulted in 3.5 times more alive Ae. aegypti captured weekly in the modified BGS compared to the original BGS, despite 40% lower overall catch rates. These cheap and simple trap modifications facilitate easier specimen identification as well as experiments requiring live field-collected samples such as virus detection from mosquito saliva and excreta.

TI  - Applications of the United States Forest Inventory and Analysis dataset: a review and future directions
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The United States Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program has been monitoring national forest resources in the United States for over 80 years; presented here is a synthesis of research applications for FIA data. A review of over 180 publications that directly utilize FIA data is broken down into broad categories of application and further organized by methodologies and niche research areas. The FIA program provides the most comprehensive forest database currently available, with permanent plots distributed across all forested lands and ownerships in the United States and plot histories dating back to the early 1930s. While the data can be incredibly powerful, users need to understand the spatial resolution of ground-based plots and the nature of the FIA plot coordinate system must be applied correctly. As the need for accurate assessments of national forest resources continues to be a global priority, particularly related to carbon dynamics and climate impacts, such national forest inventories will continue to be an important source of information on the status of and trends in these ecosystems. The advantages and limitations of FIA's national forest inventory data are highlighted, and suggestions for further expansion of the FIA program are provided.

TI  - Scattered and Received Wave Polarization Optimization for Enhanced Peatland Classification and Fire Damage Assessment Using Polarimetric PALSAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The complementarity of the "scattered" and "received" wave polarization signatures is demonstrated for enhanced characterization of peatlands and surrounding forests. Polarimetric L-band ALOS-PALSAR data collected for the Athabasca oil sand exploration region, with peatlands and forests partially affected by multiple wildfires, are used. It is shown that the scattered wave polarization signature, which represents the explicit variations of the degree of polarization (DoP) and the total scattered intensity R-0 with transmitted polarization, permits enhanced discrimination of treed bogs from upland forests and improved identification of wildfire damage in peatlands and surrounding forests. Scattered wave optimization is used as a convenient method for efficient exploitation of the scattered wave polarization signature. The Touzi decomposition is adopted for the optimization of the received wave polarization signature. The unique potential of the scattering-type phase generated with the Touzi decomposition is confirmed for enhanced discrimination of poor fens from bogs. These two important peatland classes cannot be separated with the scattered wave optimization, the conventional multipolarization (HH-HV-VV) channels, and the Freeman model based decomposition. Finally, the Touzi decomposition is combined with the extrema of the scattered wave main parameters ( DoP and R-0) for optimum extraction of polarimetric PALSAR information. This information is, then, fused with Landsat-5-TM for enhanced peatland classification. The comparison with optical Landsat5-TM-based classification confirms the valuable added information that a long penetrating polarimetric L-band PALSAR can provide for enhanced peatland classification and efficient assessment of peat health in burnt peatlands.

T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of satellite observations obtained with the help of X-ray and gamma-ray detector units (BDRG/Lomonosov in Russian), using digital filtering methods, the analysis of time delays between the second pulsations of time profiles of hard X-ray radiation of different frequency bands from the solar flare that occurred on July 21, 2016 has been made. It is shown that the count rate in energy channels of 10-20, 20-35, and 35-60 keV detected by BDRG/Lomonosov are correlated with an accuracy up to 0.1 s. The result agrees well with the observations of the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on board the Fermi satellite and supposes an effective acceleration of charged particles over the entire length of the flare magnetic arc.

AB  - Intraoperative fluorescence imaging (FI) with indocyanine green has several potential uses during esophagectomy. Intravascular injection for enhancing the visualization of conduit vascularity and assessing macroperfusion and microperfusion has the most literature support and may help reduce anastomotic leaks. Peritumoral injection has been reported for use in identifying sentinel nodes during lymphadenectomy, and intralymphatic injection may be used to help preserve or ligate the thoracic duct. The authors' own technique of FI for conduit assessment is described. They routinely use this strategy to guide anastomosis placement and reduce leaks.

TI  - Congo Basin forest loss dominated by increasing smallholder clearing
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A regional assessment of forest disturbance dynamics from 2000 to 2014 was performed for the Congo Basin countries using time-series satellite data. Area of forest loss was estimated and disaggregated by predisturbance forest type and direct disturbance driver. An estimated 84% of forest disturbance area in the region is due to small-scale, nonmechanized forest clearing for agriculture. Annual rates of small-scale clearing for agriculture in primary forests and woodlands doubled between 2000 and 2014, mirroring increasing population growth. Smallholder clearing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone accounted for nearly two-thirds of total forest loss in the basin. Selective logging is the second most significant disturbance driver, contributing roughly 10% of regional gross forest disturbance area and more than 60% of disturbance area in Gabon. Forest loss due to agro-industrial clearing along the Gulf of Guinea coast more than doubled in the last half of the study period. Maintaining natural forest cover in the Congo Basin into the future will be challenged by an expected fivefold population growth by 2100 and allocation of industrial timber harvesting and large-scale agricultural development inside remaining old-growth forests.

TI  - Survival in clinical stage I endometrial cancer with single vs. multiple positive pelvic nodes: results of a multi-institutional Italian study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate survival outcomes in endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) patients with single vs. multiple positive pelvic lymph nodes.Methods: We performed a retrospective evaluation of all consecutive patients with histologically proven International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIC1 EEC who underwent primary surgical treatment between 2004 and 2014 at seven Italian gynecologic oncology referral centers. Patients with pre- or intra-operative evidence of extrauterine disease (including the presence of bulky nodes) and patients with stage IIIC2 disease were excluded, in order to obtain a homogeneous population.Results: Overall 140 patients met the inclusion criteria. The presence of >1 metastatic pelvic node was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence and mortality, compared to only 1 metastatic node, at both univariate (recurrence: hazard ratio [HR]=2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.2-3.99; p=0.01; mortality: HR=2.8; 95% CI=1.24-6.29; p=0.01) and multivariable analysis (recurrence: HR=1.91; 95% CI=1.02-3.56; p=0.04; mortality: HR=2.62; 95% CI=1.13-6.05; p=0.02) and it was the only independent predictor of prognosis in this subset of patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were significantly longer in patients with only 1 metastatic node compared to those with more than 1 metastatic node (p=0.008 and 0.009, respectively).Conclusion: The presence of multiple metastatic nodes in stage IIIC1 EEC represents an independent predictor of worse survival, compared to only one positive node. Our data suggest that EEC patients may be categorized according to the number of positive nodes.

TI  - Internal mammary lymph node metastases in breast cancer: what should radiologists know?
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) chain is a pathway through which breast lymphatic drainage flows. The internal mammary lymphatic vessel runs around the internal mammary artery and veins with IMLN in the parasternal intercostal spaces. IMLN metastasis, which forms a part of clinical TNM staging, may negatively affect the prognosis of primary breast cancer patients. IMLN metastasis is clinically detected using ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and F-18-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography. The uptake of radioactive tracers in IMLN with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes is often identified using sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) in primary breast cancer patients. The indication for IMLN biopsy or resection that is clinically detected or visualized using SLNM is controversial. The clinically suspicious IMLN may be considered for ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. First IMLN recurrence needs to be biopsied. Irradiation of the breast, chest wall, and/or regional nodal irradiation, including IMLN, following lumpectomy or postmastectomy is recommended. Although radiation therapy for IMLN recurrence may improve clinical outcomes, it is also associated with pulmonary and cardiac toxicities. This review covers the local anatomy of IMLN, lymph drainage and image findings of IMLN with a discussion.

TI  - Comparative Performance Evaluation of Pixel-Level and Decision-Level Data Fusion of Landsat 8 OLI, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Sentinel-2 MSI for Crop Ensemble Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crops mapping unequivocally becomes a daunting task in humid, tropical, or subtropical regions due to unattainability of adequate cloud-free optical imagery. Objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative performance between decision- and pixel-levels data fusion ensemble classified maps using Landsat 8, Landsat 7, and Sentinel-2 data. This research implements parallel and concatenation approach to ensemble classify the images. The multiclassifier system comprises of Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machines, and Spectral Information Divergence as base classifiers. Decision-level fusion is achieved by implementing plurality voting method. Pixel-level fusion is achieved by implementing fusion by mosaicking approach, thus appending cloud-free pixels from either Sentinel-2 or Landsat 7. The comparison is based on the assessment of classification accuracy. Overall accuracy results show that decision- level fusion achieved an accuracy of 85.4%, whereas pixel-level fusion classification attained 82.5%, but their respective kappa coefficients of 0.84 and 0.80 but are not significantly different according to Z-test at alpha = 0.05. F1-score values reveal that decision-level performed better on most individual classes than pixel-level. Regression coefficient between planted areas from both approaches is 0.99. However, Support Vector Machines performed the best of the three classifiers. The conclusion is that both decision- level and pixel-level fusion approaches produced comparable classification results. Therefore, either of the procedures can be adopted in areas with inescapable cloud problems for updating crop inventories and acreage estimation at regional scales. Future work can focus on performing more comparison tests on different areas, run tests using different multiclassifier systems, and use different imagery.

TI  - Monitoring land subsidence in Yangon, Myanmar using Sentinel-1 persistent scatterer interferometry and assessment of driving mechanisms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inhabitants and ecosystems in delta areas are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of subsidence, caused by anthropogenic activities. Yangon is a city on the periphery of the Irrawaddy delta in Myanmar where little is known about the true extent of this hazard, while its effects can potentially harm millions of its inhabitants. This research presents the magnitude and extent of the subsidence hazard in Yangon through a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) time-series analysis on the Sentinel-1 data archives in the period of December 2015 through April 2017. The PSI analysis revealed four distinct zones of varying sizes where vertical velocity differences over 20 mm/yr were found, locally exceeding 110 mm/yr. The significant subsidence zones are exclusively located in young Alluvium deposits and 95% of velocity differences over 10 mm/yr are found at Quaternary age deposits. The addition of loads, such as buildings, predominantly affect subsidence rates in the first decade after placement. Estimates of groundwater extraction for domestic supply, used by more than 2 million inhabitants, correlate with the township average subsidence rates which shows that most subsidence in Yangon can be explained by groundwater extraction. Current operation of groundwater extraction wells induces an aquifer volume loss of 5.5 million cubic meter per year in the aquifer system of Yangon city. Unless groundwater extractions are mitigated, Yangon will be increasingly vulnerable to infrastructural damages, flooding events, and degrading aquifer quality.

TI  - Use of HSS and VHSS in steel structures in civil and offshore engineering Requirements regarding material properties
T2  - STEEL CONSTRUCTION-DESIGN AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of high-strength steels (HSS, 460 < f(y) <= 700 MPa) and particularly very high-strength steels (VHSS, f(y) > 700 MPa) is limited in steel structures in civil and offshore engineering. This is due to a lack of experience in structures made of these materials and a lack of understanding of the structural performance of HSS and VHSS. The main questions that are unanswered concern the topics of static strength, fracture toughness, fatigue, material (in) homogeneity and manufacturing. With regard to the static strength, it is unclear as to whether requirements currently stated in the Eurocodes for the yield-to-tensile strength ratio (f (y)/f(u)) as well as the Von Mises yield criterion are applicable to structural designs in HSS and VHSS. With regard to fracture toughness, it is unclear as to whether the crack arrest capability of HSS and VHSS is currently sufficiently covered in Eurocode requirements. Furthermore, Eurocode requirements for maximum plate thickness are quite restrictive if they are extrapolated to HSS and VHSS. Other questions relate to the homogeneity of the material. Are HSS and VHSS sufficiently resistant to lamellar tearing and is material testing in different orientations necessary? This study gives an overview of the relevant questions, outlines the requirements in the current Eurocode system, presents answers to these questions where possible and provides a recommended research focus for the coming years.

TI  - Satellite Observations of Cloud-Related Variations in Aerosol Properties
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper presents an overview of our efforts to characterize and better understand cloud-related changes in aerosol properties. These efforts primarily involved the statistical analysis of global or regional datasets of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol and cloud observations. The results show that in oceanic regions, more than half of all aerosol measurements by passive satellite instruments come from near-cloud areas, where clouds and cloud-related processes may significantly modify aerosol optical depth and particle size. Aerosol optical depth is also shown to increase systematically with regional cloud amount throughout the Earth. In contrast, it is shown that effective particle size can either increase or decrease with increasing cloud cover. In bimodal aerosol populations, the sign of changes depends on whether coarse mode or small mode aerosols are most affected by clouds. The results also indicate that over large parts of Earth, undetected cloud particles are not the dominant reason for the satellite-observed changes with cloud amount, and that 3D radiative processes contribute about 30% of the observed near-cloud changes. The findings underline the need for improving our ability to accurately measure aerosols near clouds.

TI  - Use of Landsat 8 data for characterizing dynamic changes in physical and acoustical properties of coastal lagoon and estuarine waters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study intends to develop methodologies that use high resolution satellite data from Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager) OLI and (Thermal Infrared Sensor) TIRS sensors for characterizing spatial and temporal changes in physical and acoustical properties of coastal lagoon and estuarine waters. It employs multiple steps to achieve this possibility: a novel atmospheric correction algorithm is applied to OLI spectral data to retrieve water-leaving radiances which are key inputs for the applied models; appropriate parameterizations are developed for the OLI bands and used in conjugation with a hybrid model to produce the spectral absorption coefficients of coloured dissolved organic matter (acDom) and to derive surface salinity fields which inversely correspond with the acDom values; an efficient algorithm is employed to estimate surface water temperature using thermal infrared bands, and well-known models are employed with the satellite-derived products to determine the acoustical properties (sound attenuation and speed). Results from the above methodology were evaluated using in-situ data and Landsat 8 OLI matchup data acquired over the coastal lagoon systems (e.g., Chilika Lagoon on the coast of Bay of Bengal) during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons. The uncertainties associated with the derived products such as CDOM, salinity, temperature, sound attenuation and speed were found to be within the desirable mission goal. Recognizing the importance of the salinity gradient that plays a unique and fundamental role in defining a transitional ecosystem, spatial and temporal patterns in the structure of the salinity gradient were examined together with the CDOM patterns. High resolution OLI products exhibited a general horizontal gradient with salinity decreasing from the lagoon mouth in the eastern and central sectors to the river mouth in the northern sector and a near uniform gradient with moderate salinity in the adjacent locations (southern sector) of the lagoon. The time-series of OLI products further showed that spatial and temporal structures of the salinity are modulated by the terrestrially delivered freshwater inputs, tidal forcing at the lagoon mouth, mixing of these two waters sources, and local geomorphology. Surface water temperature products derived from the TIRS sensor for the lagoon and its adjoining locations depicted a well pronounced seasonal cycle with warmer temperatures modulated by reduced mixing and increased solar heating and stratification during non monsoon, summer months and cooler temperatures during monsoon, winter months. The effect of salinity and temperature on the sound attenuation and sound speed was prominent in the locations of the freshwater discharge and tidal mixing regimes, where the salinity exerted a greater influence on both sound attenuation and speed despite the opposing effects of surface water temperatures. In areas of surface heating and stratification, both salinity and temperature increased causing an increase in sound attenuation and speed over the ranges found in the lagoon. These results are important for sonar performance modelling and operation of acoustic devices in such shallow water environments impacted by the terrestrial and ocean forcing factors.

TI  - Neural-Network Time-Series Analysis of MODIS EVI for Post-Fire Vegetation Regrowth
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The time-series analysis of multi-temporal satellite data is widely used for vegetation regrowth after a wildfire event. Comparisons between pre- and post-fire conditions are the main method used to monitor ecosystem recovery. In the present study, we estimated wildfire disturbance by comparing actual post-fire time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and simulated MODIS EVI based on an artificial neural network assuming no wildfire occurrence. Then, we calculated the similarity of these responses for all sampling sites by applying a dynamic time warping technique. Finally, we applied multidimensional scaling to the warping distances and an optimal fuzzy clustering to identify unique patterns in vegetation recovery. According to the results, artificial neural networks performed adequately, while dynamic time warping and the proposed multidimensional scaling along with the optimal fuzzy clustering provided consistent results regarding vegetation response. For the first two years after the wildfire, medium-high- to high-severity burnt sites were dominated by oaks at elevations greater than 200 m, and presented a clustered (predominant) response of revegetation compared to other sites.

TI  - Next generation of radiotracers for sentinel lymph node biopsy: What is still necessary to establish new imaging paradigms?
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is now the standard of care for regional staging in several solid tumors. The interstitial administration of a radiotracer around the primary tumor provide the possibility to sequentially obtain images with a gamma camera and visualize lymphatic mapping and the SLN. There is, however, a large geographical variability in those radiotracers and nanocolloids ranging from 15-100 nm which are most widely employed in Europe, while filtered and unfiltered Tc-99m-sulfur colloid (range 20-1000 nm) is usually used in the USA with different drawbacks in its use. The new radiotracer Tc-99m-Tilmanocept, designed specifically for the identification of SLNs and recently becoming commercially available in USA and Europe, appears to have the potency to overcome the shortcomings described for the conventional radiotracers used until now for SLN biopsy and at the same time to transform current imaging paradigms.After delineating the challenges for the next generation of radiotracers, this paper discusses the properties of Tc-99m-Tilmanocept, its validation process for SLN biopsy and its emerging clinical applications in various malignancies.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EID) threaten public health and are sustained by increasing global commerce, travel and disruption of ecological systems. Travelers could play a role in importing EIDs and could be a sentinel of major epidemics. In connection with the extension of poverty, urbanization, extensive livestock rearing and globalization, we could be exposed to a third epidemiological transition characterized by zoonotic diseases and infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria. The risk appears low for emerging infectious diseases, or very low for high-risk emerging infectious diseases, but higher for multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae carriage with possibly limited consequences. The role played by migrants is weaker than imagined. Immigrants don't play the role of sentinel epidemic so far. They could play a role in importing multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae, but it is poorly evaluated.

TI  - Predicting breast and axillary response after neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer: The role of histology vs receptor status
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) is increasingly administered in breast cancer patients. This study was conducted to identify predictors for tumor response in the breast and axilla. Methods All female patients with nonmetastatic, noninflammatory breast cancer receiving NST between 2003-2013 at the Catharina Cancer Institute in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, were included. Results The majority of 216 of the 337 patients receiving NST (65%) presented with a cT2 tumor. In 159 patients (47%), the axilla was clinically node positive. A pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast was achieved in 83 patients (24.6%), and a pCR in the axilla in 65 node-positive patients (40.9%). The triple-negative (OR 4.29, 95% CI 2.15-8.55) and hormone receptor (HR)-negative/HER2-positive tumors (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.59-8.75) were associated with in-breast pCR. Patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) were less likely to experience in-breast pCR (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.73) than those with invasive ductal cancer. Axillary pCR was found in 65 clinically node-positive patients (41%). Axillary pCR was more likely to occur in HR-positive/HER2-positive (OR 6.24, 95% CI 1.86-20.90) and HR-negative/HER2-positive tumors (OR 6.41, 95% CI 1.95-21.06), compared to HER2-negative disease. In-breast pCR was strongly associated with axillary pCR (OR 10.89, 95% CI 4.20-28.22). Conclusion Response to NST in the breast and axilla is largely determined by receptor status, with high pCR rates occurring in HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors. For axillary pCR, in-breast pCR and HER2-positive disease are the most important predictive factors.

AB  - Mapping tropical tree species at landscape scales to provide information for ecologists and forest managers is a new challenge for the remote sensing community. For this purpose, detection and delineation of individual tree crowns (ITCs) is a prerequisite. Here, we present a new method of automatic tree crown delineation based only on very high resolution images from WorldView-2 satellite and apply it to a region of the Atlantic rain forest with highly heterogeneous tropical canopy cover - the Santa Genebra forest reserve in Brazil. The method works in successive steps that involve pre-processing, selection of forested pixels, enhancement of borders, detection of pixels in the crown borders, correction of shade in large trees and, finally, segmentation of the tree crowns. Principally, the method uses four techniques: rolling ball algorithm and mathematical morphological operations to enhance the crown borders and ease the extraction of tree crowns; bimodal distribution parameters estimations to identify the shaded pixels in the gaps, borders, and crowns; and focal statistics for the analysis of neighbouring pixels. Crown detection is validated by comparing the delineated ITCs with a sample of ITCs delineated manually by visual interpretation. In addition, to test if the spectra of individual species are conserved in the automatic delineated crowns, we compare the accuracy of species prediction with automatic and manual delineated crowns with known species. We find that our method permits detection of up to 80% of ITCs. The seven species with over 10 crowns identified in the field were mapped with reasonable accuracy (30.5-96%) given that only WorldView-2 bands and texture features were used. Similar classification accuracies were obtained using both automatic and manual delineation, thereby confirming that species' spectral responses are preserved in the automatic method and thus permitting the recognition of species at the landscape scale. Our method might support tropical forest applications, such as mapping species and canopy characteristics at the landscape scale.

TI  - Expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and Ki-67 in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and DCIS with microinvasion
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) represents a heterogeneous disease in its histologic appearance and biological potential. Some women treated for DCIS subsequently develop invasive breast cancer. DCIS with microinvasion is considered as the interim stage in the progression from DCIS to invasive breast cancer. Analysis of the differences between DCIS and DCIS with microinvasion may aid in understanding the characteristic of DCIS with microinvasion and identifying biological factors determining progression of DCIS to invasive disease.Retrospective analysis of 219 cases between 2012 and 2018 was performed in our institution. The pathological results and axillary lymph nodes status were collected. Analysis of the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and Ki-67 in pure DCIS (164 cases), and DCIS with microinvasion (55 cases) using immunohistochemistry.DCIS with microinvasion had a higher nuclear grade (P<.001) and was more likely to have sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) positivity (P=.039) than DCIS. Expression of ER, PR were significantly higher in DCIS compared with DCIS with microinvasion (P<.001, P<.001). While the expression of HER-2 in DCIS with microinvasion (56.4%) was significantly higher than in DCIS (36.6%, P=.01). Furthermore, DCIS with microinvasion was significantly more likely to have aggressive subtype (Triple-negative and HER2enriched tumors, P=.005).Our results indicated that DCIS with microinvasion was different from pure DCIS in clinicopathologic characteristics and molecular alterations. It displayed a more aggressive biological nature than pure DCIS. It may be a distinct entity.

TI  - THE AXOLOTL IN GLOBAL CIRCUITS OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION: Producing Multispecies Potentiality
T2  - CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The axolotl is a noteworthy species of salamander, one both biologically remarkable and culturally significant. Native to the canals of Xochimilco, a neighborhood in Mexico City, the charismatic species has deep connections to Mexican history and identity, as well as serving as an important model organism for scientists studying regenerative biology. Drawing on fieldwork in Mexico with restoration ecologists engaged in conserving axolotl habitats, as well as on scientific papers and informal communications among scientists who use axolotls as model organisms, I examine the fate of the axolotl in and out of Xochimilco. Taking up the lives of both wild and cultivated axolotls, this essay asks what is at stake when a species is eliminated from one anthropogenic environment, the canals of Xochimilco, while being made to live in another, the laboratories of scientists studying developmental and regenerative biology. In the lab, axolotls are interpreted as plastic and flexible, potential models for reconfiguring human capabilities, injury, and aging. In the wild, the axolotl is a fragile sentinel species in need of protection that serves as an indicator of the fragility of the ecosystem more broadly. Conservationists interpret its failure to thrive as a message to human populations to reform and reconsider how they live in relation to the environment. This essay demonstrates how, through scientists' care, axolotls come to represent different forms of potential and produce different insights into human life, enabling distinct imaginings of the future.

TI  - Active Layer Thickness Retrieval of Qinghai-Tibet Permafrost Using the TerraSAR-X InSAR Technique
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP) is closely related to global climate change, and it has undergone serious permafrost degradation due to global warming in the last decades. It is crucial to measure the active layer thickness (ALT) for characterizing and monitoring the permafrost degradation of QTP. In this paper, an ALT retrieval model based on ground subsidence derived from synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR), land cover types, and groundwater information is proposed. In particular, the surface subsidence is retrieved using the time-series InSAR technique with TerraSAR-X ST mode images. Moreover, groundwater content models with different land covers are constructed based on multilayered assumptions and in situ data. By taking into account the groundwater content profile and land cover types, the ALT is retrieved from deformation with the full season cycle derived by InSAR technique. The experimental results in Beiluhe indicate that the estimated ALT is consistent with field-measured data. The estimated ALT map shows the difference between the alpine meadow and alpine desert areas, with mean ALT of approximately 1.5 m in alpine meadow area and approximately 3 m in alpine desert area. Our results demonstrate that the InSAR technique with high-resolution SAR images can be of great importance for the study of permafrost environments.

TI  - Capability of Remotely Sensed Drought Indices for Representing the Spatio-Temporal Variations of the Meteorological Droughts in the Yellow River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the advantages of wide coverage and continuity, remotely sensed data are widely used for large-scale drought monitoring to compensate for the deficiency and discontinuity of meteorological data. However, few studies have focused on the capability of various remotely sensed drought indices (RSDIs) to represent the spatio-temporal variations of meteorological droughts. In this study, five RSDIs, namely the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Modified Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI), and Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI), were calculated using monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The monthly NDVI and LST data were filtered by the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtering method. A meteorological station-based drought index represented by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was compared with the RSDIs. Additionally, the dimensionless Skill Score (SS) method was adopted to identify the spatiotemporally optimal RSDIs for presenting meteorological droughts in the Yellow River basin (YRB) from 2000 to 2015. The results indicated that: (1) RSDIs revealed a decreasing drought trend in the overall YRB consistent with the SPEI except for in winter, and different variations of seasonal trends spatially; (2) the optimal RSDIs in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were VHI, TCI, MTVDI, and VCI, respectively, and the average correlation coefficient between the RSDIs and the SPEI was 0.577 (alpha = 0.05); and (3) different RSDIs have time lags of zero-three months compared with the meteorological drought index.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Workshop on Advancement of Polarimetric Observations - Calibration and Improved Aerosol Retrievals (APOLO)
CL  - Hefei, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Land-atmospheric decoupling is important for the retrieval accuracy in atmospheric remote sensing. In this study, we developed an algorithm that adaptively decouples the land surface and atmosphere reflected solar radiation and retrieves the aerosol properties (adaptive land-atmospheric decoupling algorithm, ALAD). The ALAD algorithm allows precise global aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals. The four sub-procedures in ALAD comprise estimating a first guess for surface properties, aerosol property retrieval, atmospheric correction, and assessing the results. The ALAD algorithm was applied to PARASOL (Polarization & Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar) and the retrieved AODs were compared with the AOD products from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). ALAD and MODIS retrieved AOD values were with good consistency in terms of their spatial distribution, regardless of the region or the global distribution. The correlation coefficient between the global ALAD and AERONET AOD was 0.875, and about 60.7% of the AODs retrieved by ALAD were within the expected error range of 1(15% AOD + 0.05). The results obtained using ALAD agreed well with the AERONET values. We also investigated the aerosol and land surface properties that might introduce errors into the AOD values retrieved by ALAD. It was found that the value of AOD had the greatest effect on the accuracy of the retrieval results. The errors introduced by the Angstrom exponent and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index varied slightly but they made no significant contributions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential of a two-component polarimetric decomposition at C-band for soil moisture retrieval over agricultural fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a two-component (surface and volume) C-band polarimetric decomposition to retrieve soil moisture over agricultural fields covered by different crop types. RADARSAT-2 data analysis shows that vegetation attenuation on the surface scattering component is stronger for the narrow-leaf (wheat) than broad-leaf crops (canola, corn and soybean). Thus, the vegetation attenuation factor is integrated into the proposed C-band polarimetric decomposition to better account for soil contribution over the whole crop phenological season. After removing the volume scattering component from the full coherency matrix, the surface scattering component was simulated by the Oh soil scattering model, instead of conventional Bragg or X-Bragg model, which is not physically valid at C-band due to limited roughness constraint condition. The proposed retrieval algorithm was applied to the RADARSAT-2 time series acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12). Results indicate that during the crop growth, the volume scattering power of wheat shows weak temporal variation, while it increases for corn, soybean and canola. The sensitivity of the ground scattering component to soil moisture is enhanced due to the removal of the volume scattering from the full signature. The retrieved soil moisture was validated using the soil moisture ground measurements during the SMAPVEX12. The validations indicate correlation coefficients from 0.63 to 0.76, and RMSEs from 0.058 to 0.074 m(3)/m(3) for the entire phenological period of SMAPVEX12 campaign. The negligible dihedral scattering component (1.6-9.2%) at C-band greatly reduces the complexity of the soil moisture retrieval from the ground component.

TI  - Detecting Snowfall Events over Mountainous Areas Using Optical Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowfall over mountainous areas not only has important implications on the water cycle and the Earth's radiation balance, but also causes potentially hazardous weather. However, snowfall detection remains one of the most difficult problems in modern hydrometeorology. We present a method for detecting snowfall events from optical satellite data for seasonal snow in mountainous areas. The proposed methodology is based on identifying expanded snow cover or suddenly declined snow grain size using time series images, from which it is possible to detect the location and time of snowfall events. The methodology was tested with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily radiance data for an entire hydrologic year from July 2014 to June 2015 in the mountainous area of the Manas River Basin, Northwest China. The study evaluated the recordings of precipitation events at eighteen meteorological stations in the study area prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that there was more liquid precipitation in the second and third quarter, and more solid precipitation in the first and fourth quarter.

TI  - Semi-Automated Classification of Lake Ice Cover Using Dual Polarization RADARSAT-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice is a significant component of the cryosphere due to its large spatial coverage in high-latitude regions during the winter months. The Laurentian Great Lakes are the world's largest supply of freshwater and their ice cover has a major impact on regional weather and climate, ship navigation, and public safety. Ice experts at the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) have been manually producing operational Great Lakes image analysis charts based on visual interpretation of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In that regard, we have investigated the performance of the semi-automated segmentation algorithm "glocal" Iterative Region Growing with Semantics (IRGS) for lake ice classification using dual polarized RADARSAT-2 imagery acquired over Lake Erie. Analysis of various case studies indicated that the "glocal" IRGS algorithm could provide a reliable ice-water classification using dual polarized images with a high overall accuracy of 90.4%. However, lake ice types that are based on stage of development were not effectively identified due to the ambiguous relation between backscatter and ice types. The slight improvement of using dual-pol as opposed to single-pol images for ice-water discrimination was also demonstrated.

TI  - Object-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Cloud and Snow Detection in High-Resolution Multispectral Imagers
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and snow detection is one of the most significant tasks for remote sensing image processing. However, it is a challenging task to distinguish between clouds and snow in high-resolution multispectral images due to their similar spectral distributions. The shortwave infrared band (SWIR, e.g., Sentinel-2A 1.55-1.75 mu m band) is widely applied to the detection of snow and clouds. However, high-resolution multispectral images have a lack of SWIR, and such traditional methods are no longer practical. To solve this problem, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cloud and snow on an object level is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a novel CNN structure capable of learning cloud and snow multiscale semantic features from high-resolution multispectral imagery is presented. In order to solve the shortcoming of "salt-and-pepper" in pixel level predictions, we extend a simple linear iterative clustering algorithm for segmenting high-resolution multispectral images and generating superpixels. Results demonstrated that the new proposed method can with better precision separate the cloud and snow in the high-resolution image, and results are more accurate and robust compared to the other methods.

TI  - Modeling marine pelagic fish species spatiotemporal distributions utilizing a maximum entropy approach
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how ocean conditions influence fish distributions is critical for elucidating the role of climate in ecosystem change and forecasting how fish may be distributed in the future. Traditional species distribution models are often applied to scientific-survey data, which include species presence-absence information, to predict distributions. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models are promising tools as they can be applied to presence-only data (e.g., data collected from fishermen targeting a specific species or from observers in citizen-science programs). We used MaxEnt models to relate occurrence records of three marine pelagic fish (Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, and butterfish) in fishery-dependent data to environmental conditions (sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration from satellite remote sensing, bathymetry, and climate indices), and evaluated model performance by both cross-validation and validation using fishery-independent data. We developed monthly habitat suitability maps for these fish in the Northwest Atlantic Shelf area, and assessed the relative influence of environmental factors on their distributions. Across months, their suitable habitat areas varied with each species exhibiting inshore-offshore and north-south movements in response to changing environmental conditions. Overall, SST and chlorophyll-a concentration had the greatest influence on the distributions of these fish, with bathymetry having moderate influence and climate indices having little influence. Our application of MaxEnt models enabled us to integrate presence-only data and high resolution environmental data from satellite remote sensing to describe spatiotemporal distributions of marine pelagic fish. These models were used to hindcast species occurrence in relation to historical environmental conditions to evaluate their predictive performance, and have the potential to provide nowcasts in relation to current conditions or forecasts of species future distributions.

TI  - Temporal and spatial changes of urban impervious surface and its influence on urban ecological quality: A comparison between Shanghai and New York
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban spatial expansion has led to the considerable substitution of natural vegetation - dominated land surfaces by impervious surfaces, especially in large cities, with great impacts on urban ecological quality. Two most heavily populated cities, Shanghai of China and New York of USA, were chosen as the study cases. Based on Landsat images obtained in 1989, 2002, 2015 in Shanghai and in 1991, 2001, 2015 in New York, normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI) was used to extract impervious surface (IS) information. The remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) was then applied to evaluate the changes of urban ecological quality caused by the increased impervious surface. Furthermore, landscape pattern indices were used to analyze the differences of spatial structure of impervious surface between Shanghai and New York and their influences on urban ecological quality. The results showed a significant difference in urban expansion rate and pattern between Shanghai and New York from the early 1990s to 2015. The IS expansion area in Shanghai was 17.4 times as much as that in New York. The annual IS increase rate of Shanghai was 62.2 times as much as that of New York. Shanghai had experienced an expansion from urban center to the surrounding countryside in a concentric ring pattern, whereas New York showed no much expansion but had IS increase mainly within the inner city through space filling pattern. These differences in IS change rate and spatial distribution pattern had resulted in the difference in urban ecological quality of the two cities. The mean RSEI in Shanghai dropped from 0.717 in 1989 to 0.453 in 2015, with a decrease of 36.8%. In contrast, the RSEI of New York had a decline of 6.9% from 0.552 in 1991 to 0.514 in 2015. The poor ecological condition urban area tended to have large IS patches that were well connected and aggregated.

TI  - A mathematical prediction model incorporating molecular subtype for risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in sentinel lymph node-positive breast cancer patients: a retrospective analysis and nomogram development
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Molecular subtype of breast cancer is associated with sentinel lymph node status. We sought to establish a mathematical prediction model that included breast cancer molecular subtype for risk of positive non-sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis and further validate the model in a separate validation cohort.Methods We reviewed the clinicopathologic data of breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis who underwent axillary lymph node dissection between June 16, 2014 and November 16, 2017 at our hospital. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed and patients with pathologically proven sentinel lymph node metastasis underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Independent risks for non-sentinel lymph node metastasis were assessed in a training cohort by multivariate analysis and incorporated into a mathematical prediction model. The model was further validated in a separate validation cohort, and a nomogram was developed and evaluated for diagnostic performance in predicting the risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis. Moreover, we assessed the performance of five different models in predicting non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in training cohort.Results Totally, 495 cases were eligible for the study, including 291 patients in the training cohort and 204 in the validation cohort. Non-sentinel lymph node metastasis was observed in 33.3% (97/291) patients in the training cohort. The AUC of MSKCC, Tenon, MDA, Ljubljana, and Louisville models in training cohort were 0.7613, 0.7142, 0.7076, 0.7483, and 0.671, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that tumor size (OR = 1.439; 95% CI 1.025-2.021; P = 0.036), sentinel lymph node macro-metastasis versus micro-metastasis (OR = 5.063; 95% CI 1.111-23.074; P = 0.036), the number of positive sentinel lymph nodes (OR = 2.583, 95% CI 1.714-3.892; P < 0.001), and the number of negative sentinel lymph nodes (OR = 0.686, 95% CI 0.575-0.817; P < 0.001) were independent statistically significant predictors of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, luminal B (OR = 3.311, 95% CI 1.593-6.884; P = 0.001) and HER2 overexpression (OR = 4.308, 95% CI 1.097-16.912; P = 0.036) were independent and statistically significant predictor of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis versus luminal A. A regression model based on the results of multivariate analysis was established to predict the risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis, which had an AUC of 0.8188. The model was validated in the validation cohort and showed excellent diagnostic performance.Conclusions The mathematical prediction model that incorporates five variables including breast cancer molecular subtype demonstrates excellent diagnostic performance in assessing the risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in sentinel lymph node-positive patients. The prediction model could be of help surgeons in evaluating the risk of non-sentinel lymph node involvement for breast cancer patients; however, the model requires further validation in prospective studies.

TI  - Trophic state assessment of global inland waters using a MODIS-derived Forel-Ule index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication of inland waters is considered a serious global environmental problem. Satellite remote sensing (RS) has been established as an important source of information to determine the trophic state of inland waters through the retrieval of optically active water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). However, the use of RS techniques for assessment of the trophic state of inland waters on a global scale is hindered by the performance of retrieval algorithms over highly dynamic and complex optical properties that characterize many of these systems. In this study, we developed a new RS approach to assess the trophic state of global inland water bodies based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and the Forel-Ule index (FUI). First, the FIJI was calculated from MODIS data by dividing natural water colour into 21 indices from dark blue to yellowish-brown. Then the relationship between FIJI and the trophic state index (TSI) was established based on in-situ measurements and MODIS products. The water-leaving reflectance at 645 nm band was employed to distinguish coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)-dominated systems in the FIJI-based trophic state assessment. Based on the analysis, the FUI-based trophic state assessment method was developed and applied to assess the trophic states of 2058 large inland water bodies (surface area > 25 km(2)) distributed around the world using MODIS data from the austral and boreal summers of 2012. Our results showed that FUI can be retrieved from MODIS with a considerable accuracy (92.5%, R-2 = 0.92) by comparing with concurrent in situ measurements over a wide range of lakes, and the overall accuracy of the FIJI-based trophic state assessment method is 80.0% (R-2 = 0.75) validated by an independent dataset. Of the global large water bodies considered, oligotrophic large lakes were found to be concentrated in plateau regions in central Asia and southern South America, while eutrophic large lakes were concentrated in central Africa, eastern Asia, and mid-northern and southeast North America.

TI  - A deep learning framework for remote sensing image registration
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose an effective deep neural network aiming at remote sensing image registration problem. Unlike conventional methods doing feature extraction and feature matching separately, we pair patches from sensed and reference images, and then learn the mapping directly between these patch-pairs and their matching labels for later registration. This end-to-end architecture allows us to optimize the whole processing (learning mapping function) through information feedback when training the network, which is lacking in conventional methods. In addition, to alleviate the small data issue of remote sensing images for training, our proposal introduces a self-learning by learning the mapping function using images and their transformed copies. Moreover, we apply a transfer learning to reduce the huge computation cost in the training stage. It does not only speed up our framework, but also get extra performance gains. The comprehensive experiments conducted on seven sets of remote sensing images, acquired by Radarsat, SPOT and Landsat, show that our proposal improves the registration accuracy up to 2.4-53.7%.

TI  - Limitations and Challenges of MODIS-Derived Phenological Metrics Across Different Landscapes in Pan-Arctic Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent efforts have been made to monitor the seasonal metrics of plant canopy variations globally from space, using optical remote sensing. However, phenological estimations based on vegetation indices (VIs) in high-latitude regions such as the pan-Arctic remain challenging and are rarely validated. Nevertheless, pan-Arctic ecosystems are vulnerable and also crucial in the context of climate change. We reported the limitations and challenges of using MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements, a widely exploited set of satellite measurements, to estimate phenological transition dates in pan-Arctic regions. Four indices including normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), phenology index (PI), plant phenological index (PPI) and a MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product MCD12Q2, were evaluated and compared against eddy covariance (EC) estimates at 11 flux sites of 102 site-years during the period from 2000 to 2014. All the indices were influenced by snow cover and soil moisture during the transition dates. While relationships existed between VI-based and EC-estimated phenological transition dates, the R-2 values were generally low (0.01-0.68). Among the VIs, PPI-estimated metrics showed an inter-annual pattern that was mostly closely related to the EC-based estimations. Thus, further studies are needed to develop region-specific indices to provide more reliable estimates of phenological transition dates.

TI  - Estimating the Correlated Observation-Error Characteristics of the Chinese FengYun Microwave Temperature Sounder and Microwave Humidity Sounder
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In operational data assimilation systems, observation-error covariance matrices are commonly assumed to be diagonal. However, inter-channel and spatial observation-error correlations are inevitable for satellite radiances. The observation errors of the Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) onboard the FengYun-3A (FY-3A) and FY-3B satellites are empirically assigned and considered to be uncorrelated when they are assimilated into the WRF model's Community Variational Data Assimilation System (WRFDA). To assimilate MWTS and MWHS measurements optimally, a good characterization of their observation errors is necessary. In this study, background and analysis residuals were used to diagnose the correlated observation-error characteristics of the MWTS and MWHS. It was found that the error standard deviations of the MWTS and MWHS were less than the values used in the WRFDA. MWTS had small inter-channel errors, while MWHS had significant inter-channel errors. The horizontal correlation length scales of MWTS and MWHS were about 120 and 60 km, respectively. A comparison between the diagnosis for instruments onboard the two satellites showed that the observation-error characteristics of the MWTS or MWHS were different when they were onboard different satellites. In addition, it was found that the error statistics were dependent on latitude and scan positions. The forecast experiments showed that using a modified thinning scheme based on diagnosed statistics can improve forecast accuracy.

TI  - Remote Targets Recognition Based on Adaptive Weighting Feature Dictionaries and Joint Sparse Representations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the improvement in resolution, more and more useful information is contained in the space of remote sensing images, which makes the processing of remote sensing data become more complex, and it is easy to cause the curse of dimensionality and the poor recognition effect. In this paper, a remote target recognition approach named AJRC is proposed, which uses joint feature dictionary for sparse representation based on different feature information for adaptive weighting. Firstly, the features of the images are extracted to calculate the contribution weight of each eigenvalue in sparse representation, and each eigenvalue contribution weight is calculated in sparse representation. Through the adaptive method, the contribution ability of each feature value in sparse representation is strengthened, and new atoms are formed to construct feature dictionary, which makes the dictionary more discriminative. Then, the common features of each category image and the private features of a single image are extracted from the feature vector, and a joint dictionary is formed to represent the test image sparse and recognize the output of the target. Aiming at the problem that the target visual contrast difference, the low resolution and the rotation of the target with different angles, the experiment is carried out by different feature extraction methods. At the same time, we use the PCA method to reduce the feature dictionary in order to avoid dimensionality. Experiments show that compared with the existing SRC method and JSM method, this method has better recognition rate.

TI  - An Interplay between Photons, Canopy Structure, and Recollision Probability: A Review of the Spectral Invariants Theory of 3D Canopy Radiative Transfer Processes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Earth observations collected by remote sensors provide unique information to our ever-growing knowledge of the terrestrial biosphere. Yet, retrieving information from remote sensing data requires sophisticated processing and demands a better understanding of the underlying physics. This paper reviews research efforts that lead to the developments of the stochastic radiative transfer equation (RTE) and the spectral invariants theory. The former simplifies the characteristics of canopy structures with a pair-correlation function so that the 3D information can be succinctly packed into a 1D equation. The latter indicates that the interactions between photons and canopy elements converge to certain invariant patterns quantifiable by a few wavelength independent parameters, which satisfy the law of energy conservation. By revealing the connections between plant structural characteristics and photon recollision probability, these developments significantly advance our understanding of the transportation of radiation within vegetation canopies. They enable a novel physically-based algorithm to simulate the "hot-spot" phenomenon of canopy bidirectional reflectance while conserving energy, a challenge known to the classic radiative transfer models. Therefore, these theoretical developments have a far-reaching influence in optical remote sensing of the biosphere.

TI  - Analysis of the Dynamic Changes of the Baiyangdian Lake Surface Based on a Complex Water Extraction Method
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes have an important role in human life and the ecological environment, but they are easily affected by human activity and climate change, especially around urban areas. Hence, it is critical to extract water with a high precision method and monitor long-term sequence dynamic changes in lakes. As the greatest natural lake of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Baiyangdian Lake has a significant function in human life, socio-economic development, and regional ecological balance. This lake area has shown large changes due to human activity and climate change. The change monitoring process of the water surface is of great significance in providing support for the management and protection of the lake. The Spectrum Matching based on Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (SMDPSO) method is a new, robust, and low-cost method for water extraction, that has obvious advantages in extracting complex water surfaces. In this paper, the SMDPSO method was used to extract the water surface of Baiyangdian Lake by Landsat images from 1984 to 2018. This method has a good effect on complex water surface extraction with vegetation, shadows, and so forth, and the Landsat images have higher resolution and longer time series. The main contents and results of this paper are as follows: (1) We verified the applicability of the SMDPSO method in the Baiyangdian Lake using visual interpretation and correlation analysis. The relative errors between observed and extracted results were all less than 5% in spring, summer, and fall, and the correlation coefficient between the water area and water level was 0.96. (2) According to seasonal verification and comparison of the extraction results, the SMDPSO method was used to extract the water surface area of Baiyangdian Lake during spring of the years 1984-2018. Water area changes of Baiyangdian Lake can be divided into four periods: Dry period (1984-1988), degraded period (1989-2000), stable period (2000-2008), and recovery period (2008-2018). The water area reached a maximum of 280 km(2) in 1989 and a minimum of 44 km(2) in 2002. (3) The possible causes of the changes in the water area of Baiyangdian Lake were also analyzed. The changes were caused by climate and human activities during the first and second periods, but mainly human activities during the third and fourth periods. In fact, effective policies combined with water conservancy projects were directly conducive to improving or even recovering the water and ecological environment of Baiyangdian Lake. Considering its importance for the benign development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region and the construction of the Xiong'an New Area, a policy is necessary to ensure that the lake's ecological environment will not be destroyed under the premise of economic development.

TI  - A Novel Method of Generating Deformation Time-Series Using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Its Application in Mexico City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of rapid societal development and urbanization, the pumping of groundwater has gradually increased. Land subsidence has thus become a common geological disaster, which can result in huge economic losses. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), with its large-scale and high-accuracy monitoring characteristics, can attain information on Earth surface deformation using the interferometric phase between couples of SAR images acquired at different times. Time-series results for the ground surface are the key information required to understand the deformation pattern and further study the reason for the subsidence. However, in recent research, most methods for resolving time-series deformation-like the Berardino method-that use residuals in functional model solving and distinguish high-pass displacement and the atmospheric component by filtering do not generally work well and functional models focusing on prior information in the time-series solution process are not always available. In this paper, to solve the above problems, 34 Sentinel-1A descending mode scenes of Mexico City captured between 2015/04/13 and 2016/09/10 are used as experimental data. Firstly, a new functional model is provided to obtain the deformation time-series. The nonlinear deformation and atmospheric phase are combined as an unknown parameter and the method of singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to solve this variable. The nonlinear displacement and atmospheric phase are then separated by the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method. Finally, the total land subsidence time-series is obtained by adding together the linear displacement and nonlinear displacement. Two typical methods and the proposed method were compared using both unit weights and adaptive weights. The experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain a more accurate time-series deformation result. Moreover, the different weights do not result in significant differences and the solved atmospheric and nonlinear phases have good consistency with the interferogram phase.

TI  - Major forest increase on the Loess Plateau, China (2001-2016)
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Loess Plateau in China is prone to widespread land degradation (soil erosion, deforestation, and water loss), and therefore, ecological restoration programmes aiming to re-establish the ecosystem by revegetation have been implemented during recent decades. Consequently, a widespread increase in vegetation cover has been reported, but the state and dynamics of forests remain largely unknown. Here, we used field and satellite data to produce annual forest probability scores at 250 x 250 m between 2001 and 2016. We classified the forest dynamics into three types: net gain, net loss, and fluctuation. Assuming that an increasing probability score reflects forest growth, we categorised the annual forest areas into different growing stages indicating the transition between planting and mature forest. In total, the area of forest increase was 48,786 km(2), and the percentage of forested areas of the region changed from 8.19% to 15.82% within 16 years. In areas of forest net gain, there was a clear transition from low- to high-probability forest areas, providing evidence that a general forest transition is occurring on the Loess Plateau. The method developed for continuous monitoring of forest probability scores offers a benchmarking for further decision making on ecological restoration of the region and for mapping of afforestation projects elsewhere. The findings on major forest increases demonstrate that land degradation is in fact reversible, with implications for many ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage and provisioning of forest products).

TI  - Crustal Density Structure, Lithosphere Flexure Mechanism, and Isostatic State Throughout the Qinling Orogen Revealed by In Situ Dense Gravity Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravity and GPS hybrid measurements were conducted at 385 stations throughout the Qinling Orogen, China, to update Bouguer gravity anomalies and free-air gravity anomalies of the area. The crustal density structure, lithosphere flexure mechanism, and isostatic state of the Qinglin Orogen were studied in detail via these in situ observations. Bouguer gravity anomalies in the study area are mainly negative, ranging from -410mGal in the Tibetan Plateau to -100mGal in the eastern Qinglin Orogen. The estimated crustal thickness ranges from 56 to 35km and thins eastward along the Qinling Orogen. The optimal effective elastic thickness (Te) of the study area is 14km, and the loading comes from the Earth's surface, the interface between the upper and lower crust, and the Moho. Vertical tectonic stress borne by the lithosphere varies observably in the study area. Downward stress reaches a peak of -14MPa in the Liupanshan Mountains, whereas the highest value of upward stress (8MPa) is attained in the middle Qinling Orogen. Considering distributions of crustal density structures and vertical tectonic stress of the lithosphere, in addition to the distinct loading ratios of the eastern and western Qinling Orogen, a piecewise combination model was developed to interpret the uplift of the Qinling Orogen. This model shows that the eastern part of the Orogen is thickened by the upward migration of mantle materials under the thrusting of the South and North China Blocks, whereas uplift of the western part results from lower crustal flow derived from the Tibetan Plateau.Plain Language Summary The Tibetan Plateau is called the Roof of the World because it stands over 3miles (4.8km) above sea level and is surrounded by imposing mountain ranges. The surroundings of the Tibetan Plateau are uplifting, meaning that the Tibetan Plateau is expanding. The uplifting mechanism is the subject of debate. Some researchers consider that the uplift results from accumulated materials on the Earth's surface; others consider that the accumulation takes place underground. Gravity data can reflect material deficits and excesses underground, so we conducted in situ gravity and GPS measurements throughout the Qinling Orogen, where is the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau, to study the uplift mechanism. Results of this research are based on in situ data, whose accuracy is better than satellite data used in most previous research. We found that the uplift of the western Qinling Orogen (west of Baoji City) is caused by deep crustal flow, while the uplift of the eastern Qinling Orogen (east of Baoji City) is caused by the migration of mantle materials.

TI  - Continuous Change Detection of Forest/Grassland and Cropland in the Loess Plateau of China Using All Available Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of the spatiotemporal distribution of forest/grassland and cropland is necessary for studying hydro-ecological effects of vegetation change in the Loess Plateau, China. Currently, the accuracy of change detection of land cover using Landsat data in the loess hill and gully areas is seriously affected by insufficient temporal information from observations and irregular fluctuations in vegetation greenness caused by precipitation and human activities. In this study, we propose a method for continuous change detection for two types of land cover, mosaic forest/grassland and cropland, using all available Landsat data. The period with vegetation coverage is firstly identified using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. The intra-annual NDVI time series is then developed at a 1-day resolution based on linear interpolation and S-G filtering using all available NDVI data during the period when vegetation types are stable. Vegetation type change is initially detected by comparing the NDVI of intra-annual composites and the newly observed NDVI. Finally, the time of change and classification for vegetation types are determined using decision tree rules developed using a combination of inter-annual and intra-annual NDVI temporal metrics. Validation results showed that the change detection was accurate, with an overall accuracy of 88.9% +/- 1.0%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.86, and the time of change was successfully retrieved, with 85.2% of the change pixels attributed to within a 2-year deviation. Consequently, the accuracy of change detection was improved by reducing temporal false detection and enhancing spatial classification accuracy.

TI  - Upstaging to invasive ductal carcinoma after mastectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ: predictive factors and role of sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The aim of this study was to investigate preoperative factors associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) upstaged to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in patients who underwent mastectomy for a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS.Methods The medical records of 220 patients who underwent mastectomy for a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS were retrospectively reviewed.Results Fifty-one (22.6%) of 226 lesions were upgraded to IDC after mastectomy. Preoperative factors associated with upstaging to IDC included patient-reported signs and symptoms, a clinically palpable mass, ultrasound findings classified as category 4 or 5, the ultrasound appearance of a mass or widely distributed non-mass abnormality (NMA), and a high Ki67 index. The prevalence of SLN macrometastasis was 0.9%. IDC was diagnosed for 10.9% of lesions of a preoperative ultrasound category of 0-3, 13.0% of those with no mass or NMA detected by ultrasonography, and 14.1% of lesions preoperatively diagnosed by methods other than core needle biopsy (CNB). Of those lesions, none was associated with SLN metastasis.Conclusions Routinely performing SLN biopsy for patients undergoing mastectomy for a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS is overtreatment, because the prevalence of SLN metastasis was low. SLN biopsy can be omitted for most patients. In particular, we suggest omitting SLN biopsy for patients who have lesions of ultrasound category 0-3, who have neither a mass nor NMA detected by ultrasound, or whose initial diagnosis was made based on a specimen obtained by methods other than CNB.

AB  - The ability of medium-resolution (10-30 m) satellite imagery to delineate the size and persistence of ponds on debris-covered glaciers is a topic of recent interest as it has become apparent through the use of fine-resolution products that smaller ponds have often been neglected. In this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of pond detection using a normalised difference water index (NDWI) applied to several widely used satellite sensors, which offer multispectral information at high radiometric precision. These data include: RapidEye (5 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) (10-20 m), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral imagery (30 m). We demonstrate a method to derive an optimum NDWI value for pond classification using a subset reference dataset of 285 ponds classified using fine-resolution (0.5 m) imagery. We then applied the optimised NDWI (NDWI-O) to the remaining images to assess pond classification accuracy against a broader reference dataset of 898 ponds. NDWI values calculated using Sentinel-2 imagery showed the best spectral contrast between water and surrounding debris cover, and the strongest relationship with pixel water content (R-2 = 0.56), followed by the RapidEye NDWI (R-2 = 0.45). We conclude that RapidEye and Sentinel-2 imagery is best suited for accurate pond classification using a multispectral classification approach, which is important for quantifying their role in glacier ablation, meltwater regulation, and lake development. By comparison, the impact of using coarse-resolution Landsat 8 imagery to characterise surface water dynamics is minimised when applied to large glacier lakes, where the area-to-perimeter ratio is greater.

TI  - Impacts of Climate and Supraglacial Lakes on the Surface Velocity of Baltoro Glacier from 1992 to 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baltoro Glacier is one of the largest glaciers in the Karakoram mountain range. Long-term monitoring of glacier dynamics provides key information on glacier evolution in a changing climate, which is essential for regional water resource and natural hazard management. On large glaciers, detailed field based mass balance is not feasible. Ice dynamic variations quantify changes in mass transport and possibly the influence of environmental parameters on the evolution of the glacier. Although velocity variations of Baltoro Glacier during winter and summer are linked to seasonally enhanced basal sliding, little is known about differences in timing and magnitude of (intra-)seasonal velocity variations and their determining mechanisms. We present time series of annual, seasonal, and intra-seasonal glacier surface velocities by means of intensity offset tracking applied on multi-mission Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for a period of 25 years from 1992 to 2017. Supraglacial lakes forming on the downstream glacier surface in summer were mapped from 1991 to 2017 based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), calculated from multi-spectral Landsat and ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) imagery. Additionally, precipitation data of the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and temperature data of ERA-Interim were used to derive the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) from 1998 to 2017. Linking surface velocities to the SPI confirmed a strong correlation between heavy precipitation events in winter and the magnitude and the timing of glacier acceleration in summer. Downstream extensions of summer acceleration that have been found since 2015 may be explained by additional water draining from an increased number of supraglacial lakes through crevasses that have been formed in consequence of higher initial velocities, evoked by strong winter precipitation. The warmer melt seasons observed in the years 2015 to 2017 additionally affects the formation of a supraglacial lake, so stronger summer acceleration events in recent years may be indirectly related to global warming.

TI  - Incidence and Method of Suicide in Hospitals in the United States
T2  - JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are no reliable estimates of hospital inpatient suicides in the United States. Understanding the rate and the methods used in suicides is important to guide prevention efforts. This study analyzed two national data sets to establish an evidence-based estimate of hospital inpatient suicides and the methods used.Methods: The study is designed as a cross-sectional analysis of data from 27 states reporting to the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) for 2014-2015, and from hospitals reporting to The Joint Commission's Sentinel Event (SE) Database from 2010 to 2017. Categorical variables and qualitative reviews of event narratives were used to identify and code suicide events occurring during hospital inpatient treatment.Results: Based on the hospital inpatient suicides reported in the NVDRS during 2014-2015, 73.9% of which occurred during psychiatric treatment, it is estimated that between 48.5 and 64.9 hospital inpatient suicides occur per year in the United States. Of these, 31.0 to 51.7 are expected to involve psychiatric inpatients. Hanging was the most common method of inpatient suicide in both the NVDRS and SE databases (71.7% and 70.3%, respectively).Conclusion: The estimated number of hospital inpatient suicides per year in the United States ranges from 48.5 to 64.9, which is far below the widely cited figure of 1,500 per year. Analysis of inpatient suicide methods suggests that hospital prevention efforts should be primarily focused on mitigating risks associated with hanging, and additional suicide prevention efforts may be best directed toward reducing the risk of suicide immediately following discharge.

TI  - Remote Sensing Detection of Vegetation and Landform Damages by Coal Mining on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to satisfy the needs of constant economic growth, the pressure to exploit natural resources has been increasing rapidly in China. Particularly with the implementation of the National Western Development Strategies since 1999, more and more mining activities and related infrastructure constructions have been conducted on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Mining activities are known to have substantial impacts on plant dynamics and hence the water and energy cycles. Identifying mining activities and quantifying their effects on vegetation cover are critical to the monitoring and protection of the pristine TP environment. Thus, this study aims to develop an automated approach that detects the timing of initial mining development and assess the spatial distribution of mining-ruined vegetation. The Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm was used to decompose the signal in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series derived from high-frequency MODIS images, and to detect abrupt changes of surface vegetation. Results show that the BFAST algorithm is able to effectively identify abrupt changes in vegetation cover as a result of open-mining development on the studied alpine grassland. The testing study in Muli Town of Qinghai Province shows that the mining development began in 2003 and massive destructions of vegetation cover followed between 2008 and 2012. The integrated use of Landsat imagery and multi-temporal DEMs further reveals detailed areal and volumetric changes in the mining site. This study demonstrates the potential of applying multi-mission satellite datasets to assess large-scale environmental influences from mining development, and will be beneficial to environmental conservation and sustainable use of natural resources in remote regions.

TI  - The saprophytic fungus <i>Fusarium solani</i> increases the insecticidal efficacy of the entomopathogenic nematode <i>Steinernema diaprepesi</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In two field surveys, high proportions of Galleria mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) sentinel larval cadavers were infected by Fusarium solani without evidence of concomitant entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) or entomopathogenic fungus (EPF) reproduction. Because F. solani is not considered entomopathogenic, the survey suggested the possibility that F. solani competes with EPNs. We tested the hypotheses that F. solani attracts the EPN, Steinernema diaprepesi, to facilitate infection of Diaprepes root weevils (Diaprepes abbreviatus L.) and thereafter competes with the nematode in the insect cadaver. In two-choice olfactometer assays where one side was treated with F. solani mycelia and conidia, juvenile S. diaprepesi were attracted to the fungus, in either raw soil, or in autoclaved soil in the presence or absence of insects. However, this attraction was attenuated as the habitat became more complex, by using raw soil in combination with insect larvae. Fusarium oxysporum did not recruit the nematode. When soil microcosms were tested with F. solani conidia and S. diaprepesi, the concomitant infection increased the mortality of the insect (P = 0.02) to 83%, compared to 58% and 0% mortality when nematodes or fungi were individually applied, respectively. Concomitant inoculation also increased the number of cadavers that supported nematode reproduction and increased the population density of fungus in soil. The number of IJs entering the host insect was not affected by F. solani. These results support the possibility that F. solani can facilitate the insecticidal efficiency of S. diaprepesi in order to exploit the resources in the cadaver.

TI  - Soil salinity prediction and mapping by machine learning regression in Central Mesopotamia, Iraq
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization affects crop production and food security. Mapping spatial distribution and severity of salinity is essential for agricultural management and development. This study was aimed to test the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for soil salinity mapping taking the Mussaib area in Central Mesopotamia as an example. A combined dataset consisting of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and ALOS L-band radar data acquired at the same time was used for fulfilling the task. Relevant biophysical indicators were derived from the TM images, and the soil component was retrieved by removing the vegetation contribution from the L-band radar backscattering coefficients. Field-measured salinity at the three corner plots of triangles were averaged to represent the salinity of these triangular areas. These averaged plots were converted into raster by either direct rasterization or buffering-based rasterization into different cell size to create the training set (TS). One of the three triangle corners was randomly selected to constitute a validation set (VS). Using this TS, the support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) algorithms were then applied to the combined dataset for salinity prediction. Results revealed that RFR performed better than SVR with higher accuracy (93.4-94.2% vs. 85.2-89.4%) and less normalized root mean square error (NRMSE; 6.10-7.69% vs. 10.29-10.52%) when calibrated with both TS and VS. In comparison, prediction by multivariate linear regression (MLR) achieved in our previous study using the same datasets also showed less NRMSE than SVR. Hence, both RFR and MLR are recommended for soil salinity mapping.

TI  - Utilizing Multilevel Features for Cloud Detection on Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection, which is defined as the pixel-wise binary classification, is significant in satellite imagery processing. In current remote sensing literature, cloud detection methods are linked to the relationships of imagery bands or based on simple image feature analysis. These methods, which only focus on low-level features, are not robust enough on the images with difficult land covers, for clouds share similar image features such as color and texture with the land covers. To solve the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for cloud detection on satellite imagery by utilizing multilevel image features with two major processes. The first process is to obtain the cloud probability map from the designed deep convolutional neural network, which concatenates deep neural network features from low-level to high-level. The second part of the method is to get refined cloud masks through a composite image filter technique, where the specific filter captures multilevel features of cloud structures and the surroundings of the input imagery. In the experiments, the proposed method achieves 85.38% intersection over union of cloud in the testing set which contains 100 Gaofen-1 wide field of view images and obtains satisfactory visual cloud masks, especially for those hard images. The experimental results show that utilizing multilevel features by the combination of the network with feature concatenation and the particular filter tackles the cloud detection problem with improved cloud masks.

TI  - Accurate Evaluation of Regional Soil Salinization Using Multi-Source Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its negative impacts on land productivity and plant growth, soil salinization is a tough problem, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Therefore, monitoring, mapping and predicting soil salinization are of utmost importance regarding lessening and/or preventing further increase in soil salinity through some protective measures. The current study proposes an evaluating and predicting approach that is based on remote sensing (e.g., Landsat TM images), near sensing technologies (e.g., electromagnetic induction device, EM38) and soil sampling data in typical zone of Xinjiang Automonous region. Firstly, maps of soil salinity were obtained from accurate interpretation model of soil salinity using multiple regression method in study area. The uniform distribution of 3D scatter data was modelled by grid sampling point on map of soil salinity. Then, a three-dimensional soil salt distribution was characterized by inverse distance weighting method. The results showed that the coefficient of variation of soil salinity, an indicative of strength intensity variation for different seasons, ranging from 1. 281 to 1. 527. The soil salinity remained at a low level and it decreased with increase of depth in the study area. Map of three-dimensional distribution of the regional soil salt demonstrated that severe soil salinity located in Midwestern region of the studied area. The synthesized method based spectral indices from remote sensing, soil apparent electrical conductivity from electromagnetic induction device and data of soil sampling in this study had 0. 908 of high correlation coefficient for assessment of regional soil salinity. Thus the application of this technique provides a new method to interpret and evaluate regional soil salinity in the three-dimensional spatial distribution characteristics in Xinjiang.

AB  - Acquiring training samples for supervised machine learning methods to automate land cover classification is very labor intensive. The ever-increasing amount of available remote sensing data makes it necessary to reduce these costs. By adding a segmentation approach to hierarchical clustering and active learning, we create a new and unique method for land cover classification. In the segmentation stage, we adapt the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to use the spectral angle instead of the Euclidean distance. The bisecting k-means algorithm creates the hierarchical clustering. Finally, we employ an active learning strategy based on the active queries method. We further investigate the effects of incorporating local density information into the active learning scheme. Here, we use probabilistic active learning. In this framework, the sample's label and its posterior probability are modeled as two random variables and weighted with the local density to estimate the impact of the sample's future label. We conduct eight experiments to test the influences of the method's different parameters and stages. Evaluation is done on three aerial remote sensing datasets for urban and vegetational regions in Germany: Abenberg, Potsdam, and Vaihingen. The method is compared to three state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that we are able to achieve the same overall accuracy while decreasing the amount of needed training samples by 95%.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and its dynamics have attracted considerable scientific attention for their significant ecological and socioeconomic implications. Many studies have investigated the past changes in land use, but efforts exploring the potential changes in land use and implications under future scenarios are still lacking. Here we simulate the future land use changes and their impacts on ecosystem services in Northeast China (NEC) over the period of 2000-2050 using the CLUE-S (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent) model under the scenarios of ecological security (ESS), food security (FSS) and comprehensive development (CDS). The model was validated against remote sensing data in 2005. Overall, the accuracy of the CLUE-S model was evaluated at 82.5%. Obtained results show that future cropland changes mainly occur in the Songnen Plain and the Liaohe Plain, forest and grassland changes are concentrated in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains and the western Changbai Mountains, while the Sanjiang Plain will witness major changes of the wetlands. Our results also show that even though CDS is defined based on the goals of the regional development plan, the ecological service value (ESV) under CDS is RMB 2656.18 billion in 2050. The ESV of CDS is lower compared with the other scenarios. Thus, CDS is not an optimum scenario for eco-environmental protection, especially for the wetlands, which should be given higher priority for future development. The issue of coordination is also critical in future development. The results can help to assist structural adjustments for agriculture and to guide policy interventions in NEC.

TI  - Transgressive deposits and morphological patterns in the equatorial Atlantic shallow shelf (Northeast Brazil)
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to identify and characterize the Late Quaternary morphological patterns of the west coast of the Ceara shelf, Northeast Brazil, based on Landsat 8, sedimentology, and seismic data. The shallow shelf has three regions: the Acarau high (AH), unconsolidated floor (UF), and Itapage bank (IB). The AH occurs in the inner shelf (0-5 m water depth) and shows various bedforms and in part a rocky bottom. The UF (>5 m) has many subaqueous dunes with bioclastics, structures for catching lobsters, and an escarpment. The IB is an extensive feature (delimited by the 20-m isobath) with large dunes and a shipwreck. Three seismic boundaries were identified as follows: transgressive surface (TS), subaerial exposure (SE), and miscellaneous surface (MS = TS + SE). Four seismic units were defined as follows: U1 - transparent facies with low amplitude, underlying the SE; U2 - chaotic to parallel facies with moderate to high amplitude, overlying the SE and underlying the TS; U3 - chaotic facies above the SE or TS and below the TS or sea floor, with the largest spatial extension; U4 - periodically occurring chaotic facies above the TS and below the seafloor. U1 is probably related to the falling stage systems tract or previous highstand systems tract. U2 and U3 belong to the transgressive systems tracts and U4 is associated with bedforms of the highstand systems tract. Ancient topography favored the development of transgressive deposits and modern bedforms. The AH, escarpment, and IB are morphostructures influenced by Acarau sub-basin faults. The inner shelf is characterized by shallow geomorphology strongly influenced by structural inheritance (Precambrian and post-breakup of Pangea), bedrock control, and the Holocene transgressive systems tract (the largest thickness occurs with subaqueous dunes).

TI  - Evaluation of machine learning techniques with multiple remote sensing datasets in estimating monthly concentrations of ground-level PM2.5
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been recognized as a key air pollutant that can influence population health risk, especially during extreme cases such as wildfires. Previous studies have applied geospatial techniques such as land use regression to map the ground-level PM2.5, while some recent studies have found that Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived from satellite images and machine learning techniques may be two elements that can improve spatiotemporal prediction. However, there has been a lack of studies evaluating use of different machine learning techniques with AOD datasets for mapping PM2.5, especially in areas with high spatiotemporal variability of PM2.5.In this study, we compared the performance of eight predictive algorithms with the use of multiple remote sensing datasets, including satellite-derived AOD data, for the prediction of ground-level PM2.5 concentration. Based on the results, Cubist, random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting were the algorithms with better performance, while Cubist was the best (CV-RMSE = 2.64 mu g/m(3), CV-R-2 = 0.48). Variable importance analysis indicated that the predictors with the highest contributions in modelling were monthly AOD and elevation.In conclusion, appropriate selection of machine learning algorithms can improve ground-level PM2.5 estimation, especially for areas with nonlinear relationships between PM2.5 and predictors caused by complex terrain. Satellite-derived data such as AOD and land surface temperature (LST) can also be substitutes for traditional datasets retrieved from weather stations, especially for areas with sparse and uneven distribution of stations.

TI  - Detection and Identification of Camouflaged Targets using Hyperspectral and LiDAR data
T2  - DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Camouflaging is the process of merging the target with the background with the aim to reduce/delay its detection. It can be done using different materials/methods such as camouflaging nets, paints. Defence applications often require quick detection of camouflaged targets in a dynamic battlefield scenario. Though HSI data may facilitate detection of camouflaged targets but detection gets complicated due to issues (spectral variability, dimensionality). This paper presents a framework for detection of camouflaged target that allows military analysts to coordinate and utilise the expert knowledge for resolving camouflaged targets using remotely sensed data. Desired camouflaged target (set of three chairs as a target under a camouflaging net) has been resolved in three steps: First, hyperspectral data processing helps to detect the locations of potential camouflaged targets. It narrows down the location of the potential camouflaged targets by detecting camouflaging net using Independent component analysis and spectral matching algorithms. Second, detection and identification have been performed using LiDAR point cloud classification and morphological analysis. HSI processing helps to discard the redundant majority of LiDAR point clouds and support detailed analysis of only the minute portion of the point cloud data the system deems relevant. This facilitates extraction of salient features of the potential camouflaged target. Lastly, the decisions obtained have been fused to infer the identity of the desired targets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach may be used to successfully resolve camouflaged target assuming some a priori knowledge about the morphology of targets likely to be present.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of Global Food Security-Support Analysis Data (GFSAD) Cropland Extent Maps Produced at Three Different Spatial Resolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring global agriculture systems relies on accurate and timely cropland information acquired worldwide. Recently, the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Program has produced Global Food Security-support Analysis Data (GFSAD) cropland extent maps at three different spatial resolutions, i.e., GFSAD1km, GFSAD250m, and GFSAD30m. An accuracy assessment and comparison of these three GFSAD cropland extent maps was performed to establish their quality and reliability for monitoring croplands both at global and regional scales. Large area (i.e., global) assessment of GFSAD cropland extent maps was performed by dividing the entire world into regions using a stratification approach and collecting a reference dataset using a simple random sampling design. All three global cropland extent maps were assessed using a total reference dataset of 28,733 samples. The assessment results showed an overall accuracy of 72.3%, 80-98%, and 91.7% for GFSAD1km, 250 m (only for four continents), and 30 m maps, respectively. Additionally, a regional comparison of the three GFSAD cropland extent maps was analyzed for nine randomly selected study sites of different agriculture field sizes (i.e., small, medium, and large). The similarity among the three GFSAD cropland extent maps in these nine study sites was represented using a similarity matrix approach and two landscape metrics (i.e., Proportion of Landscape (PLAND) and Per Patch Unit (PPU)), which categorized the crop proportion and the crop pattern. A comparison of the results showed the similarities and differences in the cropland areas and their spatial extent when mapped at the three spatial resolutions and considering the different agriculture field sizes. Finally, specific recommendations were suggested for when to apply each of the three different GFSAD cropland extent maps for agriculture monitoring based on these agriculture field sizes.

TI  - Temporal Extrapolation of Daily Downward Shortwave Radiation Over Cloud-Free Rugged Terrains. Part 1: Analysis of Topographic Effects
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of daily downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is of great importance in global energy budget and climatic modeling. The combination of satellite-based instantaneous measurements and temporal extrapolation models is the most feasible way to capture daily radiation variations at large scales. However, previous studies did not pay enough attention to topographic effects and simple temporal extrapolation methods were applied directly to rugged terrains which cover a large amount of the land surface. This paper, divided into two parts, aims at analyzing the topographic uncertainties of existing models and proposing a better method based on a mountain radiative transfer (MRT) model to calculate daily DSR. As the first part, this paper analyze the spatiotemporal variations of DSR influenced by topographic effects and checks the applicability of three temporal extrapolation methods on cloud-free days. Considering that clouds also have a strong influence on solar radiation, cloud-free days are chosen for targeted analysis of topographic effects on DSR. Three indices, the coefficient of variation, entropy-based dispersion coefficient (CH), and sill of semivariogram, are put forward to give a quantitative description of spatial heterogeneity. Our results show that the topography can dramatically strengthen the spatial heterogeneity of DSR. The index, CH, has an advantage for quantifying spatial heterogeneity as it offers a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Spatial heterogeneity distorts the daily variation of DSR. Application of extrapolation methods in rugged terrains leads to overestimation of daily average DSR up to 60 W/m2 and a maximum 200 W/m2 error of instantaneous DSR on cloud-free days. This paper makes a quantitative analysis of topographic effects under different spatiotemporal conditions, which lays the foundation for developing a new extrapolation method.

TI  - Changes of multiple cropping in Huang-Huai-Hai agricultural region, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple cropping index (MCI) is the ratio of total sown area and cropland area in a region, which represents the regional time intensity of planting crops. Multiple cropping systems have effectively improved the utilization efficiency and production of cropland by increasing cropping frequency in one year. Meanwhile, it has also significantly altered biogeochemical cycles. Therefore, exploring the spatio-temporal dynamics of multiple cropping intensity is of great significance for ensuring food and ecological security. In this study, MCI of Huang-Huai-Hai agricultural region with intensive cropping practices was extracted based on a cropping intensity mapping algorithm using MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series at 500-m spatial resolution and 8-day time intervals. Then the physical characteristics and landscape pattern of MCI trends were analyzed from 2000-2012. Results showed that MCI in Huang-Huai-Hai agricultural region has increased from 152% to 156% in the 12 years. Topography is a primary factor in determining the spatial pattern dynamics of MCI, which is more stable in hilly area than in plain area. An increase from 158% to 164% of MCI occurred in plain area while there was almost no change in hilly area with single cropping. The most active region of MCI change was the intersection zone between the hilly area and plain area. In spatial patterns, landscape of multiple cropping systems tended to be homogenized reflected by a reduction in the degree of fragmentation and an increase in the degree of concentration of cropland with the same cropping system.

TI  - An IHS-Based Pan-Sharpening Method for Spectral Fidelity Improvement Using Ripplet Transform and Compressed Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening aims at integrating spectral information from a multi-spectral (MS) image and spatial information from a panchromatic (PAN) image in a fused image with both high spectral and spatial resolutions. Numerous pan-sharpening methods are based on intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transform, which may cause evident spectral distortion. To address this problem, an IHS-based pan-sharpening method using ripplet transform and compressed sensing is proposed. Firstly, the IHS transform is applied to the MS image to separate intensity components. Secondly, discrete ripplet transform (DRT) is implemented on the intensity component and the PAN image to obtain multi-scale sub-images. High-frequency sub-images are fused by a local variance algorithm and, for low-frequency sub-images, compressed sensing is introduced for the reconstruction of the intensity component so as to integrate the local information from both the intensity component and the PAN image. The specific fusion rule is defined by local difference. Finally, the inverse ripplet transform and inverse IHS transform are coupled to generate the pan-sharpened image. The proposed method is compared with five state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods and also the Gram-Schmidt (GS) method through visual and quantitative analysis of WorldView-2, Pleiades and Triplesat datasets. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method achieves relatively higher spatial resolution and more desirable spectral fidelity.

TI  - High resolution satellite imaging sensors for precision agriculture
T2  - FRONTIERS OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - The central concept of precision agriculture is to manage within-field soil and crop growth variability for more efficient use of farming inputs. Remote sensing has been an integral part of precision agriculture since the farming technology started developing in the mid to late 1980s. Various types of remote sensors carried on ground-based platforms, manned aircraft, satellites, and more recently, unmanned aircraft have been used for precision agriculture applications. Original satellite sensors, such as Landsat and SPOT, have commonly been used for agricultural applications over large geographic areas since the 1970s, but they have limited use for precision agriculture because of their relatively coarse spatial resolution and long revisit time. Recent developments in high resolution satellite sensors have significantly narrowed the gap in spatial resolution between satellite imagery and airborne imagery. Since the first high resolution satellite sensor IKONOS was launched in 1999, numerous commercial high resolution satellite sensors have become available. These imaging sensors not only provide images with high spatial resolution, but can also repeatedly view the same target area. The high revisit frequency and fast data turnaround time, combined with their relatively large aerial coverage, make high resolution satellite sensors attractive for many applications, including precision agriculture. This article will provide an overview of commercially available high resolution satellite sensors that have been used or have potential for precision agriculture. The applications of these sensors for precision agriculture are reviewed and application examples based on the studies conducted by the author and his collaborators are provided to illustrate how high resolution satellite imagery has been used for crop identification, crop yield variability mapping and pest management. Some challenges and future directions on the use of high resolution satellite sensors and other types of remote sensors for precision agriculture are discussed.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval over Beijing Using MODIS Satellite Images
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosol is one of the most important factors that affect air quality of urban environment, meanwhile, it has important effects on human health. Traditional aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithms are always suitable for dark areas with low surface reflectance including ocean and densely vegetated areas, however, for bright urban areas, surface reflectance is high and difficult to be determined, leading to great challenges. Aiming at this problem, a new improved approach of surface reflectance estimation is proposed and the underlying surfaces are divided into dark and bright areas. Surface reflectance is determined using the simulated relationships between the surface reflectance between visible and short-wave infrared channels and a priori surface reflectance dataset constructed with long time series of MODIS apparent reflectance images using the minimum value synthesis technology. Then aerosol retrieval is performed based on the radiative transfer theory with pre-calculated Look-up Tables. Beijing, which features complex surfaces and serious air pollution, is selected as the study area and the proposed algorithm is applied to the MODIS data for aerosol retrieval experiments. Four AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD ground-measured stations, Beijing, Xianghe, Beijing_CAMS and Beijing_RADI, and operational MODIS aerosol product (MOD04) are selected for validation and comparison purposes. Results showed that AOD retrievals are highly consistent with AERONET AOD ground measurements (R-2 =0. 902) and showed overall higher accuracy with more detailed spatial distribution compared to MOD04 AOD products over bright urban areas.

TI  - Estimating spatial variability of ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> based on a satellite-derived aerosol optical depth product: Fuzhou, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating exposure to PM2.5 within urban areas has important implications for human health. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means to retrieve spatial coverage of PM2.5 concentrations. Using the monitoring network established by the local government in 2014, this study developed a linear mixed effects model that integrates aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements (spatial resolution: 3 km) from MODIS and meteorological data from GEOS-FP meteorological fields as predictors to derive daily estimations of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in Fuzhou (SE China). A 10-fold cross validation method was employed to examine the performance of the mixed effects model. The cross validation yielded a R-2 value of 0.72, and a root mean square error value of 9.2 mu g/m(3) for the mixed effects model. Furthermore, the monthly/seasonal average PM2.5 estimated by the mixed effects model was highly correlated with those of in situ measurements. The results also revealed the spatial differences in the PM2.5 distribution across the study area, i.e., higher concentrations in the urban center and lower values in suburban to rural areas. The results suggest that the mixed effects model using MODIS 3 km AOD together with meteorological data could be effective for the estimation of PM2.5 concentrations in the Fuzhou area.

TI  - A new model to predict risk of nonsentinel lymph node status in Chinese sentinel lymph node-positive patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - There is no previous predictive model to assess risk of nonsentinel lymph node metastases (NSLN) in sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAT). Our goal was to develop a new predictive model for SLN-positive patients after NAT, and validate this new model. A series of 513 patients with metastases in SLN who received NAT were used to evaluate factors affecting NSLN status. Logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a predictive model, which was validated by a subsequent prospective 138 patients. There were 115 (22.4%) patients with metastases in NSLN followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Multivariate analysis indicated that tumor (T) stage, number of positive SLN,micrometastases, extracapsular extension (ECE), and clinical response of primary tumor after NAT were significant independent predictors for the NSLN metastases. Area under the curve (AUC) of the model was 0.795 (95% CI, 0.734-0.861). When applied to the prospective series, the model accurately predicted the risk of NSLN disease, AUC was 0.772 (95% CI, 0.653-0.845). We present a new predictive model to assess the risk of NSLN status in Chinese SLN-positive breast cancer patients after NAT. The predictive model performed well in prospective validation but needs to be further studied in external center patients before application to clinical use.

TI  - <i>Midcrustal Thrusting and Vertical Deformation Partitioning Constraint by 2017 M</i><sub>w</sub> <i>7.3 Sarpol Zahab Earthquake in Zagros Mountain Belt, Iran</i>
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the geodetic data set of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) including Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-2 and Sentinel-1A/1B satellites for inferring the fault model of the 2017 M-w 7.3 Sarpol Zahab, Iran, earthquake. The InSAR deformation fields show that the seismogenic fault does not reach the ground surface, but some shallow folds have been triggered by the mainshock. Our preferred faulting model suggests that the coseismic rupture occurs on a single planar fault surface with a strike angle of 337.5 degrees. Two significant slip sources are determined by the geodetic data: one is located within the 11.8-to 13.5-km depth range with a peak slip of 4.9 m, and the other occurs at the shallower depth (10.5-12.5 km) with a peak slip of 4.5 m. Both of them are responsible for the primary deformation signals in the geodetic imagery. The significant fault slip concentrates at the 10-to 14-km depth within the Pan-African basement. However, most of the aftershocks have depths between 3 and 12 km in the shallow sedimentary section. We hypothesize that the Hormuz Salt section with a depth of 12-13 km detaches the high-slip zones from the aftershock cluster, by which the fault slip is not transferred through the intervening salt section to the surface. The predicted static Coulomb stress change by our preferred faulting model at a depth of 10 km could encourage the occurrence of aftershocks. Moreover, the triggered fault-related folding in the southwest of the seismic zone has a positive Coulomb stress change and aseismic slip caused by the mainshock.

TI  - Dust storms backward Trajectories' and source identification over Kuwait
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms (DS) are considered a common environmental phenomenon in numerous countries of the world, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions. DS causes a significant impact on human health, climate, the environment and many associated socioeconomic factors. The main goal of this study is to assess the sources of DS in the State of Kuwait. The present study investigates DS over Kuwait using the backward trajectories' simulation with MODIS satellite observations at various latitudes (1000, 3000, 5000 m) during the four seasons; winter, spring, summer, and fall. The trajectories' simulation was modeled using the HYSPLIT model to create the seasonal climatologic of air parcel trajectories. The meteorological data (e.g., visibility, wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and humidity) were collected during a 12-year period from 2000 to 2012. Daily trajectories were computed backward for five days from a central origin at several altitudes above the ground surface. The variability of the DS was analyzed daily, monthly, seasonally and annually. A case study on 25 March 2011 and two cases from each season were selected for analysis. The results showed that the HYSPLIT model was consistent with the MODIS satellite images. The sources of DS were identified from both the Sahara Desert and the Arabian Desert. Furthermore, there is a significant influence of the atmospheric conditions on the DS sources. The most influential parameter was visibility, from the west and the northwest direction. The present work provides evidence and suggestions for the origins of DS and is expected to help in establishing guidelines for public protection against dust particles and provides significant information to the concerned officials to take proper actions.

TI  - Spatial assessment of sugarcane (<i>Saccharurn spp</i>. L.) production to feed the Komenda Sugar Factory, Ghana
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Ghana imports about US$ 2 million worth of sugar annually. To address this huge import bill and to take advantage of a growing demand for sugar in the West African sub-region, the Government of Ghana initiated a Sugar Policy. The Government of Ghana, therefore, re-constructed and commissioned the Komenda Sugar Factory in 2016 at a reported cost of US$ 35 million. The Komenda Sugar Factory can process 1,250 tons of sugarcane per day (or 225,000 tons per annum), but was shut down soon after the test run and commissioning. This raised considerable public outcry. Among the numerous reasons that were given, it was widely believed that the factory faced feedstock deficits. This study therefore applied satellite remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems to quantify the potential feedstock supply from current production within the immediate catchment of the factory. Supervised classification was applied to Landsat 8 images, using QGIS, to quantify sugarcane production in the study area and at specified buffer distances from the factory. The results showed that the factory could mobilize only 7% of its feedstock requirement within the industrially recommended radius of 40 miles and 13% within the entire catchment area in the 2016/2017 season. Thus, under current scale of production and production conditions, the Komenda Sugar Factory faces large deficits in feedstock supply. National production data suggests that total national sugarcane production in 2016 would only meet 68% of the factory's requirement if it were operational. The results suggest an urgent need to establish a plantation for the factory and to commit out-growers to production to support and sustain the factory if it is to become operational soon. There is also a need for high-yielding, high-brix, and early maturing varieties, coupled with good agronomic practices, to bridge the quantity and (potentially) quality gaps.

TI  - Continuous Daily Evapotranspiration Estimation at the Field-Scale over Heterogeneous Agricultural Areas by Fusing ASTER and MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous daily evapotranspiration (ET) monitoring at the field-scale is crucial for water resource management in irrigated agricultural areas in arid regions. Here, an integrated framework for daily ET, with the required spatiotemporal resolution, is described. Multi-scale surface energy balance algorithm evaluations and a data fusion algorithm are combined to optimally exploit the spatial and temporal characteristics of image datasets, collected by the advanced space-borne thermal emission reflectance radiometer (ASTER) and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). Through combination with a linear unmixing-based method, the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is modified to generate high-resolution ET estimates for heterogeneous areas. The performance of this methodology was evaluated for irrigated agricultural fields in arid and semiarid areas of Northwest China. Compared with the original STARFM, a significant improvement in daily ET estimation accuracy was obtained by the modified STARFM (overall mean absolute percentage error (MAP): 12.9% vs. 17.2%; root mean square error (RMSE): 0.7 mm d(-1) vs. 1.2 mm d(-1)). The modified STARFM additionally preserved more spatial details than the original STARFM for heterogeneous agricultural fields, and provided field-to-field variability in water use. Improvements were further evident in the continuous daily ET, where the day-to-day dynamics of ET estimates were captured. ET data fusion provides a unique means of monitoring continuous daily crop ET values at the field-scale in agricultural areas, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions.

TI  - Analyzing temporo-spatial changes and the distribution of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in Australia from 2009 to 2016 by greenhouse gas monitoring satellites
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We comprehensively analyzed the temporo-spatial changes in the CO2 concentrations in Australia from June 2009 to December 2016 using greenhouse gas monitoring satellites, Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). Regarding the spatial distribution, the CO2 concentration in central Australia was always higher than that of other regions, and the lack of precipitation in this region is thought to be one of the main causes of this increased concentration. By combining the results with the Koppen-Geiger climate classification, a subtle relationship between the spatial distribution of CO2 and various climate types were found. Precipitation, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), phytoplankton around the coastal region, vegetation cover and other factors jointly affected the spatial CO2 concentration in Australia. Moreover, the results indicated that the abnormal SST in the 4 Nino zones would affect the precipitation and vegetation growth in Australia and the total chlorophyll in the equatorial Eastern Central Pacific Ocean, which would in turn influence carbon cycling in Australia. According to the Ni (n) over tildeo-3 and Ni (n) over tildeo-3.4 indices, two El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events occurred during the study period. The CO2 increase rate decreased during the period of the 2011 La Nina, while the CO2 increase rate increased during the period of the 2015 El Nino. With the global CO2 concentration as the background, the abnormal change of CO2 in Australia was analyzed. Lastly, the results showed that SST around Australia, precipitation, vegetation, ENSO events, oceanic chemical processes and bushfires were assumed to directly or indirectly influence the temporal changes in CO2 in this region.

TI  - Multi-Year Mapping of Major Crop Yields in an Irrigation District from High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Vegetation Index
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation is important for formulating informed regional and national food trade policies. The introduction of remote sensing in agricultural monitoring makes accurate estimation of regional crop yields possible. However, remote sensing images and crop distribution maps with coarse spatial resolution usually cause inaccuracy in yield estimation due to the existence of mixed pixels. This study aimed to estimate the annual yields of maize and sunflower in Hetao Irrigation District in North China using 30 m spatial resolution HJ-1A/1B CCD images and high accuracy multi-year crop distribution maps. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series obtained from HJ-1A/1B CCD images was fitted with an asymmetric logistic curve to calculate daily NDVI and phenological characteristics. Eight random forest (RF) models using different predictors were developed for maize and sunflower yield estimation, respectively, where predictors of each model were a combination of NDVI series and/or phenological characteristics. We calibrated all RF models with measured crop yields at sampling points in two years ( 2014 and 2015), and validated the RF models with statistical yields of four counties in six years. Results showed that the optimal model for maize yield estimation was the model using NDVI series from the 120th to the 210th day in a year with 10 days' interval as predictors, while that for sunflower was the model using the combination of three NDVI characteristics, three phenological characteristics, and two curve parameters as predictors. The selected RF models could estimate multi-year regional crop yields accurately, with the average values of root-mean-square error and the relative error of 0.75 t/ha and 6.1% for maize, and 0.40 t/ha and 10.1% for sunflower, respectively. Moreover, the yields of maize and sunflower can be estimated fairly well with NDVI series 50 days before crop harvest, which implicated the possibility of crop yield forecast before harvest.

TI  - Deep Multi-Feature Learning for Water Body Extraction from Landsat Imagery
T2  - AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body extraction from remote sensing image data has been becoming a really hot topic. Recently, researchers put forward numerous methods for water body extraction, while most of them rely on elaborative feature selection and enough number of training samples. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), one of the implementation models of deep learning, has strong capability for two-dimension images' classification. A new water body extraction model based on CNNs is established for deep multi-feature learning. Before experiment, image enhancement will be done by Dark Channel Prior. Then we concatenate three kinds of features: spectral information, spatial information that is extracted by Extended Multi-attribute Profile (EMAP) and various water indexes firstly. Next, feature matrixes are acted as the input of CNN-based model for training and classifying. The experimental results showed that the proposed model has better classification performance than Support Vector Machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). On very limited training set, our model could learn unique and representative features for better water body extraction.

TI  - Generation of High Resolution Vegetation Productivity from a Downscaling Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating vegetation productivity is important in the research of terrestrial ecosystems, carbon cycles and climate change. Although several gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) products have been generated and many algorithms developed, advances are still needed to exploit multi-scale data streams for producing GPP and NPP with higher spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, a method to generate high spatial resolution (30 m) GPP and NPP products was developed based on multi-scale remote sensing data and a downscaling method. First, high resolution fraction photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and leaf area index (LAI) were obtained by using a regression tree approach and the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). Second, the GPP and NPP were estimated from a multi-source data synergized quantitative algorithm. Finally, the vegetation productivity estimates were validated with the ground-based field data, and were compared with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and estimated Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products. Results of this paper indicated that downscaling methods have great potential in generating high resolution GPP and NPP.

TI  - Climate-induced habitat suitability variations of chub mackerel <i>Scomber japonicus</i> in the East China Sea
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Chub mackerel Scomber japonicas is an economically important fish species, extensively distributed in the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. Climate variability has strong impacts on its habitat. In this study, an integrated habitat suitability index (HSI) model was constructed to examine habitat suitability of S. japonicas in the East China Sea, and evaluate the relationship with the El Nino and La Nina events, with three crucial environmental variables (sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH) and net primary production (NPP)) as predictors. The HSI model was developed using data over 2006-2013 and validated using data in 2014 and 2015. Results showed that the HSI model with the best model performance yielded robust predictions of habitat suitability for S. japonicas. The decreasing catch and CPUE (catch per unit effort) of S. japonicus during 2006-2015 were highly consistent with substantial shrinkage of suitable and optimal habitats, and enlargement of normal and poor habitats. Similar movement pattern was also found between the latitudinal gravity centers of fishing effort for S. japonicas fishery and the gravity centers of potential habitat. In addition, spatial correlation analysis indicated that the HSI value was significantly positively related to the SST anomaly (SSTA) and negatively correlated with the SSH anomaly (SSHA) and NPP anomaly (NPPA), on the main fishing ground between 25 degrees-30 degrees N and 120 degrees-130 degrees E. Furthermore, various intensity of the El Nino and La Nina event may lead to different variations in the habitat suitability of S. japonicus. Comparing to the very strong El Nino, the moderate El Nitio events would yield rising SSTA and lowing SSHA and NPPA, leading to dramatically enlarged suitable habitat of S. japonicas. The habitat quality in La Nina events with different intensity depended on the local environmental variability on the fishing ground. Our findings suggested that the El Nino and La Nina events prominently affected the habitat suitability of S. japonicas in the East China Sea. However, the impacts varied with the intensity of each anomalous climatic event.

TI  - Comparison of sentinel lymph node detection performances using blue dye in conjunction with indocyanine green or radioisotope in breast cancer patients: a prospective single-center randomized study
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This randomized study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy between the novel dual tracer composed of indocyanine green (ICG) and blue dye (BD) and the conventional dual tracer composed of radioisotope and BD for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with breast cancer.Methods: This study enrolled 471 clinically lymph node-negative patients with primary breast cancer. All patients underwent mastectomy, and those undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were randomized to receive blue dye plus radioisotope (RB group) or BD plus ICG (IB group). The detection performances on SLN identification rate, positive SLN counts, detection sensitivity, and false-negative rate were compared between the two groups.Results: In the IB group, 97% (194/200) of the patients who underwent the ICG and BD dual tracer injection showed fluorescent-positive lymphatic vessels within 2-5 min. The identification rate of SLNs was comparable between the IB group (99.0%, 198/200) and the RB group (99.6%, 270/271) (P = 0.79). No significant differences were observed in the identification rate of metastatic SLNs (22.5% vs. 22.9%, P > 0.05, RB group vs. IB group, the same below), positive SLN counts (3.72 +/- 2.28 vs. 3.91 +/- 2.13, P > 0.05), positive metastatic SLN counts (0.38 +/- 0.84 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.78, P > 0.05), SLNB detection sensitivity (94.4% vs. 92.5%, P > 0.05), or false-negative rate (5.6% vs. 7.5%, P > 0.05) between the two groups.Conclusions: ICG can be used as a promising alternative tracer for radioisotope in SLN mapping, and when it is combined with BD in lymphangiography, it offers comparable detection sensitivity compared to the conventional lymphatic mapping strategies that are widely used in clinical practice.

AB  - This paper concerns the disclosure of the cultural background of the lexeme fahem (intelligence, intellect, brightness, knowledge), analysis of lexical units denoting the notion of fahem in the Tatar language. The study focuses on the influence of the Muslim religion and Sufi teachings on the formation of the Turkic-Tatar religious worldview, as well as on the evolution of the Tatar language on the whole; the semantic transformation, development and functioning of the lexeme fahem in different layers of vocabulary and the specificity of its fixation in the linguistic consciousness of the TatarsRelating to the problems of research, a complex of existing basic research methods is effectively used: descriptive, comparative historical, contrastive, methods of partial and complete sampling of the material under study.The study proves that the adoption of Islam has changed the worldview of the Turkic-Tatars, contributed to the development of the Tatar language. The article states that the lexeme fahem, after being borrowed from the Arabic language, has acquired a new semantic understanding and undergone the semantic development and partial transformation. In the modern Tatar language, the lexeme fahem (the phonetic variant - fahim), functioning as a separate name and as a component of compound names, is updated in new meanings in the anthroponymic space. It is revealed that among the names with the component fahem the most frequent are the personal names Fahim / Fahima and their colloquial (phonetic) variants Faim / Faima.

TI  - Block Adjustment without GCPs for Chinese Spaceborne SAR GF-3 Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite is the first C-band multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with the ability of high-accuracy mapping in China. However, the Ground Control Points (GCPs) are essential to ensure the accuracy of mapping for GF-3 SAR imagery at present. In this paper, we analyze the error sources that affect the geometric processing and propose a new block adjustment method without GCPs for GF-3 SAR imagery. Firstly, the geometric calibration of GF-3 image is carried out. Secondly, the rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) model is directly generated after the geometric calibration parameters compensation of each image. Finally, we solve the orientation parameters of the GF-3 images through DEM assisted planar block adjustment and conduct ortho-rectification. With two different imaging modes of GF-3 satellite, which include the QPSI and FS2, we carry out the block adjustment without GCPs. Experimental results of testing areas including Wuhan city and Hubei province in China show that the geometric mosaic accuracy and the absolute positioning accuracy of the orthophoto are better than one pixel, which has laid a good foundation for the application of GF-3 image in global high-accuracy mapping.

TI  - Semi-empirical ocean surface model for compact-polarimetry mode SAR of RADARSAT Constellation Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A semi-empirical model of the ocean surface is developed for the compact-polarimetry (CP) mode of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which will be a main product of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), scheduled for launch in November 2018. The fundamental mechanism for the semi-empirical model is the interactions between sea surface waves and the radar microwave. Sea surface waves are generated by ocean surface winds and may be modulated by precipitation or oceanic processes, such as surface currents, internal waves (IWs), and surfactants (e.g. oil spill, and sea ice). Model results for normalized radar cross sections (NRCSs) induced by ocean winds are validated against a database we developed. The ocean wind vectors were observed by in situ buoys of the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC); the RCM NRCSs are obtained from a "CP simulator", using composites of RADARSAT-2 quad-pol SAR images. We simulate the dependencies of the NRCSs on wind speeds and incidence angles, for up-wind (wind direction is 0 degrees) and cross-wind (wind direction is 90 degrees) conditions. And we report the potential abilities and limitations of ocean winds monitoring using the RCM CP mode, as well as suggest that the RV-pol should be suitable for hurricane monitoring in the future. As hurricanes containing high winds are generally associated with heavy rain conditions, we discuss the possible mechanisms for precipitation effects related to the RV- and RH-polarizations by simulating two effects on the ocean surface waves. Moreover, we suggest that the RCM CP mode is better able to monitor the ocean surface currents than the fully polarimetry SAR systems (e.g. RADARSAT-2), because of the associated large swath and the possible continuous images of three RCM satellites.

TI  - Deep Self-Paced Residual Network for Multispectral Images Classification Based on Feature-Level Fusion
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification methods based on fusion techniques of multisource multispectral (MS) images have been studied for a long time. However, it may he difficult to classify these data based on a feature level while avoiding the inconsistency of data caused by multisource and multiple regions or cities. In this letter, we propose a deep learning structure called 2-branch SPL-ResNet which combines the self-paced learning with deep residual network to classify multisource MS data based on the feature-level fusion. First, a 2-D discrete wavelet is used to obtain the multiscale features and sparse representation of MS data. Then, a 2-branch SPL-ResNet is established to extract respective characteristics of the two satellites. Finally, we implement the feature-level fusion by cascading the two feature vectors and then classify the integrated feature vector. We conduct the experiments on Landsat_8 and Sentinel_2 MS images. Compared with the commonly used classification methods such as support vector machine and convolutional neural networks, our proposed 2-branch SPL-ResNet framework has higher accuracy and more robustness.

TI  - Melt Pond Conditions on Declining Arctic Sea Ice Over 1979-2016: Model Development, Validation, and Results
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A melt pond (MP) distribution equation has been developed and incorporated into the Marginal Ice-Zone Modeling and Assimilation System to simulate Arctic MPs and sea ice over 1979-2016. The equation differs from previous MP models and yet benefits from previous studies for MP parameterizations as well as a range of observations for model calibration. Model results show higher magnitude of MP volume per unit ice area and area fraction in most of the Canada Basin and the East Siberian Sea and lower magnitude in the central Arctic. This is consistent with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations, evaluated with Measurements of Earth Data for Environmental Analysis (MEDEA) data, and closely related to top ice melt per unit ice area. The model simulates a decrease in the total Arctic sea ice volume and area, owing to a strong increase in bottom and lateral ice melt. The sea ice decline leads to a strong decrease in the total MP volume and area. However, the Arctic-averaged MP volume per unit ice area and area fraction show weak, statistically insignificant downward trends, which is linked to the fact that MP water drainage per unit ice area is increasing. It is also linked to the fact that MP volume and area decrease relatively faster than ice area. This suggests that overall the actual MP conditions on ice have changed little in the past decades as the ice cover is retreating in response to Arctic warming, thus consistent with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations that show no clear trend in MP area fraction over 2000-2011.Plain Language Summary Arctic sea ice is characterized by widespread melt ponds (MPs) in summer. A MP distribution conservation equation is incorporated into the Marginal Ice-Zone Modeling and Assimilation System to simulate the evolution of MPs and sea ice over the period 1979-2016. The model captures the observed spatiotemporal variations of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MP area fraction (fraction of sea ice area covered by MPs), with low mean bias and high correlation. Model results show higher magnitude of MP volume per unit ice area (MP volume per unit area divided by ice concentration) and area fraction in most of the Canada Basin and the East Siberian Sea and lower magnitude in the central Arctic. This is consistent with MODIS observations. The model simulates a decrease in the total Arctic sea ice volume and area. The sea ice decline leads to a strong decrease in the total MP volume and area. The Arctic-averaged MP volume per unit ice area and area fraction show weak downward trends. This suggests that overall the actual MP conditions on ice have changed little in the past decades as the ice cover is retreating in response to Arctic warming, thus consistent with the MODIS observations that show no clear trend.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Landsat 8 Datasets in the Dongting Lake Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the world's major staple foods, especially in China. Highly accurate monitoring on rice-producing land is, therefore, crucial for assessing food supplies and productivity. Recently, the deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved considerable success in remote-sensing data analysis. A CNN-based paddy-rice mapping method using the multitemporal Landsat 8, phenology data, and land-surface temperature (LST) was developed during this study. First, the spatial-temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) was used to blend the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data for obtaining multitemporal Landsat-like data. Subsequently, the threshold method is applied to derive the phenological variables from the Landsat-like (Normalized difference vegetation index) NDVI time series. Then, a generalized single-channel algorithm was employed to derive LST from the Landsat 8. Finally, multitemporal Landsat 8 spectral images, combined with phenology and LST data, were employed to extract paddy-rice information using a patch-based deep-learning CNN algorithm. The results show that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 97.06% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91, which are 6.43% and 0.07 higher than that of the support vector machine method, and 7.68% and 0.09 higher than that of the random forest method, respectively. Moreover, the Landsat-derived rice area is strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.9945) with government statistical data, demonstrating that the proposed method has potential in large-scale paddy-rice mapping using moderate spatial resolution images.

AB  - Urban land cover and land use mapping plays an important role in urban planning and management. In this paper, novel multi-scale deep learning models, namely ASPP-Unet and ResASPP-Unet are proposed for urban land cover classification based on very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. The proposed ASPP-Unet model consists of a contracting path which extracts the high-level features, and an expansive path, which up-samples the features to create a high-resolution output. The atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) technique is utilized in the bottom layer in order to incorporate multi-scale deep features into a discriminative feature. The ResASPP-Unet model further improves the architecture by replacing each layer with residual unit. The models were trained and tested based on WorldView-2 (WV2) and WorldView-3 (WV3) imageries over the city of Beijing. Model parameters including layer depth and the number of initial feature maps (IFMs) as well as the input image bands were evaluated in terms of their impact on the model performances. It is shown that the ResASPP-Unet model with 11 layers and 64 IFMs based on 8-band WV2 imagery produced the highest classification accuracy (87.1% for WV2 imagery and 84.0% for WV3 imagery). The ASPP-Unet model with the same parameter setting produced slightly lower accuracy, with overall accuracy of 85.2% for WV2 imagery and 83.2% for WV3 imagery. Overall, the proposed models outperformed the state-of-the-art models, e.g., U-Net, convolutional neural network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model over both WV2 and WV3 images, and yielded robust and efficient urban land cover classification results.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Estimates from FY-3B MWRI Brightness Temperatures Using the WS Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A rainfall retrieval algorithm for tropical cyclones (TCs) using 18.7 and 36.5 GHz of vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperatures (Tbs) from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) is presented. The beamfilling effect is corrected based on ratios of the retrieved liquid water absorption and theoretical Mie absorption coefficients at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz. To assess the performance of this algorithm, MWRI measurements are matched with the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) precipitation for six TCs. The comparison between MWRI and NSIDC rain rates is relatively encouraging, with a mean bias of -0.14 mm/h and an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.99 mm/h. A comparison of pixel-to-pixel retrievals shows that MWRI retrievals are constrained to reasonable levels for most rain categories, with a minimum error of -1.1% in the 10-15 mm/h category; however, with maximum errors around -22% at the lowest (0-0.5 mm/h) and highest rain rates (25-30 mm/h). Additionally, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Tbs are applied to retrieve rain rates to assess the sensitivity of this algorithm, with a mean bias and RMSE of 0.90 mm/h and 3.11 mm/h, respectively. For the case study of TC Maon (2011), MWRI retrievals underestimate rain rates over 6 mm/h and overestimate rain rates below 6 mm/h compared with Precipitation Radar (PR) observations on storm scales. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) rainfall data provided by the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) are applied to assess the representation of mesoscale structures in intense TCs, and they show good consistency with MWRI retrievals.

TI  - Reconstruction of stand. replacement disturbance and stand age of Chinese fir plantation based on a Landsat time series in Huitong County, Hunan
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We constructed a relatively complete annual time series of Landsat archived data of Huitong County, Hunan Province from 1986 to 2016, and detected the dynamics of each forest pixel by calculating and analyzing the annual Integrated Forest Z-cores in order to obtain historical disturbance information. We mapped stand age in the study area by establishing a statistical relationship between historical disturbance information and field. measured stand ages. The results showed that: (1) The area of Chinese fir plantations was 7.67x10(4) hectares, which was mainly distributed in the regions with the slope steepness less than 25 degrees; (2) The disturbance of Chinese fir plantations mostly occurred before 1996. The highest loss of Chinese fir plantation area caused by the disturbance occurred mainly during 1987-1992, accounting for 17.54% of the total area. The area of disturbed Chinese fir plantation gradually declined after 2000, while the area of forest recovered from disturbance increased rapidly during the same period. About 42% of Chinese fir plantations were recovered from disturbances during the past 15 years, which were mostly located along the major transportation routes and the rivers; (3) Mature and intermediate-aged Chinese fir plantations occupied the majority of forest landscape, covering about 47% and 15% respectively. In contrast, young, near-mature, and over-mature Chinese fir plantations covered 15%, 3%, and 6%, respectively. Our results suggested that remote sensing time-series data could be used to effectively retrieve stand age distribution of regional plantation forest. Our results provide critical information for the management of local forest resources.

T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Workshop on Modeling the Ocean (IWMO)
CL  - Seoul, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - Combining Argo observations with satellite remote sensing data during the period of 2002-2014, the mean three-dimensional structures of mesoscale eddies on both sides of the Luzon Strait (LS) were obtained via a composite method and analyzed to statistically examine the influences of background marine environment and the Kuroshio current on the eddy structures. The significant signals of temperature and salinity anomalies within the composite eddies extend much deeper in the region east of the LS (zone E) than those in the region west of the strait (zone W) because of stronger eddy intensity and larger vertical gradients of background temperature and salinity in the deep layer in zone E. In the vertical structure of temperature anomaly within the eddies, two cores occur at around 200 and 400dbar depths, respectively, in zone E and only one core is centered at about 100dbar in zone W. There is a clear three-core sandwich pattern in the vertical structure of salinity anomaly within the eddies in zone E. The Kuroshio water trapped in the eddy is responsible for abnormally positive salinity anomaly in the surface layer of the anticyclonic eddy center in zone W. On both sides of the LS, an asymmetric dipole structure in the surface layer gradually turns into a monopole one at depths, which resulted from the competition between horizontal advection effect and eddy pumping effect. The Kuroshio current influences the distribution patterns of isotherms and isohalines and enhances background temperature and salinity horizontal gradients on both sides of the LS, determining the orientations of dipole temperature and salinity structures within eddies.

TI  - Axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer: Quantitative Evaluation at Dual-Energy CT
T2  - RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of quantitative parameters derived from dual-energy CT for the preoperative diagnosis of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in participants with breast cancer.Materials and Methods: For this prospective study, dual-phase contrast agent-enhanced CT was performed in female participants with breast cancer from June 2015 to December 2017. Quantitative dual-energy CT parameters and morphologic parameters were compared between metastatic and nonmetastatic SLNs. The quantitative parameters were fitted to univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The diagnostic role of morphologic and quantitative parameters was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves and compared by using the McNemar test.Results: This study included 193 female participants (mean age, 47.6 years +/- 10.1; age range, 22-79 years). Quantitative dual-energy CT parameters including slope of the spectral Hounsfield unit curve (lambda(Hu)) measured at both arterial and venous phases, normalized iodine concentration at both arterial and venous phase, and normalized effective atomic number at the venous phase were higher in metastatic than in nonmetastatic SLNs (P value range, <= .001 to .031). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that venous phase lambda(Hu) (in Hounsfield units per kiloelectron-volt) was the best single parameter for the detection of metastatic SLNs. The accuracy of the venous phase lambda(Hu) for detecting metastatic SLNs was 90.5% on a per-lymph node basis and 87.0% on a per-patient basis. The accuracy and specificity at venous phase lambda(Hu) was higher than their counterparts in the morphologic parameters (P < .001).Conclusion: Dual-energy CT is a complementary means for the preoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes metastases in participants with breast cancer.

TI  - Using NDVI time series to diagnose vegetation recovery after major earthquake based on dynamic time warping and lower bound distance
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Major earthquake occurred in mountainous areas usually cause large number of landslides that lead to severe impact to local vegetation cover and growth. The negative influence to vegetation may last for many year and vegetation recovery may experience dynamic fluctuation. Existing methods for vegetation recovery diagnosis face difficulty in capturing the dynamic behaviours both within and between years that makes the interannual comparison impossible. This paper proposes a new method to diagnose regional vegetation recovery after a major earthquake by defining a difference measurement index (DMI) using MODIS NDVI time series at 8-day interval. This differs from many existing methods in its quantification of the difference between the studied time series and historical samples, by using a proposed algorithm consisting of lower bound distance and dynamic time warping. This algorithm can better differentiate vegetation disturbance from its natural fluctuation. Second, the method investigates relatively regional vegetation recovery via a dynamic index, the DMI. Vegetation conditions in different years can be compared with a historical benchmark and measured by DMI. This makes it possible to diagnose dynamic vegetation recovery and generate a series of interannual spatial distributions of regional vegetation state.

TI  - Retrieval of the Fine-Mode Aerosol Optical Depth over East China Using a Grouped Residual Error Sorting (GRES) Method from Multi-Angle and Polarized Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD(f)) is an important parameter for the environment and climate change study, which mainly represents the anthropogenic aerosols component. The Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) instrument can detect polarized signal from multi-angle observation and the polarized signal mainly comes from the radiation contribution of the fine-mode aerosols, which provides an opportunity to obtain AOD(f) directly. However, the currently operational algorithm of Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA) has a poor AOD(f) retrieval accuracy over East China on high aerosol loading days. This study focused on solving this issue and proposed a grouped residual error sorting (GRES) method to determine the optimal aerosol model in AOD(f) retrieval using the traditional look-up table (LUT) approach and then the AOD(f) retrieval accuracy over East China was improved. The comparisons between the GRES retrieved and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based AOD(f) at Beijing, Xianghe, Taihu and Hong_Kong_PolyU sites produced high correlation coefficients (r) of 0.900, 0.933, 0.957 and 0.968, respectively. The comparisons of the GRES retrieved AOD(f) and PARASOL AOD(f) product with those of the AERONET observations produced a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.054 versus 0.104 on high aerosol loading days (AERONET mean AOD(f) at 865 nm = 0.283). An application using the GRES method for total AOD (AOD(t)) retrieval also showed a good expandability for multi-angle aerosol retrieval of this method.

TI  - Estimating temporal changes in soil pH in the black soil region of Northeast China using remote sensing
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil pH is a dominant soil variable because it influences many physical, chemical, and biological soil properties and plant growth processes. This study aimed at identifying the potential for field hyperspectral reflectance, multispectral satellite imagery and environmental variables to predict soil pH changes for croplands in regional areas located in the black soil region of Dehui in Northeast China. First, hyperspectral reflectance was acquired from a small area of Dehui; then, Landsat images with a 30 m resolution were acquired on 10 Oct 2005 and 22 Oct 2016 for the whole study region. This showed the scope for estimating soil pH with remote sensing derived variables both at the field scale and the regional scale for croplands in black soil regions. We selected 18 spectral variables from hyperspectral reflectance, 17 spectral variables from multispectral imagery and 6 environmental variables, respectively, and found relationships between the controlling variables and the measured soil pH values. Subsequently, 7 spectral indicators from hyperspectral reflectance, 7 spectral indicators from multi spectral reflectance and 3 environmental indicators had higher correlations with soil pH among those variables. Finally, we used the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model to build soil pH prediction models for the 7 spectral indicators from hyperspectral reflectance and for the 7 spectral indicators from Landsat image with 3 environmental indicators, then we combined the two models to obtain a soil pH prediction model at the regional scale. The results showed that several thermal reflectance, vegetation indices and environmental variables, including the ratio vegetation index (RVI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), land use, mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature were strong predictors of soil pH distribution at the regional scale. The combined soil pH prediction model had an R-2 of 0.50, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.30 and a residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 1.55, indicating reliable precision and average prediction abilities. We estimated that soil pH values showed obvious heterogeneity over the study region, and soil pH mainly changed with crop type. Our results also suggested that the average decrease in soil pH for most of the study area of was approximately 0.50 units during 2005-2016. This study provides new approaches and knowledge for the better investigation of soil properties at a regional scale by using RS technologies.

TI  - Retrieving the Diurnal FPAR of a Maize Canopy from the Jointing Stage to the Tasseling Stage with Vegetation Indices under Different Water Stresses and Light Conditions
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) is a key variable in the model of vegetation productivity. Vegetation indices (VIs) that were derived from instantaneous remote-sensing data have been successfully used to estimate the FPAR of a day or a longer period. However, it has not yet been verified whether continuous VIs can be used to accurately estimate the diurnal dynamics of a vegetation canopy FPAR, which may fluctuate dramatically within a day. In this study, we measured the high temporal resolution spectral data (480 to 850 nm) and FPAR data of a maize canopy from the jointing stage to the tasseling stage under different irrigation and illumination conditions using two automatic observation systems. To estimate the FPAR, we developed regression models based on a quadratic function using 13 kinds of VIs. The results show the following: (1) Under nondrought conditions, although the illumination condition (sunny or cloudy) influenced the trend of the canopy diurnal FPAR, it had only a slight effect on the model accuracies of the FPAR-VIs. The maximum coefficients of determination (R-2) of the FPAR-VIs models generated for the sunny nondrought data, the cloudy nondrought data, and all of the nondrought data were 0.895, 0.88, and 0.828, respectively. The VIs-including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), red-edge simple ratio (SR705), modified simple ratio 2 (mSR2), red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI705), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI)-that were related to the canopy structure had higher estimation accuracies (R-2 > 0.8) than the other VIs that were related to the soil adjustment, chlorophyll, and physiology. The estimation accuracies of the GNDVI and some red-edge VIs (including NDVI705, SR705, and mSR(2)) were higher than the estimation accuracy of the NDVI. (2) Under drought stress, the FPAR decreased significantly because of leaf wilting and the effective leaf area index decrease around noon. When we included drought data in the model, accuracies were reduced dramatically and the R-2 value of the best model was only 0.59. When we built the regression models based only on drought data, the EVI, which can weaken the influence of soil, had the best estimate accuracy (R-2 = 0.68).

TI  - Mapping Mangrove Forests of Dongzhaigang Nature Reserve in China Using Landsat 8 and Radarsat-2 Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are distributed in intertidal regions that act as a "natural barrier" to the coast. They have enormous ecological, economic, and social value. However, the world's mangrove forests are declining under immense pressure from anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Accurate information regarding mangrove forests is essential for their protection and restoration. The main objective of this study was to develop a method to improve the classification of mangrove forests using C-band quad-pol Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (Radarsat-2) and optical data (Landsat 8), and to analyze the spectral and backscattering signatures of mangrove forests. We used a support vector machine (SVM) classification method to classify the land use in Hainan Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve (HDNNR). The results showed that the overall accuracy using only optical information was 83.5%. Classification accuracy was improved to a varying extent by the addition of different radar data. The highest overall accuracy was 95.0% based on a combination of SAR and optical data. The area of mangrove forest in the reserve was found to be 1981.7 ha, as determined from the group with the highest classification accuracy. Combining optical data with SAR data could improve the classification accuracy and be significant for mangrove forest conservation.

TI  - Did the ecological engineering have a great impact on the land use change?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Overuse of land resources has increasingly contributed to environmental crises in China. To mitigate widespread land degradation, actions have been taken to maintain and restore the ecological environment through efforts such as ecological engineering. By analyzing trends in land use, the impact and effectiveness of ecological engineering can be determined. In this study, such changes in Huanjiang County in China were considered. In the early 1990s, an eco-immigration policy and returning farmland to forest program were implemented in the county, drastically impacting land use. Land use/land cover changes were detected and analyzed using remote sensing data recorded over 4years (1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010). Land transfer flow and the rate of land use change elucidated the extent of changes, while nuclear density analysis indicated spatial agglomeration. The results indicate that, over a period of 15years, farmland area increased, while forest area decreased initially before subsequently increasing. From 1995 to 2000, the highest transfer flow was observed in the grassland to farmland conversion (79.34%). From 2000 to 2005, the transfer flow of conversions was the highest for forest to farmland (56.79%). Land use changes were not prominent from 2005 to 2010. Direct drivers of land use change exert obvious impacts on land use, and indirect drivers impact direct drivers that are then channeled through direct anthropogenic drivers (e.g., land use policies). We found that ecological engineering has a very significant impact on land use change, and that impact varies from region to region.

TI  - Positive non-sentinel axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer with 1-2 sentinel lymph node metastases
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent clinical trials have shown that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can offer excellent regional control if there is sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) metastases to 1-2 nodes. This study aimed to explore the predictive factors for non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis in breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLNs.Patients with breast cancer and 1-2 positive SLN admitted between March 2009 and March 2017 and who underwent ALND after SLN biopsy (SLNB) at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Factors influencing the status of NSLN were studied by univariate and multivariate analysis.Of 1125 patients, 147 patients had SLN metastasis (13.1%) and 119 patients (81.0%) had 1-2 positive SLNs. Among them, 42 patients (35.3%) had NSLN metastasis. The invasive tumor size (P<.001), histological grade (P=.011), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (P=.006), and over-expression of HER2 (P=.025) significantly correlated with non-SLN metastasis by univariate analysis. LVI (LVI) (P=.007; OR: 4.130; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.465-11.641), invasive tumor size (P<.001; OR: 7.176; 95% CI: 2.710-19.002), and HER2 over-expression (P=.006; OR: 5.489; 95% CI: 1.635-18.428) were independently associated with NSLN metastasis by the Logistic regression model. The ROC analysis identified a cut-off point of 26mm of tumor size (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC] 0.712, CI: 0.614-0.811) was useful for dividing patients with positive SLN (1-2 nodes) into non-SLN-positive and non-SLN-negative groups.For 1-2 positive SLNs of breast cancer, LVI, large invasive tumor size, and HER2 over-expression are independent factors affecting NSLN metastases.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of Tiangong-2 MWI Visible/NIR Channels over Aquatic Environments using MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate-Resolution Wide-Wavelength Imager (MWI), onboard the Tiangong-2 (TG-2) Space Lab, is an experimental satellite sensor designed for the next-generation Chinese ocean color satellites. The MWI imagery is not sufficiently radiometrically calibrated, and therefore, the cross-calibration is urgently needed to provide high quality ocean color products for MWI observations. We proposed a simple and effective cross-calibration scheme for MWI data using well calibrated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery over aquatic environments. The path radiance of the MWI was estimated using the quasi-synchronized MODIS images as well as the MODIS Rayleigh and aerosol look up tables (LUTs) from SeaWiFS Data Analysis System 7.4 (SeaDAS 7.4). The results showed that the coefficients of determination (R-2) of the calibration coefficients were larger than 0.97, with sufficient matched areas to perform cross-calibration for MWI. Compared with the simulated Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance using synchronized MODIS images, all errors calculated with the calibration coefficients retrieved in this paper were less than 5.2%, and lower than the lab calibrated coefficients. The Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (rho(rc)), remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and total suspended matter (TSM) products of MWI, MODIS and the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) images for Taihu Lake in China were compared. The distribution of rho(rc) of MWI, MODIS and GOCI agreed well, except for band 667 nm of MODIS, which might have been saturated in relatively turbid waters. Besides, the R-rs used to retrieve TSM among MWI, MODIS and GOCI was also consistent. The root mean square errors (RMSE), mean biases (MB) and mean ratios (MR) between MWI R-rs and MODIS R-rs (or GOCI R-rs) were less than 0.20 sr(-1), 5.52% and within 1 +/- 0.023, respectively. In addition, the derived TSM from MWI and GOCI also agreed with a R-2 of 0.90, MB of 13.75%, MR of 0.97 and RMSE of 9.43 mg/L. Cross-calibration coefficients retrieved in this paper will contribute to quantitative applications of MWI. This method can be extended easily to other similar ocean color satellite missions.

TI  - Change Detection in Coral Reef Environment Using High-Resolution Images: Comparison of Object-Based and Pixel-Based Paradigms
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increases in the spatial resolution of satellite imagery prompting interest in object-based image analysis, few studies have used object-based methods for monitoring changes in coral reefs. This study proposes a high accuracy object-based change detection (OBCD) method intended for coral reef environment, which uses QuickBird and WorldView-2 images. The proposed methodological framework includes image fusion, multi-temporal image segmentation, image differencing, random forests models, and object-area-based accuracy assessment. For validation, we applied the method to images of four coral reef study sites in the South China Sea. We compared the proposed OBCD method with a conventional pixel-based change detection (PBCD) method by implementing both methods under the same conditions. The average overall accuracy of OBCD exceeded 90%, which was approximately 20% higher than PBCD. The OBCD method was free from salt-and-pepper effects and was less prone to images misregistration in terms of change detection accuracy and mapping results. The object-area-based accuracy assessment reached a higher overall accuracy and per-class accuracy than the object-number-based and pixel-number-based accuracy assessment.

TI  - Detection of Building and Infrastructure Instabilities by Automatic Spatiotemporal Analysis of Satellite SAR Interferometry Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) is a powerful technology to monitor slow ground surface movements. However, the extraction and interpretation of information from big sets of InSAR measurements is a complex and demanding task. In this paper, a new method is presented for automatically detecting potential instability risks affecting buildings and infrastructures, by searching for anomalies in the persistent scatterer (PS) deformations, either in the spatial or in the temporal dimensions. In the spatial dimension, in order to reduce the dataset size and improve data reliability, we utilize a hierarchical clustering method to obtain convergence points that are more trustworthy. Then, we detect deformations characterized by large values and spatial inhomogeneity. In the temporal dimension, we use a signal processing method to decompose the input into two main components: regular periodic deformations and piecewise linear deformations. After removing the periodic component, the velocity variation in each identified temporal partition is analyzed to detect anomalous velocity trends and accelerations. The method has been tested on different sites in China, based on InSAR measurements from COSMO-SkyMed data. The results, verified with in-field surveys, confirm the potential of the method for the automatic detection of deformation anomalies that could cause building or infrastructure stability problems.

TI  - Small-Scale and Mesoscale Variabilities in the Electric Field and Particle Percipitation and Their Impacts on Joule Heating
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the electric field and the particle precipitation at different spatial scale sizes have been investigated by utilizing the Dynamic Explorer 2 satellite data set, focusing on conditions of moderately strong southward interplanetary magnetic field. Dynamic Explorer 2 data from the period between 1981 and 1983, from all universal times, seasons, and both hemispheres, have been processed and binned over geomagnetic latitude and local time. It is found that, as compared with the large-scale (>500 km) average electric field and particle precipitation, the variabilities (i.e., departures from the large-scale average) of electric field and particle precipitation are not negligible. Moreover, the electric field variability tends to be anticorrelated with the particle precipitation variability in the auroral regions on small scale and mesoscale (<500 km). The impacts associated with the small-scale and mesoscale electric field and particle precipitation variabilities on Joule heating have also been addressed in this study by using the Global Ionosphere and Thermosphere Model. It is found that although Joule heating can be significantly enhanced by the small-scale and mesoscale electric field variabilities (similar to 27% globally), the corresponding change in the particle precipitation tends to depress such enhancement (-5% globally), which is not negligible on the dusk side (up to -17.5% locally). It is the first time that the correlation between electric field and particle precipitation variabilities on small scale and mesoscale has been quantified. Furthermore, the impact on Joule heating associated with the correlation between the small-scale and mesoscale electric field and particle precipitation variabilities has been evaluated unprecedentedly in a general circulation model.

TI  - Underestimates of Grassland Gross Primary Production in MODIS Standard Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the biggest carbon flux of terrestrial ecosystems from photosynthesis, gross primary productivity (GPP) is an important indicator in understanding the carbon cycle and biogeochemical process of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite advances in remote sensing-based GPP modeling, spatial and temporal variations of GPP are still uncertain especially under extreme climate conditions such as droughts. As the only official products of global spatially explicit GPP, MOD17A2H (GPP(MOD)) has been widely used to assess the variations of carbon uptake of terrestrial ecosystems. However, systematic assessment of its performance has rarely been conducted especially for the grassland ecosystems where inter-annual variability is high. Based on a collection of GPP datasets (GPP(EC)) from a global network of eddy covariance towers (FluxNet), we compared GPP(MOD) and GPP(EC) at all FluxNet grassland sites with more than five years of observations. We evaluated the performance and robustness of GPP(MOD) in different grassland biomes (tropical, temperate, and alpine) by using a bootstrapping method for calculating 95% confident intervals (CI) for the linear regression slope, coefficients of determination (R-2), and root mean square errors (RMSE). We found that GPP(MOD) generally underestimated GPP by about 34% across all biomes despite a significant relationship (R-2 = 0.66 (CI, 0.63-0.69), RMSE = 2.46 (2.33-2.58) g Cm-2 day(-1)) for the three grassland biomes. GPP(MOD) had varied performances with R-2 values of 0.72 (0.68-0.75) (temperate), 0.64 (0.59-0.68) (alpine), and 0.40 (0.27-0.52) (tropical). Thus, GPP(MOD) performed better in low GPP situations (e.g., temperate grassland type), which further indicated that GPP(MOD) underestimated GPP. The underestimation of GPP could be partly attributed to the biased maximum light use efficiency (epsilon(max)) values of different grassland biomes. The uncertainty of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and the water scalar based on the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) could have other reasons for the underestimation. Therefore, more accurate estimates of GPP for different grassland biomes should consider improvements in epsilon(max), FPAR, and the VPD scalar. Our results suggest that the community should be cautious when using MODIS GPP products to examine spatial and temporal variations of carbon fluxes.

TI  - Locally Oriented Scene Complexity Analysis Real-Time Ocean Ship Detection from Optical Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to strong ocean waves, broken clouds, and extensive cloud cover interferences, ocean ship detection performs poorly when using optical remote sensing images. In addition, it is a challenge to detect small ships on medium resolution optical remote sensing that cover a large area. In this paper, in order to balance the requirements of real-time processing and high accuracy detection, we proposed a novel ship detection framework based on locally oriented scene complexity analysis. First, the proposed method can separate a full image into two types of local scenes (i.e., simple or complex local scenes). Next, simple local scenes would utilize the fast saliency model (FSM) to rapidly complete candidate extraction, and for complex local scenes, the ship feature clustering model (SFCM) will be applied to achieve refined detection against severe background interferences. The FSM considers a fusion enhancement image as an input of the pulse response analysis in the frequency domain to achieve rapid ship detection in simple local scenes. Next, the SFCM builds the descriptive model of the ship feature clustering algorithm to ensure the detection performance on complex local scenes. Extensive experiments on SPOT-5 and GF-2 ocean optical remote sensing images show that the proposed ship detection framework has better performance than the state-of-the-art methods, and it addresses the tricky problem of real-time ocean ship detection under strong waves, broken clouds, extensive cloud cover, and ship fleet interferences. Finally, the proposed ocean ship detection framework is demonstrated on an onboard processing hardware.

TI  - Application of UAV BVLOS remote sensing data for multi-faceted analysis of Antarctic ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A photogrammetric flight was performed in December 2016 as BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) operation over Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands, Western Antarctica). Images were taken by the PW-ZOOM fixed wing UAV equipped with a digital SLR Canon 700D camera. The flight was performed at 550 m ASL and covered a total distance of 231.58 km. The plane take-off and landing site was near the H. Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station (Arctowski) on King George Island, South Shetlands. The main aim of the mission was to collect environmental data to estimate the size of penguin and pinniped breeding populations and to map vegetation cover and landforms. The plane returned to Arctowski with 1630 images of Penguin Island with the ground sample distance (GSD) lower than 0.07 m. The analysis of developed ortophoto allowed us to locate and identify individuals of two penguin species (Adelie and chinstrap), and individuals of two species of pinnipeds (Southern elephant seal and Weddell seal). Three types of tundra communities were mapped together with numerous landforms such as: volcanic, mass movement, fluvial, coastal and aeolian ones. The UAV BVLOS photogrammetric operation proved to be very robust in gathering valuable qualitative and quantitative data necessary for monitoring distant and isolated polar environments.

TI  - The Advantages of Landsat 8-OLI-Derived Suspended Particulate Matter Maps for Monitoring the Subtidal Extension of Amazonian Coastal Mud Banks (French Guiana)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coast of French Guiana is characterised by the northwestward migration of large mud banks alongshore and by high concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) resulting from the strong influence of the Amazon River outflow. Surface OLI SPM concentration, linked to the footprint of the subtidal part of mud banks due to resuspension and migration processes, was used to develop a method to estimate the location of this footprint. A comparison of the results from this method with those obtained by locating the limit of the wave damping, which characterises muddy coasts, revealed good performance of the method based on recurring SPM values. The migration rates of the mud banks in French Guiana were calculated according to the delimitation of their subtidal parts, and showed slightly higher values (2.31 km/year) than suggested by earlier studies. In comparison with other methods, the migration rate estimated using the method proposed within the framework of this study takes into account the variability of the shape of the subtidal part for the first time. It was also shown that the mud banks existing on the coastal area of French Guiana present two different shapes. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantage of ocean colour data to describe mud banks according to their subtidal part, delimited using the assessment of SPM temporal variability.

TI  - Determining the Mechanisms that Influence the Surface Temperature of Urban Forest Canopies by Combining Remote Sensing Methods, Ground Observations, and Spatial Statistical Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distribution pattern of the surface temperatures of urban forest canopies (STUFC) is influenced by many environmental factors, and the identification of interactions between these factors can improve simulations and predictions of spatial patterns of urban cool islands. This quantitative research uses an integrated method that combines remote sensing, ground surveys, and spatial statistical models to elucidate the mechanisms that influence the STUFC and considers the interaction of multiple environmental factors. This case study uses Jinjiang, China as a representative of a city experiencing rapid urbanization. We build up a multisource database (forest inventory, digital elevation models, population, and remote sensing imagery) on a uniform coordinate system to support research into the interactions that influence the STUFC. Landsat-5/8 Thermal Mapper images and meteorological data were used to retrieve the temporal and spatial distributions of land surface temperature. Ground observations, which included the forest management planning inventory and population density data, provided the factors that determine the STUFC spatial distribution on an urban scale. The use of a spatial statistical model (GeogDetector model) reveals the interaction mechanisms of STUFC. Although different environmental factors exert different influences on STUFC, in two periods with different hot spots and cold spots, the patch area and dominant tree species proved to be the main factors contributing to STUFC. The interaction between multiple environmental factors increased the STUFC, both linearly and nonlinearly. Strong interactions tended to occur between elevation and dominant species and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots in different years. In conclusion, the combining of multidisciplinary methods (e.g., remote sensing images, ground observations, and spatial statistical models) helps reveal the mechanism of STUFC on an urban scale.

TI  - "HIERARCHICAL" PATTERNS OF MEANING IN COMMUNICATION REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY: A MULTIMODAL PERSPECTIVE
T2  - REVISTA SAN GREGORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is inspired by the idea of the Russian philosopher and orientalist A.V. Smirnov about the need to distinguish between two fundamental orientations of human thinking: the procedural and the substantial logics. The concept of a "picture of the world", which is basic in the theory of A.V. Smirnov, is based on the intuition inherent in people that the world, with all its diversity, behaves in a certain stable way, and has an intrinsic coherence. A.V. Smirnov relies on the methods of philosophical and historical Islamic world view, and also on linguistic analysis of grammatical forms of the Arabic language. The concept of "action" in procedural logic is a fundamental category. The paper implements an attempt to apply his ideas to conduct a specific socio-psychological study of the world's picture of contemporary Muslims. At the beginning of the paper a summary of his main ideas reflected in his two works, is given. In the future, the way of transferring his analytical scheme from the level of philosophical abstraction to the level of analysis of the individual and social (group) phenomenon is determined on the basis of the theory of social constructionism by K. Dzherdzhen, the theory of frames by G. Beitson, I. Hoffman. The last part of the paper highlights and describes the "hierarchical" patterns of reframing, derived from the study of Muslim communication using qualitative methods and a multimodal approach.

TI  - Toward Landsat and Sentinel-2 BRDF Normalization and Albedo Estimation: A Case Study in the Peruvian Amazon Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon forest has been the focus of study by the science community during the last few decades. Remote sensing data analysis is the only way to study such a large geographical extent during an extended period of time. Since the launch in 2015 of Sentinel 2 and its increase in temporal resolution through the combination with Landsat sensors, a strong emphasis has been put on exploiting these data. Though these satellites provide near nadir observations, surface reflectance time series are affected by illumination variability throughout the year. These effects can be corrected using a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. Franch et al. (2014a) developed a methodology to derive Landsat surface albedo and BRDF. It is based on the BRDF parameters from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) which are disaggregated at Landsat spatial resolution (30 m). In this work, we apply the Franch et al. (2014a) method to normalize the surface reflectance for BRDF effects using the NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product. We apply this method to the Tambopata region in Peru from 2013 to 2017 and validate it using ground-based albedometer measurements. The results show that the near infrared reflectance can increase up to 0.06 (20%) for low solar angles while the impact on the red range and the NDVI is minor (<0.01). The evaluation of the surface albedo against field measurements shows an error of 0.01.

AB  - Mangroves are valuable ecosystems for coastal protection, carbon sequestration and storage, and they provide habitat, refuge and rearing areas for many important marine species. To control mosquito outbreaks in coastal regions, mangroves were often impounded and managed using a variety of techniques that ranged from the application of insecticides to water level manipulation. Since continuous impounding had been shown to have negative effects on mangrove vegetation, other techniques have been used to manage hydrology in impoundments. A recent technique is called rotational impoundment management (RIM) and it involves flooding impoundments in summer and spring, the reproductive season of the mosquitos. In this study, we assessed the effects of 5 years of RIM management on mangrove vegetation in an impoundment on the east coast of Florida. We compared mangrove vegetation in the RIM impoundment with an adjacent impoundment that was not managed. We created a map of leaf area index (LAI) to assess vegetation productivity and its change in the two impoundments. We classified color-infrared aerial photographs from 2008 to 2010 and a WorldView-2 satellite image from 2014 to measure the extent of mangrove vegetation types and temporal changes in the two impoundments. We found a 38% increase in cover of dense mangrove vegetation after five years for the RIM impounded area. Classification accuracy was around 80% for all imagery. The increased growth of plants and cover of dense mangroves in the RIM impoundment was corroborated by observed leaf area index values. Overall, the study demonstrates that vegetation in the RIM impoundment is becoming denser and in the near future will probably become similar to an impoundment that is open to tidal exchange or mangrove dominated areas that are not impounded.

TI  - Temporal-angular fusion of MODIS and MISR images via sparse representation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the complementarity of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) images on temporal and angular resolutions, we propose a fusion method to generate frequent time series MISR images. Thereby, the fusion results can give full play to their respective advantages in the inversion of surface or atmospheric parameters. Based on sparse representation, the proposed method includes two stages: the spectral dictionary-pair training stage and the MISR image prediction stage. In the training stage, we establish a corresponding relationship between the basic MODIS and MISR representation atoms in the spectral domain by learning a dictionary pair from the prior image pairs. In the prediction stage, the MISR images are predicted from the corresponding MODIS images via sparse coding. Experimental results on Baltimore-Washington, DC metropolitan area demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with approximately 7% prediction errors.

TI  - Complete genome sequence of <i>Bacillus velezensis Z</i>Y-1-1 reveals the genetic basis for its hemicellulosic/cellulosic substrate-inducible xylanase and cellulase activities
T2  - 3 BIOTECH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacillus velezensis ZY-1-1 was isolated from the larval gut of the lignocellulose-rich diet-fed scarab beetle, Holotrichia parallela, and confirmed to possess extremely high xylanase (48153.8 +/- 412.1U/L) and relatively moderate cellulase activity (610.1 +/- 8.2U/L). Notably, these xylanase and cellulase activities were enhanced by xylan (1.4 and 5.8-fold, respectively) and cellulose (1.1 and 3.5-fold, respectively), which indicated the hemicellulosic/cellulosic substrate-inducible lignocellulolytic activities of this strain. The complete genome of B. velezensis ZY-1-1 comprises of 3,899,251bp in a circular chromosome with a G+C content of 46.6%. Among the predicted 3688 protein-coding genes, 24 genes are involved in the degradation of lignocellulose and other polysaccharides, including 8, 7 and 2 critical genes for the degradation of xylan, cellulose and lignin, respectively. This genome-based analysis will facilitate our understanding of the mechanism underlying the biodegradation of lignocellulose and the biotechnological application of this novel lignocellulolytic bacteria or related enzymes.

TI  - Using the modified two-mode method to identify surface water in Gaofen-1 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid, accurate, and automated extraction of surface water is highly important for conducting reliable and necessary surface water monitoring endeavors. Classification methods commonly exhibit high precision but also have a low degree of automation or narrow scope of application; commonly used water index methods are highly efficient, but they easily mistake other targets with similar spectral characteristics for surface water. Simultaneously achieving precision, efficiency, and automation within a single method is a challenge. To address these problems, we simplify the normalized different water index (NDWI) to a band ratio index and traverse the neighborhood of the extreme in the histogram to determine two peaks and one trough between the peaks in the two-mode method, and we then compare the middle value of the two peaks with the value of the trough to confirm the threshold of the surface water. We use the modified two-mode method to extract Poyang Lake from four Chinese Gaofen (GF)-1 remote sensing images corresponding to different seasons, and then compare the results with those obtained by the NDWI index and the maximization of interclass variance (OTSU) method. The comparison shows that our method has higher and more stable accuracy, especially during the drought period for Poyang Lake. However, polluted water, narrow rivers, bridges, and residential areas along the lake are sometimes mistakenly extracted. Finally, the advantages and prospects of the proposed method are discussed.

TI  - From Picture to Movie: Twenty Years of Ground Deformation Recording Over Tuscany Region (Italy) With Satellite InSAR
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) techniques have been long exploited for detecting and mapping slow-moving ground surface displacements due to their millimeter accuracy, non-invasiveness and wide area coverage. A review on different applications of Persistent Scatterers InSAR approaches, proposed and applied over Tuscany region (Italy) across time, is here presented. The study area is characterized by both subsidence of alluvial plains and landslides on hilly and mountainous reliefs. Tuscany has a leading role in Italy in the field of interferometric applications: the first InSAR analyses, which date back to 2003, were performed at local basin scale, by exploiting various PSI-based approaches for risk mapping. The first InSAR applications at regional scale date back to 2009, relying on historical SAR archives of ERS and ENVISAT satellites for updating subsidence and landslide inventory maps at a certain temporal date. Nowadays, the availability of Sentinel-1 SAR data with a regular and systematic 6-days acquisitions plan, allows near-real time monitoring of deformative scenario at regional scale rather than solely mapping of geo-hydrological phenomena. Most recent innovative InSAR applications over Tuscany region scan the territory, exploiting the regular repeat pass of Sentinel-1, and promptly highlight the sites affected by the highest ground movements with high temporal frequency. Such approaches permit us to pass from a static 'picture' of regional slope instability to a weekly updated 'movie' with improved detail, useful for civil protection practices. These last ongoing works significantly enhance the value of multi-temporal InSAR approaches for investigating and managing geo-hazards over the Region.

TI  - Variations of the effective elastic thickness reveal tectonic fragmentation of the Antarctic lithosphere
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To this day, little is known about thermal and Theological properties of the Antarctic lithosphere. We derive the effective elastic thickness T-e as a proxy for these parameters by using ice thickness, bedrock topography and a combination of new satellite and high resolution terrestrial gravity data. Cross-spectral analysis based on the fan wavelet technique was employed to calculate T-e variations by means of admittance and coherence techniques. Our results confirm a clear tectonic division of Antarctica with predominantly high values in East Antarctica (EANT) (T-e similar to 60-80 km) and low values in West Antarctica (WANT) (T-e similar to 5-20 km). For the Transantarctic Mountains separating these provinces, we found T-e to be around 10 km along the whole chain which is comparable to WANT. Apart from this general division, we found fragmentation of the lithosphere within these provinces. Especially EANT doesn't represent a single lithospheric block but shows strong variations of T-e. The highest values are found around the Aurora Subglacial Basin (T-e similar to 90 km) and in Dronning Maud Land (T-e similar to 80 km). The minimum value of T-e within EANT (similar to 15 km) is found in the Lambert Graben. Such a low value can be associated with active rifting in the Permian-Triassic, strong localized erosion or possibly the effect of a Cenozoic mantle plume. According to the coherence calculations, the weak zone extends to the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM), showing a distinct decrease of T-e to 25-30 km. Thus, this weak channel divides the previously mentioned strong blocks. However, the admittance analysis gives relatively high values (T-e similar to 70 km) for the GSM. Based on the analysis of the wavelength-dependent admittance and coherence results and misfits for several principal locations, we give some preference to the coherence based values.

TI  - Determination of maize water requirement using remote sensing data and SEBAL algorithm
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient agricultural water demand management in arid and semi-arid regions is key in continuing crop production in a changing climate. As such, there's a need for further investigation on various crops to identify the optimum water requirements to avoid water wasting in regions that are already facing water shortage. The focus of this work is to determine water requirement maize farming Mazandaran Province in Northern Iran, located on the southern side of the Caspian Sea, using Landsat satellite data. In order to use SEBAL algorithm, the images were atmospheric calibrated. Evapotranspiration maps with RMSE values equals to 0.73, 1.38 and 0.74 mm/day were produced and compared to Reference Book (RB), National Water Document (NWD) and FAO56 values. Furthermore, by computing reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficient curve was evaluated. In order to prepare maize water requirement maps, ETO in 58 weather stations throughout the province were computed and interpolated. By using the daily ETO maps and resulted Kc values, maize water requirement maps for the cultivated area of the province were 345.16-383.99 mm. The maize water requirement in the observation station of Sari compared to RB and NWD values showed - %20 and + %41 differences and RMSE was 76 and 156 mm, respectively.

TI  - Leveraging Remote-Sensing Data to Assess Garage Door Damage and Associated Roof Damage
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Garage doors or roll-up doors on residential and commercial structures are vulnerable components that are often damaged in windstorms. Failures of these large openings can lead to internal pressurization, which can cause additional structural damage to roofs and walls. This study utilized high spatial resolution oblique remote-sensing data to assess the condition of garage doors and roof structure damage on residential structures following two tornadoes and one hurricane. The performance of the garage doors was evaluated to determine any dependence on the size of the door and orientation to the wind, as well as estimated wind speed. The study found higher failure rates of garage doors in the hurricane event than the tornadoes, but roof structural damage was more common following a garage door failure in a tornado. Additionally, roof structural damage was uncommon for buildings where the garage door remained intact, regardless of event type.

TI  - Downscaling of American National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) daily air temperature in Sicily, Italy, and effects on crop reference evapotranspiration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (T-a) is one of the key factors in agro-hydrological studies including estimation of crop reference evapotranspiration (ET0), which is crucial for irrigation water management and sustainability of agro-ecosystem productivity. Because direct measurements of ET0 are difficult, expensive and time consuming, the use of physically based or empirical approaches linked to meteorological information is often preferred. The Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource project developed by the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration (POWER-NASA) provides daily meteorological information on a 1 degrees latitude by 1 degrees longitude grid. Despite the poor spatial resolution characterizing this archive, the data is global and continuous in time, so that it can be used in particular regions of the globe where weather measurements are not well spatially distributed and/or there are some missing weather data to fill.Procedures for downscaling and spatial disaggregation of daily air temperatures retrieved from the POWER. NASA archive were proposed and validated for the climate of Sicily, Italy. In particular, a cosine function with three empirical parameters derived from ground elevation was suggested to estimate the spatial and temporal variability of a lapse rate adjustment factor used to downscale and to disaggregate POWER-NASA air temperature. Model calibration was carried out over three years (2006-2008), whilst validation regarded the measurements acquired over the following six years (2009-2014). Downscaled daily air temperature results were consistent and comparable with local ground measurements. The spatial disaggregation technique, aimed to map the distributions of T-a, was then tested by the joint use of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the proposed model. Finally, in order to assess the suitability of downscaled air temperatures, two simplified empirical equations to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from air temperature and solar radiation (Turc, 1961; Hargreaves, 1975) were applied. To this aim, daily ET0 estimated by introducing native and downscaled POWER-NASA air temperature values into Turc and Hargreaves equations were compared to the corresponding estimations obtained with FAO 56 Penman Monteith (FAO 56 PM) equation and climate data measured on ground.

TI  - Differences in ecosystem water-use efficiency among the typical croplands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important parameter to assess agricultural production and the reasonable utilization of water resources. Especially in the context of changing hydrological environment, more attention need to be paid on how to use limited water resource to improve crop yield for ensuring food security. Based on 33 site-years of flux measurements over 10 cropland sites using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, the study systematically evaluated the large differences in seasonal and interannual variations of gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and ecosystem WUE across the four crops worldwide including soybean, maize, winter wheat and paddy rice. The lengths of the growing seasons across the main crops extracted from time-series MODIS NDVI data, implied that the longest growth period in winter wheat and the shortest growing season in paddy rice field. Further analyses suggest that maize cropland has the strongest ecosystem WUE with 2.48 +/- 0.69 g C kg(-1) H2O, followed by winter wheat (2.00 +/- 0.39 g C kg(-1) H2O), soybean (1.92 +/- 0.52 g C kg(-1) H2O), and paddy rice (1.88 +/- 0.63 g C kg(-1) H2O). Meanwhile, the variability in ecosystem WUE exhibited apparent seasonality, and peaked together with GPP in the most active summertime. A series of biotic and abiotic factors affected the GPP as well as WUE variability. Given the complicated interactions among these environmental factors, this study revealed the great potential to remotely retrieve the WUE variability using time-series MODIS NDVI data over large areas. Ecosystem WUE of the C-4 crop -maize was obviously higher than the other three C-3 crops. Engineering C-4 feature into C-3 crops may be a feasible way to increase photosynthesis and yield.

TI  - Evaluating water-saving efficiency of plastic mulching in Northwest China using remote sensing and SEBAL
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic mulching of agricultural land surfaces has been widely used to cope with growing water shortage, but little research has been done in evaluating its water-saving efficiency at large catchment scale. We evaluate the effectiveness of water use in plastic mulching in a large catchment in Northwest China using remote sensing data and the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). We use a decision-tree method to delineate the plastic mulching lands (PML) from other croplands (NPML) based on land surface albedo and temperature derived from Landsat images. We use SEBAL and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) and the water use in PML and NPML. Our study shows that ET from the PML reduced about 6.6% compared with NPML, and the area of PML increased about 84.2% during the 14-year period of 2000-2013 in the catchment. However, the total water use in the area still increased 50.0% as the total cropland area increased about 48.6% in the same period. Our study therefore suggests that the best water management strategy in arid China needs not only to increase water use efficiency but also to control total water usage by limiting reclamation of farmlands.

M3  - Article
AB  - The SummaryFRAX scores were significantly higher in patients admitted with fragility fractures than controls and can be useful in choosing the right patients for bone density testing, thus using of an expensive test judiciously.PurposeThis study was planned to compare the FRAX scores for the risk for major osteoporotic fracture (FRAX-MOF) and hip fracture (FRAX-HF) in patients with fragility fractures (cases) and those admitted for other indications (controls) in the orthopedic ward in our institute.MethodsHistorical and anthropometric data were prospectively recorded from 500 consecutive patients admitted in the orthopedic ward in in Medanta, the Medicity, Gurgaon, India. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for FRAX-MOF and FRAX-HF and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated between cases and controls.ResultsThe FRAX-MOF was significantly high in cases as compared to controls (7.344.41 versus 5.64 +/- 4.3; p=0.001). The FRAX-HF was also significantly high in cases as compared to controls (2.95 +/- 3.13 versus 1.67 +/- 2.21; p<0.001). The areas under the curves were 0.627 for FRAX-MOF and 0.654 for FRAX-HF. For FRAX-MOF, a cutoff of 2 has a 90% sensitivity, but only 15% specificity; whereas a cutoff of 10.5 had a specificity of 90% to differentiate those with and without fractures, but only 23% sensitivity. For FRAX-HF, a cutoff 0.3 had about 90% sensitivity and 20% specificity, whereas a cutoff of 3.5 had 90% specificity and 25% specificity to differentiate cases and controls.Conclusions This study compared the FRAX-MOF and FRAX-HF in patients with and without fragility fractures and derived cutoffs for practical clinical use of FRAX-MOF and FRAX-HF to optimize the use of DXA-BMD.

TI  - Approach for identifying optically shallow pixels when processing ocean-color imagery
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean-color remote sensing is routinely used to derive marine geophysical parameters from sensor-observed spectral water-leaving radiances. However, in clear geometrically shallow regions, traditional ocean-color algorithms can be confounded by light reflected from the seafloor. Such regions are typically referred to as "optically shallow". When performing spatiotemporal analyses of ocean color datasets, optically shallow features such as submerged sand banks and coral reefs can lead to unexpected regional biases. Most contemporary approaches mask or flag suspected optically shallow pixels based on ancillary bathymetric data. However, the extent to which seafloor reflectance contaminates the water-leaving radiance is dependent on bathymetry, water clarity and seafloor albedo. In this paper, an approach for flagging optically shallow pixels has been developed that considers all three of these variables. In the method, the optical depth of the water column at 547 nrn, zeta(547), is predicted from bathymetric data and estimated water-column optical properties. If zeta(547) is less then the pm-defined threshold, a pixel is flagged as potentially optically shallow. Radiative transfer modeling was used to identify a conservative threshold value of zeta(547) = 20 for a bright sand seafloor. In addition, pixels in waters shallower than 5 in are also flagged. We also examined how varying bathymetric datasets may affect the optically shallow flag using MODIS data. It is anticipated that the optically shallow flag will benefit end-users when quality controlling derived ocean color products. Further, the flag may prove useful as a mechanism for switching between optically deep and shallow algorithms during ocean color processing.

TI  - Vaccine safety surveillance in pregnancy in low- and middle-income countries using GAIA case definitions: A feasibility assessment
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Global efforts to adequately monitor safety of new vaccines for pregnant women in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are needed. The Global Alignment of Immunization Safety Assessment in pregnancy (GAIA) project recently published case definitions based on levels of diagnostic certainty for pregnancy- and neonatal outcomes and maternal vaccination. As a preliminary step to assessing the applicability of these definitions in LMICs, WHO selected sites and conducted a feasibility assessment to evaluate their ability to identify and classify selected outcomes (preterm birth, neonatal death, neonatal invasive bloodstream infection (NI-BSI), stillbirth) and maternal vaccination.Methods: Candidate sites were initially screened using a questionnaire. For each outcome, eligible sites were asked to retrospectively identify and collect information for three individuals born in 2016. Subsequently, outcomes were classified by level of diagnostic certainty.Results: Fifty-one sites (15 countries) were screened; 32 of them (9 countries) participated in the assessment and identified 315 subjects with the outcomes of interest. Twenty-four sites (8 countries) identified at least one subject per outcome and agreed to continue participating. The majority (80%) of preterm births, neonatal deaths, and NI-BSI subjects, but only 50% of stillbirths, could be assessed for diagnostic certainty. The main reasons for not classifying stillbirths were insufficient information to distinguish between antepartum and intrapartum stillbirth (29%); or that not all data for one subject fit into a single level of diagnostic certainty (35%). Forty-nine percent of mothers were considered vaccinated, 6% notvaccinated, and vaccination status could not be assessed in 44% of them.Discussion: GAIA case definitions for four neonatal outcomes and maternal vaccination were successfully piloted in 24 sentinel sites across four WHO regions. Our assessment found that modification of the stillbirth definition could help avoid potential misclassification. Vaccine safety monitoring in LMICs will benefit from systematic recording of all vaccinations during pregnancy. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - CubeSat cloud detection based on JPEG2000 compression and deep learning
T2  - ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to enhance the efficiency of the image transmission system and the robustness of the optical imaging system of the Association of Sino-Russian Technical Universities satellite, a new framework of on-board cloud detection by utilizing a lightweight U-Net and JPEG compression strategy is described. In this method, a careful compression strategy is introduced and evaluated to acquire a balanced result between the efficiency and power consuming. A deep-learning network combined with lightweight U-Net and Mobilenet is trained and verified with a public Landsat-8 data set Spatial Procedures for Automated Removal of Cloud and Shadow. Experiment results indicate that by utilizing image-compression strategy and depthwise separable convolutions, the maximum memory cost and inference speed are dramatically reduced into 0.7133 Mb and 0.0378 s per million pixels while the overall accuracy achieves around 93.1%. A good possibility of the on-board cloud detection based on deep learning is explored by the proposed method.

TI  - Balanced Cloud Radiative Effects Across a Range of Dynamical Conditions Over the Tropical West Pacific
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Instantaneous relationships between clouds and large-scale vertical motion are used to study the impact of circulation on the near cancellation of cloud radiative effects that is observed over the tropical west Pacific Ocean. The coverage of deep-convective clouds increases with stronger upward motion, but the proportion of thick, medium, and thin anvil cloud remains nearly constant. Thus, when averaging over scales larger than individual storms, the top-of-atmosphere net radiation is only weakly sensitive to the large-scale flow. The balance in cloud radiative effects is therefore maintained across a wide range of large-scale circulations. The ability of the Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 to reproduce the observed cloud-circulation relationships is investigated. The simulated convective clouds substantially overestimate the proportion of deep and optically thick cloud and underestimate the proportion of anvil cirrus. These results demonstrate that simulating key properties of deep-convective clouds remains challenging for some state-of-the-art climate models.Plain Language Summary The high-cloud systems that are found over warm tropical oceans typically contain thick, rainy clouds connected to thinner extended ice clouds. The thick clouds have a cooling effect on Earth's climate because of their ability to reflect incoming sunlight back to space, while the thin clouds have a warming effect because of their ability to trap outgoing thermal infrared radiation. These warming and cooling effects cancel one another very closely, but why they do so is unknown. In this study we use satellite data to show that the cancellation is maintained as the large-scale atmospheric circulation varies. We also show that a state-of-the-art climate model does not reproduce this behavior.

TI  - Dual-Isotope Constraints on Seasonally Resolved Source Fingerprinting of Black Carbon Aerosols in Sites of the Four Emission Hot Spot Regions of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite much recent efforts, the emission sources of black carbon (BC) aerosols. central input to understanding and predicting environmental and climate impact. remain highly uncertain. Here we present observational delta C-13/Delta C-14-based constraints on the sources of BC aerosols over the four seasons in each of the four key hot spot emission regions of China: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH-Wuqing; where Wuqing is the sampling location), Yangtze River Delta (YRD-Haining), Pearl River Delta (PRD-Zhongshan), and Sichuan Basin (SC-Deyang). Overall, BC loadings were highest in winter, yet elevated loadings were also observed in other seasons, for example, spring at SC-Deyang and fall at PRD-Zhongshan. Annually, the dominant BC sources were coal (50 +/- 20%) for BTH-Wuqing, liquid fossil for YRD-Haining (46 +/- 8%) and PRD-Zhongshan (48 +/- 18%), whereas liquid fossil (42 +/- 17%) and biomass burning (41 +/- 14%) equally affected SC-Deyang. There is also different but distinct seasonalities in BC sources for the different sites. As an example, for BTH-Wuqing coal burning increased from summer to winter, while summer and spring BTH-Wuqing were more influenced by liquid fossil. In contrast, for YRD-Haining, the relative importance of emission sources was more constant over the year. These quantitative observational constraints on source-seasonality of BC aerosols in receptor sites located in China's four key economic zones highlight that regulatory control on BC aerosol emissions from different fuels should consider both seasonal and regional variations. Our results also suggest that models on estimates of BC-induced climate and air quality should consider variations over both regional and seasonal scales.

TI  - Synoptic Circulation Impact on the Near-Surface Temperature Difference Outweighs That of the Seasonal Signal in the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface temperature difference (i.e., the difference between land surface skin and 2-m air temperatures-Delta T) drives numerous ecological and biophysical processes on Earth, constituting an essential parameter in process-based Earth System Modeling. Delta T is known to be governed by factors like incoming solar radiation and wind, which vary according to synoptic-scale circulation via horizontal pressure gradient and cloud cover. Delta T is also affected by land surface characteristics and vegetation dynamics. Here we assess the role of seasonality, synoptic-scale circulation, and vegetation dynamics, using satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and latent heat estimates, on the Delta T in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM). Delta T was calculated using land surface temperatures derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and air temperatures measured at 94 meteorological stations in the EM for 2006-2010. The effect of circulation on Delta T is demonstrated for four synoptic categories covering all seasons, showing that the influence of synoptic-scale circulation may be sometimes stronger than that of the seasonal signal in this region. Delta T showed negative relationships with NDVI indicating that vegetation is attenuating the near ground temperature difference, with a gradual effect increasing from southern drylands to the more humid northern vegetated areas in the EM. The relationship between Delta T and NDVI was stronger for specific synoptic classes than for seasonal division, implying the combined role of vegetation cover dynamics and synoptic-scale conditions on Delta T. Findings from this study show promise for continuous spatiotemporal estimations of Delta T from land surface temperature and NDVI satellite data.

TI  - Temperature Trends and Anomalies in Modern Satellite Data: Infrared Sounding and GPS Radio Occultation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Trends in monthly average, zonal average temperature in the stratosphere as retrieved from highly accurate modern satellite data are intercompared and compared with climate reanalyses from 2003 through 2014. The data sets used are those of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation, and the reanalyses are those of MERRA and ERA-Interim. Trends produced by all data sets agree to within 0.02 K/year in the lower stratosphere and 0.05 K/year in the middle stratosphere. A number of retrieval errors are found that introduce incorrect trends and seasonal anomalies. Adding microwave data to the infrared retrieval changes trends by approximately 0.01 K/year, thus improving agreement with the other data sets. The signature of the quasi-biennial oscillation in temperature and the annual cycle of temperature over Antarctica as retrieved from infrared data contain null-space errors of more than 3 K due to erroneous priors used in retrieval. Nonuniformity in GPS radio occultation gives rise to errors because changes in received GPS signal strength alter the upper boundary initialization in radio occultation retrieval. Finally, an incorrect specification of atmospheric water vapor introduces an erroneous seasonal cycle of temperature as retrieved from GPS radio occultation data in the upper troposphere. All of these time-dependent retrieval errors can be corrected with future research and improvements to spectral infrared and GPS radio occultation retrieval systems.

TI  - Raindrop Size Distribution Characteristics of Summer and Winter Season Rainfall Over North Taiwan
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Raindrop size distribution (RSD) characteristics of summer and winter seasons over north Taiwan are analyzed by using long-term (similar to 12 years) raindrop spectra from Joss-Waldvogel disdrometer located at National Central University (24 degrees 58'N, 121 degrees 10'E), Taiwan. Along with the disdrometer data, radar reflectivity mosaic from six ground-based radars, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and ERA-Interim data sets are used to establish the dynamical and microphysical characteristics of summer and winter rainfall. Significant differences in raindrop spectra of summer and winter rainfall are noticed. Winter rainfall has a higher concentration of small drops and a lower concentration of midsize and large drops when compared to summer rainfall. RSD stratified on the basis of rain rate showed a higher mass-weighted mean diameter (D-m) and a lower normalized intercept parameter (log(10)N(w)) in summer than winter. Similarly, diurnal variation of RSD showed higher Dm and lower log(10)N(w) values in summer as compared to winter rainfall. In addition, for both seasons, the mean value of Dm is higher in convective precipitation than stratiform. Radar reflectivity (Z) and rain rate (R) relations (Z = A*R-b) showed a clear demarcation between summer and winter rainfall. Higher ground temperatures, deeply extended clouds with intense convective activity in summer modified the RSD through evaporation, drop sorting, and collision-coalescence processes resulting with higher Dm and lower log10Nw values in summer as compared to winter rainfall.Plain Language Summary This study details about the raindrop size distribution characteristics variations between summer and winter seasons of north Taiwan using long-term (12 years) disdrometer data and the possible reasons for the raindrop size distribution variations are also detailed.

TI  - Determining the Shortwave Radiative Flux From Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard Deep Space Climate Observatory provides 10 narrowband spectral images of the sunlit side of the Earth. The blue (443 nm), green (551 nm), and red (680 nm) channels are used to derive EPIC broadband radiances based upon narrowband-to-broadband regressions developed using collocated MODIS equivalent channels and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) broadband measurements. The pixel-level EPIC broadband radiances are averaged to provide global daytime means at all applicable EPIC times. They are converted to global daytime mean shortwave (SW) fluxes by accounting for the anisotropy characteristics using a cloud property composite based on lower Earth orbiting satellite imager retrievals and the CERES angular distribution models (ADMs). Global daytime mean SW fluxes show strong diurnal variations with daily maximum-minimum differences as great as 20 W/m(2) depending on the conditions of the sunlit portion of the Earth. The EPIC SW fluxes are compared against the CERES SYN1deg hourly SW fluxes. The global monthly mean differences (EPIC-SYN) between them range from 0.1 W/m(2) in July to -4.1 W/m(2) in January, and the RMS errors range from 3.2 to 5.2 W/m(2). Daily mean EPIC and SYN fluxes calculated using concurrent hours agree with each other to within 2% and both show a strong annual cycle. The SW flux agreement is within the calibration and algorithm uncertainties, which indicates that the method developed to calculate the global anisotropic factors from the CERES ADMs is robust and that the CERES ADMs accurately account for the Earth's anisotropy in the near-backscatter direction.Plain Language Summary Measurements from Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera onboard Deep Space Climate Observatory were used to derive the global daytime mean shortwave fluxes. They agree with those derived from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System to within 2%.

TI  - Satellite Detection of Water Stress Effects on Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux With MODIS Shortwave Infrared Reflectance Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides spatially contiguous measurements of terrestrial biophysical variables, which can be used to estimate the terrestrial latent heat flux (LE). MODIS-derived shortwave infrared reflectance (SWIR) metrics (SWIRs) are sensitive to the soil moisture and vegetation water stress. In this study, we used the MODIS-derived SWIRs with eddy covariance flux measurements obtained from 25 flux tower sites representing 10 different land cover types within China to evaluate the sensitivity of SWIRs to ground-measured evaporation fraction and LE. The water constraint metrics determined using the MODIS-derived SWIR generally corresponded better with the ground-measured evaporation fraction values than those obtained without using SWIR. The MODIS-derived SWIRs were used as proxies for the soil and vegetation water supply constraints in a revised Priestley-Taylor algorithm to estimate the terrestrial LE. The estimated LE using the MODIS-derived SWIRs generally corresponded well with the ground-measured LE (0.56 <= R-2 <= 0.97) for most of the flux tower sites. Regional algorithm sensitivity analysis using the MODIS-derived SWIRs as water supply proxies demonstrated that water limitations reduce LE by more than 53% over China, and the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and relative humidity are not sufficient to characterize both the atmosphere demand and water supply for LE estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of using MODIS-derived SWIRs to characterize soil and vegetation water supply factors for determining LE, where the relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions (500 m and daily) are closer to the scale of the eddy covariance ground measurements.

TI  - The Relationships Between Cloud Top Radiative Cooling Rates, Surface Latent Heat Fluxes, and Cloud-Base Heights in Marine Stratocumulus
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top radiative cooling (CTRC) drives turbulence in marine boundary layers (MBLs) topped by stratocumulus clouds. This study examines the role of CTRC in regulating the surface-cloud coupling, surface latent heat fluxes, and cloud base height by exploiting a 6-month worth of shipborne observations over the subtropical northeast Pacific in combination with geostationary satellite data. We find that owning to the prevailing equatorward flow that advects stratocumulus clouds over warmer sea surfaces, the vast majority of the decoupled stratocumulus decks are fed by divergence from the tops of underlying cumulus, forming cumulus-coupled MBL. The cumulus-coupled and well-mixed MBL dominate the subtropical MBL regimes. We find that strong CTRC favors greater (smaller) occurrence frequency of well-mixed (cumulus-coupled) MBLs. In well-mixed MBLs, strong CTRC enhances entrainment of dry free-tropospheric air, desiccates the MBL, increases the surface latent heat fluxes, and elevates the cloud-base height. This is demonstrated by the observed covariabilities between the CTRC rate and surface latent heat fluxes and cloud-base height. The relationships are more statistically significant in conditions where the inversion strength is relatively weak, and thus, the entrainment is more effective. In cumulus-coupled MBLs, however, the influence of CTRC in regulating the surface moisture is not detected by the ship observations. The much greater latent heat fluxes than the CTRC rate in cumulus-coupled MBLs suggest stronger surface forcing, which substantially tames the footprint of CTRC.

TI  - Human-climate induced drivers of mountain grassland over the last 40 years in Sidama, Ethiopia: perceptions versus empirical evidence
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMountain grasslands are globally important ecosystems. They are considered as heritage sites with outstanding values to ecological communities by adding a further layer and support to the existing protection measures. However, mountain grasslands are increasingly under threat from human activities and impacts of climate change.MethodsUsing satellite imagery, we studied land use/land cover (LULC) patterns between 1973 and 2015. Individual interviews consisting of 240 households for comparison and field data collection were conducted for accuracy assessment.ResultsFive categories of LULC types were identified from the image classification that included forestland, grassland, shrubland, bushland, and agricultural land. Between 1973 and 2015, the forestland, grassland, and shrubland covers were declined by 15.9%, 53.6%, and 41.0%, respectively. In contrast, bushland and agricultural land were increased by 169% and 647%, respectively. The overall LULC classification accuracies for the four reference years ranged from 77.6 to 86.5% with Kappa statistic of 0.69 to 0.80. The majority of respondents (92.5%) mentioned that the cover of forestland outsized the other land use land cover types followed by grassland in the past.ConclusionsThe stated indicators of land use/land cover changes linked to the impact of climate change were decline in milk yield and crop production, spread of livestock diseases, degradation of grazing lands, and change in the timing of rain. The results of the study suggest that human-climate related components were major drivers of land use/land cover dynamics that demand for proper management and conservation of mountain grassland ecosystem in Sidama South Ethiopia.

TI  - Arctic climate: changes in sea ice extent outweigh changes in snow cover
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent declines in Arctic sea ice and snow extent have led to an increase in the absorption of solar energy at the surface, resulting in additional surface heating and a further decline in snow and ice. Using 34 years of satellite data, 1982-2015, we found that the positive trend in solar absorption over the Arctic Ocean is more than double that over Arctic land, and the magnitude of the ice-albedo feedback is four times that of the snow-albedo feedback in summer. The timing of the high-to-low albedo transition has shifted closer to the greater insolation of the summer solstice over ocean, but further away from the summer solstice over land. Therefore, decreasing sea ice cover, not changes in terrestrial snow cover, has been the dominant radiative feedback mechanism over the last few decades.

TI  - Temporal trend of the suspended sediment transport of the Amazon River (1984-2016)
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We discuss the claim that the Amazon River has been subjected to a noticeable increase in suspended sediment transport (SST) in response to both climate and land-use changes. To study this, both satellite imagery and in situ data were compiled to produce a 32-year time series (1984-2016) of suspended sediment concentration. Both parametric and nonparametric statistics were applied to examine the SST time trend. The results indicate that there has been no statistically significant increase in SST in the last 32 years, independent of the statistical approach. The results indicate that, over the last 32 years at the Obidos station, in Brazil, a recurring pattern of increase and decrease in SST has occurred, rather than a unidirectional systematic trend. This further explains the increasing trend reported in the literature and indicates that short time series are not recommended for time trend analyses due to the large inter-annual variability.

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The major flood of 2014 in the two eastern, transboundary rivers, the Jhelum and Chenab in Punjab, Pakistan, was simulated using the two-dimensional rainfall-runoff model. The simulated hydrograph showed good agreement with the observed discharge at the model outlet and intervening barrages, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.86 at the basin outlet. Further, simulated flood inundation extent showed good agreement with the MODIS imagery with a fit (%) of 0.87. For some affected areas that experienced short-duration flooding, local housing damage data confirmed the simulated results. Besides the rainfall-runoff and flood inundation modelling, parameter sensitivity analysis was undertaken to identify the influence of various river and floodplain parameters. The analysis showed that the river channel geometric parameters and the roughness coefficients exerted the primary influence over flood extent and peak flow.
