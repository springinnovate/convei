AB  - Over the past several decades, the conversion of native forest to tea plantation and crop land has accelerated across the Coonoor watershed in Nilgiris. It is notable that the present study explored the severity prevalent in the land cover changes including deforestation activities at Coonoor watershed region as a result of urbanization, recreation parks, resorts and tea plantation development. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is one of the most widely used soil erosion model which estimates the average soil loss over a long-term period. This paper therefore, imprinted the impact of land use changes on land degradation and the consequent vital phenomenon like the soil erosion. The change detection was carried out between the periods of 2005-2018. Landsat images of corresponding periods were classified using supervised classification technique and also Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) was computed for the determination of C-factor (cover and management factor) for the corresponding periods. Conversion of forest land into tea plantation, wasteland and settlement significantly decreases the soil organic matter (SOM) and hydraulic conductivity (HC) of the soil, which leads to different K-factor (soil erodibility factor) for the study duration, whereas the R-factor (rainfall and runoff factor) and LS-factor (length-slope factor) are considered to be constant throughout the period. The results of this study indicates via promising results, that the total sediment yield of the study area has remarkably increased due to land use/cover changes. The most significant rise in soil erosion was found evitable in the deforested region where there has occurred a changeover from forest/orchard to infrastructure and wasteland.

AB  - The aim of this study is to utilize the remotely sensed data and GIS techniques for instability assessment of terrain and prediction in the chosen study area, Rohtang to Baralacha, Lahaul Spiti District, Himanchal Pradesh, India. Several parameter maps were generated by the availability of different types of multi-temporal and various scales of remote sensing data. Inventory map was developed though the field work, past records and with the help of remote sensing data. Geological map, soil map, land use map, terrain map, slope map, aspect map, drainage density and snow melt parameter maps were generated or extracted from the existing ancillary data. In speeding up processing for hazard zonation and prediction assessment, GIS can be useful. To determine the degree of susceptibility to the landslides, information value method is used. The landslide hazard map is classified on the basis of its probability values into low, medium, high and very high risk zones. The results showed that over 3.09% of the area is liable to low landslide risk, 26.28% of the area is liable to medium landslide risk, 32.81% of the area is of high landslide risk and within this area about 37.81% has very high to severe risk. The landslide susceptibility map delineated in this paper can be used by various stakeholders, like state governments, researchers and citizens to develop and manage the developmental activities in the area in particular and in other similar areas in general.

AB  - Identification of homogeneous regions in a satellite image is essentially the clustering of pixels in intensity space. Importantly remote sensing image like satellite images contain varieties of land cover types. Some of the covers are significantly large areas whereas some are relatively smaller regions. Therefore, automatically detecting such wide varying areas is a challenging task. Hence, this fact motivated us to propose an improved clustering technique viz. Ensemble based Differential Evolution for Fuzzy Clustering (EDEFC). For this purpose, very recently developed three variants of differential evolution (DE) are used in order to perform the clustering with different set of solutions. As a result, better clustering solution yields from the ensemble of DEs by exhaustive exploration of search space. The proposed EDEFC technique is applied on two numeric remote sensing datasets and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite image of Kolkata. The results of the EDEFC are shown quantitatively and visually by comparing with eight other clustering techniques. Moreover, the statistical significance test has also been performed in order to judge the superiority of EDEFC.

AB  - The cloud and the atmospheric aerosol are two major inter-related components controlling the Earth's total radiation budget. One year data from space based MODIS instrument are used to study the cloud drop and aerosol distribution and their inter-relation over the globe. The latitudinal analysis of inter-relation between these two show strong positive correlation for tropical and northern hemisphere for most of the time however, shows both negative and positive correlation for southern latitudes for significant time. The seasonal dependence of the correlation value at southern latitudes and tropical region indicate the role of convective system in determining the size of cloud droplet. The positive value of the correlation in northern hemisphere also indicate that the anthropogenic aerosol induce a positive relation between AOD and CER.

TI  - Intelligent Drone-based Surveillance: Application to Parking Lot Monitoring and Detection
T2  - UNMANNED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY XXI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Unmanned Systems Technology XXI
CL  - Baltimore, MD
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are rapidly gaining popularity in the field of remote sensing for capturing images with ultra-high spatial resolution while flying at lower altitudes. Development of highly-efficient miniaturized sensors and the use of geospatial image processing techniques have been immensely helpful in growing this technology as the most sought-after and sophisticated remote sensing technique at a relatively lower cost. Parking lot occupancy detection, one of the current drone based application area, can be used for effective management of parking spaces, to reduce queues, minimize the time required to find an area, and to issue tickets in cases of parking violations. Visual information based parking lot monitoring techniques are mostly tailored for specific applications, and they lack generalization. In this paper, a UAV-assisted quick and efficient monitoring solution is proposed for real-time parking occupancy and car number plate detection. In this approach, a drone-mounted camera has been used to capture images of the parking lot under consideration. Initially, the parking lot is being mapped using drone-coordinates, and then a dynamic programming algorithm is used to determine the shortest route to cover multiple parking lots in minimum time to capture maximum number pictures solved by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). For capturing images, an optimum location is used, such that the drone can cover the maximum area of a parking space in minimum time. Depending on the parking area under investigation, paths altitudes and gimbal angles of the drone is changed dynamically while capturing images. Then a deep neural network based parking lot occupancy monitoring system is used to determine the number of occupied and vacant spots in a parking lot. The drone captured images of each parking spot are then tested with a pre-trained model based on car and non-car images. Then the automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) algorithm is used for parking rule enforcement. Finally, experimental results are verified using a web based application that is connected with a cloud database.

AB  - In this paper, our main aim is to investigate the context-based pixel-wise classification using a fully convolutional neural networks model for flood extent mapping from multispectral remote sensing images. Our approach helps to overcome the limitation of the conventional classification methods with low generalisation ability that used per-pixel spectral information for pixel-wise classification. In this study, a comparative analysis with conventional pixel-wise SVM classifier shows that our proposed model has higher generalisation ability for flooded area detection. By using remote sensing images with different spatial resolutions we also aim to investigate the relationship between image-sensor resolution and neighbourhood window size for context-based classification. Instead of fine-tuning a pre-established deep neural network model, we developed a preliminary base model with two convolutional layers. The model was tested on images with two different spatial resolutions of 3 meters (PlanetScope image) and 30 meters (Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper). During training phase we determined the structure of the convolutional layer as well as the appropriate size of the contextual neighbourhood for those two data types. Preliminary results showed that with increasing the scale of spatial resolutions the required neighbourhood size for training samples also increases. We tested different neighbourhood sized training samples to train the model and the analysis of the performance of those models showed that a 11 x 11 neighbourhood window for PlanetScope data and a 3 x 3 neighbourhood window for Landsat data were found to be the optimum size for classification. Insights from this work may be used to design efficient classifiers in scenarios where data with different resolutions are available.

AB  - Our knowledge of urban areas is constantly being renewed and diversified depending on new data sources. Spatial data plays a particularly major role in this change. Currently the elements of a given city can be analyzed in high resolution and with great accuracy. Such progress guides the observation of the specific structure of urban spaces more easily. This study focuses on the spatial construction and current situation of Bagcilar, one of the most problematic urban areas of the city of Istanbul. This research has been conducted using high-resolution remote sensing data and positional information from companies. The findings of the study are based on four different processes in the city. The first interprets the development form of the urbanization process which starts with urban sprawl and develops into a "monstrous industrial city" (Guvenc, 1993). The second includes changes in housing presentation patterns over time and their mismatches. The third process focuses on the recent transformation and its consequences in various parts of the city, but especially in areas where large industrial enterprises are located. The final one questions the distribution pattern of the companies that have shut down and those that are operating in the city. All four cases show that a significant part of Bagcilar's current problems stem from spatial irregularities.

AB  - In this study, sediment transport rate of the Kizilirmak River basin located in the tectonically active North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) is evaluated in order to determine the effects of the NAFZ on the Kizilirmak basin sediment transport rate. Vegetation covers the basin area is extracted from the LANDSAT ETM data by using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). On the other hand, topographic attributes (elevation, slope, curvature, and water catchment) were obtained from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to detect areas associated with sediment transport and accumulation. GIS was used to extract topographic profiles along with the Kizilirmak River and attributes as well as for the implementation of the stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), sediment transport index (STI) and channel width. The relation with the derived indices and NAFZ is determined by integrating hot and cold spot clusters of indices values mapped with Getis-Ord Gi* statistics. According to the derived results which highlighted hot and cold spots of the index values helped to identify the relation between sediment transport rate of the basin area and NAFZ.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thousands of acres of giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) are managed annually in Louisiana and Texas, but management success is difficult to measure quantitatively. The objective of this research was to evaluate and develop remote sensing techniques to quickly and accurately assess giant salvinia health and herbicide efficacy in a field scenario. Field sampling data from Saline Lake, LA documented a negative correlation (R-2 = -0.785) between Landsat near-infrared (NIR) reflectance and visual percent control ratings. Additional research utilizing high-resolution WorldView-3 reflectance data indicated that percent control and NIR reflectance of giant salvinia in sampled plots were significantly correlated at 2 and 6 wk after treatment, with P = 0.047 and P < 0.0001, respectively. Additional data collected with a DJI Phantom drone and low-cost RGNIR Sentera Single Sensor during an 8-wk mesocosm study documented the strongest linear relationship (R-2 = -0.914) between percent control and NIR reflectance values, and the resulting linear regression equation was used to predict percent control values utilizing data collected in previous studies. The relationship between predicted and observed percent control values was linear and significant (P <= 0.0001) and yielded R and R-2 values of 0.918 and 0.843, respectively. On the basis of the NIR spectral response of giant salvinia to herbicide applications, remote sensing can provide beneficial information on the success or failure of large-scale herbicide applications.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Climate variability is one of the greatest risks for farmers. The ongoing increase of natural calamities suggests that insurance strategies have to be more dynamic than previously. In this work a remote sensing-based service prototype is presented aimed at supporting insurance companies by defining an operative tool to objectively calibrate insurance annual fares, tending to cost reduction able to attract more potential customers. Methodology was applied to an agriculture devoted area located in the Vercelli province (Piemonte - NW Italy). COPERNICUS Sentinel-2 Level 2A image time series were used for this purpose jointly with MODIS data. High resolution Sentinel-2 data (GSD = 10 m) were used to map local spatial differences of crop performance, aimed at locally tuning insurance risk and fares around the average one estimated with reference to MODIS data on a longer period. The agricultural seasons 2018 were considered for this purpose. Although the work with MODIS data was carried out by authors in previous works, their integration with S2 data proved to locally tune at single field and crop type level the agronomic performances of insured areas.

AB  - The most popular and beautiful spot of Urak valley- Hanna Lake, situated in the capital city Quetta (Balochistan, Pakistan), is shrinking affecting the surrounding environment and lake's ecosystem. Lake completely dried thrice since 2001. One of the most stated reasons is a shortage of rainfalls due to climate change. Pakistan is ranked on 7th position in the list of most vulnerable countries to climate change with 141 extreme weather events. Linking lake drying to climate change seems to be an obvious connection in the absence of required historical records regarding temporal changes in the lake's surface area and volume. Researching precise reasons is crucial to find appropriate solutions. This study took advantage of satellite-derived data to overcome the gap between recorded information. Changing lake surface areas from satellite images were compared with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) rainfall records since 1984 to study any interconnection between them. It was found that since 2002, rainfall trend increases, whereas, lake area decreases. This gives rise to the impression that climate change has not caused any drop in lakes and other water bodies.

M3  - Article
AB  - American black bear (Ursus americanus) populations in North Carolina, US have recovered significantly in recent decades and now occupy much of western North Carolina, including urban-suburban areas. We used the black bear as a potential sentinel for leptospirosis, a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira spp., which is maintained by domestic and wild mammals. We determined whether Leptospira spp. were present across a gradient of housing densities in the urban and suburban black bear population in and around Asheville, North Carolina using serologic and molecular surveys. We collected blood from captured black bears (n=94) and kidneys and bladders from carcasses (n=19). We tested a total of 96 (47 females, 47 males, and 2 unknown) serum samples by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and had positive results (titer >1:100) for L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa (L. Grippotyphosa) in 4 females (8%) and 5 males (10%). No other serovars showed elevated titers in MAT. We tested a total of 125 samples using PCR (n=96 serum, n=20 kidney, and n=9 bladders) and obtained positive results from one serum (1%), one kidney (5%), and one bladder (11%). The presence of Leptospira spp. in black bears occupying an urban and suburban landscape may indicate a more extensive occurrence of the bacteria among animals in the study region because black bears are the top carnivore in that ecosystem. Potential threats of widespread contamination during natural events such as flood or drought must be considered.

AB  - We study small scale ionospheric effects on L-band SAR images in the equatorial region, known as equatorial stripes or streaks by using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and ground air glow imager. Our experiment shows the existence of density depletion regions in the ionosphere within the radar geometry when SAR stripe phenomena occurred. This study experimentally demonstrates that the equatorial L-band SAR stripes are associated with plasma irregularities in density depletion regions, although further work is necessary to clarify the formation mechanism of irregularities.

AB  - Sen2Like is a processor designed to produce harmonized Level 2 surface reflectance dataset considering as reference Sentinel-2 data. Sen2Like fits with the on-going and growing expectations of the Earth Observation (EO) Community for the merging of an increasing number of input data streams from the various Multi-Spectral (MS) High Resolution (HR) EO mission instruments.The harmonization is an essential processing stage in order to fully exploit all the potential of physical data in the context of land use / land change classification / detection. However, because harmonization addresses several issues in the field of atmospheric / geometric / directional effects / spectral difference corrections, there is not a standard way to achieve this objective.To initiate this project, the Landsat 8 (LS8) mission has been considered as the most appropriate. The Sen2Like processor is now delivering S2/LS8 Analysis Ready Data (ARD) on S2 tiling system at a map resolution of 30 m and 10 m. After a description of the algorithms involved in Sen2Like, this paper discusses testing and validation results.

AB  - In the context of Long Term Data Preservation, ESA, with the support of the Instrument Data Evaluation and Quality Analysis Service (IDEAS+) team, reprocessed over 600'000 Landsat 1-5 Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) products acquired in the period 1975 - 2001 from the European Ground Stations complementing the existing 1 million Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Level 1 products, with a geographical coverage from Greenland to Continental Europe and North Africa. The reprocessing software and quality control tool developed for the reprocessing present new features aimed at improving the radiometric and geometric accuracy, image data recovery and including additional quality assurance information.An accurate geometric and radiometric accuracy evaluation across the over 40-years long operative life of Landsat is vital for the exploitation of long time series analysis and for the future development of multi-mission Analysis Ready Data (ARD). This paper proposes to evaluate the geometric accuracy and the radiometric calibration accuracy of the Landsat Level 1 products delivered by ESA.It is obvious that across Landsat historical mission the accuracy is not the same; data are acquired with the MSS, the TM and the ETM+ sensors with improved characteristics for the most recent ones. All these differences between remote sensing systems, did not preclude to engineer processing algorithms with one main objective to harmonize physical measurement and ensure interoperability with the ongoing missions such as Landsat 8 - OLI / Sentinel 2 - MSI. This approach is a key aspect for the future development of multi mission ARD.The geometric quality assurance parameters are exposed in the Level 1 products. These scene based parameters allows to filter out and select, for a given region, if needed the most accurate products. Also, to demonstrate that these parameters are consistent is fundamental.Because of the ageing of missions, specifically for MSS missions, the processing cannot solely rely on information coming from telemetry. It is mandatory to apply ground model and to estimate both external and internal orientation parameters for what concerned the geometric model. Furthermore, for some parameters, the use of single scene for calibration of geo referencing model is not sufficient and the estimate of parameters becomes more robust when considering, instead of one scene, all data recorded in the acquisition period and downlinked to the receiving station.Also, the proposed methodology herein validates the stability of geometric accuracy for a long period of time within the orbit. The product quality assurance parameters are compared with the same ones but inferred from an image matching methods comparing disparity between two geometric grids; the input ESA image and geometric reference image (Global Land Survey data). A comparison with relative USGS products is also performed.

AB  - Climate changes and rapid urbanization are the main factors affecting forest vegetation land cover around the globe. Satellite remote sensing data provide important information to detect changes in forest landscapes over long time periods in contrast to conventional approaches. Satellite remote sensing provides a useful tool to capture the temporal dynamics of forest vegetation change in response to climate shifts, at spatial resolutions fine enough to capture the spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we present an integrated, standardized approach that aims at combining remote sensing data provided by different sensors, available for a long-term period (2000-2018). This multi-sensor and multi-temporal approach detects Cernica-Branesti periurban forest vegetation dynamics based on derived biophysical parameters within the highly dynamic city of Bucharest, as a test case. Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, MODIS Terra/Aqua, and Sentinel 2 data are combined in an integrated procedure to locate forest disturbances in relation with potential climate and anthropogenic drivers. To apply the approach for detecting forest land cover changes, the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index/Enhanced Vegetation Index (NDVI/EVI), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data are used to provide forest vegetation change detection information in relation with land surface temperature (LST) and climate stressors and to monitor forest vegetation phenological variations. Correlations between NDVI/EVI time series and climatic variables were computed. Forest vegetation dynamics at seasonal and longer timescales reflect large-scale interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and the climate system.

AB  - Due to global warming and climate changes forest ecosystems in Romania experienced environmental degradation. Climate models scenaria evidenced that some of the most severe weather events could become more frequent in Romania over the next 50 to 100 years. In the case of Carpathian mountain forests, winter storms, heavy rains, summer draughts and heat waves are considered main keys of climate risks, particularly in prealpine and alpine areas. Forest phenology is a multi-scale phenomenon, arising from processes in leaves and trees, which controls carbon and water cycles, observable at the ecosystem scale (e.g. eddy flux measurements), very important to characterize the relation between phenophase transition events at different spatial scales. Through time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), provided by MODIS Terra/Aqua data is possible to examine trends and seasonality in forest vegetation Leaf Area Index (LAI) and in primary productivity, as well as to identify the impacts of human disturbances (clearcutting, etc.). In order to extract forest phenological changes, this paper applied fusion technique to multitemporal satellite imagery data (Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, Sentinel 2 and MODIS Terra/Aqua satellite data) for a mountain forest ecosystem placed in Prahova Valley, South Carpathians in Romania over 2000-2018 period. Effects of climate extremes on forests can have both short-term and long-term implications for standing biomass, tree health and species composition. The preservation and enhancement of mountain forest vegetation cover in natural, semi-natural forestry ecosystems is an essential factor in sustaining environmental health and averting natural hazards.

TI  - CURRENT STATE OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR POLLUTION IN UKRAINE BASED ON SENTINEL-5P SATELLITE DATA
T2  - VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Industrial development and increasing traffic emissions cause air quality problems. The most accurate for air pollution analysis are ground-based data; however, it is very limited in space. Modelling could solve this problem, but huge amount of input information and limits of computational power make it difficult to analyze big territories with high resolution. Sentinel-5P satellite with TROPOMI instrument nowadays gives opportunities to monitor the air pollution with good spatial resolution. The purpose of the study is to analyse nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and formaldehyde spatial and temporal distribution over Ukraine and Black Sea and Azov Sea.Methods and raw data. There were selected Sentinel-5P data of NO2, SO2, CO and HCHO for the period from first data release in 2018 to June, 2019. Data processing implemented in Google Earth Engine using JavaScript programming in The Earth Engine Code Editor.Results and discussion. Joint analysis of NO2 tropospheric, stratospheric and total columns showed the prevailing of tropospheric NO2 content and therefore crucial role of anthropogenic emission sources. While background NO2 total column varies from 4.10(-5) mol/m(2) to 7.0(-5) mol/m(2), in the most polluted cities content exceeds 1.10(-4) mol/m(2). The highest values are observed in Kyiv and industrial cities in Donbas region. Some of them are situated in the area of Joint Forces Operation outside the demarcation line. Sentinel-5P data catch the large emissions from the local industries; however, no official confirmations about production volume are available. NO2 dispersion increase during winter with the values range from 1.10(-5) mol/m(2 )to 3.10(-5) mol/m(2) over clean territories and 8.10(-5) mol/m(2) to 1.10(-3) mol/m(2) in industrial cities. Seasonal maximal observed during warm period in unpolluted regions and during winter in the cities. Cold seasonal NO2 content outbreaks in the mountains are the result of its transportation from industrial cities.Spatial distribution of CO total column over Ukraine is rather homogeneous because of CO lifetime in the atmosphere up to several months. It could be transported on the long distances, which makes identification of polluted regions difficult. However, several cities with maximal average values of more than 0.037mol/m(2) prove the existence of extreme anthropogenic emissions. Overall background CO contents vary within 0.033-0.035 mol/m(2). Coastal regions of the Black Sea and Azov Sea are more polluted by CO compared to the mainland, which could be the consequences of ships emissions. Temporal analysis of CO total column found 4 powerful emissions: three of them are anthropogenic in industrial cities and one is natural, connected with forest fires in Belarus and northern part of Rivne region in April, 2019.There is one location with huge SO2 emission in Ukraine, observed in Novyi Svit (Donetsk region) outside the demarcation line of Joint Forces Operation, which corresponds to Starobeshivska thermal power station. In general, higher SO2 contents are observed over Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Dnipro regions; also over the Black Sea and Azov Sea. For HCHO spatial distribution minimal values are typical for the Carpathians. It is well seen that SO2 content are higher in the Southern part of Ukraine than in the Western part.The research finds regularities in spatial distribution of pollutants over the sea area. During cold season higher concentrations could be observed over the main merchant vessels tracks in the Black Sea. In summer months, which coincide with the main tourist season, most polluted are shoreline area because of emissions from cabotage and fishing vessels.The study updates information about most polluted cities in Ukraine, especially in the regions with absence of ground-based measurements. Some of them are mentioned for the first time among other research. Air quality analysis in many industrial cities significantly changed over the last two years. It shows difficulties of long-term pollution forecast and scenarios based on historical data and observed trends. It is recommended to use ensemble modelling for this purpose with scenarios of emission reduction, increasing and temporal stability. Sentinel-5P data confirm the conclusions of previous research about dependence of NO2 annual cycle and seasonality phases shift from the level of anthropogenic load.Prospects for further research. Sentinel-5P spatial resolution expands the horizons for air pollution research. The most relevant are monitoring of short-term anthropogenic and natural emissions, pollutants' seasonality changes in different macroclimatic conditions, research of ships emissions in Black Sea and Azov Sea, combination of satellite air pollution data with methods of "artificial intelligence" for individual emissions detection.

TI  - <SUP>68</SUP>Ga-Sienna+ for PET-MRI Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation in a Metastatic Breast Cancer Model
T2  - Nanotheranostics
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is commonly performed in cancers that metastasise via the lymphatic system. It involves excision and histology of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and presents two main challenges: (i) sensitive whole-body localisation of SLNs, and (ii) lack of pre-operative knowledge of their metastatic status, resulting in a high number (>70%) of healthy SLN excisions. To improve SLNB, whole-body imaging could improve detection and potentially prevent unnecessary surgery by identifying healthy and metastatic SLNs. In this context, radiolabelled SPIOs and PET-MRI could find applications to locate SLNs with high sensitivity at the whole-body level (using PET) and guide high-resolution MRI to evaluate their metastatic status. Here we evaluate this approach by synthesising a GMP-compatible Ga-68-SPIO (Ga-68-Sienna+) followed by PET-MR imaging and histology studies in a metastatic breast cancer mouse model.Methods. A clinically approved SPIO for SLN localisation (Sienna+) was radiolabelled with Ga-68 without a chelator. Radiochemical stability was tested in human serum. In vitro cell uptake was compared between 3E.Delta.NT breast cancer cells, expressing the hNIS reporter gene, and macrophage cell lines (J774A.1; RAW264.7.GFP). NSG-mice were inoculated with 3E.Delta.NT cells. Left axillary SLN metastasis was monitored by hNIS/SPECT-CT and compared to the healthy right axillary SLN. Ga-68-Sienna(+) was injected into front paws and followed by PET-MRI. Imaging results were confirmed by histology.Results. Ga-68-Sienna(+) was produced in high radiochemical purity (>93%) without the need for purification and was stable in vitro. In vitro uptake of Ga-68-Sienna(+) in macrophage cells (J774A.1) was significantly higher (12 +/- 1%) than in cancer cells (2.0 +/- 0.1%; P < 0.001). SPECT-CT confirmed metastasis in the left axillary SLNs of tumour mice. In PET, significantly higher Ga-68-Sienna(+) uptake was measured in healthy axillary SLNs (2.2 +/- 0.9 %ID/mL), than in metastatic SLNs (1.1 +/- 0.2 %ID/mL; P = 0.006). In MRI, Ga-68-Sienna(+) uptake in healthy SLNs was observed by decreased MR signal in T2/T2*-weighted sequences, whereas fully metastatic SLNs appeared unchanged.Conclusion. Ga-68-Sienna(+) in combination with PET-MRI can locate and distinguish healthy from metastatic SLNs and could be a useful preoperative imaging tool to guide SLN biopsy and prevent unnecessary excisions.

AB  - Natural calamities triggered by erratic weather conditions like cyclone, earthquakes, hail storms, and Hood incurs substantial loss to the infrastructure and crops of the region. Countries across the globe are prone to such natural calamities. In India, specifically coastal parts are vulnerable to tropical cyclones. In 2018 east coast districts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, India were affected by the three cyclones namely Titli (11 Oct. 2018), Gaja (16 Nov. 2018) and Pethai (17 Dec. 2018) causing severe damage to seasonal crops such as Rice, Coconut and Areca Nut plantations. Traditional survey-based methods of crop loss assessment are time-consuming and labor-intensive.This study addresses the problem of near-real-time qualitative crop loss assessment due to tropical Gaja cyclone using the temporal data from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellites. The crop damage assessment study has been undertaken for Gaja cyclone in the affected district of Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India. The major crops cultivated in the district are Khalif Rice (locally called as Samba and Late Samba) and Coconut plantations. The study addresses qualitative loss assessment in terms of crop area affected. As a first step, we used time series data of Sentinel 1 (VV and VH backscatter) available between Aug.-Nov. 2018 to map the Kharif rice area. Also, cloud-free Sentinel 2 scenes available during Mar.-May. 2018 have been used to map the Coconut area. Field visits were conducted to collect the geo-tagged plot boundaries for the rice crop and coconut plantations. The data collected through field visits was used both for model training and crop loss assessment. Google maps satellite layer was used as a base map for identification of other non-crop classes (i.e., forest, water, settlement, etc.). The overall accuracy of crop area classification was 87.23% for rice and 92.22% for coconut.Further, to estimate the crop loss, crop layers along with the NDVI were considered. Two crop loss scenarios, namely minimum damage and maximum damage, were identified for both the crops. The mean NDVI composite before the event, i.e., 1-15 Nov. 2018 was considered as the base. In case of maximum loss scenario, short term NDVI composite available immediately after the event, i.e., 17-25 Nov. 2018 was selected. After the cyclone, long term NDVI composite of the mean (i.e., 17 Nov. 13 Dec. 2018) was used to assess the minimum loss scenario. Using field observations, the crop loss was categorized as severe loss, medium loss, low loss, and no loss. Results showed that the coconut plantations in Pattukkottai, Peravurani, and Papanasam blocks of Tanjavur are affected by the cyclone. The significant rice crop loss has been observed in Thanjavur, Orattanadu, Pattukkottai blocks. We have found the remote sensing based crop loss observations are matching with the government reports based on field observations. The remote sensing observations with human participatory sensing (i.e., field observations) has the potential tiff near-real-time crop loss assessment.

AB  - Erratic rainfall with varying intensity and duration has raised the risks of crop failure in semi-arid areas of south and south-east Asia. In subsistence irrigation cropping systems often its difficult to schedule the irrigation, i.e. when and how much water to irrigate. Therefore there is a need for a regional real / near real-time updated database on vegetation greening and browning to facilitate the irrigation scheduling decisions. With the advent of open archives of remote sensing from United States Geological Survey (USGS) and European Space Agency (ESA) have proven an unique set of long-term historical and near real-time observations. In this study, an attempt has been made to understand the vegetation greening and browning patterns using time series of remote sensing observations for irrigation water management. The main objective is to study the greening and browning of natural vegetation (i.e., grasslands and forests) and agricultural areas of Indian sub-continent for understanding the breaks in the rainfall spells and integrated approach for irrigation scheduling. The time series of vegetation indices have been extracted for predefined grid locations from Sentinel 2 remote sensing sensor. Further, an algorithm based on time series analysis were evaluated for estimating the vegetation growth stages. The estimated vegetation growth stages was compared with the agro-climatic zones. A methodology for subsistence irrigation scheduling has been proposed based on regional vegetation growth stages (i.e. onset, peak and end of the season). The estimated vegetation growth stages showed poor alignment with the agro-climatic zones. The integrated approach based on vegetation growth stages is promising for scheduling subsistence irrigation. The proposed methodology for vegetation growth stage identification has potential applications in drought risk assessment and in establishing key indicators for agro-climatic zones.

AB  - Increasing urbanization, especially in developing countries, promotes the need of monitoring and modelling of urban growth or sprawl. Urban remote sensing and modelling are the tools which facilitate assessment and prediction of urban growth. In the present work, spatio-temporal variations in urban growth has been studied using 22 years of multi-spectral remote sensing data for Pushkar Town in India. The CA (Cellular Automata) based SLEUTH model has been used in the present study for urban growth modelling, which is one of the most promising urban growth model and widely used throughout the world. The self-modifying parameters in SLEUTH model play a crucial role in identifying and controlling the temporal urban growth rate during model calibration and urban growth prediction. Present study is aimed to determine the SLEUTH model sensitivity to self-modifying parameter and also to identify the influence of self-modifying parameters on fragmented urban growth, urban growth pattern and spatial & temporal distribution of growth. The study revealed the need of sensitivity analysis of SLEUTH model parameters which are critically affecting simulation process in identifying fragmented urban growth, in areas where built-up unit sizes are small, built-up practices are heterogeneous and scattered. Study has been found to be successful in quantifying the model sensitivity to self-modifying parameters and in identifying different urban forms like clustered, dispersed, edge, road influenced, compact and spreading center growth. The study is important for research community, urban planners and land use policy decision makers.

TI  - A Structural Classification of Australian Vegetation Using ICESat/GLAS, ALOS PALSAR, and Landsat Sensor Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia has historically used structural descriptors of height and cover to characterize, differentiate, and map the distribution of woody vegetation across the continent but no national satellite-based structural classification has been available. In this study, we present a new 30-m spatial resolution reference map of Australian forest and woodland structure (height and cover), with this generated by integrating Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced TM, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation (ICESat), and Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data. ALOS PALSAR and Landsat-derived Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) were used to segment and classify the Australian landscape. Then, from intersecting ICESat waveform data, vertical foliage profiles and height metrics (e.g., 95% percentile height, mean height and the height to maximum vegetation density) were extracted for each of the classes generated. Within each class, and for selected areas, the variability in ICESat profiles was found to be similar with differences between segments of the same class attributed largely to clearance or disturbance events. ICESat metrics and profiles were then assigned to all remaining segments across Australia with the same class allocation. Validation against airborne LiDAR for a range of forest structural types indicated a high degree of correspondence in estimated height measures. On this basis, a map of vegetation height was generated at a national level and was combined with estimates of cover to produce a revised structural classification based on the scheme of the Australian National Vegetation Information System (NVIS). The benefits of integrating the three datasets for segmenting and classifying the landscape and retrieving biophysical attributes was highlighted with this leading the way for future mapping using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, Landsat/Sentinel-2, Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), and ICESat-2 LiDAR data. The ability to map across large areas provides considerable benefits for quantifying carbon dynamics and informing on biodiversity metrics.

TI  - A STUDY ABOUT LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGES IN NEGRO RIVER WATERHED, RIO GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL, BETWEEN 1977 AND 2016
T2  - BOLETIN GOIANO DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of land use and land cover changes mapping in Negro River Watershed, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, over a period of 39 years, between 1977 and 2016. For this purpose, we used Landsat satellites series images (1977, 1985, 1996, 2003 and 2016) and Digital Image Processing (PDI) and geographic data analysis using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The Maximum Likelihood method was chose for the supervised classification of satellite images. Based on the results of the mapping, we verified that the predominant LULC classes throughout the study period were: forest area, field and temporary culture. At first, the classes "field" and "temporary culture" began to occupy areas previously occupied by the class "forest area". In a second moment, the class " temporary culture" happened to occupy areas previously occupied by the " field" class. These changes coincided with the significant increase in soybean cultivation in the municipalities covered by the Rio Negro-RS river basin. In 2016, soybeans occupied 75,000ha, corresponding to 75.20% of the entire area occupied by temporary crops in these municipalities.

TI  - LEVELS OF THE WORLD. LIMITS AND EXTENSIONS OF NICOLAI HARTMANN'S AND WERNER HEISENBERG'S CONCEPTIONS OF LEVELS
T2  - HORIZON-FENOMENOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The conception that the world can be represented as a system of levels of being can be traced back to the beginnings of European philosophy and has lost little of its plausibility in the meantime. One of the important modern conceptions of levels was developed by Nicolai Hartmann. It exhibits remarkable similarities and contrasts with the classification of the real developed by Werner Heisenberg in his paper Ordnung der Wirklichkeit (Order of Reality). In my contribution I will introduce these two conceptions of levels and compare their salient features. I will discuss them as variants of a scientific worldview that attempts to forge a link to the perspective of the lifeworld. Then I will go on to argue that the shortcomings of these conceptions can be remedied by extending them with the level of the very small and that of the very large. The introduction of these ontologically fundamental levels is based on scientific knowledge that for the most part eludes the intuitively representable character of lifeworld experience. Historical changes in science and the lifeworld could lead to the notion that reality can be represented as a system of levels being challenged in future.

AB  - While many infrared camera-specific properties are considered for practical application, the influence of the radiation distribution surrounding the measuring spot is often neglected for thermal cameras. However, this has a significant influence on the uncertainty of thermal imaging cameras when measuring absolute temperatures, referred to as the size-of-source effect. Since thermal cameras acquire information about the radiation distribution around a potential point of interest through their spatially resolved measurement, neighborhood pixels could be used to reduce the uncertainty. In this paper, a convolution filter is presented whose parameters are optimized with regard to the compensation of the size-of-source effect for two different infrared cameras. The results show that the filter can reduce the effect significantly for different object geometries or even at the border of a thermal image. The algorithm could be applied to infrared cameras as a post-processing step in the future.

AB  - On-site controlling of subsidy measures in rural areas are cost- and time-intensive for authorities and can only be done for a small subset of subsidized areas within short time frames. The use of high resolution satellite image time series covers many applications in the field of agricultural monitoring. We present a method for an automated control system based on vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 image time series. We calculated a catch crop phenological reference profile (TS_ref) from a subset of sampling sites in the German federal state Rhineland-Palatinate and compared it with observed Sentinel time series (TS_obs) via Pearson's correlation coefficient. The utilization of the classification results reduces on-site controls noticeably and helps to define areas with higher and lower control demands.

AB  - Measured antennas as field sources in numerical simulation is by now a consolidated method to investigate deployed antenna performance. Typical applications are situations where a measurement of the entire scenario or a full-wave representation is unfeasible or unavailable [1-5]. Antenna placement on complex platforms such as satellites are good examples of such application. In these scenarios, the antennas are often supplied by a third party. Thus the mechanical and electronic characteristics needed for a full-wave representation of the antenna are likely unavailable or not in the right format for use by the Computational Electromagnetic (CEM) tool. To overcome this problem, the antenna can be fully characterized by measurement. The equivalent field source, compatible with the CEM tool, can then be derived, as a Huygens box, using an Equivalent Current (EQC) expansion [6-7].The measured field source was applied in the investigation of a GNSS antenna on a mock-up of the Sentinel satellite designed, manufactured and measured by RUAG SPACE [8]. This scenario was investigated in [9-10]. In this paper, the accuracy investigation is extended to include different CEM tools [11-12] and comparison with measurements of the full mock-up.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages during the glacial melt season in an Italian glacier-fed stream
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The biodiversity of glacier-fed streams is particularly threatened by climate change, emphasising the need of monitoring these sentinel systems. The glacier-fed Saldur stream is an International Long Term Ecological Research (ILTER) site in the Italian Central Eastern Alps. Here, we sampled benthic macroinvertebrates and measured environmental variables (discharge, suspended solids, conductivity, water temperature, and channel stability) five times at six sites (5-11km from the glacier) during an entire glacial melt season (April-September). Our main objectives were (1) to elucidate relationships between the abiotic variables and the faunal composition, (2) to quantify and compare the spatial and temporal variability of the faunal community, and (3) to assess the composition of the benthic macroinvertebrate community in relation to conceptual models. Hosting a higher number of individuals and more diverse communities at sites with reduced glacial influence, the Saldur stream fitted well in the framework of conceptual models. Nevertheless, the spatial variability of the fauna was higher than the temporal variability. This study presents an initial characterisation of the benthic faunal assemblages in the Saldur stream, constituting a reference point for future analyses dealing with potential disruptive factors introduced by climate change and upcoming hydroelectric power production on this stream.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of backswing speed on the golf swing using the 7 iron club for golf players and to provide basic data about the swing tempo and rhythm. Ten male golfers were participate in the experiment(age: 20.7±3.8 yr, height: 175.7±5.0 cm, weight: 76.9±8.5 kg, handy: 2.0±1.8). The intentional backswing speed was analyzed through three conditions(normal backswing: normal, fast backswing: fast, slow backswing: slow). Trackman data, swing time, displacement of center of mass, club head velocity, and ground reaction force were calculated through trackman, 3D motion analysis system and ground reaction force. In the power of the trackman data, club speed and ball speed fast appeared in the fast backswing depending on the backswing speed. In the swing time, the influence of the backswing speed did not appear in the downswing phase except for the backswing phase. Displacement of center of mass was not affected by the backswing speed. The club head velocity was faster at fast backswing speed at impact, and the follow swing was fast at fast backswing only on X axis. The ground reaction force did not show a difference the Fx and Fz on the backswing speed. However, in the Fy at the takebacks, the right foot showed a large rightward force and the left foot showed a large leftward force in the slow backswing.

TI  - From extreme weather to impacts: The role of the areas of concern maps in the JRC MARS bulletin
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Each month the JRC issues the MARS Bulletin detailing the agro-meteorological and expert analysis underpinning the assessment of European crops' status and yield forecasts. In this context a resume is provided to give an overview on the geographical distribution of eventual crop damages. The MARS Bulletin provides such information in a set of synthetic maps (Areas of Concern), produced in each Bulletin, depicting extreme weather events and their impact on crops that have occurred in Europe during the analysis period. The present article describes the mix of quantitative and qualitative datasets and methodologies that drive the delineation of the Areas of Concern (AOC) maps and evaluates their capability to resemble crop production losses. The quantitative analysis is based on the Mars Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS) indicators coming from meteorological models, crop growth models and remote sensing data. Indicators are considered in absolute and relative terms and in their relation with standard statistical metrics. The outcome of the quantitative analysis is a set of potential Areas of Concern. Experts' judgment is thus necessary to discriminate potential results through a qualitative analysis focused on: past occurred events and climatologic conditions; agro-management practices; regional agricultural systems peculiarity and their historical resilience and resistance to adverse conditions. In this article the experts' judgment of the team of current MARS analysts, as used in the AOC analysis, is translated into a warning index. Such index condenses the specific contribution to the final production of each development stage and the adverse agrometeorological events occurred, as depicted into the AOC maps. The warning index is computed at country scale for the past five agricultural seasons, from season 2011-2012 to season 2015-2016. Two crops are considered, winter wheat and grain maize as proxy for winter and summer crop groups. The warning indexes calculated are then compared to the national production in a qualitative way. To support the analysis few study cases are presented. The findings of this article highlight that the events depicted in the AOC maps are informative about production losses and specific knowledge is needed to full understand the information carried.

TI  - Eddy-Resolving In Situ Ocean Climatologies of Temperature and Salinity in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Circulation patterns and thermohaline fields of the Northwest Atlantic are highly variable in space and time and are strongly impacted by various mesoscale phenomena such as quasi-stationary frontal zones with sharp gradients, meandering jet-like currents, vortexes, and filaments. These all contribute to building and maintaining complex large-scale regional structures of ocean tracers, such as temperature and salinity, which persist over time periods of decades and longer. To reflect the existence of these long-term mesoscale phenomena and diagnose their changes, a new high-resolution in situ climatology of the Northwest Atlantic was developed. At its core, this eddy-resolving climatology, with 1/10 degrees horizontal resolution, reveals a cumulative effect of mesoscale dynamics within the Northwest Atlantic. Additionally, strong agreement exists between this in situ climatology and climatologies derived from high-resolution satellite data, thus providing a validation of the presence of stochastic periodicity of ocean tracer patterns on decadal timescales. Furthermore, large and very localized multidecadal subsurface heat gains southeast of the Gulf Stream was diagnosed using this new high-resolution regional climatology. It was demonstrated that the climatic shifts in the wind stress over the Northwest Atlantic may play a leading role in this heat accumulation due to subtropical water heaving through Ekman pumping. It is argued that uncovering many important details of long-term ocean climate variability from in situ ocean data can only be ascertained through the use of eddy-resolving climatologies.Plain Language Summary Historically, the long-term state of the global ocean, particularly for temperature and salinity, has been derived from in situ observational data and mapped to rather coarse horizontal resolutions of 1 degrees and more recently to 1/4 degrees. Most mesoscale activity, such as the meandering of jet streams, eddies, large vortexes, and filaments, cannot be adequately mapped with such resolutions. Unfortunately, in most places in the World Ocean a better resolution is unattainable due to limited observations. However, in a small number of ocean regions higher-resolution mapping is now possible. These regions are well sampled and in many cases are extremely important for the ocean and Earth's climate. The Northwest Atlantic is one of these regions. Using a large volume of temperature and salinity data, a new decadally averaged high-resolution (with 1/10 degrees) ocean climatology was compiled for this region and used, in conjunction with ancillary data, to assess ocean climate change and decadal variability in this region with higher accuracy over the past six decades.

AB  - The aim of this study is to understand the changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST) caused by the conversion of agricultural lands to residential and urban use. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellite data acquired on 30.09.1996 and 27.09.2018, respectively, were utilized to obtain LST images. Single Channel Algorithm was used as LST retrieval method. The study was conducted in eight test sites where farmlands converted to residential and urban areas. These test sites are located in Ceyhan city, which is one of the districts of Adana province in Southern Turkey, and the total area size not only test sites of the study area is 28.51 km(2). LST images were cross-validated with MODIS LST products and RMSEs were calculated as 2.5 K and 2.2 K for 1996 and 2018 LST images, respectively. Considering long term variations, the conversion of farmlands to residential and urban areas caused a distinctive increase in LST, which may lead to the changes in the regional climate patterns. This study showed that decision makers and city planners can consider LST images for a sustainable environment.

TI  - Tribute, Hostages, and Marriage Alliances: A Close Reading of Diplomatic Strategies in the Northern Wei Period
T2  - EARLY MEDIEVAL CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Early imperial and early medieval Chinese foreign relations have been mainly viewed through the prism of the so-called tributary system. Consequently, tribute relations with the Northern Wei court are either reduced to business ventures undertaken by foreign polities, or empty ideological exercises by the Tuoba emperors, who were only interested in having their worldview confirmed. Such views disregard the actual political and diplomatic value of tribute offerings to the Northern Wei. This article will provide a corrective through a close reading of diplomatic interactions recorded largely in the Wei shu that involved tribute offerings. Since these interactions sometimes also involved diplomatic hostages and marriage alliances, they will be briefly analyzed as well. I will show that tribute, in fact, was a political tool that was successfully utilized to meet various ends by both parties involved in bilateral exchanges. In the true sense of diplomatic interaction, tribute relations were highly effective means to negotiate peace.

AB  - Widespread deterioration of ageing infrastructure and the recent collapses of bridge structures highlight the vital importance of structural health monitoring. Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) provides remote measurements at millimetre scale over large areas, but the interpretation of such data into civil engineering contexts remains more than a trivial task. This work presents the monitoring of Waterloo Bridge to investigate the potential for InSAR to be used to support bridge management activities. Corner reflectors and target prisms for automated total station measurements have been installed at key points of interest as part of a wider structural monitoring system, and displacement data from traditional and satellite monitoring systems are compared and studied.

TI  - Temporal Changes in Mangrove Forest Coverage and Seasonal Influence on NDVI in Pichavaram Mangrove Forest, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical mangrove forests are rapidly degrading around the world and recent restoration activities are helping them to flourish again. Current study focused on temporal changes in Pichavaram mangrove forest coverage from 1970 to 2014 and seasonal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) changes in 2013-2014. Topomaps and Landsat series images were used to extract information from satellite images, the major degradation was found between 1970 and 1981. Recent restoration activities are very useful in expanding the forest cover. NDVI of Pichavaram forest was studied for different seasons of 2013-2014 year, and results showed that monsoon season plays a vital role in varying NDVI of forest. Vegetation density determined by NOVI values, was predominantly high and is expected to expand with restoration activities. This study helps to understand the overall mangrove cover changes in past 44 years and NDVI changes with rainfall. NDVI and rainfall correlation coefficient obtained was 0.87. The current status of mangrove forest updates will assist the policy makers to validate present restoration and also to draw a sustainable management plan for future.

AB  - In many attempts, remote sensing has been utilized to assist agriculture in the best management practice to improve production and minimize its impact on the environment. In palm oil agriculture in Indonesia, conversion of high conservation value forest into palm oil plantation area is a continuous major environmental concern. Many efforts have been done using remote sensing technology such as Landsat 8 and Landsat 4-5 TM imagery to obtain information. However, the degree in which the information has been used effectively to assist policy and other decision, limited research has been done. To add to the knowledge, this paper aims to present a review of recent studies on remote sensing and exemplify some of the main challenges to optimally support the attempt to minimize deforestation, at the same time improve palm oil production in Indonesia.

TI  - Modelling fuzzy combination of remote sensing vegetation index for durum wheat crop analysis
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of new technologies (e.g. Internet of Things, mechatronics, remote sensing) to the primary sector will reduce the production costs, limit the waste of primary materials, and reduce the release of polluting compounds into the environment. Precision agriculture (PA) has been growing in the last years thanks to industry efforts and development of applications for diagnostic purposes. Many applications in PA use vegetation indices to measure phenology parameters in terms of Leaf Area Index (IAI). In this context, the correlation of some vegetation indices were analyzed with respect to the durum wheat canopy, evaluating two different phenological stages (elongation and maturity). The results show that for the first stage of growth, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was the best-correlated vegetation index with LAI, while the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) was more reliable for the following stage of growth. Considering trials findings, a fuzzy expert system was developed to combine EVI and LSWI, obtaining a new combined index (Case-specific Fuzzy Vegetation Index) that better represents the LAI in comparison with the single indices. Thus, this approach could give place to a better representative vegetation index of a different biological condition of the plant. It may also serve as a reliable method for wheat yield forecasting and stress monitoring.

The code in general are presented as "notebooks" which are R Markdown files. You can knit the whole file or you can run the code chunks seperately. Each notebook includes detailed notes about the code for data wrangling and analysis. We can&#39;t share MAPS data directly. Brown Creeper analysis code will not work unless you have access to full MAPS data. However, we share an example analysis with simulated data under sim_example_CJSpop_run.R. Clone the repository and run sim_models_notebook.rmdto generate the .jags files. Then run sim_example_CJSpop_run.Rto obtain example results. If you have access to data, the main analysis has three parts: MAPS, Simulations, and Projections and Plotting. 1. MAPS Run the brcr_data_wrangling_notebook.rmdto prepare Brown Creeper MAPS data for CJS-pop in JAGS. Run brcr_models_notebook.rmdto generate the .jags files used in applying CJS-pop to BRCR capture history data. Easiest way is to knit the whole notebook. Run brcr_models.Rto apply 4 different mark-recapture models (3 different IRMs and one CJS) to Brown Creeper capture history data. These results are alos available in the file BRCR_results.rds. 2. Simulations Run data_generation_notebook.rmdto simulate capture history data as explained in Sen and Ak&ccedil;akaya (in review). Run sim_models_notebook.rmdto generate the .jags files used in applying CJS-pop to simulated data. Easiest way is to knit the whole notebook. We analysied the simulated data sets using the high performance comuputing cluster of Stony Brook University, which is named SeaWulf. We provide a sample code, sim_example_CJSpop_run.R, that can be run locally and analyses a single simulation set. This sample code can easily be extended to analyse all simulated sets in a single script in another cluster. 3. Projections and Plotting The plots and population projections in Sen and Ak&ccedil;akaya et al. (2019) can be reproduced with Plots.R.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Detection and segmentation of motorways, railroads and other roads with similar features are significant for comprehension of both low and high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Separation of transportation network from other fields or features is important to understand area contained in SAR image (i.e. the road density can inform about characteristic of that area). Standard image processing methods are inadequate to detect multiple linear targets correctly where computer vision, especially deep learning, provides more insight about features for different type of roads which help better discrimination of multiple linear features like roads and railroads. State-of-art deep learning algorithms are proposed as solutions for understanding road characteristics and extraction of multiple roads. In this paper, a method which uses deep convolutional neural network (DeepLabv3+) backbone architecture is proposed to detect road and railways concurrently. Semantic segmentation of roads using SAR imagery is challenging since these images differ as ground sample distance changes with sensor types which creates a setback for establishing dataset for all sensors. Training set contains 3 classes (road, railway, other) with collected signatures from TerraSAR-X Spotlight images for classification. Proposed method shows robust performance when applied to other sensor and results are presented.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is spreading at an extremely rapid pace in the agricultural sector as in many other sectors. In many areas such as biomass, disease detection, water stress, irrigation, and soil moisture determination, UAVs can be used in agriculture. The biggest problem of irrigation managers is to not be able to fully determine the irrigation activities in the irrigation area by conventional methods. In this study, the possibility of determining the agricultural parcels where irrigation is carried out in the irrigation scheme was investigated with a UAV. During the study, thermal images obtained with a Matrice 600 pro loaded with Zenmuse XT capable of radiometric temperature measurement with 640*320 resolution were used. Thermal images were interpreted by Agisoft Pro. As a result of the study, it has been determined that the irrigation activities carried out in the scheme can be determined easily, especially with the images taken on the first date of the irrigation. In addition, a thermal camera mounted UAV can be detected easily at the points where the leakage losses occur at the irrigation site. thus, irrigation management is determined in areas that need to be concentrated for maintenance services.

AB  - The article deals with morphology-derivational aspect of analytization tendencies, which are evidenced by the active use of analytical derivation, in particular complex lexemes not typical for the Russian language. Analytical constructions become active in the modern Russian literal language which evidences appearance of a stratum of affix-root word components in the language system with system bounds. It is affirmed that analytical constructions is a significant part of the vocabulary fixed by dictionaries proving Russian lexical innovations. This illustrates a prominent function of analytical constructions in the modern linguistic consciousness: many aspects of the modern Russian life are reflected in affixoids semantics; the displayed cognitive matrix "Russian society" has different cognitive contexts, disclosing language priorities, reflecting the tastes adequate to modern Russia. Active use of analytical word-building models, characterized by significant structural-semantic morpheme discreteness, evidences weakening of traditional morphonologic mechanisms and introduction of a different grammatical system to traditional synthetic performance. The purpose of the article is to determine activity of analytical compounds, study the process of analytization of the Russian language system in the aspect of the national cultural world view. It has been proved that at the modern stage of the Russian language development there is a necessity to study this language phenomenon beyond the traditional system-structural paradigm, which necessitates to pay attention to the character of the contemporary national cultural world view, determine its peculiarities in Russian ethnological linguistic culture.

AB  - This research observed variation of flow velocity on the David Glacier, East Antarctica observed by using Sentinel-1A satellite. Because of the 12-day revisit cycle, relatively slow-flowing area was observed. Using double-differential InSAR (DDInSAR) technique, we could find the circular shaped velocity anomaly. We combined the ascending and descending DDInSAR images to figure out the direction of the true displacement over the anomaly. As a result, the circular anomaly appears mainly to be a vertical movement, not in the flow direction. This vertical movement in the David Glacier, where subglacial lakes are known to exist, can be thought of as a signal of water level change of a subglacial lake forming a subglacial channel system.

AB  - This paper is on the study of the character's identity in Heo Jun's “The Faint Lamplight”. In the piece, the author depicts the journey of the main character from Changchun to Gyeongseong via Hoeryong and Chongjin. The work is the author's autobiographical content, as he returned home from his stint in the Manchurian capital.The piece first depicts the main character's escape from Manchuria due to Japan's defeat.  And this escape and return clearly shows that there is a great difference in sentiment and worldview from the hopeful return of the exiled to their emancipated homeland because it was a war refugee's.This is the part that reveals the value of this work. The author describes in detail how the main character, who is a war refugee, is transformed into a Korean through a ritual of returning home. Some important scenes are produced and illustrated by how the gap between war refugees and Koreans is overcome through some mediums. Describing a relative farmer in Manchuria who lived a hard life, a boy who catches Japanese fleeing in a rural area near Chongjin, and an old woman who runs a soup kitchen to help Japanese who are in exile, he claims universal cause and international solidarity beyond the people's morals.Although it was not positively accepted at that time and was considered a literary achievement of no passion, Heo Jun's theme is considered a valuable literary legacy that should be repeated all over again.

AB  - This research aimed to ascertain the influence of music and art in modern Korean novels, based on Jang Jeong-il’s belief in jazz, Lee Je-ha’s “Yuja-yakjeon” Kim Young-ha’s “I Have the Right to Destroy Myself,” Park Chan-soon’s “Slow Running Train to Amsterdam,” and Park Min-gyu’s “Fabanne for the Dead Queen.” The pictorial motifs in Kim Young-ha’s novel “The Death of Mara,” Klimt’s “The Judith,” and Delacroix’s painting “The Death of Sardanapal” were used to construct and characterize in his novel. The paintings in his novel are the most important keywords for reading the novel’s themes as well as the author’s worldview and consciousness.While Kim Young-ha tries to identify with Delacroix through his novel “I Have the Right to Destroy Myself” Park summons Diego Velasquez, a Spanish court painter, in the novel “Fabanne for the Dead Queen.” Park Min-gyu, who has mainly painted “Minority’s Life,” pays attention to the “servant girl” in Bellace’s painting with a slightly awkward plot and re-instates it as the master of the novel. Morris’ piano song“ Fabanne for the Dead Queen” is also super-imposed on the image of the dwarf in the painting, thus heightening the tragic atmosphere of the novel. Park Chan-soon’s “Slow Running Train to Amsterdam” also uses the music motif to emphasize the theme as well as the development of the novel.Above all, Jang Jung-il and his current musical and painting techniques are being introduced into novel forms, thereby contributing to the expansion of the realm of fiction. The uncertainty about the variable world in which people believe in jazz leads to the spirit of jazz, which varies with the emotion and technique of the performer. In addition, through the “Yuja-yakjeon” a multi-ethnic character is created and the “Yuja” is incorporated into a novel with the same techniques that overlap time and space. The formal experiment of such a novel is the result of a pictorial imagination based on the writer’s expressionism and surrealism.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Lineaments constitute an interesting approach in the geological mapping and the exploration of resources such as minerals, energy and groundwater. With the use of remote sensing technology structural lineaments can be better detected, due to strong advances in using data and methods that enable us to exceed the usual classical procedures and achieve more precise results. The aim of this work is combining and comparing different techniques of automatic extraction of lineaments in the Palaeozoic massif of Rehamna located in the western Moroccan Meseta. Three methods were used to extract lineaments from Landsat 8 Oli, Sentinel 1 and DEM images. In the first method, four derived images were generated by applying frequential directional filters, in all possible directions (NS, NE-SW, EW, and NW-SE), to RGB composite images and the principal component analysis (PCA) of Landsat 8 OLI. These filters increase the image contrast and allow mapping a large number of lineaments. The second method consists to extract lineaments automatically by using level 1 GRD (Ground Range Distance) of Sentinel 1, according to IW mode with the polarizations (VH) and (VV). Finally, shaded relief images were generated from DEM created by radar interferometry with the resolution of 13m, made by two Single Look Complex (SLC) of sentinel 1 images, and the DEM SRTM with a resolution of 30m. The results were compared with pre-existing geological data and Google Earth images, and were satisfying.

AB  - The article is devoted to study of the dramaturgy in Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's opera The Tsar Bride by the example of the composer's interpretation of the sphere of counter-action, the latter sphere holding a prominent position and being of special importance for the opera. The counter-sphere in question determines most prominently the opera's linguistic and conceptual novelty. It is substantiated that the opera conception lacks the traditional bipolarity of the real and the fantastic worlds, so typical for Rimsky-Korsakov, as well as a number of other elements of his operatic poetics, while, at the same time, preserves fully within the conception of the opera the principles of global conceptualization of the operatic material by means of the mythopoetic picture of the world, and is based on the opposition between the two worlds, musically expressed through the opposition between different pitch systems, as if they were 'heterogeneous semiotic spaces.' But the treatment of the material differs here from the way it is treated in the composer's other works.The special complex character of The Tsar Bride is expressed in the fact that the different intonational and semantic layers interact with each other within a single 'real world, and their juxtaposition stems from the background of the characters' inner lives and characterizes their inner space and that 'struggle of the worlds' occurring there. The opera's musical text is organized in such a way as to emancipate the pitch system of the counter-sphere, to assign to it a 'sign' character, thereby producing a kind of 'text within the text.' The latter text exists in a hidden manner within the harmonic layer of the main action, thereby 'signifying' the protagonists' link to the space of the lower abyss, according to the Christian worldview.It is the creation of the integral semiotic domain of the counter-sphere which would speak its own language, and its representation as a system, is what comprises, according to the author, the novelty of the opera, as well as the hidden layer in its dramaturgy. The interaction within it of all the protagonists of the counter-sphere has been elaborated by the composer as a consistently expressed conception.The leitmotiv system of the counter-sphere in The Tsar Bride is analyzed in the article in the aforementioned conceptual perspective.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The research is devoted to the problem of estimations of CO2 fluxes between the hydrosphere and atmosphere. Hurricane-force winds lead to intensive wave breaking, with formation of spray in the air, and bubbles in the water. It strongly intensifies gas flux characterizing by power dependence of the transfer rate on the 10-m height wind speed used for approximation of the empirical results. But available data demonstrate wide variation which leads large confidence limits for coefficients in empirical approximations. On the other hand there is an obvious problem of obtaining reliable data on the wind speed. Widely used reanalysis data typically underestimate wind speed magnitude, due to the low spatial and temporal resolution. One of the most promising ways to measure near water wind speed is the use of the data of remote sensing. The present study used technique to achieve wind speed based on the processing sea surface images obtained in cross-polarized mode with C-band (5.4 GHz) radar with synthesized aperture (RSA) of RADARSAT satellite. To this propose geophysical model function (GMF) which binds values of wind speed and normalized radar cross section in cross-polarized mode was used. This GMF was developed in a special laboratory experiment on the wind-wave flumes for a wide range of wind speeds, including hurricanes. In turn, for parameterization of gas transfer rate results of recent laboratory experiment on high speed wind-wave flume was used.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on the biographical circumstances of B. L. Pasternak in 1930-1932 connected with the family conflict: his departure from his first wife Evgenia Pasternak and unification with his second wife Zinaida Neuhaus. The paper is based on unpublished sources, i.e. archival documents. Letters of the Pasternak family members and their close friends living both in Moscow and in Germany are extensively cited. The analysis of these texts gives a lot of new material for the correction established terms in the study of the Pasternaks. The assessments and attitude of the family affected the worldview of Boris Pasternak and his decisions. The family, with its moral imperative and a clear system of values, was always his most important reference point. The feeling of psychological affinity of Zinaida Neuhaus to the spiritual world of the Pasternak family and the common feeling of strangeness to this world of Evgenia Pasternak strongly affected the attitude of the poet ("To love some is a heavy load,// Your charm is pure, no convolution"). In the light of such a detailed biographical commentary, some Pasternak's verses could be understood more deeply, first of all the book The Second birth. The image of Zinaida Neuhaus-Pasternak entrenched in the cultural consciousness thanks to numerous late memoirs also needs corrections. This is important for understanding the psychology of the author of Doctor Zhivago. The novel reflects the personality traits of Zinaida Neuhaus. At last, the life choices of Boris Pasternak become clearer, which is of great importance for literary historians.

TI  - Means of Irony Expression in German Translations of Gogol's Texts
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The question of irony expression means in the original literary text and the degree of their identity in translation into German by the material of N. V. Gogol's works and their German translations is considered. Traditional and modern definitions of irony in linguistics are given. The author defines the structural and functional status of irony as an implicit form of expression of the author's modality that implements intentions, value positions, the worldview of a literary text author. The main linguistic means of its expression are revealed. The problem of identity of the translation of texts containing irony into another language is discussed. The features of the conveying ironic meanings in the literary text are revealed. The equivalent German translations of ironic contexts and problematic aspects of conveying ironic meaning into German in N. V. Gogol's works are established and analyzed. The causes of distortion in ironic meanings in translations are established. It is concluded that irony realized in N. V. Gogol's literary texts using a variety of linguistic means is characterized by the complexity of translation into a foreign language and in some cases can be classified as untranslatable.

TI  - Evaluation of Normalized Difference Water Index as a Tool for Monitoring Pasture Seasonal and Inter-Annual Variability in a Mediterranean Agro-Silvo-Pastoral System
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive animal production in Iberian Peninsula is based on pastures, integrated within the important agro-silvo-pastoral system, named montado in Portugal and dehesa in Spain. Temperature and precipitation are the main driving climatic factors affecting agricultural productivity and, in dryland pastures, the hydrological cycle of soil, identified by soil moisture content (SMC), is the main engine of the vegetation development. The objective of this work was to evaluate the normalized difference water index (NDWI) based on Sentinel-2 imagery as a tool for monitoring pasture seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variability in a Mediterranean agro-silvo-pastoral system. Forty-one valid NDWI records were used between January and June 2016 and between January 2017 and June 2018. The 2.3 ha experimental field is located within the Mitra farm, in the South of Portugal. Soil moisture content, pasture moisture content (PMC), pasture surface temperature (T-ir), pasture biomass productivity and pasture quality degradation index (PQDI) were evaluated in 12 satellite pixels (10 m x 10 m). The results show significant correlations (p < 0.01) between NDWI and: (i) SMC (R-2 = 0.7548); (ii) PMC (R-2 = 0.8938); (iii) T-ir (R-2 = 0.5428); (iv) biomass (R-2 = 0.7556); and (v) PQDI (R-2 = 0.7333). These findings suggest that satellite-derived NDWI can be used in site-specific management of montado ecosystem to support farmers' decision making.

TI  - Real-world testing and treatment patterns in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: A SEER patterns of care analysis
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Laboratory testing and treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have changed dramatically within the last decade. The authors evaluated changes in patterns of real-world testing and treatment over time by comparing 2 population-based cohorts. Methods The National Cancer Institute-sponsored Patterns of Care study was conducted among patients with CLL who were sampled from 14 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program registries. Demographics, testing, and treatment data were abstracted from medical records within 24 months of diagnosis. Results A total of 1008 patients diagnosed in 2008 and 1367 patients diagnosed in 2014 were included. There was a significant increase in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgV(H)) mutation analyses, and lymph node biopsies between 2008 and 2014. FISH testing was performed in the majority of, but not all, treated patients (53% in 2008, which increased to 62% in 2014). Some differences in the receipt of FISH testing by age and insurance status were observed over time (older patients and Medicare patients without private insurance were less likely to be tested in 2014). There were contrasting testing patterns noted by practice type and year, with nonteaching hospitals more likely to perform bone marrow biopsies in 2008, and teaching hospitals more likely to perform FISH and IgV(H) testing in 2014. There also were differences in treatments over time, with the use of bendamustine and rituximab being more common in 2014, at the expense of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Conclusions There have been rapidly changing practices in the testing and treatment patterns of patients with CLL within the last decade. (c) 2018 American Cancer Society.

AB  - When it comes to disaster management and mitigation, remote sensing data is considered as one of the most valuable sources of information due to its ability to quickly access to the affected area and all-weather, day and night imaging capability. However, considering the long revisit time of most optical and radar sensors orbiting the Earth, multi-temporal disasters monitoring remains a very challenging task. In this paper, a multimodal, multitemporal approach for fusing optical and radar images in the context of flooded areas extraction is introduced. First, potential flooded pixels contained in pre- and post-disaster images are extracted based on the Structural Feature Set (SFS) texture measurement and a modified water index. Then, Attribute Filters (AF) are applied to the resulting images in order to filter out small-sized objects and retain high probability flooded areas. Finally, homogeneous regions resulting from the previous step are used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier used later to classify optical or radar images of the event into flooded and unflooded areas. In order to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, our methodology was applied to time-series optical and radar images acquired before and during three different flooding events: 1) Rockhampton, Australia in 2017; 2) Texas, USA in 2017; and 3) Kerala, India in 2018. Experiments show that our approach gives very promising results and demonstrate the potential of fusing multimodal and multitemporal images.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - Open water season (OWS) changes in the Kara Sea coastal zone near Marresalya are analyzed using satellite-derived sea ice concentration data. In addition to state of the art 15% threshold method, original data-based rolling window approach was implemented to define the open water season characteristics (start/end dates, duration). To validate the results sea cover observations on Marresalya station, sea ice charts and Terra/MODIS images were used. Linear trend coefficients and RMSE (comparing with sea ice cover observations) were used as the main quality metrics.Near Marresalya the open water season duration increased significantly (alpha-level < 0.05) in recent decades (1979-2015) with the mean rates of 7-9 days/decade. The OWS start dates shifted to earlier dates with the mean rates about 4-6 days/decade while the end dates significantly shifted to later period with mean rates of 3 days/decade. Obtained OWS characteristics for nearshore satellite data pixels correspond to observations and sea ice charts archives. It is shown, that satellite-derived sea ice concentration data could be successfully used for the coastal zone cases.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to understand the postmaterialistic paradigm of science in the context of a holistic worldview and evolutionary worldview processes. The cosmological model of Helena Blavatsky, who systematically introduced the symmetric structure of the universe in the form of a hierarchy of mutual-integrational structures of matter of different levels, from crude physical matter to the most subtle, spiritual substance, is the methodological basis of the holistic picture of the world. The unity of the system, according to Blavatsky, is provided by the egregore of the Absolute, approximated by conceptual content to the Transcendent. Accordingly, the absolute foundation of the world is an egregore that emits energy of a higher level than traditional energy sources, limited to the physical picture of the world. The article substantiates the conceptual foundations of the postmaterialistic paradigm of science, based on the achievements of quantum physics, synergetics, eniology and the theory of physical vacuum. The principles of the postmaterialistic paradigm (the ontological principle of holism, the principle of teleological hierarchy, the principle of materialistic-ideal complementarity, the anthropic principle of the predefinition of man and the world, the principle of the spiritual determiner of all theories of being) allowing to change radically the methods of energy use, applying the energy potential of the egregore for subtle, non-material matters of reality to upgrade the energy efficiency taking into account the axiological dominant, are explicated.

AB  - In this research the emotional and valuable component of civic identity of the youth population of the Mari El Republic is considered.The purpose of this article is to analyze civic identity of modern youth of the republic in aspect of its understanding Russia as a common home for peoples of Russia.The material for analytical generalizations of sociological data obtained as a result of a survey of residents of the Mari El Republic at the age from 15 to 29 years old (more than 750 people were interviewed) on the topic "Civic and ethnic identity of youth in the context of inter-ethnic relations in a multicultural space", which was held in September-October, 2018, by employees of the Mari Scientific Research Institute of Language, Literature and History named after V. M. Vasilyev. The survey was conducted by the method of random repetition-free quota sampling in 2 cities, 6 districts and 5 urban-type settlements. The method of formally standardized interview was used for the collection of sociological information.During the research the question "Your attitude towards Russia as to the home for peoples of Russian" with the list of the possible answers, capable to present the level of formation of respondents' ethic and legal consciousness, tolerant and humanistic worldview, was offered to respondents.Based on the analysis of sociological data, it has proved, that modern youth of the Mari El Republic concerning the attitude towards Russia as a home for peoples of Russian has the pronounced positive civic identity, including respect for the equal and mutually enriching principle of the existence of peoples in the multinational state.In this article the attitude of young people towards Russia as a common home for peoples of Russian depending on the ethnic identification of the respondents, their age, level of education and material wellbeing of the family is considered.Young people in their vast majority (more than two thirds) - both in general and for individual qualification groups, identified according to ethnic self-definition, age, education level and material well-being of the family, - consider, that Russia is the common home for many nations, exerting their influence on each other, that all peoples of Russia should have equal rights, and nobody should has any advantages.To the fullest extent people's equality in the common Russian home is recognized by the Tatars, youth at the aged 15-19 years, respondents with higher and incomplete higher education, people from lower-income families.There are few supporters of the idea of prevalence of the rights of the Russians as a state-forming and most numerous nation; there are more of them among Mari people, young people at the aged of 20-24, from a middle-income family and among the least educated part of youth.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The unplanned urbanisation especially in the developing countries has led to the urban heat islands (UHI) largely impacting the local climate. The present study was carried out to assess the capability of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) product at a spatial resolution of 1 km for capturing urban heat island phenomenon of Srinagar city located in North West Himalaya, India. Satellite images acquired from MODIS has a revisit time for one day. Our analysis indicated that the LST data at the four observation times for the month of July 2012 is higher in urban built-up area than those within the surrounding suburbs. The built-up area and thermal signatures, as extracted from MODIS showed a good correlation thus establishing a fact that urbanisation leads to UHI effect. We suggest ensemble approach using machine learning, neural networks that could be worked upon to obtain an optimal predictive framework.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Lymph node metastases are the most significant prognostic factor in localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Identification of the first nodal drainage site (sentinel node) may improve detection of metastatic nodes. Extended surgeries, such as lobectomy or pneumonectomy with lymph node dissection, are among the therapeutic options of higher acceptability. Sentinel node biopsy can be an alternative approach to less invasive surgeries. The current study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of sentinel node mapping in patients with NSCLC using an intraoperative radiotracer techniques.METHODS: This prospective study was conducted on 21 patients with biopsy-proven NSCLC who were candidates for sentinel node mapping during 2012-2014. All patients underwent thoracoabdominal computed tomography, based on which they had no lymph node involvement. Immediately after thoracotomy and before mobilizing the tumor, peritumoral injection of 2mCi/0.4 mL Tc-99m- phytate was performed in 4 corners of tumor. After mobilization of the tumoral tissues, the sentinel nodes were searched for in the hillar and mediastinal areas using hand-held gamma probe . Any lymph node with in vivo count twice the background was considered as sentinel node and removed and sent for frozen section evaluation. All dissected nodes were evaluated by step sectioning and hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E).The recorded data included age, gender, kind of pathology, site of lesion, number of dissected sentinel nodes, number of sentinel nodes, and site of sentinel nodes. Data analysis was performed in SPSS software (version 22).RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 58.52±11.46 years with a male to female ratio of 15/6. The left lower lobe was the most commonly affected site (30.09%). Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma were detected in 11 and 10 subjects, respectively. A total of 120 lymph nodes were harvested with the mean number of 5.71±2.9 lymph nodes per patient. At least one sentinel node was identified in each patient, resulting in a detection rate of 95.2%. The mean number of sentinel nodes per patient was 3.61±2. Frozen section results showed 100% concordance with the results of hematoxylin and eosin staining.CONCLUSION: Based on the findings, sentinel node mapping can be considered feasible and accurate for lymph node staging and NSCLC treatment.

AB  - Over the last five decades the Karakoram Glaciers has revealed irregular behavior and lack of stability. These anomalies lead surge of glaciers and the formation of glacier lakes, and now risk increasing in the context of climate change. The hazard associated with glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) has become an increasingly serious threat to the life, property, livelihoods and infrastructure in the Karakoram Mountains of Pakistan. Shishper Glacier Lake in the Shishper watershed areas of central Hunza in North Pakistan, after its latest activity has turned to a highly prone GLOF hazard. Shishper Glacier and Glacier Lake in the North Pakistan can be harmful to the downstream population and have large socioeconomic impacts if an outburst occurs. This study investigated the spatio-temporal changes in Shishper glacier and its glacial lake, and associated risk of potential GLOF hazard. Shishper glacier was assessed on the basis of field survey carried out in December 2018 combine with GIS and remote sensing data for morphometric, land cover change, physical vulnerability and temporal analysis of Shishper glacier. The Glacier has shown an anomalous behavior in the month of July 2018, no prominent lake was observed while in the month of November 2018 a lake with an area of 0.026 km2 was noticed. Similarly, in the month January, 2019 a prominent lake appeared with an area of 0.057 km2. The physical vulnerability results showed that 80% of the area of Hassanabad village is highly exposed to GLOFs hazard, whereas low lying areas along the Hunza River are also susceptible to inundation. The results show that there is immediate danger of catastrophic outburst through downward movement of the glacier. The study recommends the glacier has an anomalous behavior, it is necessary to monitor the glacier and Glacier Lake continuously, and minimize the adverse effects of potential GLOFs risk. We also recommend strong understanding the phenomenon of glaciers therefore, glacier lakes are very important in north Pakistan with respect to GLOF disaster management.

TI  - Evaluating susceptibility of the 2005 earthquake produced landslides in Kashmir region, Northern Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIMALAYAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On October 8th, 2005 a devastating earthquake in the Kashmir region has triggered widespread landslides, which were considered the second most important driver of devastation to the natural and man-made environment after the earthquake. Landslides susceptibility assessment is the prerequisite for the landslide management, however, considering the dynamic spatial-temporal distribution of co-seismic landslides, an updated landslide susceptibility assessment is of fundamental importance. This paper has evaluated the earthquake-induced landslides and developed an updated landslide susceptibility map. A detailed inventory of the co-seismic landslides is acquired from the SPOT-5 satellite image and field observations. The developed landslide inventory is subsequently cross analyzed with the ASTER based Digital Elevation Model (DEM) computed topographic parameters (curvature, slope angle, aspect, drainage pattern), geology, human activities and fault lines to investigate their influence on landsldies distribution. The derived correlations were statistically analyzed using a Weight-of-Evidence model to develop the landslide susceptibility map. The accuracy of the developed landslide susceptibility is 74 %. The acquired susceptibility map can be used by the relevant departments for the landslide's mitigation and risk reduction.

TI  - ANALYZING SITE SUITABILITY FOR SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL THROUGH GIS MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION MAKING HIERARCHY PROCESS
T2  - 3C TECNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently the human beings are encircled by multiple types of problems, out of those the environmental degradation issue is one of the major problem which is caused by over population, rapid increase of urbanization and industrialization which result in production of huge quantity of solid wastes. Thus the effectual solid waste management and its disposal arrangements are required. Another major problem being faced globally is to locate an appropriate area for the disposal of hazardous wastes by overcoming main constraints including environmental, economic and political for spotting of a suitable site. In this study our focus is to spot a proper landfill site for the disposal of hazardous wastes for which we have selected industrial (radioactive) wastes of the district of Karachi East as a area for research. This district has wide range of Korangi Industrial Area and small portion of Landhi Industrial Area. In this research we have used methods of Decision Support System (DSS) based on Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) concerning all supportable measures. With the assist of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), suitable alternative site for dumping solid waste has been selected on the basis of different factors performed on Arc Map 10.3, Erdas Imagine, e-Cognition developer by considering the decision maker's expectations. The results show that after performing different investigations on the suitability indexes, the analyzed area which is most suitable for solid waste dumping is 200m away from Malir River.

CL  - Univ Brawijaya, East Java, INDONESIA
AB  - Monitoring of the environment over a large area will require huge amount of data. The implementation of conventional methods will be time consuming and very costly. Furthermore, one way to assess the environmental sustainability is by analysing the changes of land cover over two different periods. Therefore, this study implemented a cloud computing approach utilising an open source Remote Ecosystem Monitoring Assessment Pipeline (REMAP) to map the changes of Land use land cover (LULC) over Peninsular Malaysia utilising Landsat data obtained from two different periods (2003 and 2017). This approach has utilised a powerful inbuilt machine learning algorithm, Random Forest (RF) to test the performance of cloud computing using REMAP to produce LULC maps over Peninsular Malaysia. The results showed an acceptable LULC maps and the changes between two periods were analysed. Therefore, the utilisation of machine learning algorithm with the integration of cloud computing using REMAP can reduce the cost, lessen the processing time, produce LULC maps, and perform change analysis over large area.

TI  - Mapping the Distribution of Oil Palm using Landsat 8 Data by Comparing Machine Learning and Non-Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm is one of the major crops in Malaysia; it accounts for 47% of the global palm oil supply. Equatorial climate has provided Malaysia with the potential to produce oil palm biomass, which is one of the major contributors to the local economy. The utilisation of oil palm biomass as a source of renewable energy is one of the effective methods to promote green energy. Therefore, there is a need to have sufficient data related to oil palm biomass such as yield estimation, oil palm distributions, and locations. The aim of this study was to produce a land cover map on the distribution of oil palm plantations on three districts located in Selangor. Landsat 8 images of resolutions 15 x 15 m were used and classified via machine learning and non-machine learning algorithms. In this study, three different classifier algorithms were compared using support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and maximum likelihood classifications in which the values obtained for overall accuracy were 98.96%, 99.39%, and 15.30% respectively. The output showed that machine learning algorithms, support vector machines and artificial neural networks gave rise to high accuracies. Hence, the mapping of oil palm distributions via machine learning algorithm was better than that via non-machine learning algorithm.

TI  - Analysis of a dense haze event over North-eastern Pakistan using WRF-Chem model and remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas in Pakistan are experiencing escalation in haze episodes. Due to increase in economy, emissions of gaseous and aerosol components from automobiles, road constructions and industry is growing in Pakistan which has resulted in worsening air quality during winter and post-monsoon season. North Eastern (NE) Pakistan (71-74.5 degrees E, 28-34 degrees N) is experiencing haze and fog episodes because of the increase in aerosol pollution levels. In addition to anthropogenic emissions, winter pollution over NE Pakistan is associated with unfavourable meteorological conditions. Lahore, a metropolitan city in NE Pakistan experienced a dense haze event during the first week of November 2016. In this article, we examine the pollution levels before, during and after this heavily polluted episode in NE Pakistan based on model simulations and remote sensing data. In particular, the Weather Research Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) and pertinent satellite data from MODIS are utilized towards validation. Another goal of this study is to characterize sources and causes of this haze event especially over Lahore. Particulate matter concentrations, AOD, and concentration of gaseous components increased many folds than the usual levels. Additionally, Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) results are presented from measurements by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite revealing vertical layers of aerosol of thickness ranging from 2 to 5 km in the study region and period.

TI  - Paediatric asthma clinical pathway: Impact on cost and quality of care.
T2  - The Medical journal of Malaysia
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Uncontrolled asthma may cause an increase in healthcare utilisation, hospital admission and productivity loss. With the increasing burden of asthma in Malaysia, strategies aimed at reducing cost of care should be explored.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine if a clinical pathway (CPW) for inpatient paediatric asthma would reduce average length of stay (ALOS), improve asthma management and decrease cost.METHODS: A quasi-experimental, pre-post study was used to evaluate the CPW effectiveness. Paediatric inpatients aged 5-18 years old, admitted for acute asthma exacerbation from September 2015 to April 2016 were prospectively recruited. Data from patients admitted from January-July 2015 were used as control. CPW training was carried out in August 2015 using standardised modules. Direct admission cost from the provider's prospective was calculated. Outcomes compared were differences in ALOS, discharge medication, readmission within 28 days of discharge and cost.RESULTS: ALOS is 26 hours lower in the CPW group for severe exacerbations and underlying uncontrolled asthma (19.2 hours) which is clinically significant as patients have shorter hospital stay. More newly-diagnosed intermittent asthmatics were discharged with relievers in the CPW group (p-value 0.006). None of the patients in the CPW group had readmissions (p-value 0.16). Mean treatment cost for patients in the intervention group is higher at RM843.39 (SD ±48.99, versus RM779.21 SD±44.33).CONCLUSION: This study found that management using a CPW may benefit asthmatic patients with uncontrolled asthma admitted with severe exacerbation. Further studies will be needed to explore CPW's impact on asthma management starting from the emergency department.

AB  - In this research work we have investigated the impact on landcover of one of the most powerful storm, Fani which strike the State of Odisha, India. The investigation is performed by investigating the texture features obtained from both pre-strike and post-strike satellite images. Initially, the texture visual features are obtained for the pre-images which are later compared with the post-strike image. The features are obtained through Grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) change detection (CD) technique which provides both spectral and spatial information about the different types of changes that got established in the land cover through Fani destruction. Histogram plots also suggest that the change in the texture of the land cover occurs which are further quantified through GLCM technique. GLCM is obtained for different orientation angles i.e.. Finally, change in the texture features in term of percentage is obtained.

AB  - Change detection (CD) from the Earth's surface has developed into an important issue throughout the world. CD methods have found applicability in socioeconomic assessments, environmental monitoring, exploring resources, etc., and till today, various numbers of CD methodologies utilising remotely sensed data have been developed. Researchers have categorised different CD techniques on the basis of distinct viewpoints. A common one is to associate different techniques in two categories pre-classification CD and post-classification CD. This paper examines the efficiency of post-classification, texture-based CD method. Changing conditions are investigated for the three cases of civic urbanisation, depleted lake's water and surging rivers and lake. Changes in the image parameters are first analysed with first order statistics, i.e. (non-zero 'mean' and 'standard deviation'), and then changes in the visual characteristics are quantitatively measured through the grey level by second-order statistical parameters. Contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity are the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features which predict change in the 'visual' appearance of the texture. Texture gets converted from one form to another form represented by pre- and post-grey level image, respectively. Finally, we have established a novel changing 'pattern' of the texture from the aforesaid three cases.

AB  - The networks of the ground meteorological stations in several basins are most often insufficient and inadequate, which causes a paucity in the rainfall data, and these are regarded as the basic inputs for the models of water resources. Therefore, a good alternative information source is required. This paper gives a report on the applicability of using satellite derived precipitation data, which is essential for the simulation models of the Galal-Badra basin that lies in both the Iranian and Iraqi regions. Two scenarios to be validated were used, first by using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) to generate the satellite precipitation data for the 1998 -2009 period and employ that data to compare with the data from the rain gauge stations available in the basin. The second was accomplished by using the Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA POWER) for the 1994-2005 period. The validation of the techniques was tested statistically by using coefficient of determination (R2) and slope besides the correlation coefficient (r) and the results obtained were concurrent, as (r = 0.95; R2= 0.83 and the slope = 0.7) when using the TRMM; however, these values are lower when NASA-POWER is used. Both results suggested a positive correlation between the satellite and observed data, and thereby satellite data was sufficient for simulation of the different hydrological processes.

TI  - Integrating Satellite and Ground Measurements for Predicting Locations of Extreme Urban Heat
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of urban heat as a climate-induced health stressor is receiving increasing attention among researchers, practitioners, and climate educators. However, the measurement of urban heat poses several challenges with current methods leveraging either ground based, in situ observations, or satellite-derived surface temperatures estimated from land use emissivity. While both techniques contain inherent advantages and biases to predicting temperatures, their integration may offer an opportunity to improve the spatial resolution and global application of urban heat measurements. Using a combination of ground-based measurements, machine learning techniques, and spatial analysis, we addressed three research questions: (1) How much do ambient temperatures vary across time and space in a metropolitan region? (2) To what extent can the integration of ground-based measurements and satellite imagery help to predict temperatures? (3) What landscape features consistently amplify and temper heat? We applied our analysis to the cities of Baltimore, Maryland, and Richmond, Virginia, and the District of Columbia using geocomputational machine learning processes on data collected on days when maximum air temperatures were above the 90th percentile of historic averages. Our results suggest that the urban microclimate was highly variable across all of the cities-with differences of up to 10 degrees C between coolest and warmest locations at the same time-and that these air temperatures were primarily dependent on underlying landscape features. Additionally, we found that integrating satellite data with ground-based measures provided highly accurate and precise descriptions of temperatures in all three study regions. These results suggest that accurately identifying areas of extreme urban heat hazards for any region is possible through integrating ground-based temperature and satellite data.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many experiments of object-based image analysis have been conducted in remote sensing classification. However, they commonly used high-resolution imagery and rarely focused on suburban area. In this research, with the Landsat-8 imagery, classification of a suburban area via the object-based approach is achieved using four classifiers, including decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random trees (RT), and naive Bayes (NB). We performed feature selection at different sizes of segmentation scale and evaluated the effects of segmentation and tuning parameters within each classifier on classification accuracy. The results showed that the influence of shape on overall accuracy was greater than that of compactness, and a relatively low value of shape should be set with increasing scale size. For DT, the optimal maximum depth usually varied from 5 to 8. For SVM, the optimal gamma was less than or equal to 10(-2), and its optimal C was greater than or equal to 10(2). For RT, the optimal active variables was less than or equal to 4, and the optimal maximum tree number was greater than or equal to 30. Furthermore, although there was no statistically significant difference between some classification results produced using different classifiers, SVM has a slightly better performance.

AB  - With the needs of quality assessment for massive GF-3 polarimetric data, a method based on common distribution targets has been proposed by Sha Jiang. However, it needs manually selection of those woodlands, and cannot be performed automatically. In this paper, an automated GF-3 full-polarization SAR data quality assessment method is conducted using a classic Convolution Neural Network (VGG-16). The network is pre-trained by Radarsat-2 PolSAR data and then trained by selected typical GF-3 scenes. It is supposed to learn the features of the targets, which satisfies the azimuthal symmetry and backscatter reciprocity and fulfills the quality assessment work. Several typical GF-3 strips data are used to test the method. Experiments show that the network can predict the plots of targets from a new scene under the interference of polarimetric distortion and noise. And, the quality assessment results by the network are consistent with the manual assessment results, which shows the effectiveness of the method.

TI  - Modeling Spectral Degradation of MODIS and VIIRS Solar Diffusers
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Solar diffusers (SDs) onboard the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua spacecraft and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on SNPP and NOAA-20 spacecraft have been used as the primary onboard radiometric calibrator for reflective solar bands and their spectral reflectance is known to degrade on-orbit. All of the solar diffusers on these instrument show faster degradation of reflectance in the 0.4 to 0.6 mu m channels than the longer wavelength channels. The spectral degradation of these SDs is due to the surface roughness growth under the exposure to solar UV and energetic particle radiation in space. In this paper, the origin of SD degradation is modeled by the physics-based Surface Roughness-induced Rayleigh Scattering (SRRS) model. The long-term growths of surface roughness of the SD on these instruments are characterized to show the consistency of SD roughness growth rates between Terra/Aqua MODIS and SNPP/NOAA-20 VIIRS. There was coincidental flattening or reverse in the growth trend of the surface roughness for the Terra/Aqua MODIS and SNPP VIIRS SDs, which can be due to the space weather variation. The applicability of the SRRS model is demonstrated with the long term spectral reflectance data from independent spaceborne SDs.

TI  - Axillary reverse mapping (ARM): where to go
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - In the past decades, breast surgeons have changed the clinical practice in the surgical treatment of breast cancer, by performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) instead of performing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in axillary lymph node clinically negative breast cancer patients. ALND can also be avoided in SLN-positive patients who meet the Z-0011 criteria. However, the postoperative complications of SLNB and ALND, such as the secondary upper extremity lymphedema, are common and need effective solutions to prevent as soon as possible. The axillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique has been developed to map and preserve arm lymphatic drainage during ALND and/or SLNB, thereby minimizing arm lymphedema. However, the success of ARM in reducing lymphedema has not been exactly determined. If ARM can be confirmed to be both effective and oncologically safe in preventing lymphedema, this technique should be recommended in the management of breast cancer treatment.

T2  - IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Technology of precision agriculture has caused to the remote sensors development that compute Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) parameters. Vegetation indices obtained from remote sensing data can help to summarize climate conditions. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as a soft computing methods, are one of the most efficient methods for computing as compared to the statistical and analytical techniques for spectral data. This study was employed experimental radial basis function (RBF) of ANN models and adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to design the network in order to predict the soil plant analysis development (SPAD), protein content and grain yield of wheat plant based on spectral reflectance value and to compare two models. Results indicated that the obtained results of RBF method with high average correlation coefficient (0.984, 0.981 and 0.9807 in 2015 for SPAD, yield and protein, respectively and 0.979, 0.9805 and 0.984 in 2016) and low RMSE (0.271, 103.315 and 0.111 in 2015 for SPAD, yield and protein, respectively and 0.407, 105.482 and 0.121 in 2016) has the high accuracy and high performance compared to ANFIS models.

TI  - Discrimination of Aerosol Types over Nairobi, Skukuza and Ilorin Using AOD-AE Clusters
T2  - JORDAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatology of aerosols, their trends and classification based on the long-term Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements (from February 2000 to July 2015) of aerosol optical depths at 550 nm (tau(550)) and Angstrom exponent (alpha(470-660)) using the wavelengths of 470 and 660nm in Nairobi, Skukuza and Ilorin AERONET stations were analyzed in this work. The level-2 collection-6 Deep Blue (L2 C006 DB) of the parameters listed above from the aqua- (MYD04) and terra- (MOD04) MODIS of the study area were statistically analyzed using SPSS. To be able to understand the temporal variation in the characteristics of aerosols in the three stations and during each season separately, MODIS measurements of tau, retrieved for the study area, were compared with AERONET tau. Overall, aqua-MODIS tau corroborate the AERONET measurements well in Nairobi and Ilorin stations with underestimation of 29.80 % and overestimation of 2.90 % respectively, whereas Skukuza station has terra-MODIS tau as the best representation of the AERONET measurements with underestimation of 1.90 %. On seasonal bases, MODIS t agree well with AERONET measurements during rainy season in Nairobi and Skukuza, with underestimation ranging between 17.20 % and 29.70 % and Ilorin station had overestimation of 7.20 % during dry seasons. Coupled with the fact that the coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.50, the results suggest that both aqua- and terra-MODIS give a good estimate oft. t records presented a unique peak in Nairobi (June), Skukuza (October) and Ilorin (February), while the a monthly mean variability indicated a more complicated behavior with minimum values in Nairobi (June), Skukuza (June) and Ilorin (August). The maximum tau values occurred during dry seasons, while their minimum values occurred during rainy seasons or transition months. The a value showed an opposite behavior to that oft such that the highest a values occurred during rainy seasons (or transition months) and the lowest values were observed during dry seasons. This behavior may be attributed to the domination of single-mode aerosol particles in each station. Lastly, tau and a values have been employed to identify several aerosol types seasonally and overall.

TI  - Understanding of HIV/AIDS in the international border area, Manipur: Northeast India
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Manipur, an international border region has the highest incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection in India. Nevertheless, there have been no analytical reviews of research article published within this region. In this review, the authors aim to draw the attention of policy makers, medical practitioners and researchers in adopting new strategies to limit the expansion of HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) not only in Manipur but also in other international border areas. A systematic search for published literature in last decade was performed based on the keywords 'Manipur' and 'HIV' using the PubMed. Twenty-six articles were selected and reviewed. There were high incidence of drug resistance (53%), emergence of recombinant virus (32%) and increased incidence of co-infection with hepatitis C virus. The prime cause of the HIV is due to the uses of 'heroin' smuggled from the 'South Asia Golden Triangle' and complex patterns of cross-border movement for trade and commerce. The drug abuse, social stigma, geographical location and resource limitation and socio-political problem of the region have contributed strongly on spreading and failure of preventively programme of HIV/AIDS. This review will provide vital knowledge for the policy makers and clinicians for sentinel surveillance of AIDS pandemic in Manipur and other international border regions.

AB  - Constantly increasing population and up-scaling economic growth has certainly contributed to fast-paced urban expansion, but simultaneously, as a result, has developed immense pressure on our natural resources. Among other unfavorable consequences, this has led to significant changes in the land use and land cover patterns in megacities all across the globe. As the impact of uncontrolled and unplanned development continues to alter life patterns, it has become imperative to study severe problems resulting from rapid development and leading to environmental pollution, disruptions in ecological structures, ever increasing pressure on natural resources and recurring urban disasters This paper presents an approach to address these challenges using geospatial data to study the land use and land cover change and the patterns and processes of urban growth. Spatio-temporal changes in land-use/land-cover were assessed over the years using multi-date high resolution satellite data. The land use classification was conducted using visual image interpretation technique wherein, study area was categorized into five different classes based on NRSC classification system namely agricultural, built-up, urban green (forest), and fallow land and water bodies. Post-classification change detection technique was used for the assessment of land-cover change and transition matrices of urban expansion were developed to quantify the changes. The results show that the city has been expanding majorly in its borders, where land masses have been converted from agriculture based rural areas to urban structures. An increase in the built-up category was observed with the transformation of agricultural and marginal land with an approximate change of 8.62% in the peri-urban areas. Urban areas are becoming more densely populated and open barren lands are converted into urban areas due to over population and migration from the rural areas of Delhi and thus increasing threat towards urban disaster. Conservation and sustainable management of various natural resources is recommended in order to minimize the impact of potential urban disasters.

AB  - The sea surface wind at low and moderate speed (< 20 m/s) can be well derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data by geophysical model functions (CMOD5, XMOD, CMOD-X0, or others). However, wind retrieval bias is usually large at high wind speed (> 20 m/s). In this study, we explore to use a novel deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) architecture, U-Net, to retrieve the sea surface wind at high speed. The Sentinel-1B SAR cross-polarized (HV and VH) Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS), SAR incidence angle and the ancillary Global Forecast System (GFS) model wind directions are used as the U-Net input data. The GFS model wind speed is the ground-truth data. The results suggest that the U-Net wind retrieval model has a capability to retrieve the high wind speed from SAR data with the physical model-based data. The accuracy of physical model data directly affects the U-Net model results. Meanwhile, U-Net model has a better continuity in the joint area of two strips.

TI  - Intelligent image segmentation model for remote sensing applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional JSEG algorithm has a powerful detection capability on the homogeneity of regional texture features because it combines the spectral information with image texture features during the segmentation. However, the conventional JSEG method is not very accurate for the target edge localization in segmentation results. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved segmentation method of remotely sensed image based on JSEG algorithm and fuzzy c-means (FCM) with spatial constraints. Firstly, the FCM clustering method based on spatial neighborhood terms is used to replace the traditional HCM clustering method in the quantization step. Then the region growing method is applied to segment the class diagram after FCM clustering. Finally, the proposed method uses the improved regional merger approach to merger the over divided region after segmentation. According to the J index, the proposed algorithm is improved by 31% and 12% compared with the traditional JSEG segmentation method and improved by 17% and 8% compared with the FNEA segmentation algorithm for aerial image and the SPOT 5 image. The experimental results show that the proposed segmentation algorithm has good noise immunity because of the fuzzy clustering of spatial constraints and can extract the edge of the target more accurately.

AB  - Based on the SPOT-5 images in 2004 and 2010 and SPOT-6 images in 2016 on the northern region of Hexi new town of Nanjing, the urban green space pattern of 2022 was predicted using the CA-Markov model. On this basis, four landscape indexes were used to analyze the evolution of green landscape pattern in the study area from 2004 to 2022. The results showed that the spatial accuracy of urban green space simulated by CA-Markov model was as high as 87.23%, and the Kappa index was 0.8533, which means high reliability. It is predicted that the scale of urban green space in the northern region of Hexi new town will continue to increase in 2016-2022, accounting for 17.28%, and the patch area of the dominant green space will keep increasing. The number of green patches NP and complexity LSI show a downward trend, the green landscape begins to become orderly, the fragmentation is lessening, the green space network system is gradually formed, and the spatial layout of urban green space tends to be reasonable. The simulation results can provide decision-making basis for the dynamic control of urban green space of Hexi new town of Nanjing.

T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ULTRASONICS SYMPOSIUM (IUS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)
CL  - Glasgow, ENGLAND
AB  - Magnetomotive ultrasound (MMUS) is an emerging technique to image in vivo magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) distribution, which is challenging to conventional B-mode ultrasound, and has shown its potential in extravascular ultrasound molecular imaging, monitoring of magnetic nano- drug delivery, and sentinel lymph node identification. To date, MMUS is mainly implemented in forward mode where the imaging object must lie in between an ultrasound probe and an electromagnet, and the imaging frame rate is low, both of which hinder its clinical translation. To facilitate clinical translation of MMUS, here we move toward the development of a real time backward-mode pulsed magnetomotive ultrasound system based on an ultrasound research engine, Prodigy (S-Sharp Corp., Taiwan), featuring an MMUS probe integrating a linear array and an electromagnet. The MMUS probe facilitates the backward-mode MMUS, improving the portability of MMUS. All the processing exploits the fast Prodigy-to-MATLAB interface, PSRT, automatically streaming beamformed ultrafast baseband data to MATLAB for post-processing and image display. Overall, we demonstrate that the imaging frame rate of our MMUS system can achieve 3.4 Hz with free hand scanning, which is about nine time faster than those of the previously reported systems. We believe that such handheld and toward real-time capability would push MMUS toward clinical usage.

T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - On August 8, 2017, an earthquake of M(s)7. 0 occurred at Jiuzhaigou, China. Based on the baseline correction method, coseismic displacement of 9 strong motion stations 100 km away from the epicenter are obtained. Also, the InSAR coseismic deformation field is derived from the Sentinel-1 satellite interference SAR images. Combined with GPS data, a joint inversion for the slip model of the source fault is carried out. Results show that the fault is dominated by strike slip, and the total released seismic moment is about 7. 60 X 10(18)N . m, equivalent to an earthquake of M-w 6. 52. Results also demonstrate the joint inversion is better than the inversion from InSAR deformation alone comparing the simulated and the observed deformation field. Static stress calculation shows that the average static stress drop is 1. 07 MPa, and corner wavenumbers of the slip model are 0. 99 X 10(-4) and 1. 10 X 10(-4) in strike and dip directions, respectively. Coulomb stress change calculation reveals that 83. 6% of aftershocks are located in the positive Coulomb stress zone, 77. 9% of total aftershocks may be triggered by the mainshock, indicating that the mainshock has a significant triggering effect on the subsequent aftershocks. The strong motion simulations permit to display basic features associated with the ground motion patterns. Moreover, the simulated results reflect the obvious rupture directivity effect. Both the average stress drop and corner wavenumber are at low levels which may be responsible for relatively weaker ground motion during the Jiuzhaigou earthquake.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a vital role in regulating the feedback between the terrestrial water, carbon, and energy cycles. However, the passive microwave SM product can hardly satisfy many applications, owing to their coarse spatial resolution. In this study, a random forest (RE) -based downscaling approach was applied to downscale the FY3B L2 soil moisture data from 25 -km to 1 -km, synergistically using the optical and thermal infrared (TIR) observations from the Moderate -Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS). The RF algorithm used various surface variables to construct the SM relationship model, such as surface temperature, leaf area index, albedo, water index, vegetation index, and elevation, comparing with the widely used polynomial-based relationship model. The correlation coefficient (R) and the root -mean -square deviation (RMSD) of RE -based method reached 0.93 and 0.051 m3/ml, respectively. Four blends of data were used to retrieve the downscaled SM through the RF-based downscaling method. The downscaling results were validated by the in-situ soil moisture from REM EDHUS network. The temporal changing pattern of the downscaled SM was assessed with the precipitation time series. This study suggests that the RE-based downscaling method can characterize the variation of SM and is helpful to improve accuracy of the passive microwave SM product.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in the study of hydrology, the environment, meteorology, and other fields. One widely used approach to retrieve soil moisture data is based on satellite remote sensing technology. However, the spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture products retrieved from microwave remote sensing data do not meet the accuracy requirements of flood prediction and irrigation management, due to their coarse spatial resolution. China's Fengyun-3B (FY3B) microwave radiation imager (MWRI) soil moisture product is one of the relatively new passive microwave products. Remotely sensed soil moisture data retrieved by the MWRI onboard the FY3B satellite is currently provided at a 25 km grid resolution. In this study, in terms of the thermal inertia theory, the FY3B soil moisture products were downscaled from 25 km to 1 km based on the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) grid (12.5 km). For different ranges of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the relationship of soil moisture and diurnal temperature change from the land surface model of NLDAS could be obtained. The 1 km soil moisture was then computed from this regression model using 1 km LST data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODES) (1 km), which was then bias-corrected using FY3B 25 km soil moisture data. The algorithm was applied to every FY3B pixel in the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2015 (SMAPVEX15). The downscaling results were validated using the in-situ soil moisture from SMAPVEXIS. The downscaling estimates better characterize the continuity of spatial and temporal aspects and are more consistent with the soil moisture data used for validation.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in controlling the water, carbon, and energy exchange processes of land atmosphere interface. One of the widely used approaches to retrieve soil moisture is based on satellite remote sensing technology. However, these spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture products retrieved from microwave remote sensing data are not able to meet the accuracy requirement of flood prediction and irrigation management due to the coarse spatial resolution. As one of the relatively new passive microwave products, The Fengyun-3B Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3B/MWRI) soil moisture product was retrieved from passive microwave brightness temperature data based on the Qp model. However, it has rarely been applied at the catchment and regional scale due to the coarse resolution with 25-km grid. In this study, the Fengyun-3B soil moisture product was downscaled from 25-km to 1-km based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The downscaling approach uses MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to construct soil evaporative efficiency (SEE). The 1-km SM was then estimated based on the difference value of high resolution and average SEE in original FY3B pixel. The downscaling method was applied to every Fengyun-3B pixel in the Naqu area on the Tibetan Plateau to retrieve the downscaled 1-km resolution FY3B soil moisture product. The downscaling results were validated using the in-situ soil moisture from Soil Moisture/ Temperature Monitoring Network on the central Tibetan Plateau (TP-STMNS) in August 2015. The validation results revealed that the downscaling approach showed promising results. We can conclude that the downscaled FY3B SM product better characterize the spatial and temporal continuity and have higher consistency with validation soil moisture data. The approach proposed in this study are applicable to bare surface or sparse vegetation covered land surface.

TI  - Cold plasma treatment and exogenous salicylic acid priming enhances salinity tolerance of <i>Oryza sativa</i> seedlings
T2  - PROTOPLASMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was designed to highlight the effects of cold plasma (10kV) treatment and priming with 2mM salicylic acid (SA) and their combination (10kV of plasma+2mM SA) on the physiological parameters and metabolism of two cultivars of Oryza sativa, i.e., Zhu Liang You 06 (ZY) and Qian You No. 1 (QY), under salinity stress (150mM NaCl) and normal growth condition (0mM NaCl). Seed germination and seedling growth were enhanced by SA priming and cold plasma treatment either alone or in combination under salinity stress. Photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetic gas exchange, and chlorophyll fluorescence were improved by cold plasma treatment and SA priming under salinity stress as compared to the untreated seeds. The activities of antioxidant enzymes were significantly improved by the combination of SA priming and cold plasma treatment in both cultivars under salinity stress. There were rapid changes in the cellular content of sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca+), where the plants grown under saline conditions accumulate more Na+ and less Ca+ contents resulting in ionic imbalances. Interestingly, cold plasma and SA treatments diminished this action by reducing Na+ accumulation and increasing K+ and Ca+ contents in the plant cell under salinity stress. The activities of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism assimilation were up-regulated with cold plasma and SA priming either alone or combination under salinity stress. An increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and malondialdehyde (MDA) content was also observed under salinity stress condition. On contrast, seed treated with SA and plasma alone or combined resulted in a significant decrease in ROS and MDA contents under salinity stress. Our results indicated that SA priming and cold plasma treatment either alone or combined improved plant uptake of nutrients in both cultivars under stress conditions. The ultrastructural changes were observed to be more prominent in ZY than QY cultivar. Plants without SA priming or cold plasma treatments have a big vacuole due to the movement of ions into the vacuole directly from the apoplast into the vacuole through membrane vesiculation leading to membrane destabilization. However, SA priming and cold plasma treatment alone or combined helped the plants to recover their cell turgidity under salinity stress.

AB  - This study rewrites the widely used 6S radiative transfer model (RTM) in Fortran 90, to make which easily studied and used. Three surface reflectance models are also incorporated, including the PROSAIL-D canopy reflectance model, the ACRM canopy reflectance model, and the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) snow reflectance model. The 6S+PROSAIL model is then further analyzed: (1) Sensitivity analysis (SA) of parameters of the 6S+PROSAIL model is conducted at 400-2500 nm, and SA of parameters of PROSAIL is also given. (2) Bidirectional reflectance factors of the PROSAIL and 6S+PROSAIL models are simulated over 2 pi space, to show their anisotropy characteristics. The analysis results provide reference information for those who intend to use these models in their applications, such as parameter inversion and observation simulation; and the updated code is helpful to users of 6S, and those who plan to put 6S and PROSAIL together.

AB  - We discussed atmospheric correction of passive microwave over China in the snow covered area. SSM/I brightness temperature, radiosonde observation database and MODIS water vapor product (MOD05) were used to estimate the atmospheric influence. The traditional gradient SWE algorithm before and after the atmospheric correction was compared, and results showed atmospheric influence was bigger over snow cover area. It is about 4-5K over the whole China. In the QTP (Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) area, the atmospheric influence was less than other areas in China; also QTP always had thin snow, so the traditional gradient SWE algorithm could not perform well. The gradient algorithm at high frequency was tested, and the results showed even under the original brightness temperature difference at 19 GHz and 85.5 GHz, the gradient (19 GHz-85.5 GHz) performed good consistency with IMS products.

TI  - Factors contribution to oxygen concentration in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxygen (O-2) is essential for physiological activity in humans. On the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with an average altitude of more than 4 km, hypoxia can seriously damage local residents' health, especially the respiratory system. When an organism cannot fully compensate for insufficient physiological function caused by hypoxia, acute and chronic mountain sickness (AMS and CMS) will occur. Previous studies have suggested that the relative oxygen concentration (ROC) in the near-ground air shows no obvious changes at different altitudes. However, during field work in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we found that, in addition to altitude, surface vegetation coverage and weather conditions may also have an impact on ROC. The results of data analysis showed that altitude and 500 hPa air temperature (500 hPa-T) were negatively correlated with ROC, while vegetation coverage was directly proportional to ROC. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), the results indicated that altitude, vegetation coverage and 500 hPa-T accounted for 65.5% of the total variance in ROC, of which the variance interpretation rate of vegetation coverage was highest (33.1%), followed by 500 hPa-T (28.5%) and altitude (3.9%). Absolute oxygen concentration (AOC) was calculated using the Ideal-Gas Equation. Using this equation, we found that altitude, vegetation coverage and 500 hPa-T accounted for 78.9% of the total variance in AOC, of which the variance interpretation rate of altitude was highest (45.9%), followed by vegetation coverage (18.5%) and 500 hPa-T (14.5%). AOC was negatively correlated with the incidence of CMS, and elevated AOC significantly reduced the incidence of CMS. The science community should pay more attention to this topic as a further decrease in ROC could significantly increase instability and risk in populations at high altitudes. These findings could enhance our understanding of the relationships between oxygen concentration, altitude, vegetation, weather conditions and their interactions. In addition, this research may not only play an important guiding role in human and animal health in high altitude areas, but also significantly deepen our understanding of the risks in high altitude environments under global warming both theoretically and practically. Multi-source data, including in-situ measurement data, remote sensing data, and model reanalysis data, will facilitate further implementations in this direction. Future work can be carried out using more fixed-point observations and by expanding the spatio-temporal extent of relevant data in high altitudes.

CL  - Tianjin Normal Univ, Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - With the increasing of traffic demand in satellite systems, it is essential to maximize the efficiency of resource utilization due to the expense and scarcity of on-board resources. In this paper, we propose a selective beam allocation algorithm with guaranteed fairness for multibeam satellite systems. The algorithm can achieve an acceptable trade-off between the maximum total capacity and the fairness among the spot-beams by allocating the basic power and bandwidth for low priority beams. In addition, the resources allocated for low priority beams can be adjusted flexibly by introducing a lower bound of the capacity. Extensive simulations evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that the total capacity of the proposed algorithm is 99% of water-filling algorithm. Furthermore, comparing with common selective beam allocation algorithm, the Jain Fairness index is improved by 20%.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - West Texas' Permian Basin, where the Wink sinkholes are located, is underlain by evaporite rocks that have been exposed to the dissolution due to natural processes and/or anthropogenic activities. We used the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique to process 16 ALOS PALSAR images from 01/01/2007 to 02/27/2011 for inspecting ground stability. Our results clearly show that two major sinkholes (Wink Sinks 1, 2), formed in 1980 and 2002, are both still subsiding, but the maximum subsidence for the 4-year period (2007-2011) occurred over an area about 1 km northeast of Wink Sink 2. The peak subsidence rate reached similar to 40 cm/year during 2007-2010 and rose to similar to 50 cm/year after 2010 when the area was hit by a record drought. Continuous monitoring of the subsidence in the vicinity of the Wink sinkholes is required for preventing and mitigating catastrophic outcomes of long-term developing geohazards to the area's oil production facilities, infrastructure, and human safety.

AB  - The Arctic has a unique geographical environment. In recent years, the Arctic has undergone major changes, including an increase in temperature, a decrease in the extent and thickness of sea ice, and the reasons for these changes have yet to be further studied. In the Arctic, aerosol is an important factor that causes the temperature and environmental change. The lack of ground-based observation data in the Arctic makes satellite remote sensing an effective means for aerosol monitoring.We first selected the C61 version of the MOM Level2 10 KM aerosol product from 2000 to 2018 as the Arctic's aerosol monitoring data. Then the products Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) was evaluated by 20 ground-based AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sites in the Arctic. Based on the data with high quality control, the monthly averaged AOD in the Arctic were analyzed. Results show that: 1. MODIS AOD is overestimated in the Arctic and requires quality control to obtain more reliable results; 2. The monthly averaged AOD in the Arctic region does not exceed 0.3 with maximum 0.25 and minimum 0.027, and the average monthly AOD value of 18 years is 0.111. Usually, AOD peaks in sununer and has a valley in autumn and winter, but it rises in spring with the Arctic haze events.

AB  - Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has some instruments aboard satellites for understanding of marine context. Two satellite-based automatic identification system (AIS) receivers, named SPace-based AIS Experiment 1 (SPAISE1) on the Small Demonstration Satellite-4 (SDS-4) and SPAISE2 on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) has the wide observation coverage to enable to support a wide range of search and rescue and traffic monitoring activities and to assist with maritime security. ALOS-2 is also equipped with the Panchromatic L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) that has the special feature of being able to make observations of ships, including no signal transmission of AIS. Simultaneous observations with SPAISE2 and PALSAR-2 on the identical satellite bring both individual ship information and fleet distribution including small ships with no AIS signals. Satellite-based AIS systems and SAR ship detection technique combined with sea surface temperature (SST) and other parameters derived from earth observation satellites (e. g. Global Change Observation Mission - Water (GCOMW)) can provide the detailed distributions of ships and fleets with environmental information.

TI  - NDVI Based Change Detection in Sundarban Mangrove Forest Using Remote Sensing Data

AB  - As a global ecosystem, Sundarban mangrove forest plays a significant role by tackling enormous CO2, and other environmental impurities from air and water. It also protects Ganges Delta's people from water surges, and cyclones. The land cover of Sundarban is degraded day by day which is threaten for mangrove plants, and animals. To detect those changes for forest mapping, feature characterization and mapping of coastal erosion, remote sensing (RS) imagery have adopted based on Satellite e.g., Landsat images. The conventional change detection (CD) approaches include post-classification comparison (PCC), unsupervised CD, change vector analysis (CVA), single threshold algorithm (STA) etc. However, the single RS image classification result may not be satisfactory using the PCC method. Tiny noise and changes of land-use or land-cover heritage cannot be recognized apparently through unsupervised CD method. CVA losses information when it uses original feature space whereas STA possesses certain difficulties to compute the complete information. Consequently, this paper proposed a CD technique to quantify the temporary changes of Sundarban RS images from 2011 to 2019 based on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for making an index of Floras for indicating the volume/amount of which area is highly vegetated and whether growing of vegetation is possible or not. The outcome of this experiment indicates progressive changes for high-vegetation (0.02%), vegetation (19.22%), regressive changes for water (17.30%), and no-vegetation (1.93%).

AB  - This study examines the relationship between humans and nature, or between civilization and nature. I highlight the ecological thought and life philosophy in Korean myths by considering that Sancheon-gut is a narrative that recognizes the world from the perspective of nature and seeks a human path coexisting with nature.Sancheon-gut shows that a deep-seated life mechanism beyond human rational comprehension is at work in nature. Serious problems arise when humans attempt to intervene in the mechanism with their civilized prejudices and arrogance. The consequence of human intervention to the fire of old big tree was to stop the renewal process of degraded nature and destroy the divinity of great nature. This led to big problems among both nature and human beings. When the fire burned, the tree became a disaster god. The human couple killed it with palmoyagwangju(marble with eight corners). It was a contradictory act that killed nature by the power of nature. The couple burned the body of the disaster god and then sprinkled it on the mountains to regenerate them as mountain gods. This is a phyletic gesture that facilitates the ecological circulation of life.However, it is not perfect because human-centered recreation runs contrary to the natural order. The ultimate solution revealed by the myth about this problem was to devote a gut(shamanic ritual) to the mountains. The gut is meaningful for humans to restore all humiliation and artefacts, return to humility and return to nature. Restoring the original connection beyond the dual confrontation of man and nature leads to restoring the eternity of life beyond the boundaries of life and death. This shows the essence of gut as a rite for universal reconciliation and unity beyond disunity and confrontation.Korean folk myths such as Sancheon-gut have significance as divine narrative for thinking about the world on the macro level. They have formed a worldview balance with folk tales as secular It is necessary to rediscover and present the value of gut and myth as ‘oral life science’ for the coexistence of human and nature in the current situation where the secular value is extreme and the attacks of civilization against nature are becoming global.

AB  - There have been many theories about the Afrasiab Paintings since modern times. In general, the painting is regarded as a reflection of a Samarkand painter’s worldview which is based on his imagination, and the contents of the painting is not necessarily true. Also, it is difficult to provide accurate information about the painting because it have been damaged so much, and it is difficult to present a theory nearly everyone agrees because there are so few historical records left by the Sodgians. However, in this paper, the interpretation of the painting will be suggested.First, what principles had been applied to construct the painting? The painting accepted and reflected the Four Emperor worldview. Second, different scholars present many theories about what the west-side of the painting described. Although the painting have seriously damaged, the contents of this west-side of the painting are a picture of Western Turk(西突厥) Illig Beg Shekuei Qaghan(乙毗匱可汗) and Fuhuman(拂呼縵)-King of Samarkand being paid tribute together. Of course, the painting necessarily correspond to historical facts, but we can see from the painting that the Samarkand people were quite confident. Thirdly, there is a theory about the period and purpose of the Goguryeo(高句麗/高麗) ambassadors in the painting, but the envoy in the painting were sent to Samarkand and Xue-Yantuo(薛延陀) from Yeon Gaesomun(淵蓋文) when Emperor Tai-zong(唐太宗) of Tang dynasty attacked Goguryeo. Based on the several contexts, in my opinion, that the giant man on the horse in the north-side painting is not the Emperor Gaozong(唐高宗), but the Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong promoted his warrior charisma by making songs like Qinwangpozenyue(秦王破陣), which was accepted by Indians at the time. Therefore, based on all these information, re-identifying the age of painting is necessary.

AB  - Purpose: Lymph node metastasis is a very important prognostic factor for all skin cancers and some sarcomas. A sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the most useful technique for identifying SLNs. Recently, a new generation of diagnostic tools, such as single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) enabled the detection of SLNs. This study compared the efficacy of PET/CT for detecting lymph node metastases with a SLN biopsy in a single medical center.Materials and Methods: From 2008 to 2018, 72 skin cancers of sarcoma patients diagnosed with some lymph node involvement in a whole body PET/CT reading were assessed. Patients suspected of lymph node metastasis were sent to biopsy and those suspected to be reactive lesions were observed. The analysis was performed retrospectively using the medical records, clinical information, PET/CT readings, and pathology results.Results: The age of patients ranged from 14 to 88 years and the mean follow-up period was 2.4 years. Twenty-two patients were suspected of a lymph node metastasis and confirmed. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of PET/CT images in sarcoma and non-sarcoma tumors were increased significantly when the expert’s findings were considered together.Conclusion: PET/CT is effective in detecting lymph node metastases.

TI  - Synergistic Effect of Multi-Sensor Data on the Detection of <i>Margalefidinium polykrikoides</i> in the South Sea of Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 1995, Margalefidinium polykrikoides blooms have occurred frequently in the waters around the Korean peninsula. In the South Sea of Korea (SSK), large-scale M. polykrikoides blooms form offshore and are often transported to the coast, where they gradually accumulate. The objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of multi-sensor data for identifying M. polykrikoides blooms in the SSK from July 2018 to August 2018. We found that the Spectral Shape values calculated from in situ spectra and M. polykrikoides cell abundances in the SSK were highly correlated. Comparing red tide spectra from near-coincident multi-sensor data, remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) spectra were similar to the spectra of in situ measurements from blue to green wavelengths. R-rs true-color composite images and Spectral Shape images of each sensor showed a clear pattern of M. polykrikoides patches, although there were some limitations for detecting red tide patches in coastal areas. We confirmed the complementarity of red tide data extracted from each sensor using an integrated red tide map. Statistical assessment showed that the sensitivity of red tide detection increased when multi-sensor data were used rather than single-sensor data. These results provide useful information for the application of multi-sensor for red tide detection.

AB  - Aims of this research is to analyze landform and changes of eco-environment of Baekdusan and lava plateau on the Gaema Highlands. Major geomorphological landscape of study area consists of the quaternary glacial landform of last glacial peroid, present periglacial and volcanic landform. Quaternary glacial landform coexist with peri-glacial and volcanic landform on Baekdusan, summit area on lava plateau and ridge area of Mt Gwanmo over average 2,000m area. Landcover of Baekdusan area were classified into mixed forest(35%), needleleaf tree(30%), evergreen needleleaf tree(19%), arable land(11%) by Landsat image(year 2018). By analyzing 415 individual data, flora was 34 species, fauna was 108 species. Indigenous species of Baekdusan was investigated Tiger, Bear, Wolf, and Large-leaf labrador tea, Pungsan spruce, Baekdusan birch, et al. Forest and landform is rapidly progressive destorying due to ever-growing tourists of Baekdusan and mountain logging of North Korea, and forest dieback and wetland decrease cause of global warming. This results are expected to be in application with international co-research for eco-environments conservation and basic information for follow-up research.

AB  - Disasters such as earthquakes, floods, landslides etc. create great economic and social loss by destroying the balance of life and property and create chaos. In the wake of a disaster, it becomes very significant to take real-time and on-the-fly actions to minimize the effects of the event. Remote Sensing data acquired through airborne or spaceborne platforms is usually huge in size and requires huge time in generating actionable insights during the disaster scenario. In this work, we propose a two-fold analysis of the Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery based on Compressive Sensing (CS) and Deep Learning. We propose employing a deep learning approach for inferencing over compressed sensing satellite imagery. We hypothesize that this could be beneficial in generating real-time actionable insights during a catastrophe. In our work, we are using the satellite imagery from GeoEye-1 of Haiti Earthquake. Our objectives are: (1) To generate CS images for 75%, 50%, and, 25% sampling on the sparse space and (2) To develop a deep learning pixel-level classification model based on the UNet architecture using the original and reconstructed images. The UNet architecture has shown promising results for pixel-level classification in the recent literature. We envisage to combine both the objectives into an end-to-end learning framework for on-board processing which we foresee would be of great significance in various applications for rapid disaster management response.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of information and communication environment tools for constructing a vision of the future. The research methodology is determined by the information paradigm providing a general theoretical basis for rational explanation of orienting interactions in socio-technical environment / system. The information model of interactions management in a social environment is noted to be of code nature, which is typical of an indirect influence on contemporaries' consciousness. The infosphere tools for the future modeling are presented by their structural, functional and motivational aspects. In the context of social and educational environment modeling, one should point out the material needs driven by the market code and background knowledge transmitting the stereotypes of thinking and behavior. Further, the authors specify the role of the worldview and educational paradigm in the future modeling. The results of mass expectations monitoring are presented, such as dynamic analysis of social sentiment indicators in Russia, youth assessment of the university's image and prospects for online learning. The study materials include data of sociological surveys among Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University students. In conclusion, the authors emphasize the need for mental protection of a person in the digital hypernet, which transforms the infosphere of communication thus creating potential threat of community and mental structures disorganization.

TI  - Detecting and monitoring of landslides using persistent scattering synthetic aperture radar interferometry
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PSInSAR) is an applied time series technique to overcome limitations of InSAR (temporal and geometrical decorrelation and atmospheric delay anomalies) for monitoring of ground surface deformations. This method only monitors displacements on pixels with nearly constant temporal backscattering characteristics. In this study, datasets of ascending ALOS PALSAR (L-band) images recorded from 2006 to 2010 and descending ENVISAT ASAR (C-band) images acquisitioned between 2003 and 2010 were processed to detect and monitor the landslide occurred in the Noghol area, Iran. Application of the PSInSAR technique on both PALSAR and ASAR images has significantly improved monitoring of the Noghol landslide. However, the determination of vertical displacement of the landslide by the ASAR images processing is more correct compared to results of the PALSAR processing due to the descending orbital motion of ASAR. The ASAR images also overwhelm PALSAR images for determination of the landslide extent because of detection of more persistent scatterer points. The landslide displacement and aspect obtained by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and PSInSAR techniques are in agreement (about 1.2-1.5m westward in the period of 2003-2010). Particularly, processing results of the ASAR images are more similar to the GNSS measurements. Furthermore, assessment of the landslide type, mechanism and its displacement direction were possible by integration of the PALSAR and ASAR radar images with ascending and descending orbital motions, respectively.

TI  - Yield Estimation of Paddy Rice Based on Satellite Imagery: Comparison of Global and Local Regression Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precisely estimating the yield of paddy rice is crucial for national food security and development evaluation. Rice yield estimation based on satellite imagery is usually performed with global regression models; however, estimation errors may occur because the spatial variation is not considered. Therefore, this study proposed an approach estimating paddy rice yield based on global and local regression models. In our study area, the overall per-field data might not available because it took lots of time and manpower as well as resources. Therefore, we gathered and accumulated 26 to 63 ground survey sample fields, accounting for about 0.05% of the total cultivated areas, as the training samples for our regression models. To demonstrate whether the spatial autocorrelation or spatial heterogeneity exists and dominates the estimation, global models including the ordinary least squares (OLS), support vector regression (SVR), and the local model geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to build the yield estimation models. We obtained the representative independent variables, including 4 original bands, 11 vegetation indices, and 32 texture indices, from SPOT-7 multispectral satellite imagery. To determine the optimal variable combination, feature selection based on the Pearson correlation was used for all of the regression models. The case study in Central Taiwan rendered that the error rate was between 0.06% and 13.22%. Through feature selection, the GWR model's performance was more relatively stable than the OLS model and nonlinear SVR model for yield estimation. Where the GWR model considers the spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity of the relationships between the yield and the independent variables, the OLS and nonlinear SVR models lack this feature; this led to the rice yield estimation of GWR in this study be more stable than those of the other two models.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the resource of theology, features of interconnections and, at the same time, difference in methods of philosophy and theology. Revealing the religious and denominational affiliation of theological teachings, the author draws attention to the intellectual and value-worldview importance of theology. The motive of this article was an author's reflection on two recent monographs of Russian philosophers: Vladimir Shokhin [Shokhin 2018] and Galina Vdovina [Vdovina 2019]. The first book describes the variety of discursive practices of analytical philosophy of religion also known as a "philosophical theology". The author of the article points to the specific consequences of the position of modern "philosophical theologians" (who should rather be attributed to an analytical tradition in philosophy), including those related to the absence of clearly defined distinctions between subject fields of natural theology and philosophy. The second work, the monograph of Galina Vdovina, focuses on the cognitive aspect of psychological sections in university scholastic courses of 17th century philosophy. Contrary to common opinions about the negative impact of theology on the development of creative thinking, it becomes clear that main philosophical innovations in scholasticism arose either within theology, or from the needs of theology, or for its purposes. The author of the article shows the important role of these two books in the formation of adequate understanding of various aspects of theology and demonstrates the feasibility of turning to scholastics as a methodology of rational cognition and the first classical system of creating of productive knowledge, which (the system) preceded as the mathematics and experimental science as the philosophical thought of the Modern Age.

AB  - Being based on the study of the key concepts of metalanguage, the article identifies the culturally conditioned tendency of entrepreneurial activity in industrial and digital paradigm of economic development. Metalanguage as a product of collective wisdom and accumulated knowledge does not appear spontaneously, it emerges either ontologically in the form of metaphorical images of the naive picture of the world, or as a result of radical change in the grasp of reality. The study of metalinguistic elements of the culture of entrepreneurship reveals the deep concepts and ideas that guide entrepreneurial activity. The analysis of the metalanguage of entrepreneurial culture conducted in this study shows the correlation of the mindset and work methods, ensuring entrepreneurial success in socially acceptable framework to the worldview of the era, to the key notions of understanding of reality. The analysis of the key notions of the metalanguage of entrepreneurial culture demonstrates that the economic development paradigm shift, which started in the beginning of the 21st century, meaning the transition to networking, constant adjustment and refinement of strategic tasks with the help of digital technology under uncertainty and risk, reflects some changes in models of perception and practical actions of entrepreneurs, rather than transformation of the root idea of modernisation - that is gaining dominance by means of "creative destruction".

TI  - Development of land-use scenarios using vegetation inventories in Japan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) have major effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Land change models can simulate future trends of ecosystem services under different scenarios to inform the actions of decision makers towards building a more sustainable society. LULC data are essential inputs for predicting future land changes. It is now possible to derive high-resolution LULC maps from satellite data using remote sensing techniques. However, the classification of land categories in these maps is too limited to sufficiently assess biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study aims to develop land-use scenarios, using an appropriate LULC map, to enable assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services at the national scale. First, we developed an LULC dataset using vegetation inventories based on field records of vegetation collected throughout the country in the periods 1978-1987, 1988-1998 and 1999-2014. The vegetation maps consist of over 905 vegetation categories, from which we aggregated the most prevalent categories into 9 LULC categories. Second, we created a business-as-usual scenario and plausible future scenarios on the land use change maps using the Land Change Model tool. In the process of developing the model, we considered key drivers including biophysical and socio-economic factors. The results showed some key land changes as consequences of intensive/extensive land-use interventions. These derived scenario maps can be used to assess the impacts of future land change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The comparative assessment of natural potential of agro-chernozems of Siberia in order to plan rational land use, protection of soils and soil cover is carried out. The score was determined by soil-ecological index (SEI). SEI calculation was carried out on climatic, agrochemical and soil parameters. At calculating the climate index, the sum of temperatures above 100 degrees C and precipitation was taken into account; the agrochemical index was calculated by the content of humus, mobile forms of phosphorus and potassium, the reaction of the medium and the soil index - by alkalinity, salinity, erosion, granulometric composition of soils. According to the data of the Landsat satellite and the QGIS software, a map of the distribution of chernozems in the Siberian region was created. Interactive map is comparable to the relief map of the study area, cadastral, geological and other maps. The most valuable soils for agricultural use are formed in the Krasnoyarsk and Altai Krai, where up to 50% of the total chernozem area of the Siberian Federal district (SFD) is concentrated. SEI of agro-chernozems of Siberia decreases in a number: Krasnoyarsk Krai - Altai Krai - Irkutsk region - Omsk region - the Republic of Tuva. The development of erosion and deflation to an average degree reduces the SEI value by 14-36%. The calculated SEI values of agro-chernozems can be used to determine their resource potential, cadastral and market assessment, development of recommendations for land transformation. In modern conditions, the unused chernozems are considered as unrecorded reserve for expansion of arable land, most balanced, anthropogenic, environmental resource.

AB  - Since their launch in December 1999 and May 2002, Terra and Aqua MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) have successfully operated for over 19 and 17 years, respectively. MODIS is a scanning radiometer that uses a two-sided scan mirror rotating at 20.3 rpm. MODIS data are collected in 36 spectral bands: 20 reflective solar bands (RSBs) and 16 thermal emissive bands (TEBs). Earth observations are made each scan over a wide scan-angle range of +/- 55 degrees from the instrument nadir. MODIS TEBs are calibrated onorbit on a scan-by-scan basis using a blackbody at a fixed scan-angle. For Terra MODIS, the current TEB Response Versus Scan-angle (RVS) of its scan mirror was derived using observations made during a deep-space pitch maneuver in early 2003, while the Aqua MODIS TEB RVS was characterized pre-launch. In this study, the RVS on-orbit stability for the MODIS TEBs (over mission lifetime) is evaluated using multiple daily Dome C observations over the entire range of angles of incidence (AOIs) using a 20 x 20 km region of interest (ROI) centered at 75.12 degrees S, 123.39 degrees E. In this study, a total of approximately 3000 individual granules per year per instrument are analyzed. Except for band 29, the estimated brightness temperature drift for every AOI and band is small for both MODIS instruments over their mission lifetimes. The large variability and noise in the Dome C data sets make it difficult to determine any small RVS changes that may have occurred, but the stability of the results does give confidence that the current RVS used in the calibration is sufficient.

AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) of vegetation canopy is a critical variable in affecting wildfire behavior. Methodologies based on multiple sources of remote sensing data have shown a prominent advantage for spatial and temporal FMC mapping. However, there is no study focused on FMC retrieval using the Sentinel-2A satellite data to date. This study is to evaluate the performance of this data for FMC retrieval under the framework of the multiple coupled radiative transfer models. Due to the limited field measurements and discontinuous satellite data, only 15 field measurements from USA, South Africa, Australia and France were available for the validation of the retrieved FMC. Results show that the retrieved FMCs were promising with R-2 = 0.64 and RMSE = 47.16%, which demonstrated the potential usage of the Sentinel-2A data for FMC mapping and further applications for early-warning of wildfire risk.

TI  - Modeling Urban Growth Trajectories and Spatiotemporal Pattern: A Case Study of Lucknow City, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indian cities are facing rapid and unplanned urbanization in the present scenario and expanding at a miraculous amount. The unprecedented speed of expansion is a major challenge for urban planners and policy makers due to unavailability of the current database and the lack of appropriate analysis of unplanned urban expansion. This study dispenses an approach to these challenges by deploying the capabilities of remote sensing data for Lucknow city, India. The spatiotemporal analysis of expansion model integrated with driving factors is required for sustainable development of the city. The study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal urban growth trajectories integrated with driving factors of Lucknow city and its surrounding area in the period of 26 years i.e., from 1990 to 2016. An expansion model is proposed in the study for a precise examination of urban expansion topologies and its quantification. The model is processed using remote sensing satellite data of Landsat sensor of the year 1990, 1999, 2009 and 2016. The study utilizes land-use and land-cover classification maps of study years for analyzing urban trajectory model. The expansion pattern is formulated using patch distribution analysis and quantification based upon spatial built-up densities of urban patches. Further, these patches are classified in four classes of expansionedge, infill, leapfrog and ribbon. Moreover, six different statistical parameters are formulated for quantification of detailed urban growth analysis. Patch distribution analysis has been performed for monitoring the patch size variation during study years. The villages are demarcated and significant changes are analyzed (where transition took place) and integrated with the driving factors responsible for the changes. The study indicates the dominating urban pattern and the driving factors responsible in the expansion of the built-up urban area of Lucknow city.

M3  - Article
AB  - An unplanned urban sprawl is emerging as a major threat for urban development, especially in developing countries. In recent decades, ever increasing population and urbanization has led to the urban sprawl. The dynamic nature of urbanization creates ambiguities in measurements of urbanization growth and its extent. Temporal analysis of land-use/land-cover (LULC) and identification of transition points are required for sustainable development of the city. Therefore, the sustainable model is required for critical analysis of urbanization and its impact. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urbanization process at an urban, suburban, sub-rural and rural level that has occurred in Lucknow, the capital city of the state Uttar Pradesh of India. The micro-level study has been performed to measure the extent and growth of urbanization. The model is processed using remotely sensed satellite data of Landsat sensor of the year 1995, 2005 and 2016. The workflow is initiated using LULC classification map of two decades 1995-2016. The classification result depicts an increased built-up area i.e., 77.15 sq. km to 143.70 sq. km from 1995 to 2005 and increased to 199.92 sq. km from 2005 to 2016. The accuracy assessment of LULC is found to be 90%, 92% and 94% for 1995, 2005 and 2016 respectively. The micro- level analysis is performed using urban landscape quantification in which urbanness analysis of each pixel is estimated and then the pixel is allocated according to built-up densities of spatial area. Further these densities are classified in seven classes those are (i) Urban built-up, (ii) Suburban built-up, (iii) Rural built-up, (iv) Urbanized open land (UOL), (v) Captured open land (COL), (vi) Rural open land (ROL) and, (vii) Water. Finally, the urban footprint maps are generated using the results of urban landscape quantification. The critical and detailed analysis of the peri-urban interface (PUI) is performed by demarcating the villages where significant changes are observed and integrated with the driving factors responsible for the changes. The expansion analysis is performed for quantifying the sprawl taking place in the city. Mainly four types of expansions are identified and mapped that are infill, extension, leapfrog and ribbon expansions. Land surface temperature (LST) analysis is performed over the study area for analyzing the adverse effect of urbanization over the transition points (Villages). Land surface temperature variation has been monitored over these transition points and their unfavorable effects on the environment.

AB  - The freely available imagery from Sentinel-2, with 13 optical narrow bands in moderate-to-high spatial resolution (10, 20, and 60m) attracts the research community to explore the potentiality of bands for different land services. This study examined the capabilities of Sentinel-2 in vegetation health/stress monitoring, especially, narrow red-edge bands and their significance in deriving vegetation health/stress using different vegetation parameters such as leaf water contents, level of carotenoid pigment and chlorophyll.The study area is Keoladeo National Park (KNP), Bharatpur, Rajasthan, India. National park is selected to utilize the diversity of park to examine the suitability of bands for vegetation health/stress mapping. The availability of bands for the wavelength at 500 mu m, 445 mu m, 705 mu m, 750 mu m, 680 mu m, 819 mu m, and 1599 mu m have shown the importance for vegetation's health/stress mapping. Furthermore, the relative amounts of vegetation health scaled from 1 (unhealthy) to 9 (healthy) are also calculated. Comparative analysis with different indexes is also discussed in KNP. Results of this study show the significance of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands in vegetation health/stress mapping.

AB  - This work investigates the regional specifics of the appearance and propagation of internal waves at the shelf of the Black Sea. The parameters of horizontal inhomogeneity associated with changes in the bottom relief and density of seawater that lead to instability and destruction of internal waves are studied. The numerical experiments for the spring and summer seasons on transects normal to the coast are conducted using data of temperature and salinity from the Bank of oceanographic data of the Marine Hydrophysical Institute of RAS. The article touches upon the actual theme of adaptation of satellite images obtained from open sources when solving oceanographic problems. The result of the processing of remote sensing data was information about the speeds and wavelengths for the observed phenomena. These values are used to recover the depth of the seasonal pycnocline within a two-layer approximation of the vertical density structure. For different bottom slopes and seasonal profiles of the buoyancy frequency, sites are determined where the transition from supercritical to critical or subcritical conditions is possible in the region of the Crimean coast.

AB  - Satellite data is one of the best sources of information to monitor and analyze the city state and the impact of urbanization on environmental aspects such as soil, water, land, and air pollution within the city. Urban Heath Island (UHI) is a zone in the city with the highest land surface temperature. These zones have a negative impact on the inhabitants comfort, ecological and energetic essential variables. One of the most common ways of detecting and analyzing thermal islands is based on the use of evening and night surface images and the difference in surface temperature in urban areas and adjacent areas. The research in this work is being primed using land surface classification maps, satellite LST products Sentinel-3 and the population density of Global Human Settlement Layer. Kyiv was chosen as study area and for this city urban heat island temperature dependence on building density, tree density and population density were analyzed.

AB  - Net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR) is a key parameter for the estimation of surface energy budget. This paper proposes a method to directly estimate the NSSR from simulated Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF-5) data without using any ancillary information. Firstly, the narrowband reflectances of visible/near infrared channels at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) were converted to the TOA broadband albedo. Secondly, by categorizing the land surface into three types, the NSSR was estimated under clear and cloudy skies separately based on the relationship between TOA broadband albedo and the Earth's surface absorbed shortwave radiation. The estimation error of the absorption coefficient for each land type is lower than 0.05. Finally, by employing a look-up-table acquired in the process of narrowband-to-broadband conversion, and the parameters in the NSSR estimation model for each land type, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated, where the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 25.85 (13.97) W/m(2), 20.39 (7.97) W/m(2), and 40.54 (11.26) W/m(2) for land, ocean and snow/ice surfaces for clear (cloudy) skies, respectively.

TI  - Estimating LAI and mapping canopy storage capacity for hydrological applications in wattle infested ecosystems using Sentinel-2 MSI derived red edge bands
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the strength of Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) derived Red Edge (RE) bands in estimating Leaf Area Index (LAI) and mapping canopy storage capacity (CSC) for hydrological applications in wattle infested ecosystems. To accomplish this objective, this study compared the estimation strength of models derived, using standard bands (all bands excluding the RE band) with those including RE bands, as well as different vegetation indices. Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLSR) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) ensembles were used in this study. Results showed that the RE spectrum covered by the Sentinel-2 MSI satellite reduced the estimation error by a magnitude of 0.125 based on simple ratio (RE SR) vegetation indices from 0.157m(2)m(-2) based on standard bands, and by 0.078m(2)m(-2) based on red edge normalised difference vegetation (NDVI-RE). The optimal models for estimating LAI to map CSC were obtained based on the RE bands centered at 705nm (Band 5), 740nm (Band 6), 783nm (Band 7) as well as 865nm (Band 8a). A root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.507m(2)m(-2) a relative root mean square error of prediction (RRMSEP) of 11.3% and R-2 of 0.91 for LAI and a RMSEP of 0.246m(2)/m(2) (RRMSEP=7.9%) and R-2 of 0.91 for CSC were obtained. Overall, the findings of this study underscore the relevance of the new copernicus satellite product in rapid monitoring of ecosystems that are invaded by alien invasive species.

The observation of the forest coverage is of primary importance for the study of the carbon cycle and plays a fundamental role for the management of Earth's natural resources. In this paper we present a strategy to map forested areas by exploiting interferometric Sentinel-1 acquisitions. We observe the evolution in time of the temporal decorrelation of Sentinel-1 stacks and provide a processing and classification framework. We show results over the Amazon rainforest, in particular over the Brazilian Rondonia state, where intensive deforestation phenomena take place.

AB  - This paper reports the first results of a comparative study of tropospheric delays retrieved by means of PSI processing of an interferometric stack of SAR images against those derived independently from a permanent GNSS network. The stack comprises 33 Cosmo-SkyMed stripmap images acquired in the summers between 2008-13 over the Matter Valley in the Swiss Alps. The long-term objective of the study is to explore whether GNSS-derived delays from existing networks (i.e., not deployed specifically for a test site) in Swiss Alpine regions can aid in tropospheric phase corrections in SAR data, or rather the phase corrections derived within the PSI processing being at a higher spatial resolution might be appropriate to build upon the GNSS products by improving their resolution.

TI  - A Case Study on the Correction of Atmospheric Phases for SAR Tomography in Mountainous Regions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography with repeat-pass acquisitions generally requires a priori phase calibration of the interferometric data stack by compensating for the atmosphere-induced phase delay variations. These variations act as a disturbance in tomographic focusing. In mountainous regions, the mitigation of these disturbances is particularly challenging due to strong spatial variations of the local atmospheric conditions and propagation paths through the troposphere. In this paper, we assess a data-driven approach to estimate these phase variations under a regression-kriging framework. The vertical stratification of the troposphere is modeled functionally, while the impact of the spatial turbulence is considered in a stochastic sense. The methodology entails an initial persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) analysis. The atmospheric phases isolated for the persistent scatterers (PS) within the PSI processing are considered as samples of the 3-D distribution of the phase delay variations over the scene. These atmospheric phases are regressed against the spatial coordinates in map geometry at. PS locations. In turn, kriging predictions are obtained at each location along the elevation profile, where tomographic focusing is intended. A key point of this approach is that the requisite atmospheric corrections are incorporated within the tomographic focusing model. A case study has been performed on a data stack comprising 32 COSMO-SkyMed stripmap images acquired over the Matter Valley in the Swiss Alps, in the summers of 2008-2013. The results show locally improved deformation sampling with tomographic methods compared to the initial PSI solution, primarily due to the improved phase calibration. In general, this paper underscores the indispensability of height-dependent correction of atmospheric phases for SAR tomography.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Grassland occupies a large proportion of utilised agricultural area, especially in mountainous regions. Despite its importance current and reliable data on grassland yields and cutting frequencies with a sufficient spatial coverage are lacking. Both are essential for optimizing the use of grassland, nature conservation and policy consultation. Model approaches for the assessment of grassland yields take cutting dates and frequency into account despite environmental and cultivation factors.The European Earth Observation programme Copernicus provides large quantities of spatial and temporal high resolution data collected by a set of Sentinel satellites. The freely and openly accessible Sentinel-1 radar data form a valid basis for automated satellite and ground data processing methods to detect cutting events. These cutting frequencies are a fundamental information source for further analysis - the computation of grassland yields with different model approaches.In this study we like to present our overall approach integrating and analyzing data of different sources. A comparison between two different automated data processing methods to detect cutting frequencies from radar satellite data in three different regions in Bavaria is included. The common statistical detection represents a robust and reliable way by analysing time series of Sentinel-1 radar images of the same acquisition geometry with time intervals of 6 days. In contrast, machine learning techniques offer the opportunity to increase the accuracy and limit cutting dates to more precise time intervals.

T2  - MOLLUSCAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine seasonal variations of two biomarkers of oxidative stress, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and their correlation with lipid-carbohydrate metabolism in the edible bivalve Donax trunculus. The samples were collected during the four seasons in 2014 at two sites in the Gulf of Annaba (northeast of Algeria): El Battah, which is some distance from any source of pollution, is considered a relatively clean site, while Sidi Salem is a site exposed to various sources of industrial, urban and harbour pollution. The results show a significant decrease in LDH activity in Sidi Salem D. trunculus compared with those at El Battah. Moreover, carbohydrate levels increased significantly in Sidi Salem. The MDA rate increased significantly in Sidi Salem relative to El Battah, while the amounts of lipid showed a significant decrease. The lipid and carbohydrate metabolism was negatively correlated with LDH and MDA. This difference between the two sites was observed for all seasons, with more effect in spring and summer. The results obtained showed that under stressful conditions due to anthropogenic factors, some physiological processes of D. trunculus can be affected. Thus, D. trunculus appears to be a suitable sentinel species for the assessment of ecotoxicological risk in the Gulf of Annaba.

TI  - Towards improved, cost-effective surveillance of <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> ticks and associated pathogens using species distribution modelling
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Various ticks exist in the temperate hilly and pre-alpine areas of Northern Italy, where Ixodes ricinus is the more important. In this area different tick-borne pathogen monitoring projects have recently been implemented; we present here the results of a two-year field survey of ticks and associated pathogens, conducted 2009-2010 in North-eastern Italy. The cost-effectiveness of different sampling strategies, hypothesized a posteriori based on two sub-sets of data, were compared and analysed. The same two subsets were also used to develop models of habitat suitability, using a maximum entropy algorithm based on remotely sensed data. Comparison of the two strategies (in terms of number of ticks collected, rates of pathogen detection and model accuracy) indicated that monitoring at many temporary sites was more cost-effective than monthly samplings at a few permanent sites. The two model predictions were similar and provided a greater understanding of ecological requirements of I. ricinus in the study area. Dense vegetation cover, as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index, was identified as a good predictor of tick presence, whereas high summer temperatures appeared to be a limiting factor. The study suggests that it is possible to obtain realistic results (in terms of pathogens detection and development of habitat suitability maps) with a relatively limited sampling effort and a well-planned monitoring strategy.

AB  - The objective of this work was to analyze the morphometric and the dynamics of deforestation in the microbasin of D'Alincourt River, Western Amazonia. The geometric, relief and drainage parameters were calculated by using altimetric data from the SRTM project. Land cover dynamics were calculated by the difference of the vegetation index in 10-year intervals, by using images from the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites. The microbasin has an area of 5,867.61 ha, altitude from 210 m to 419 m, predominance of smooth undulating relief, drainage density of 2, 02 km km(-2). Cumultative deforestation in the microbasin until 2005 was 76%, but between 2005 and 2015 there was an increase of 4.5% in forest cover.

AB  - In mitigating climate change and ecosystems preservation that are unique and indispensable to the life of the planet, efforts are being made to reduce current levels of deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In the arch of deforestation of the Amazon forest, studies on the occurrence of fires and the dynamics of deforestation are frequent in the literature on several aspects such as soil management, climate and vegetation change and forest resilience.This work presents an analysis of the relationship between deforested areas and the occurrence of fire outbreaks observed from January 2007 to November 2018, in a study area of approximately 36,000 km(2), corresponding to the area covered by a Landsat-8 scene. Further, it was performed a correlation of fire outbreaks occurred in and near the forest area from the boundaries of the deforested areas from 2015 to 2018. Annual fire outbreaks data were obtained through the Queimadas Program of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) from 2007 to 2018, the deforestation polygons from the Project for Deforestation Monitoring in the Amazon Forest by Satellite (PRODES) and the INPE's Real-Time Detection System (DETER-B) from 2007 to 2018. The temporal analysis revealed an increasing of the incidence of fires with the increasing of deforestation in that period, evidencing the systematic use of fire as a means of suppressing biomass. In the last 4 years, the high occurrence of forest fires between 500 to 1000 m from the edge boundaries of the deforested areas, showed a considerable degradation of the forest and a probable decrease of forest resilience.

TI  - STUDY OF URBAN GROWTH OF A SMALL AMAZON CITY: A METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
T2  - GEOFOCUS-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE LA INFORMACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban spatial transformations that have occurred in small, medium and large cities of the Amazon Region have been quite significant since the 1970s. Most of these cities (over 80 %) are considered small urban areas, with less than 20 thousand inhabitants, with poor infrastructure, and most of them are dependent on public and forest resources. This paper discusses a methodology of mapping of the land use and land cover of a part of Barcarena municipality, using unsupervised classification technique of remote sensing LANDSAT images, obtained between 1984 and 2010. During this period, there was a deforestation of 43.7 km(2) (27 %) and the urban area grew 26.7 km(2) (334 %). The mapping of the land use of Barcarena municipality made possible to verify the existence of two distinct urban realities, the administrative city of Barcarena, and the District of Cabanos.

AB  - Remote sensing has provided a modern wider perspective to approach the earth with its various environments and impact of humans by prospecting previously unknown frontiers of human life. The traces of mobile groups are archaeologically often more difficult to detect than those of the sedentary ones, but new approaches and methods have changed and enhanced the ways to extract archaeological information of hunter-gatherers and pastoral nomads. Remote sensing, for example, provides alternative views from above and better visibility in a larger scale, especially with high resolution solutions, than on the ground to trace sites. Mobile people have become more visible in archaeology, and therefore their importance in the development of human cultures has received more focus and understanding. This paper will focus on the use of remote sensing in the archaeological study of mobile cultures and their environments in the Near East. Various examples of techniques and site types will be discussed, and the suitability of applications will be considered based on the studies by Finnish and Finnish-Swedish projects in the Near East. We will provide examples of applications and emphasize the importance of empirical approaches in studying archaeological evidence by remote sensing. GPS coordinate points have served as the basis of our field survey and mapping. From the image-based data we shall deal with aerial photographs, CORONA satellite photographs, Landsat, SPOT, QuickBird and GeoEye satellite images. From the range-based data we shall discuss X-SAR Shuttle Mission 2000 and ASTER-DEM data, but LiDAR and geophysical devices will only be briefly considered.

T2  - NORDIC JOURNAL OF MUSIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Acute care mental health inpatients have the expertise to evaluate different group-based music therapy interventions. Moreover, from an objectivist worldview, there is a need for data concerning non-symptom measures that are specific to group-based music therapy experiences using randomized designs. The purpose of this posttest-only study is to compare how adult acute care mental health inpatients rated group experiences of three different types of educational music therapy for illness management and recovery (EMT-IMR) interventions and a recreational music therapy (RMT) intervention.Methods: Participants (N = 91) were cluster-randomized to one of four single-session group-based conditions: EMT-IMR-songwriting, EMT-IMR-lyric analysis, EMT-IMR-social story, or RMT-music therapy game.Results: There were significant between-group differences concerning RMT and EMT-IMR (both lyric analysis and songwriting conditions) in the sharing of emotions and experiences subscale. Participants in the EMT-IMR conditions rated this subscale higher than participants in the RMT condition. Although no other difference was significant, descriptive statistics tended to favor the three EMT-IMR conditions. Group experiences descriptive data from people in community mental health services from a previous study were also compared with data collected in the current study. Results indicated tendencies for the three EMT-IMR conditions to have slightly higher mean group experiences scores across all subscales than participants in the non-music therapy community mental health services condition.Discussion: Specifically targeting illness management and recovery via EMT-IMR may be practical, effective, and constitute an ideal model within acute care mental health facilities. Limitations, suggestions for future inquiry, and implications for clinical practice are provided.

CP  - 13th Annual Meeting of the Academic-Surgical-Congress/Society-of-University-Surgeons/Association-for-Academic-Surgery
CL  - Jacksonville, FL
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an important adjunct in the staging of patients with melanoma. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with radiolabeled isotopes is essential to localize sentinel nodes for removal. Our study compared the effectiveness of Lymphoseek to standard sulfur colloids in patients with melanoma undergoing SLNB.Methods: We queried our IRB-approved melanoma database to identify 370 consecutive patients who underwent SLNB from 2012 to 2016 with at least 1 y of follow-up. There were 185 patients in each group. Data points included characteristics of the primary melanoma lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB. Student's t-test and chi-square were used to analyze the data with a P value of < 0.05 being considered significant.Results: Patients were equally matched in regard to age, sex, and primary characteristics of their melanoma. In comparison to sulfur colloid, Lymphoseek required lower radiation dosages (P < 0.001), shorter mapping times (P = 0.008), and decreased number of sentinel nodes removed (P = 0.03). There was no difference in the number of patients with positive nodes (P = 0.5). In addition, there were no statistical differences between the two radioactive tracers in regard to the number of patients with false-negative SLNB.Conclusion: Lymphoseek has the potential to decrease radioactivity and mapping time in patients who need SLNB. With a decrease in the number of nodes removed without loss of sensitivity, there is a potential to avoid unnecessary node removal and thus complications such as lymphedema. Longer follow-up will help to determine if there is any increase in false-negative rates despite fewer nodes removed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of Thermal Anomalies in Volcanic Areas Using Multiscale and Multitemporal Monitoring: Vulcano Island Test Case
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperatures derived by 208 ASTER and L8 satellite imagery were analysed to test multiscale and multitemporal capability through available sets of thermal data to support the volcanic monitoring of Vulcano Island in Italy. The analysis of thermal historical series derived by ASTER and L8 shows that two are the main thermally active areas: La Fossa crater and the mud pool of Fangaia. In this work we aimed to assess the correlation between the satellite-retrieved temperatures with those measured during the daytime ground field campaign conducted within the same time period and, in particular cases, simultaneously. Moreover, nighttime data acquired by an airborne and field campaign were processed with the same methodology applied to satellite data for a multiscale approach verification. Historical meteorological data acquired from a weather station were also considered. Statistically significant correlations were observed between nighttime acquisitions and meteorological data. Correlations were also significant for temperature measured during the airborne campaign, while differences up to 50% with daytime acquisition during the ground field campaigns were observed. The analysis of the results suggests that within nighttime data acquisition, differences between satellite-derived temperatures and ground temperature measurements are considerably reduced; therefore nighttime data acquisition is recommended to detect thermal anomalies.

AB  - Image segmentation is the most important stage on Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). The result of segmentation affects the final accuracy of classification. One of the applications of image segmentation operations is to delineate vegetation objects. Further analysis of vegetation could be used for inventory of natural resources, agricultural, land cover, land use, etc. However, applying image segmentation for separating vegetation types is challenging due to their irregular shapes and various patterns and colors. This study aims to determine the optimum parameters of image segmentation for delineating vegetation types using a pan-sharpened WorldView-2 image (0.5 m pixel size) which was acquired on August 2018. Combinations of scale parameter and composition of homogeneity criterion (shape and compactness) were systematically simulated to obtain the best segmentation parameters. The result of segmentation was assessed quantitatively based on visually interpreted image map as a reference. This study found that application of shape and compactness simultaneously for vegetation extraction would produce rough segmentation result. The optimum parameters for segmenting vegetation types using WorldView-2 were using scale parameter of 5, shape of 0 and compactness of 0.5.

AB  - Providing accurate and up-to-date agricultural vegetation maps is a very important task for agricultural land evaluation and monitoring. These maps allow various kinds of spatial analyses could be conducted to optimally manage and utilize of land resources. One of the newly developed approaches in information extraction from remote sensing data is object-based approach or widely known as Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). This study aims to utilize GEOBIA and a pan-sharpened WorldView-2 image (0.5 m pixel size) to identify and map agricultural vegetation types in part of Dieng Plateau, Central Java, Indonesia. A multiresolution segmentation algorithm was used to partition the image into vegetation object candidates based on some segmentation criteria. The accuracy of segments created were evaluated by visually comparing the segmentation result with the objects border on the image and field visit. A hierarchical conceptual model was created to systematically classify targeted agricultural vegetation objects, and the relevant interpretation keys for each object were identified. For the classification process we implemented a rule-based classification based on segment's values, shape, homogeneity, texture, compactness, asymmetry, roundness, elliptic fit, number of pixel and border length. These parameters have an important role in producing segments that separated the different object, and the result would be tested using a reference map. The result showed that the combination of GEOBIA and WorldView-2 were able to discriminate and map the types of agricultural vegetation into cabbage, carica, carrot, chili, potato, potato with soil solarization, and tamarillo with 78.92% of overall accuracy.

T2  - FIRST PEOPLES CHILD & FAMILY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboriginal social work is a relatively new field in the human services, emerging out of the Aboriginal social movement of the 1970s and evolving in response to the need for social work that is sociologically relevant to Aboriginal people. Aboriginal social work education incorporates Aboriginal history and is premised upon traditional sacred epistemology in order to train both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal social workers who can understand and meet the needs of Aboriginal people. The deficiencies of contemporary cross-cultural approaches and anti-oppressive social work education are highlighted as a means to emphasize the importance of social work education premised upon relevant history and worldview. The values and responsibilities that derive from Aboriginal worldview as the foundation for Aboriginal social work education are discussed in terms of the tasks that are implied for the educator and student of Aboriginal social work. Such tasks include self-healing, decolonization, role modelling, developing critical consciousness, and social and political advocacy. Aboriginal social work education, a decolonizing pedagogy directed to mitigating and redressing the harm of colonization at the practice level, is a contemporary cultural imperative.

AB  - Automatic water feature delineation from satellite imagery is a challenging task due to the variability of sensor parameters, acquisition conditions, and geographical heterogeneity of scenes. To mitigate above challenges, we proposed a fully automatic method for surface water feature dilatation from the moderate resolution satellite imagery through the integration of adaptive and automatic training sample collection by a modulated spectral reflectance curve and one-class classification algorithm. The specific modulation codes that are partially able to represent water features have been chosen to collect positive training samples for the target class. In addition, one-class classification algorithm has applied to classify multispectral imagery, and it utilized the collected datasets as the positive-labeled training samples for the target class. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it's applicable to several moderate resolution sensors having SWIR, NIR, Red, and Green spectral bands. We evaluated the robustness of the proposed method on different multispectral earth observation sensors (Landsat 8OLI, LISS-III IRS-P6, and Sentinel 2A MSI) having heterogeneous acquisition environments. We achieved the overall accuracy on test sites ranges from 93.90 % to 97.27 %, and kappa statistics is ranges from 0.7622 to 0.9453.

TI  - Automated Retrieval of Snow/Ice Surface Broadband Albedo in Beas River Basin, India Using Landsat-8 Satellite Images and Validation with Wireless Sensor Network Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposed an algorithm for automated retrieval of snow/ice surface albedo using Landsat-8 satellite images and validation with wireless senor network data in Beas River basin, India. Cloud-free Landsat-8 images of winter season 2016-2017 have been used to estimate snow/ice broadband albedo. Albedo maps generated using satellite images have been compared and validated with in situ recorded albedo values at wireless sensor network stations. Root-mean-square error of 0.053, R-square (R-2) of 0.96, bias of -0.034 and mean absolute percentage error of3.5% have been observed. Existing global albedo model for Landsat ETM+ was also used to estimate albedo in the study area using Landsat-8 images. Algorithm proposed in this paper for Landsat-8 has shown comparatively better results. Simultaneously, albedo values for snow/ice class have also been estimated using MODIS images. High correlation has been observed between the albedo values estimated from Landsat-8 and MODIS images. Proposed algorithm appears to be the first to estimate broadband albedo of snow/ice class from narrowband reflectances using Landsat-8 images for Indian Himalaya.

AB  - Real-time monitoring of agricultural crops is an important exercise because of it's huge impact on agri-business and agricultural policy management. Identification of crops during multiple crop growth stages can help formulate better agricultural policies and management strategies. In this context, the objective of this article is to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery in crop classification for an Indian region. A multi-class classification algorithm based on the support vector machine (SVM) is applied to the temporal features extracted from the above mentioned satellite data sets. The experiments are conducted for Kharif and Rabi crop cycles with major crops in the region. The experiments suggest that the joint use of optical and radar imagery results in better classification accuracy compared to using them individually. An overall accuracy of 89% and 96% is obtained for Kharif and Rabi crops, respectively.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeated monitoring of paddy rice is essential for government agencies and policy makers to maintain the balance of supply and demand for rice. Recent studies have mostly concentrated on the mapping of paddy rice with temporal satellite imagery during growing seasons. Given the phenological variation within paddy rice fields and spectral confusion between paddies and other vegetation classes, our ability to identify paddy rice fields with temporal imagery remains limited. The objective of this study is to develop new phenology and textural-based strategies to detect paddies with HJ-1A, MODIS and PALSAR FNF imagery. Two phenology-based strategies that track the seasonal trajectory of crops and one textural-based strategy that contains image surface characteristics are presented. With the proposed strategies, temporal, spectral and textural features were investigated for paddy rice detection. The results indicate that the phenology-based strategies could reveal the phenological variation within paddy rice and significantly improved the detection accuracy. Seasonal amplitude, grey level co-occurrence matrix entropy and spectral features of the heading stage were proven to be important in identifying paddy rice. It was concluded that the combination of HJ-1A, MODIS and PALSAR FNF imagery are promising in facilitating the rapid mapping of paddy rice at a regional scale.

AB  - Operational ice services around the world have recognized the economic and environmental benefits that come from the increased capabilities and uses of space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observation system. The two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large areal coverage, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. Although until now, L-Band SAR sensors are rarely used in an operational context, it offers greater capabilities for sea ice type retrieval and is more robust during the melt season compared to higher frequency bands. With the help of JAXA's ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 sensor, we are able to explore the potential of polarimetric L-band acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification in an operational environment. In this study we investigated the incidence angle related variation on the L-band backscatter and recommended optimal scenarios for Artificial Neural Network based sea ice type retrieval schemes.

AB  - The aim of this research was to assess the pyrogenic load and recovery processes after the fire event of 2016 within the drained site of Bakchar bog. Satellite remote sensing data and field data were collected for this study. The specific objectives of this study were: 1) to conduct field studies in key sites with different pyrogenic load keys in order to assess projective cover and species composition of the vegetation cover and 2) to compare field data with satellite image data using the vegetation index and perform spatial assessment of vegetation post-pyrogenic recovery in the first three years after the fire. The area of fire spread was 5.54 km(2), including 4.44 km(2) within the mire. The intensity and character of the vegetation recovery are differed between sites pyrogenic load classes. The first and second classes of the pyrogenic load are characteristic by the most intensive recovery process. These classes occupy 78 % of the burned area. NDVI values in three years after the fire become close and even exceed the values characteristic for drained pine-dwarf shrubs-sphagnum bogs mainly due to the intensive renewal of dwarf shrub layer. The emergence of deciduous trees will lead to a significant increase in the vegetation index in subsequent years.

AB  - Analysis Ready Data (ARD) products are enabling users to get first hand satellite data that are 'ready to use' for a wide range of applications, including time-series analysis and the way forward to multi-sensor interoperability. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) is leading the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) initiative. The rationale behind this initiative is to enable users to access products that have been already processed to a certain level. This will allow users to carry out immediate analysis on the data and to address a variety of applications without the extra time and cost that is associated with the data pre-processing steps. The aim of the proposed paper is to give an overview on the work already carried out by the CEOS community on the CARD4L framework, to introduce the processes and steps that Earth Observation (EO) data providers should undertake to have a CARD4L level product as well as the planned steps that CEOS LSIVC will be undertaking to accomplish the CARD4L initiative.

AB  - The Lancang Island waters have the potential of marine biological resources such as the crab (Portunus pelagicus). The crab is a species that eats suspended material. Remote sensing can estimate the parameters of Total Suspended Solid (TSS). The purpose of this study was to estimate the distribution and test the accuracy of TSS concentrations in Lancang Island waters extracted from Landsat 8 OLI images by field observations. Statistical test indicators that can be used for accuracy tests include; root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and normalized mean absolute error (NMAE). The results of the RMSE value was 11.5 showed that the size of the error based on the difference between the value of the image and field data. The smaller the RMSE value, means the results of the model estimation produced was more precise with those observations. The MAE value of 1.774 showed the simplest form of error size. The MAE results indicated that it could be seen that the prediction error of the distribution of TSS was too small. It means the prediction of the distribution of TSS in this study had high accuracy. The NMAE of 31.9% shows the error rate that is normalized and expressed in percent (%). The NMAE value below 30% that could be used as proof of the validity of image data. The high error value was caused by differences in the time taken by field data with the recording time of satellite images and the effect of thin cloud cover.

AB  - This chapter focuses on cultural and religious factors related to the rise of the Islamist jihadist movement. We make the distinction between the Islamic worldview and ideology and place much of jihadist beliefs that motivate terrorist action in the category of ideology. We discuss the cultural drivers of jihadism couched in the context of religious-cultural paradigms. Specifically, we explore cultural and religious factors that drive the behavior or actions of radical Islamist jihadists toward violence, factors such as grievance and humiliation crisis, revenge and the need to defeat the enemy, establishment of the Islamic State and the re-establishment of the Islamic caliphate, the vanguard of the ummah, martyrdom and reward in the afterlife, glorification of Allah, defending sacred places, the temporal paradigm, and chivalric and heroic feats.

AB  - Cognitive dual satellite system, where primary and secondary satellites transmit data on multiple spot beams on the same sub-channel is investigated. To be specific, overlay mode of operation is proposed in which the secondary satellite acts as a relay for the primary satellite while simultaneously transmitting its data. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) precoding along with multi-resolution broadcasting is proposed for the secondary satellite. The NOMA precoder exploits the correlated channels and it can be used to transmit the data of both satellites for the users in each spot beam. The achievable data rates at both primary and secondary satellites are characterized. The overlay mode based cognitive dual satellite system is shown to achieve better sum-rate than the interweave mode based cognitive dual satellite system.

AB  - Multiple spot beam and full frequency reuse based dual satellite systems are investigated in this work. Both satellites in the proposed DSS use precoding to mitigate intra satellite (inter spot beam) interference among its users. The inter satellite interference is mitigated through joint decoding at the receivers. To be specific, receivers in each spot beam utilize the structure of the strongest inter satellite interfering signal and treat the other inter satellite interfering signals as additive white Gaussian noise. The minimum sum-power needed to achieve a target data rate is evaluated using rank-relaxed semidefinite programming technique. The proposed technique is shown to achieve higher throughput than traditional interference ignorant decoder based protocol. The proposed protocol is also benchmarked against centralized precoding technique, where both satellites together act as a virtual single satellite and eliminate inter satellite and intra satellite interference through precoding. If the users associated with both satellites are co-located, then the proposed protocol is shown to outperform centralized precoding.

TI  - Estimation of Above Ground Biomass Using Support Vector Machines and ALOS/PALSAR data
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - L-band Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been extensively used for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation due to its higher saturation level. However, SAR backscatter is highly influenced by the topography characteristics along with the bio-geophysical properties of vegetation and underneath soil characteristics. This has limited the accuracy of directly relating the SAR backscatter with above ground biomass in highly undulated terrain. In this study, it has been observed that terrain degree of slope and aspect plays a vital role in influencing the SAR backscatter in addition with AGB. Because of this, the degree of slope and aspect along with SAR backscatter in HH (transmit and receive polarizations are horizontal) and HV (transmit horizontal and receive vertical) polarizations have been considered as inputs for Support Vector Machine (SVM) to improve the biomass retrieval accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of AGB estimation over hilly terrain can be significantly improved by considering topographical characteristics in addition to L-band backscatter.

AB  - The temperature data of the mesopause region obtained for the period 2013-2018 at the station Maimaga (63.04 degrees N, 129.51 degrees E) was investigated. During the winter period of the 2014-2015 observation season, the characteristic of the internal gravity waves (IGW) activity sigma(gw) has lower values than in other seasons, and the average night temperature of the mesopause region, on the contrary, exceeds corresponding values in other seasons. For comparison, satellite data of temperature profiles obtained by EOS MLS (Aura) are given. After isolating and subtracting the contribution of the gravitational component from the EOS MLS temperature profiles for the region above the Maimaga station, the difference in the winter stratopause of the 2014-2015 season is noticeable. During this season, the winter stratopause has lower temperatures than in other seasons, taking into account the deduction of the contribution of temperature fluctuations due to IGW.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)
CL  - Glasgow, ENGLAND
AB  - A key challenge in the treatment of colorectal cancer is identification of the sentinel draining lymph node. Magnetomotive ultrasound, MMUS, has identified lymph nodes in rat models: superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) accumulated in the lymph are forced to oscillate by an external magnetic field; the resulting axial displacement is recovered allowing structure delineation with potential to indicate alterations in tissue stiffness, but it is limited by small vibration amplitudes. We propose CE-MMUS using SPION loaded microbubbles (SPION-MBs) to enhance sensitivity, reduce toxicity, and offer additional diagnostic or perfusion information. Laser doppler vibrometry measurements was performed on SPION containing tissue mimicking material during magnetic excitation. These measurements show a vibration amplitude of 279 +/- 113 mu m in a material with Young's modulus of 24.3 +/- 2.8 kPa, while the displacements were substantially larger, 426 +/- 9 mu m, in the softer material, with a Young's modulus of 9.6 +/- 0.8 kPa. Magnetic field measurement data was used to calibrate finite element modelling of both MMUS and CE-MMUS. SPION-MBs were shown to be capable of inducing larger tissue displacements under a given magnetic field than SPIONs alone, leading to axial displacements of up to 2.3x larger. A doubling in tissue stiffness (as may occur in cancer) reduces the vibration amplitude. Thus, there is potential for CE-MMUS to achieve improved stiffness sensitivity. Our aim is to define the potential contribution of CE-MMUS in colorectal cancer diagnosis and surgical guidance.

AB  - Lymphatic dissemination of tumor cells involves invasion into tumor-associated lymphatic vessels, seeding of metastases in the lymph nodes, and, ultimately, delivery into the blood circulation and to distant organs. Tumor lymphangiogenesis is induced by factors released by tumor or stromal cells, such as macrophages, and facilitates metastasis by providing pathways for cancer cell spread. Vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D are the most specific lymphangiogenic factors that mediate signals for lymphatic endothelial cell growth and migration by binding to and activating VEGFR-3 receptors. Extensive preclinical data in mouse tumor models with specific inhibitors of lymphangiogenic signaling pathways provided the impetus for clinical trials of such agents in patients. In clinical practice, the presence of tumor cells in sentinel lymph nodes is an adverse prognostic factor for patients with solid tumors and constitutes a major consideration in tumor staging. Lymphovascular invasion, lymphatic vessel densities, and the expression of lymphangiogenic factors are also strongly correlated with poor prognosis. Although lymphatic and blood vascular endothelium share many molecular features, they are structurally and functionally distinct and play very different roles in tumors. Here, we discuss the distinct functions and significance of the lymphatic vascular system in cancer.

AB  - The results of the comparison of the values of the standard satellite product "Chlorophyll a Concentration" recovered from MODIS-Aqua satellite with the results of field measurements in the coastal waters of the Black Sea near Sevastopol from 2009 to 2019 as a part of regular bio-optical monitoring have been presented. Differences between seasons in the nature of the error of the standard satellite product "Chlorophyll a Concentration" using the standard NASA algorithm were established: in spring, a significant underestimation of the values of the standard satellite product "Chlorophyll a Concentration" (up to 2.1 times) at high chlorophyll a concentrations was noted according to the results of the full-scale measurements, and in summer a significant overestimation of the values (up to 3.8 times) at low concentrations was noted. Throughout the year, depending on the season, the error in determining the standard satellite product "Chlorophyll a Concentration" on average varied from +/- 24 % to +/- 51 %. To increase the accuracy of determining the chlorophyll a concentration with remote sensing, it is necessary to use a regional approach.

AB  - Historical structures of the agricultural landscapes (HSAL) result from interactions among natural and human factors within a geographic area. The paper is focused on HSAL consisting of arable land and grassland with the typical occurrence of terraces. This type was found in 23 localities, covering 23.85% of the agricultural land in the cadastral district of Cierny Balog (Slovakia). HSAL were classified into 8 categories (according to their land cover composition, and current land uses); 40% of HSAL was cultivated actively. Generally, we proposed incentives focusing on preservation of landscape character, including protection of habitats on terraces and removing non-forest woody vegetation covering the HSAL.

AB  - The paper aims to discuss the difficulties with vegetation indices determined using satellite imagery of Brassica napus crops. Data used in the study was registered by Sentinel-2 satellite. Differential evolution method was used for vegetation model fitting for numerous monitored fields. In specific cases that procedure allowed to determine parameters even with a very limited number of clear images. Crop vegetation modeling using only NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) or solely on EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) is often problematic while these indices are not resistant to imagery issues caused by clouds and cloud shadows registered on earth surface. To overcome the limitations of those indices the novel index MSVI (Maxima Standardized Vegetation Index) was proposed. Robust regression was used to find its optimal parameters for individual fields. To verify the presented methodology a set of satellite images of Grudziadz area (northern Poland) for the period 1st to 25th of May 2018 was used, with 6373 fields of Brassica napus that were analyzed. According to the conducted experiments, the median value of absolute error of the florescence date estimated using the proposed methodology was only 0.421 days and was significantly lower to those calculated using conventional indices: NDVI or EVI - 1.191 and 14.128 days respectively.

T2  - PROBLEMOS
M3  - Article
AB  - By using cognitive definition method created by the Lublin ethnolinguists, this paper aims to explore the Lithuanian conception of wisdom and where it stands within the set of moral values. Firstly, the data from various dictionaries is examined. The second part analyses data from a survey and represents the contemporary worldview of a young person. The third part is an analysis of data from six discourses, revealing wisdom as a complex concept. In the end, the cognitive definition is formulated. It reflects the understanding, evaluation, and characterization of wisdom in Lithuanian ' s mind, together with its coherence to other values and virtues.

AB  - The article was prepared for the purpose of scientific substantiation of the need for further development of information technologies in the field of notary activities. The authors of the article to achieve this target, developing a scientific content, methodologically based on the materialist, positivistic worldview, applying a number of general scientific, special scientific and special methods. Currently, at the stage of modernization of the Russian economy, the notary can serve as a guarantor of the stability of civil turnover, and it is the notaries that can offer the most effective, including electronic, ways of protecting property rights and the legitimate interests of citizens and legal entities. Electronic notary document's turnover is considered by the Authors in direct interaction with the electronic public services of state authorities and administration. An electronic notarized document is considered as a priority area of online interaction of legal entities in modern document's turnover. The article examines one of the new notary actions to certify the equivalence of paper and electronic documents, as well as the procedure for transferring documents that do not lose their legal force, in electronic form to another notary.

TI  - On possibility of remote detection of gas leaks from underwater pipelines using specific slick signatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2019
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - One of the urgent problems of gas pipeline transport today is the detection of gas leaks in underwater sections of gas pipelines and reducing their negative impact on the environment. This paper is devoted to the development of remote detection methods of gas leaks from underwater gas pipelines by images of slicks above them.A series of laboratory experiments was carried out, in which the structure of average flows in the water column created by bubble flows with different gas flow rates was obtained. The simulation of surfactant removal to the water surface by bubbles was performed by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the laboratory cuvette at the concentration of 0.5 mg/l. For the surfactant film on the water surface, experimental dependences of its characteristics on the operation time of the "bubble pump", such as the surface tension coefficient, elasticity and the relative damping coefficient of small-scale waves under the film, were obtained. It was shown that there are flow convergence zones at some distance from the gas outlet area, which vary depending on the intensity of the gas flow. Surfactant film samples taken in these areas confirmed that over time, the accumulation of surfactants occurs on the water surface. Field experiment conducted in one of the backwaters of the Oka river in the city of Nizhny Novgorod allowed to spot and evaluate the size and shape of the film slick formed around the gas outlet area.The conducted experiments confirmed the formation of a surfactant film spot near the removal area, which indicates the possibility of its remote detection in full-scale conditions, provided the wind near water surface is not more than 2-10 m/s. The obtained data made it possible to get a general idea of the morphology and characteristics of the surfactant spot around the gas outlet from the water.

TI  - A Latent Class Analytic Approach to Identifying Structures of Classist Ideology from World-View Orientations
T2  - JOURNAL OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study identified clusterings of individuals based on worldview orientations including epistemological style, right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance, and religious fundamentalism. The groups were compared on classist attitudes. U.S. participants (N = 272) completed a 2015 online survey. The latent class analysis's fit indices supported a three-group solution, including moderates (40%), progressives (35.8%), and traditionalists (25.2%). Assessing differences between classes, an analysis of covariance indicated that progressives had the lowest levels of classism, followed by moderates, then traditionalists, after controlling for demographics. This study illuminates worldview ideologies associated with classism and represents a step in understanding the underlying structure of classism.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance: two decades experience of sustainable systems - its people not just data!
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Syndromic surveillance is a form of surveillance that generates information for public health action by collecting, analysing and interpreting routine health-related data on symptoms and clinical signs reported by patients and clinicians rather than being based on microbiologically or clinically confirmed cases. In England, a suite of national real-time syndromic surveillance systems (SSS) have been developed over the last 20 years, utilising data from a variety of health care settings (a telehealth triage system, general practice and emergency departments). The real-time systems in England have been used for early detection (e.g. seasonal influenza), for situational awareness (e.g. describing the size and demographics of the impact of a heat-wave) and for reassurance of lack of impact on population health of mass gatherings (e.g. the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games). We highlight the lessons learnt from running SSS, for nearly two decades, and propose questions and issues still to be addressed. We feel that syndromic surveillance is an example of the use of 'big data', but contend that the focus for sustainable and useful systems should be on the added value of such systems and the importance of people working together to maximise the value for the public health of syndromic surveillance services.

TI  - Azimuthally averaged structure of Hurricane <i>Edouard</i> (2014) just after peak intensity
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of dropsonde data collected in Hurricane Edouard (2014) just after its mature stage are presented. These data have unprecedentedly high spatial resolution, based on 87 dropsondes released by the unmanned NASA Global Hawk from an altitude of 18 km during the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) field campaign. Attempts are made to relate the analyses of the data to theories of tropical cyclone structure and behaviour. The tangential wind and thermal fields show the classical structure of a warm-core vortex, in this case with a secondary eyewall feature. Additionally, the equivalent potential temperature field ((e)) shows the expected structure with a mid-tropospheric minimum at outer radii and contours of (e) flaring upwards and outwards at inner radii. With some imagination, these contours are roughly congruent to the surfaces of absolute angular momentum. However, details of the analysed radial velocity field are quite sensitive to the way in which the sonde data are partitioned to produce an azimuthal average. This sensitivity is compounded by an apparent limitation of the assumed steadiness of the storm over the period of data collection.

TI  - Concordant Evidence-Based Interventions in Cardiac and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Guidelines
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOPULMONARY REHABILITATION AND PREVENTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) contribute to a significant burden to patients and many experience a reduction in physical functioning, psychological health, and quality of life. The sentinel symptom for COPD and CVD is breathlessness. Rehabilitation programs have been proven to reduce disease symptoms and increase levels of physical and psychological wellness. Pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation programs have been recommended in international and national guidelines for managing COPD and CVD. Given that these programs seek to reduce breathlessness and improve the physical and psychological functioning of people with COPD and CVD, this review examines the concordant evidence-based interventions in rehabilitation guidelines. The findings of this review indicate that there was concordance in the program design, location of programs, types of health professionals involved in program delivery, assessments of patient at commencement and completion of program, and the delivery of educational topics with minor deviations that were related to disease-specific topics. Apart from disease-specific recommendations, the main divergence from rehabilitation guidelines was found to be dietary screening, inspiratory muscle training, and psychological assessments in evidence-based recommendations for cardiac and pulmonary programs.

TI  - VALERIUS MAXIMUS: THE ROMAN AT THE TURN OF THE AGE
T2  - VESTNIK DREVNEI ISTORII-JOURNAL OF ANCIENT HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the views of Valerius Maximus (first half of the first century AD), the author of a collection of moralizing stories, Factotum et dictorum memorabilium libri novem. Valerius Maximus' work belongs to the time of transition from the Republic to the Empire. The main idea of his work is to praise Roman traditional values related to the Republic. Approximately three out of every five stories in his work refer to the epoch before the Gracchi, when the crisis of the Republic started. He does not indulge in edification, rather, in his work there can be seen a timeless admiration for Valour and condemnation of Vice, the contrast with contemporaneity being implicit. At the same time, he praises the modem life attributing its benefits to the ruling Emperor. Having no access to power and its privileges he might have been quite sincere in his admiration for the Emperor. It was not only due to the tradition but also to his worldview that he is associated with both ages, making at the same time apparent a connection between their views and values despite their discrepancy. Valerius Maximus' work presents a set of knowledge and ideas that reflected the worldview of an ordinary educated Roman.

TI  - The impact of low volume lymph node metastases and stage migration atter pathologic ultrastaging of non-sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage cervical cancer: a study of 54 patients with 4.2 years of follow up
T2  - GINEKOLOGIA POLSKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To assess the significance of pathologic ultrastaging (PU) of sentinel (SLN) and non-sentinel (nSLN) lymph nodes (LNs) and the influence on cancer staging in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA2-IB1 cervical cancer.Material and methods: A retrospective study was conducted with 54 patients divided into two equal-sized groups. In test group (n1), at least one SLN/patient was detected with blue dye. All excised LNs in this group were subjected to PU (4 mu m slices/150 pm intervals) with hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry (AE1-AE3 antibodies). In none of the control group (n2) was PU performed, but in 2 patients SLN concept was performed. Patients in both groups underwent radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. The effect of PU was expressed in puTNM and compared with both standard pTNM and FIGO systems.The influence of PU on patients'disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:In total, 516 LNs were extracted (66 SLNs, 36% bilaterally). Micrometastases (MIC) or isolated tumor cells (ITC) were detected in 34 of the 482 LNs (7.1%), including 16 MICs and 9 ITC in non-SLNs. False negative rates were: 3.7%/side-specific, and 7.4%/both sides.The use of PU resulted in stage change in 2 cases (N and M status change), FIGO stage did not changed. No PU impact on DFS or OS was observed.Conclusions: The risk of TNM stage migration in early cervical cancer is low, is more likely in inattentively evaluated patients, and has indeterminate prognostic and predictive value. Selection of cases with cT <= 2 cm and cNO is sufficient to avoid the risk of improper staging.

TI  - Economic Obsession in Early Literary Imagination: Shakespeare, Jonson and More
T2  - INTERLITTERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - That revenues, profits, wealth, valuables, properties and various forms of riches can be so attractive to most people is because these resources affect the operational mode of social economy and personal well-being. As a major driving force of social development, the desire to accumulate wealth affords people the prospect of leading a comfortable life. Yet the acquisition of which may bring down other people to become poorer and creating potential social injustice. Three interrelated concepts in money spending: consumption, fear of poverty and social justice/injustice are markedly shown in some of the great minds among English writers.In this article, Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Ben Jonson's Volpone and Thomas More's Utopia are used to demonstrate the concerns of the early modern English mentality. Some scholars have suggested that the first two playwrights reflected the fear that their London would come to be ruled by corruption, swindling, greediness, vicious competition and unethical business practices. In this pre-capitalist economy, people are seen to adopt unfair competition and reciprocal malice in order to accumulate wealth. Entrepreneurial liberation in economic affairs sets off the dark side of hu manity in which the playwrights were most probably implicated.To counteract this rapacious thinking, Thomas More offers his conception of a wealthy and happy worldly life. Not to attack the self-centered, bene fit gaining intentions, Utopia builds up a society that claims fairness, commonwealth, more obligations than privileges and the wiping away of vanity. Mercantilism is not denied, yet private property is contained. Written earliest among the three works, Utopia anticipates the two plays that dwell on social evils sparked by over concern for personal gains.Generally, the three works lay the foundation of positive and negative aspects of economy in terms of production, marketing, circulation, consumption and services of the English mind of that era. The social mood borders on the financial and political matters of the bourgeois class while providing a mega-worldview as well as micro-worldview of economic concern of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries England.

M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrographic basin is the basic unit for the management of water resources, which provides subsidies for environmental planning. The objective of this work was to characterize the morphometry of the Santa Teresinha River microbasin. The geometric characteristics, relief and drainage were analyzed using Alos image (Palsar sensor) and QGIS software. The microbasin has an area of 179.64 km(2), a perimeter of 78.31 km, an elongated form, low susceptibility to floods, altitudes between 190 and 241 m, predominance of relief features wavy corrugated smooth, rectilinear drainage network with 3rd order dendritic pattern, low drainage densities, hydrographic and of springs, concentration time of 18 hours and 51 minutes, low susceptibility to water erosions and propensities to soil flooding. Thus, the use of computational tools allows the generation of geomorphological information, in a timely manner and low financial cost, to assist in the planning and management of water resources, providing subsidies for the formation of public policies.

T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of human in any culture, including the culture of the nomads of Inner Asia, is procreation. The standard of traditional society was the life of its members in the family, surrounded by children and grandchildren. This article attempts to accumulate known material reflecting the features of the reproductive culture of the Turkic-Mongolic peoples of Inner Asia, representatives of predominantly nomadic culture, its development right up to the beginning of the 20th century. Research interest focused on basic ideas and actions that program the future family well-being of nomadic society young members. Attention was also focused to the problem of extramarital relations of maidens and women among the Turkic-Mongolian peoples of Inner Asia, as an important category of reproductive culture. A comparative historical and comparative typological analysis of the worldview, the ritual sphere and the legal culture of nomads revealed a common ideological layer, which formed the idea of the need for marriage and the sinfulness of loneliness. People who did not marry, or those who remained childless, became outcasts of society. They were associated by a number of negative ideas and will accept, including the views of the transformation of unmarried childless women after death into evil spirits that harm women and children. The study of the problem of chastity in the nomadic environment shows the divergence of views and customs of the traditional society with the ethical standards reflected in the legal culture of the Mongolian empire and its successors. The laws of the Mongol Empire differed most rigorously. In the process of further development of the Mongolian law, there is a softening of punishments for illegal sexual relations, along with the growing loyalty of society to extramarital relations and the birth of illegitimate children. The reason for this situation was, in our opinion, a gender imbalance that developed in a nomadic society by the 17th - 19th centuries, a high mortality rate among women of reproductive age and children. In this regard, the scenario of reproductive behavior in the culture of the Mongolic peoples has become focused on the birth of children without any restrictions.

TI  - The neotropical reforestation hotspots: A biophysical and socioeconomic typology of contemporary forest expansion
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical reforestation is a significant component of global environmental change that is far less understood than tropical deforestation, despite having apparently increased widely in scale during recent decades. The regional contexts defining such reforestation have not been well described. They are likely to differ significantly from the geographical profiles outlined by site-specific observations that predominate in the literature. In response, this article determines the distribution, extent, and defining contexts of apparently spontaneous reforestation. It delineates regional 'hotspots' of significant net reforestation across Latin America and the Caribbean and defines a typology of these hotspots with reference to the biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics that unite and distinguish amongst them. Fifteen regional hotspots were identified on the basis of spatial criteria pertaining to the area, distribution, and rate of reforestation 2001-2014, observed using a custom continental MODIS satellite land-cover classification. Collectively, these hotspots cover 11% of Latin America and the Caribbean and they include 167,667.7 km(2) of new forests. Comparisons with other remotely sensed estimates of reforestation indicate that these hotspots contain a significant amount of tropical reforestation, continentally and pantropically. The extent of reforestation as a proportion of its hotspot was relatively invariable (3-14%) given large disparities in hotspot areas and contexts. An ordination analysis defined a typology of five clusters, distinguished largely by their topographical roughness and related aspects of agro-ecological marginality, climate, population trends, and degree of urbanization: 'Urban lowlands', 'Mountainous populated areas', 'Rural highlands', 'Rural humid lands' and 'Rural dry lands'. The typology highlights that a range of distinct, even oppositional regional biophysical, demographic, and agricultural contexts have equally given rise to significant, regional net reforestation, urging a concomitant diversification of forest transition science.

TI  - STRUCTURAL MODEL AND TECTONIC EVOLUTION OF THE FAULT SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE KHUR AREA, CENTRAL IRAN
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the southern part of the Khur area, there is faults system with predominantly North-West strike. This network of tectonic disturbances is one of the most important fault systems in Central Iran which crosses Paleozoic metamorphic rocks, Cretaceous limestones, and Eocene volcanic rocks. Interpretation of satellite imagery ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus, Landsat) and field observations showed the presence of left-lateral shifts along with fault system. This formed the structure of the branch faults at the northeast end of the main fault. Another feature associated with shear dislocations is the rotation of blocks in the northeastern and southwestern segments of the area under study. There are several basins and positive structures within the area such as a series of uplifts and thrusts, indicating the presence of compressional and extensional tectonics.Another part of the work is devoted to the study of the correlation between active faults and earthquakes. Processing of satellite images, field observations, records of micro-earthquakes within a radius of 17 km made it possible to analyze the earthquakes parameters and the position of tectonic disturbances, and, as a result, confirm the presence of active faults in the region. In addition, we have identified three successive stages of the Khur area tectonics: rifting, contraction, change of convergence and uplift direction.

AB  - The Metropolitan city of Roma Capitale (Italy) represents a vast area, which purposes are not only institutional but also specific functions, such as the promotion and coordination of economic and social development. The park areas included in the Metropolitan area are able to provide ecosystem services and resources such as agricultural and forest products. The rational exploitation of biomass resources produced around the Metropolitan area can be an opportunity to replace fossil fuels, make the city more climate friendly and, at the same time, to relaunch the sustainable management of forest that are often abandoned and prone to degradation risk. The goal of this paper is to investigate and update the actual distribution of the main forest types of the Bracciano-Martignano Regional Natural Park, through GIS and Remote Sensing techniques, in order to assess the biomass potential present in the forest areas. Results confirmed the importance of Sentinel-2 satellite data for vegetation applications, allowing to map species and surfaces as well as to carry out other studies at regional scale with a high overall accuracy. The forest types distribution analysis performed inside the park showed that there are about 20,000 t of woody biomass per year available, indicating that rationale forest management can be strategic to deal both with forest degradation and city energy supply.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Information regarding both the spatial distribution and the quantity of vegetation components is of great relevance in different fields. Of particular interest is the detection of Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) against Photosynthetic Vegetation (PV) and Bare Soil (BS). In-situ approaches exist that identify NPV, but are time and cost expensive. In this context, remote sensing is useful thanks to its ability to provide information at different temporal, spatial and spectral scales. While commonly used vegetation indexes, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), provide robust information to highlight PV, the distinction of NPV from BS is less trivial. Some indices designed for Landsat and Sentinel-2 (S2) bands(1) identify only a part of NPV, the one related to tillage, but they do not provide the proper differentiation of NPV and BS. The Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI)(2,3) exists that may highlight the presence of NPV. Nevertheless, available broadband multispectral sensors like MODIS, Landsat or S2 do not spectrally resolve these narrow wavelength features, thus CAI cannot be directly extracted. This paper presents a surrogated index for the identification and differentiation of NPV, PV and BS in high spatial resolution S2 Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). To do so, inspiration is taken from the paper presented by Guerschman et al.(4), where a surrogated CAI (CAI*) for MODIS sensor is presented, and moves one step forward in order extend it to high spatial resolution sensors. The S2 CAI* was qualitatively analysed on four different climate zones covering grassland and cropland areas.

AB  - Crop-type classification has been attracting a lot of attention in recent years. In particular since the launch of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite which combines a large amount of spectral and spatial information, compared to previous satellite generations. In the literature, several methods exist that perform crop classification in time series, but most of them: i) work at pixel level; ii) perform single-data analysis; and/or iii) consider a single feature. This results in low performance of state-of-the-art methods. This paper presents an approach that works at object-level and exploits both spatial and temporal information coded in NDVI time series and phenological parameters and takes advantage of a semi-supervised paradigm by combining a new hierarchical correlation clustering with an artificial neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was corroborated over an intensive cultivated area located in Barrax, Spain. Crop-type classification was compared to state-of-the-art methods.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - Current satellite missions (e.g., COSMO-SkyMed, Sentinel-1) collect single- or multi-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with multiple spatial resolutions and possibly short revisit times. The availability of heterogeneous data requires effective methods able to exploit all the available information. In the context of environmental monitoring and natural disaster recovery, this paper proposes an unsupervised change detection method able to properly fuse and exploit multiresolution and multimodality SAR data. The data fusion process is based on the estimation of the virtual images that would have been collected in case all the sensors worked at the same spatial resolution and on the definition of a probabilistic model based on generalized Gaussian distributions and Gram-Charlier approximations. The detection of changes is addressed in a probabilistic graphical framework through a novel conditional random field, by defining an energy function that is minimized through graph-cuts or belief propagation methods.

AB  - We investigate the deformation of Mt. Etna volcano (Italy) by exploiting the DInSAR technique referred to as the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm. In particular, we take advantage of the multi-sensor data processing capability of the SBAS algorithm which allows us to generate Mt. Etna mean deformation velocity maps and the corresponding time series in the last twenty-five years. To achieve this task, we exploit different set of SAR data collected by ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 radar sensors in the 1992-2018 time interval. We, also, show the deformation pattern induced by the recent seismo-volcanic crisis occurring from 24 to 27 December 2018. The main results show that the East-West displacement map highlights the most significant entities, whose maximum values exceed 30 cm towards the West and 40 towards the East on the summit of the volcano. In this scenario, the measurements permit to model the geometry and characteristics of the causative deformation sources; preliminary results suggest the presence of two different sources: a shallow dyke feeding the eruptive activity at summit craters and a major strike-slip fault/s on the southeastern flank nucleating the 26th mainshock.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of any forest provides valuable information to forest managers as well as to nature conservationists. In this study, the potential of three spaceborne sensors: (1) Landsat-8, (2) Sentinel-2, and (3) IRS-Pansharpened were compared by applying Random Forest (RF) classification algorithms to classify the three most common tree species: Pinus taeda, Alnus spp., and Populus spp., in Hyrcanian forest of Iran. Three RF models with optimized parameters of mtry and ntree were used for the classification of trees species. Based on our Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) analysis, IRS-Pansharpened data showed the highest accuracy (OA = 84.9% and KC = 79.7%), followed by Landsat-8 (OA = 78.2% and KC = 70.6%), and Sentinel-2 (OA = 77% and KC = 70%). According to the Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA) criterion delivered as an output of RF, the near-IR spectral band was found on the top rank (high variable importance) as compared to all other spectral bands for tree species classification. The findings of this study can be used by the researcher, forest managers, economists and policy and decision makers in the context of sustainable forest management of Hyrcanian forest resources.

AB  - We performed comparative analysis of the efficiency of planar scintigraphy and SPECT-CT in the localization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in the early stages of breast cancer in 50 patients. The true amount of SLN by lymphoscintigraphy was detected in 48% of observations, clear visualization was achieved in 78% of cases. There was no significant correlation between the efficiency of the planar study and the body mass index of the patients. The SPECT-CT analysis of regional lymphatic drainage of the mammary gland allowed to determine both the exact localization and the number of SLN in all patients included in the study. Comparison of SLN size and structure with histology results revealed no reliable association between CT anatomy and the presence of metastases in the lymph nodes.

AB  - The notion of sentinels with given sensitivity was introduced by J.L.Lions [11] in order to identify parameters in the problem of pollution ruled by a parabolic equation. He proves that the existence of such sentinels is reduced to the solution of exact controllability problem with constraints on the state. In population dynamics model, we reconsider this notion of sentinels in a more general framework. We prove the existence of the boundary sentinels by solving a boundary null-controllability problem with constraint on the control. Our results use Carleman inequality which is adapted to the constraint.

We shall solve this problem by transforming the simultaneous null controllability of uncoupled initial systems into a null controllability of a coupled system via a change of variables. This last problem is solved thanks to a global Carleman inequality, appropriates estimates adapted to the system and via some fixed point theorems. The obtained results are used to build a simultaneous sentinel of detection in a population dynamics model with incomplete data.

AB  - This paper presents a multiple spot single-feed-per-beam antenna for high throughput satellites. A three reflector solution is employed that uses horns, specially designed to maximize not only the directivity but also the carrier-to-interference ratio. In order to save costs for assembly and integration, an entire feed cluster including waveguide routing was manufactured by additive manufacturing technology. The determined performance for a multiple spot beam Ku-band scenario, based on measured pattern of the manufactured feed cluster, demonstrates the efficiency of the approach.

T2  - The Korean Journal of Slavic Studies
T2  - 슬라브硏究
M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine how Tolstoy’s experiences and memories are incorporated into his literary works, with reference to his first novel Childhood. For Tolstoy, the key to writing was thorough, almost obsessive self-reflection, and based on this, an affective understanding of the world. Therefore, his works are akin to sustained attempts at self-exploration, which can be seen as a rendering through fiction of his own memories. What should not be overlooked here is that his memories are comprised of not only events that actually happened but also potentialities that should have come about and those that he wished would transpire in the future. That is, his works are a combination of real and unreal or desired “memories”. In order to capture the mysterious and independent world that cannot be encompassed solely through empirical perceptions of material objects, Tolstoy developed a dual worldview consisting of both an imaginary and a realistic world by assimilating together both types of “memory” in his works. This fictional strategy forms a contrast between a world where the origin of existence is represented and the real or quotidian world where the essential is replaced by the superficial. Through the permeating sadness created by the conflicts and overlaps between these two worlds, Tolstoy depicts nature, love, religion, and life from the perspective of highly pure moral emotions, which are completely distinct from a notional moral code. This is his unique literary characteristic, and the interpretation of his novel Childhood from this perspective offers a unique insight into his worldview.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - India is known for its diversity of languages, cultures, ethnicities, religions and environment. However, the revisions to the current science curriculum and pedagogy in the National Curriculum Framework 2005 does not heed to the unique perspectives and value that this diversity brings to the vibrancy of its science classrooms and still imposes a monolithic curriculum in most schools. When I started my research into Tibetan Buddhist monastics' experiences of learning Western science, the literature was devoid of any lessons to draw from India or its neighbouring countries, despite the existence of various religions, cultures, languages and indigenous groups in the sub-continent where negotiation between traditional ways of knowing and Western science has been ongoing. Hence, in my research, I used the science education literature involving indigenous people and communities around the globe. These include indigenous people from the Americas, South Africa and Pacific Islands, where research has been undertaken about the experiences and challenges of learners in negotiating and integrating their traditional worldview with the worldview implicit in Western science education. In this chapter, I will share the experiences of monastics negotiating the intersection of Western science and Buddhist theology from an educational perspective and provide a brief history of programs that were set up to formalise Western science teaching in the Tibetan Buddhist monastic academic institutions of India.

AB  - This study analyzed the relationship of land cover type, urban temperature in Gimhae city, Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea. Date were used for land cover map, MODIS LST, and detailed temperature data on the Korean Peninsula based on RCP between 2000 and 2010. The correlation between urban area and surface temperature was 0.417, 0.512 for agricultural area and -0.607 for forest area. The correlation between surface temperature and air temperature was 0.301. The relationship with air temperature was analyzed as 0.275 for urban area, agriculture area 0.226, forest area 0.350. Urban and agricultural areas showed increased surface and air temperature as the area increased, while forest areas showed opposite improvements. In structural equation models, urban and agricultural areas had direct effects on the rise of surface temperature, whle forest areas had direct effects on the reduction of air temperature. In the future, it is necessary to use measured temperature data near the surface to understand the relationship between surface temperature and temperature according to the changes in spatial characteristics, which will prepare measures for urban heat island mitigation at the level of urban and environmental planning.

TI  - A Patch-Based Light Convolutional Neural Network for Land-Cover Mapping Using Landsat-8 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a light convolutional neural network (LCNN) well-fitted for medium-resolution (30-m) land-cover classification. The LCNN attains high accuracy without overfitting, even with a small number of training samples, and has lower computational costs due to its much lighter design compared to typical convolutional neural networks for high-resolution or hyperspectral image classification tasks. The performance of the LCNN was compared to that of a deep convolutional neural network, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF). SVM, KNN, and RF were tested with both patch-based and pixel-based systems. Three 30 km x 30 km test sites of the Level II National Land Cover Database were used for reference maps to embrace a wide range of land-cover types, and a single-date Landsat-8 image was used for each test site. To evaluate the performance of the LCNN according to the sample sizes, we varied the sample size to include 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 samples per class. The proposed LCNN achieved the highest accuracy in 13 out of 15 cases (i.e., at three test sites with five different sample sizes), and the LCNN with a patch size of three produced the highest overall accuracy of 61.94% from 10 repetitions, followed by SVM (61.51%) and RF (61.15%) with a patch size of three. Also, the statistical significance of the differences between LCNN and the other classifiers was reported. Moreover, by introducing the heterogeneity value (from 0 to 8) representing the complexity of the map, we demonstrated the advantage of patch-based LCNN over pixel-based classifiers, particularly at moderately heterogeneous pixels (from 1 to 4), with respect to accuracy (LCNN is 5.5% and 6.3% more accurate for a training sample size of 20 and 320 samples per class, respectively). Finally, the computation times of the classifiers were calculated, and the LCNN was confirmed to have an advantage in large-area mapping.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of multitemporal remote sensing images for crop classification. Multi-temporal Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS C1 Level-1 images were acquired. The surface reflectance of visible and near infrared bands was used to represent the characteristics of crops. A time series model of surface reflectance was constructed for crop classification. Cloud cover is critical for the accuracy of classification. In order to remove the influence of clouds, the cloud pixels were neglected by setting a constant. Pearson correlation coefficient was used in the time series model of surface reflectance to classify the crop type. Finally, the overall accuracy reaches 78.26% and Kappa reaches 71.33%. Therefore, the method has the operational potential for crop classification even in the special area with cloudy or foggy weather.

AB  - In recent years, with the acceleration of urbanization and the rapid growth of urban population, the impact of urban human activities on the ecological environment system has become more and more significant. How to scientifically to analyze the evolution characteristics of urban spatial form and demarcate the urban extension boundary scientifically and reasonably is of great significance to grasp the urban development context, construct a scientific and reasonable urban spatial form framework and guide the healthy and sustainable development of the city. This paper takes the Chenggong District of Kunming City, which has been developing rapidly in recent years, as the research object. It uses the Landsat remote sensing satellite image data onto different periods to extract the information on the land use type of the study area, and then combines the GIS technology to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of the urban form evolution in the Chenggong District. Finally, qualitative analysis is carried out in the aspects of the natural environment, policy orientation, economy and society in combination with the evolution of urban form. After introducing the four types of indicators: extended annual speed, extended dynamics, extended intensity and extended comprehensive index, the urban form evolution of Chenggong District was quantitatively analyzed. It was found that Chenggong District was in the stage of rapid development of urbanization in the past 15 years. There is obvious differentiation in the pattern the southwest and northwest directions are the main expansion directions, and the southeast direction is the slowest. Natural factors have greatly restricted the expansion of Chenggong' District. The development of economic construction and policy planning has become the main driving factors for urban land expansion and space-time evolution.

TI  - Object-based feature selection for crop classification using multi-temporal high-resolution imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With high-resolution remote-sensing data, there are numerous possible features for object description, making the selection of optimal features a time-consuming and subjective process. While substantial efforts have been made to compare the utility of feature selection metrics, less attention has been paid to the efficiency of such in the context of object-based image analysis. In this study, the statistical measurement z-score was used to ensure compatibility with objects. We assessed the feasibility of a z-score method, and then ranked and reduced input features using a backward elimination technique. The results showed that separability can be efficiently estimated based on z-score values, and the near-infrared band performed the best for crop classification. A straightforward trend was observed, and the optimal feature set was created, which was a combination of spectral, temporal, texture information and vegetation indices. These features complement one another to help increase crop map accuracy. For the 40% of the entire sample sizes, the optimal feature sets produced the best trade-off between the number of inputs and classification accuracy, with the misclassification error of 7.09%. Additionally, reliable crop maps were obtained, with the overall accuracy of 92.64%, and the z-score method showed great potential for the separability of crops at object scale using remotely sensed multi-temporal data.

TI  - <i>Static Slip Model of the 2017 M</i><sub>w</sub> <i>5.4 Pohang, South Korea, Earthquake Constrained by the InSAR Data</i>
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - An M-w 5.4 earthquake occurred in the city of Pohang in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula on 15 November 2017. It was a moderate-sized crustal event but triggered enormous attention from the Korean public because strong shaking was felt over the whole country, and it had been just a year since the M-w 5.5 Gyeongju earthquake, the largest instrumentally recorded event in the country. Both earthquakes occurred within 40 km of each other. The Pohang earthquake provides a unique opportunity to constrain the static slip model of an earthquake in Korea using spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations because the focal depth is relatively shallow (similar to 4 km), and surface displacement fields were successfully obtained by both descending and ascending orbits of the Sentinel-1A/B satellites. We performed a linear slip inversion using the InSAR data. Our slip model reveals that a major slip associated with the event occurred in the northeastern part of the hypocenter rather than in the southwestern part. In addition, its rupture dimension and mean slip are 5 km (width) by 6 km (length) and 15 cm, respectively. The InSAR data also show that no significant postseismic deformation occurred after the event.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel ship detection method in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. We model the sea clutter by a general multivariate Normal distribution. From the geometrical perspective of general multivariate Normal distribution, we show that the test statistic is actually a Mahalanobis distance, and the test threshold is essentially a hyper ellipsoidal surface. We detail the theoretical derivation and give the new CFAR detector. The proposed method is applied to synthetic data and a RADARSAT-2 SAR image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has good detection performance.

TI  - Analysis of Infrared Absorption Band for Volcano Based on Meteorological Satellite Cloud Image
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The targets have strong infrared radiation near the 2.7 and 4.3 mu m bands, so these two bands are also the best bands to detect the flying target, but since these two bands are not atmospheric windows, they are not included in most remote sensors. It is of great value to study the typical features of infrared absorption spectrum. However, due to the lack of necessary data acquisition ability, it often faces the problem of lack of data. There are frequent volcanic eruptions in various parts of the world. Whether volcanic eruptions have an impact on typical target detection or not is lacking in relevant analysis and research. In this paper, we get the data which transformed from the meteorological satellite data, through the wave band conversion model, based on the theory of atmospheric radiation transmission and the multivariate statistical analysis. The High temperature pixel is regarded as a mixed pixel of flame and background, and the target radiation is separated from the background to describe the thermal radiation of high temperature target pixel. When the aerosol mode is fixed, the observation zenith angle, atmospheric precipitation and the atmospheric profile are the influencing factors of the independent variable. For the background radiation brightness, the observation zenith angle, atmospheric precipitation in the atmosphere, atmospheric profile and background temperature are the influential factors of independent variables, and multivariate statistics are used to establish the relevant models. The volcano was detected by using the statistical characteristics of the third channel data of the FY-3 VIRR to obtain the apparent multidimensional features and quantitative analysis in time dimension, and the data of the same volcano are analyzed at different times. In spatial dimension, the spatial distribution characteristics of radiation brightness and luminance temperature of the crater are statistically calculated. The resolution of normal meteorological satellite is quite low, if we use pixel resolution to represent the volcanic area, the actual area of the volcano will be significantly exaggerated. So in this paper we propose a sub-pixel characteristics analysis method to increase the quantitative analysis accuracy. A combination of a mixture of pixels is considered as a combination of flame and background, and a linear spectral mixture model is used to accurately calculate the area and temperature of a volcano's high temperature point by the emissivity of the mixed pixel. The results show that the 2.7 similar to 2.95 mu m crater may interfere with the high temperature target in the weak background environment. In 4.2 similar to 4.45 mu m band, the crater has been proved to be a potential disturbance that can not be ignored. Its energy is much higher than the general surface type.

AB  - ZY-3 is the first civilian mapping satellite capable of stereo observation in China. This study systematically compares and analyzes block bundle adjustment models for Chinese ZY-3 satellite imagery. The experimental results revealed that: (a) there is no significant difference between the results of RSM-based (Rigorous Sensor Model based) and that of the RFM-based (Rational Function Model based) method for direct forward intersection. (b) it is reasonable to replace the RSM-based method using the RFM-based method when there are approriate control points. (c) the distribution of control points has a certain influence on the positioning results, especially for the RSM-based method. The use of shift model in image space can greatly improve the positioning accuracy when one control point is located in image center, and the systematic errors in initial RPCs of Chinese ZY-3 satellite are mainly translation errors.

AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from ALOS-2 PAL SAR, spanning the 2015-2018 period, are used to measure interseismic strain accumulation across the Zemuhe-Daliangshan fault zone. In order to mitigate the atmospheric contamination in the interferograms, we use the atmospheric delay estimated from the numerical weather model output from Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS). The results show that the atmospheric signal in interferograms represent strong seasonal fluctuations, and the GACOS-based corrections partially worked in removing the topography-dependent atmospheric delay in Sichuan-Yunan block block area, especially for those cross-season Interferograms. Mean line-of-sight (LOS) ratemap are estimated by inverting selected atmospheric-corrected and orbital-corrected interferograms from one interferometric descending track. Both the ratemap and its profile show a distinct tectonic signal across the Zemuhe fault. In the middle part of the Zemuhe fault, there is a local uplift area near the fault. Whether it is caused by fault motion or not, more evidences are needed. There is no clear gradient in displacement rate related to tectonic signal on the Daliangshan fault, which agrees with the insensitivity of InSAR to the north-south movement and the low geological slip rate of the Daliangshan fault.

Using the SPOT-6 observed after the disaster. The grain size index (GSI) value were applied for the extraction of the flood area. The extraction accuracy of the flood area was appropriately evaluated by using the interpretation result by the aerial photograph taken after the disaster. The extraction accuracy was improved by removing the excessively extracted area by DEM data and using spatial processing. In addition, the flood area was judged for each block by using the building polygon and the result of the extracted the flood area. It was considered that this method and improvement method was effectively used from these results to extract the flood area in the densely populated area and agricultural fields mixed.

AB  - Over mountainous region, the topographic effects in the form of shadow due to rugged terrain are very common which imposes the negative impact on the applicability of satellite dataset. Since the past decade, different topographic correction methods have been developed and implemented over hard classifiers to compensate for these topographic effects. But the impact of different topographic corrections on subpixel classification is still needed to be addressed over undulating terrain like the Himalayas. The subpixel classification methods deliver the information at subpixel level from low and coarse resolution satellite imagery which can be utilized in mapping or monitoring of land use and cover changes. Previous literature has shown that the performance of subpixel classification methods is highly influenced by topographic effects. In order to select an appropriate method of topographic correction for both subpixel classification and Himalaya region, different topographic correction methods have been implemented on AWiFS satellite dataset and performance of each topographically corrected image is analyzed over linear spectral mixing (LSM) as subpixel classification method. The experimental outcomes have been computed using visual analysis, graphical analysis, statistical analysis and accuracy assessment procedures. The study provides the necessary information regarding accurate analysis of change detection, glacier mass-balances, and monitoring.

AB  - In this article, I tried to examine Yu Gil-Joon's perception of Chosun, reflected in the book 'Seoyugyeonmun'. In the meantime, 'Seoyugyeonmun' has been in the spotlight as the result of a ‘Western cruise’, as it was titled. As a result, the focus tends to be on Western institutions introduced outwardly or on analyzing new conceptual words. In this article, I took a break from this view and tried to focus on the perception of Chosun as its own characteristic of the ‘Seoyugyeonmun’.In ‘Seoyugyeonmun’, Yu Gil-joon was not only focused on introducing the customs and systems of the West, but instead wanted to selectively accommodate the needs of Chosun. It is also directly related to his worldview, in which he want to take the moderation in dealing with all things and phenomena. For him, the moderation was the only way for a Korean to live in a world of barbarism (violence in civilization).Yu Gil-joon tried to follow the Western civilization system in a continuous view from the past, centering on the traditional and the original of Chosun, with a modest attitude. He prayed for the establishment of a civilized country like the West, but was thoroughly wary of becoming a colony of Western civilization. By defining Chosun as a spiritual civilized country, and by introducing Western institutions (especially modern education and law) centering on Chosun, he wanted to create an equal country with no protection needed, that could be comparable to the world's civilized countries.In this context, the ‘Seoyugyeonmun’ is not just a reform instruction of state affairs, but the first political book that tried to promote the future of Chosun with Koreans. The fact that he expressed the Perception of Chosun with Korean readers in mind can be seen in the following clues. They include consciously writing Korean and Chinese Characters, not only Chinese, warning and requesting Korean readers, not just praising the Western system, but examining the origins and analyzing the pros and cons, and emphasizing the pride of Chosun in the continuity with traditional practical science. Therefore, the ‘Seoyugyeonmun’ needs to be noted again from various angles.

AB  - In 1987, satellite sea surface temperature images were mailed to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Beaufort Laboratory to aid in tracking the first documented harmful algal bloom (HAB) along the North Carolina coast [1]. The HAB event demonstrated the need of Federal, State, and Local government scientists to use satellite imagery to aid in monitoring bio-oceanographic events. This led to establishment of the NOAA CoastWatch Program in 1989. Today, there are many types of users of satellite ocean remote sensing data products-Public, Commercial, Academic, and Federal, State, and Local Governments) needing both near real-time or delayed/science quality satellite oceanographic data. The CoastWatch data inventory has increased in both temporal and spatial holdings. These data are distributed through several services with the understanding that 'one size does not fit all' for data distribution. Through services, web pages, and online applications, CoastWatch allows users to interactively visualize, access or set up automated machine-to-machine scripts to acquire a wide variety of satellite oceanographic data and products.

T2  - LIMNETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Albufera of Valencia, a hypertrophic lake, has been studied extensively since the 1980s, but the efforts to revert the system to a clear water state have not yielded the expected results because pressure on this system is growing (increase in nutrient-rich water inputs, decrease in precipitation and increase in evaporation). The current state of the lake requires constant monitoring, and one of the main biological parameters used in ecology and water management to monitor and control the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems is chlorophyll a concentration [Chl-a]. In this sense, remote sensing is an optimal tool for continuous monitoring of the quality state of the water body through [Chl-a] and to obtain a better understanding of its spatial dynamics. This work aims to demonstrate the validity of an algorithm for [Chl-a] retrieval from Sentinel-2 (A and B), the new Earth observation satellites of the European Space Agency, with the sensor MSI, multispectral (13 bands) from 404 nm to 2200 nm, a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal frequency of 5 days - values unthinkable until now as regards to open access images. The study was carried out with images from 2016 and 2017, but only 40 images out of the 81 taken by the satellite could be used - such rate was mainly due to unfavourable weather conditions. Once images were downloaded, the SNAP 5 software was used for the processing. Using the Sen2cor tool, they were corrected atmospherically and, with the algorithm developed by Soria et al. 2017, lake [Chl-a] was estimated. Estimated data were validated against field samples: a total of 18 sampling campaigns were carried out and 92 samples were taken to measure the [Chl-a] . In addition, to better interpret results, data on conductivity and Secchi disk depths measurements were taken in the field and hydrological, precipitation and wind data were also collected. Results of the validation were deemed very good since an R = 0.8 was obtained when applying a linear correlation between field data and estimates, which shows the robustness of the algorithm used. From the interpretation of the thematic maps, it was possible to infer that the temporal evolution in [Chl-a] variations follows an annual bimodal pattern, where the decrease in [Chl-a] is determined either by a significant increase in water renewal of the lake or by the depletion of the available nutrients in the water due to a previous excessive growth of phytoplankton.

AB  - The State of Tabasco in Southeastern Mexico is subject to recurrent floods affecting the rural and services sector with important economic loss. The objective of this study was to contribute in the determination of flooding behavior occurring in this State during the rainy season using SAR Sentinel-1A images. The project was realized in 2017, a year when registered precipitation levels attained an accumulation of 2,013.9 mm, when September and October were the rainiest months. Cartographic information was produced concerning flooded areas, water bodies and wetlands before the waters receded. This information was compared for the same areas during the dry season. The methodology is apt to be used to monitor floods by INEGI and by state governments' personnel elsewhere in the country to respond to natural disasters and emergencies. INEGI is the official organization responsible for geographic information in Mexico.

AB  - The experimental study of the efficiency of interferometric data processing algorithms for synthetic aperture space radars is complicated by the fact that a quantitative result can be obtained only after the completion of the entire technological chain. The efficiency of the first stages of interferometric processing incoherent accumulation and suppression of phase noise-has been studied on the basis of the method of inverse transformation of standards previously proposed by the authors. The results of estimation of accuracy of digital elevation model construction for ALOS PALSAR data with different base lengths and polarizations of the probing signal are presented.

AB  - A method of space-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements ( InSAR and DInSAR techniques) allows to obtain different types of altitude data for the Earth surface, i.e. terrain heights and displacements. Phase noise is an intrinsic random uncorrelated additive process, which complicates data processing in such systems. Different processing approaches ( on example of ALOS PALSAR scenes) are proposed from the phase noise suppression efficiency point-of-view for digital elevation models creation tasks. An accuracy estimation for these approaches based on a reference digital elevation model is made, and some optimal processing parameters and conditions are found.

The author makes an attempt to find ethnic peculiarities of this vocabulary taking into account the frequency of the words usage and their syntagmatic relations in the texts of the songs. The paper provides some examples of the chosen vocabulary functioning in the English and Russian folklore. The novelty of this study stems from the source material used - the paper is the first one to present a comparative research of verbalizing the concept 'old' in English and Russian folklore texts. It is also relevant as it identifies certain specificity of the mentality of two ethnoses and figures out the ways of its reflection in the English and Russian folklore linguistic worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - The natural salt meadows of Tilopozo in the hyperarid, Atacama Desert of northern Chile, which are located at approximately 2800 m above sea level, are under pressure from industrial activity, and cultivation and grazing by local communities. In this research, the land surface covered by salt meadow vegetation was estimated from normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data from 1985 to 2016. The vegetated area of the Tilopozo salt meadows decreased by 34 ha over the 32-year period studied. Multiple regression models of the area covered by vegetation and climate data and groundwater depths were derived on an annual basis, as well as for both the dry and wet seasons and had R-2 values of 83.0%, 72.8% and 92.4% respectively between the vegetated areas modeled and those estimated from remotely sensed data. These models are potentially useful tools for studies into the conservation of the Tilopozo salt meadows, as they provide relevant information on the state of vegetation and enable changes in vegetation in response to fluctuations in climate parameters and groundwater depths to be predicted.

AB  - In the coastal areas of the province of Huaura, it has been found that 75% of its areas have increasing levels of salinity, leading to a decrease in the fertility of farmland, which harms the region since its economy is based on agricultural activities. This paper evaluates and determines the distribution of salinity, through a processing of satellite images obtained from Landsat 8 based on the main parameters of the saline soil; the electrical conductivity (CE) and with this result obtain which areas are optimal for the crop. It has been found that the correlation coefficient shows a normal and almost linear distribution with minimal discrepancy for validation, which can be considered acceptable for the estimated time. Concluding that this is an effective and low cost method for monitoring salinity of the lands of that region under study. and determining the optimal areas for cultivation.

T2  - REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect describes the phenomenon whereby cities are generally warmer than surrounding rural areas. UHI increases energy consumption, air and water pollution, and, in general, reduces the urban life quality. Consequently, UHI mitigation and adaptation is a priority in many cities around the world. Although the UHI effect can be perceived in the Aburra Valley, where the city of Medellin is located, it has been studied superficially and so far there are no prevention or mitigation measures at the regional scale. This paper presents an estimation of the UHI in the metropolitan area of the Aburra Valley. The UHI was estimated using Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS images acquired between 1986 and 2016. Results showed that the average surface temperature in the urban area was 4.81 degrees C warmer than in the rural surroundings.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring Rice Agriculture with Multisensor Temporal Mixture Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the staple food for more than half of humanity. Accurate prediction of rice harvests is therefore of considerable global importance for food security and economic stability, especially in the developing world. Landsat sensors have collected coincident thermal and optical images for the past 35+ years, and so can provide both retrospective and near-realtime constraints on the spatial extent of rice planting and the timing of rice phenology. Thermal and optical imaging capture different physical processes, and so provide different types of information for phenologic mapping. Most analyses use only one or the other data source, omitting potentially useful information. We present a novel approach to the mapping and monitoring of rice agriculture which leverages both optical and thermal measurements. The approach relies on Temporal Mixture Models (TMMs) derived from parallel Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses of Landsat image time series. Analysis of each image time series is performed in two stages: (1) spatiotemporal characterization, and (2) temporal mixture modeling. Characterization evaluates the covariance structure of the data, culminating in the selection of temporal endmembers (EMs) representing the most distinct phenological cycles of either vegetation abundance or surface temperature. Modeling uses these EMs as the basis for linear TMMs which map the spatial distribution of each EM phenological pattern across study area. The two metrics we analyze in parallel are (1) fractional vegetation abundance (F-v) derived from spectral mixture analysis (SMA) of optical reflectance, and (2) land surface temperature (LST) derived from brightness temperature (T-b). These metrics are chosen on the basis of being straightforward to compute for any (cloud-free) Landsat 4-8 image in the global archive. We demonstrate the method using a 90 x 120 km area in the Sacramento Valley of California. Satellite T-b retrievals are corrected to LST using a standardized atmospheric correction approach and pixelwise fractional emissivity estimates derived from SMA. LST and T-b time series are compared to field station data in 2016 and 2017. Uncorrected T-b is observed to agree with the upper bound of the envelope of air temperature observations to within 3 degrees C on average. As expected, LST estimates are 3 to 5 degrees C higher. Soil T, air T, T-b and LST estimates can all be represented as linear transformations of the same seasonal cycle. The 3D temporal feature spaces of F-v and LST clearly resolve 5 and 7 temporal EM phenologies, respectively, with strong clustering distinguishing rice from other vegetation. Results from parallel EOF analyses of coincident F-v and LST image time series over the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons suggest that TMMs based on single year F-v datasets can provide accurate maps of crop timing, while TMMs based on dual year LST datasets can provide comparable maps of year-to-year crop conversion. We also test a partial-year model midway through the 2018 growing season to illustrate a potential real-time monitoring application. Field validation confirms the monitoring model provides an upper bound estimate of spatial extent and relative timing of the rice crop accurate to 89%, even with an unusually sparse set of usable Landsat images.

T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to propose a new methodology for mapping coffee cropping areas that includes multitemporal data as input parameters in the classification process, by using the Landsat TM NDVI time series, together with an object-oriented classification approach. The algorithm BFAST was used to analyze coffee, pasture, and native vegetation temporal profiles, allied to a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) for mapping. The following multitemporal variables derived from the R package greenbrown were used for classification: mean, trend, and seasonality. The results showed that coffee, pasture, and native vegetation have different temporal behaviors, which corroborates the use of these data as input variables for mapping. The classifications using temporal variables, associated with spectral data, achieved high-global accuracy rates with 93% hit. When using only temporal data, ratings also showed a hit percentage above 80% accuracy. Data derived from Landsat TM time series are efficient for mapping coffee cropping areas, reducing confusion between argets and making the classification process more accurate, contributing to a correct characterization and mapping of objects derived from a RapidEye image, with a high spatial solution.

AB  - BACKGROUND In Brazil the implementation of the Sentinel Surveillance System of Influenza began in 2000. Central public health laboratories use reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for diagnosis of respiratory viruses, but this protocol identifies only specific targets, resulted in inconclusive diagnosis for many samples. Thus, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) would be complementary method in the identification of pathogens in inconclusive samples for RT-qPCR or other specific detection protocols.OBJECTIVES This study aimed to detect unidentified viruses using HTS approach in negative samples of nasopharynx/tracheal secretions by the standard RT-qPCR collected in the Federal District, Brazil.METHODS Nucleic acids were extracted from samples collected in winter period of 2016 and subjected to HTS. The results were confirmed by the multiplex PR21 RT-qPCR, which identifies 21 respiratory pathogens.FINDINGS The main viruses identified by HTS were of families Herpesviridae,Coronaviridae,Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae, with the emphasis on rhinoviruses. The presence of respiratory viruses in the samples was confirmed by the PR21 multiplex RT-qPCR. Coronavirus, enterovirus, bocavirus and rhinovirus were found by multiplex RT-qPCR as well as by HTS analyses.MAIN CONCLUSIONS Wide virus diversity was found by different methodologies and high frequency of rhinovirus occurrence was confirmed in population in winter, showing its relevance for public health.

TI  - Mapping and quantification of ferruginous outcrop savannas in the Brazilian Amazon: A challenge for biodiversity conservation
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - The eastern Brazilian Amazon contains many isolated ferruginous savanna ecosystem patches (locally known as canga vegetation) located on ironstone rocky outcrops on the top of plateaus and ridges, surrounded by tropical rainforests. In the Carajas Mineral Province (CMP), these outcrops contain large iron ore reserves that have been exploited by opencast mining since the 1980s. The canga vegetation is particularly impacted by mining, since the iron ores that occur are associated with this type of vegetation and currently, little is known regarding the extent of canga vegetation patches before mining activities began. This information is important for quantifying the impact of mining, in addition to helping plan conservation programmes. Here, land cover changes of the Canga area in the CMP are evaluated by estimating the pre-mining area of canga patches and comparing it to the actual extent of canga patches. We mapped canga vegetation using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) from 1973 Landsat-1 MSS, 1984 and 2001 Landsat-5 TM, and 2016 Landsat-8 OLI images, and found that canga vegetation originally occupied an area of 144.2 km2 before mining exploitation. By 2016, 19.6% of the canga area was lost in the CMP due to conversion to other land-use types (mining areas, pasturelands). In the Carajas National Forest (CNF), located within the CMP, the original canga vegetation covered 105.2 km2 (2.55% of the CNF total area), and in 2016, canga vegetation occupied an area of 77.2 km2 (1.87%). Therefore, after more than three decades of mineral exploitation, less than 20% of the total canga area was lost. Currently, 21% of the canga area in the CMP is protected by the Campos Ferruginosos National Park. By documenting the initial extent of canga vegetation in the eastern Amazon and the extent to which it has been lost due to mining operations, the results of this work are the first step towards conserving this ecosystem.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are one of the main factors for disturbances in Niassa Reserve-Mozambique, with economic and environmental impacts. There are cyclical records of fire occurrences across the reserve. However, studies on the main causative factors and identification of more susceptible locations are very limited. In this perspective, this study had as objectives: (1) determine the main significant factors for wildfire occurrences; (2) Map the probability of wildfire occurrences, using logistic regression. Independent variables included vegetation index (NDVI), climatic, topographic and socioeconomic data. The analysis period was from 2001 to 2015 and comprised the months with more occurrences of wildfire (May to December). According to the results, the main factors that determine the occurrence of fires were: NDVI, temperature, elevation, followed by precipitation, slope, relative humidity and human settlements. The spatial distribution of probability of fire occurrence reveals that zones with high and very high risk are located at the west and central west zones (areas with higher accumulation of dry biomass); medium risk zones are located in the centre of the reserve, while in central east and east zones the probability of fire occurrence is low and very low risk. Results showed that the expectation of wildfire ignition using logistic regression presented good precision (area under the curve 74%).

AB  - In the last few years, the availability of new earth observation satellites, such as Sentinel 2, has increased the interest in their potential for precision agriculture. In a non-continuous crop, like grapevines, the influence of interrow space, and vine geometry can disturb the assessment of vegetation properties using satellites. In particular, vine height and row orientation can project shadows differently, according to the relative solar and sensor position. In this study, sun shading and sensor off-nadir effects were estimated for images acquired by three constellations of satellite (Sentinel 2, RapidEye and Pleiades) on 48 vineyards. Shading and off-nadir effects were calculated using satellite image metadata and vineyard row orientation. Then, multiple linear regression models, based on satellite information and shadows, were estimated using pure vine data extracted from images acquired by a multispectral camera carried by unmanned aerial vehicle as dependent variable. Multiple regression models were compared to simple regression models using different model's performance parameters (rho Spearman, R-2 adjusted, root mean square error and Akaike's Information Criteria). The results showed significant effects of sun and off-nadir sensors' effects on pure vine variability estimation using satellite images, with a stronger effect of sensor orientation than solar shading. In multiple regression models, R-2 increased of 5.8, 6.6, and 13.4 % in Pleiades, RapidEye, and Sentinel 2, respectively, compared to simple linear regression models based just on the satellite sensor band data. Moreover, these multiple linear regression models have a better fitting and lower estimation errors than simple linear regressions.

AB  - Climate components are closely related to one of the most dynamic elements of the Earth's surface, such as wet snow. It is an element which influences most of the flood-related models. The subject of the research is a specific event registered on 10/07/2018 in Urupema, the wet snow, which remained for only a few days. Urupema is a Brazilian city with an average annual temperature of 13C, located in the southern part of Santa Catarina and heavy winters regularly bring frost, snow and frozen water in the area. The aim of the study is to demonstrate different approaches for short-lived snow coverage monitoring based on SAR and optical satellite data. The subject of the study is to demonstrate the dynamics for a short period of time. The results obtained are data in the form of thematic maps showing the spatial reflectance of wet snow and its dynamics over time. A methodology based on SAR and optical satellite data for wet snow exploration has been developed. The methodology was applied to the city of Urupema. Brazil includes a wide range of meteorological conditions on a large area and diversified relief, which is why there is no optical data with good quality. This requires the use of SAR data that has the advantage over the visible and NIR ranges. Various spectral indices and indicators, calculated on a Sentinel database in Copernicus have been used. Results have been obtained for the dynamics of the particular region over a given time period.

AB  - The main aim of the presented research is to demonstrate an integrated methodology for flood monitoring with SAR and optical satellite data in order to track the dynamics of flooded areas in two different locations in Greece and Turkey. The subjects of the research are the flooded areas near Athens on 12 and 13 November, 2017 and along the valley of the Maritsa River between Greece and Turkey on 17/07/2017. The objects were analyzed and mapped according to ESA (European Space Agency) data from Sentinel. Results have been obtained for quantitative changes of flooded areas and their dynamics. The importance of this type of remote sensing is considerable as the access to the Earth is difficult, and the presence of clouds severely limits research by optical sensors. The use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is much more effective, and it is more accurate to plot the flooding degree during flooding and after this event. The data used are with high time-spatial resolution, which is imperative when studying a short-term event such as the flood. River-type floods in combination with torrential rains falling over vast river basin territories such as these two floods on absolutely different seasons are one of the most common natural disasters which cause many economic losses and take many victims. The flood near Athens has taken a few lives and caused great economic damage during the late autumn, which has led to even more complicated situation. The floods along the Maritsa River valley are often repeated.

AB  - Mosquitoes are the most important vectors of some human diseases in tropical countries. In particular, Aedes aegypti is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Brazil (Scavuzzo, 2018). The infection causes flu-like symptoms, and sometimes evolves into a life-threatening condition called severe dengue or hemorrhagic dengue. It is a widespread infection that occurs in all regions of the planet's tropical climate, and now because of the climate change, it may expand to some other regions. In recent years, transmission has increased predominantly in urban areas and has become a major public health problem.Recently, there has been an increasing trend on GeoHealth studies by use of remotely sensed data for mapping health risk and monitoring vector-borne diseases. Thus, the aim of this work is to generate risk maps integrating those environmental and climate indicators with adaptive capacity factors to define regions with high risk of vector-borne diseases in Brazil. Consequently, we present a multi-indicator study, similar to the one already developed in Vietnam by Nguyen and Liou (Nguyen and Liou, 2018) for the Aedes Albopictus, but the present study is in Brazil for the Aedes aegypti and adding the information of the Soil Moisture (SM) from the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). Then, the study combines climatological data (e.g. soil moisture, temperature and precipitation), and demographic and socioeconomic data over the Brazilian territory for the 2013-2018 period. Dengue episodes distribution data for this period have been obtained from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), developed by Ministry of Health.

AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used to map annual large-scale mechanized agriculture across Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Goias, Maranhao, western Bahia, and southern Piaui. All MODIS (MOD13Q1) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), day of year (DOY), and VI Quality 16‐day, 250 m resolution data composited between August 2002 and July 2017 were used. A growing season is defined as beginning in August and ending in July: the data used to analyze the 2003 growing season span August 1, 2002-July 31, 2003. A published decision‐tree algorithm (Spera et al., 2014, Environmental Research Letters) was modified to incorporate crop cycles and calendars for the states of Tocantins, Goias, Maranhao, western Bahia, and southern Piaui. The modified Spera et al. algorithm adds single‐cropped corn as a crop class, as it is common in Matopiba. Crop rotations identified include: (i) single cropping (a single rotation of soy, corn, or cotton within one growing season); (ii) double cropping (a soy‐corn or soy‐cotton rotation within one growing season); and (iii) irrigated agriculture. This algorithm uses metrics that include growing season EVI standard deviation, minima and maxima; it derives green‐up and harvest dates to differentiate natural vegetation from croplands. Due to the 250 m spatial resolution of the data, we mapped only agricultural fields greater than 25 ha. Thus, these cropland estimates are likely relatively conservative. The results of our algorithm were validated using 883 validation points collected across the Cerrado over the study period using the Landsat data repository within Google Earth Engine. Compositing false‐color Landsat 5 and 7 images (NIR Band 4 as red, SWIR1 Band 5 as green, red Band 3 as blue) from the growing season permitted visual identification and separation of corn, soy, cotton, pasture, and natural vegetation land covers. Across the study region, annual agriculture was distinguished from natural vegetation and pasture with 95% accuracy, and crop types were separated with 87% accuracy. Because pasture and sugarcane are difficult to separate using the phenological signal from a single growing season, we integrated previously published (spatially explicit) sugarcane data (Canasat: Rudorff et al., 2010) into our land‐cover maps. A data key is published with the files.

M3  - Article
AB  - Oskar von Redwitz's successful book "Amaranth" (1849) is shown to be a central interface between the culture of the liberal German fraternity (Burschenschaft) movement and the 19th century tradition of epic poetry. On the basis of several parodies of "Amaranth", a type of student epic occurring from Heyse to Scheffel comes into view, recognizable by a student protagonist (or a corresponding historical forerunner) and customs or technical terms of the fraternities, but also by an academically trained worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The primary goal of the study was to evaluate how the use of rehabilitation technology impacted closure status for consumers receiving services in fiscal year (FY) 2014.Materials and Methods: Rehabilitation Service Administration (RSA-911) Case Service Report FY 2014 archival dataset was obtained from the U.S. Department of Education (2014) and secondary analyses was performed for this study. RSA-911 archival data is updated on an annual basis and consists of all state-federal rehabilitation consumers who were served in the specific fiscal year. The dataset contains information related to each consumer's demographic information (e.g. age, gender, race) and other supplemental information (e.g. weekly earnings at closure, cause of disability, services provided).Results and Conclusions: A multiple logistic regression analysis was utilized and revealed that white consumers receiving rehabilitation technology (RT) services have significantly higher closure rate than consumers of other races, RT services differ by the employment status at application, RT services differ by the type of disability, educational level at application for people receiving RT services did predict closure status (i.e. exiting with an employment outcome), IEP status did not predict closure status, weekly earnings at application did predict closure status and the interaction effect between IEP and RT services is statistically significant. The odds ratio (ORs) were presented at the 95% confidence interval (CI). Vocational rehabilitation counselors needs training to correctly identify appropriate RT services for consumers, so that the likelihood of exiting with an employment outcome is obtained.

TI  - Evaluation of Mass Drug Administration through Transmission Assessment Survey in Udupi District of Karnataka, India
T2  - Journal of Communicable Diseases
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA) of single dose of antifilarial drugs to all the eligible population was initiated in 2004 in Udupi district, a known endemic district for bancroftian filariasis. Nine rounds were implemented in this Implementation Unit (IU) with drug coverage ranging from 83% to 90% in different MDA rounds and with drug compliance rate of more than 65% in each of the MDA round. The baseline mf prevalence of 1.3% in 2004 was brought down to 0.09% in the year 2013. The impact assessment performed after 9 MDA rounds revealed <1% mf prevalence in each of the sentinel and spot check sites. The mf prevalence was further measured in 10 additional sites, which recorded <1% mf prevalence in all the sites. Having qualified for Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS), school-based survey was conducted in March 2014 in EUvaluation unit (EU) targeting 6 to 7-year children. The number of clusters, sample size, sampling fraction, critical cut off value, clusters and additional clusters to be sampled were estimated using Survey Sample Builder tool. A total of 1579 children from 53 clusters were screened against the target of 1553 and 5 were found positive for filaria antigen (0.3%) against the critical cut off value of 18 and hence the decision of stoppage of further rounds of MDA was taken. The "Post MDA Surveillance" was implemented in the EU, wherein the mf prevalence among 5-9-year age group in sentinel and spot check sites was measured annually for two years. The mf prevalence of such surveys was less than 1%. The second TAS conducted in 2016 after a gap of 2.4 years has shown presence of 0.6% filarial antigenemia thus passing the second TAS also.

AB  - The monitoring of urban cover is very important for the planner, management, governmental and non-governmental organizations for optimizing the use of urban resources and minimizing the environmental losses. The study here aims at analyzing the changes that occurred in urban green cover over a time span of 1991-2001 using multi-date Landsat satellite images data over the Varanasi district, India and its relation to demographical changes. The Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier has been used for image classification. The urbanization indicators such as Land Consumption Ratio (LCR) and Land Absorption Coefficient (LAC) were also used in order to understand the changes in urban cover and population dynamics. All the analysis indicates significant changes in the urban cover values with increasing population at both spatial and temporal scale.

AB  - Global warming is an increase in average global temperature of the earth which lead to climate change. Heterogeneity in the earth-atmosphere system becomes difficult to capture at low resolution (1 degrees x1 degrees) by satellite. Such features may be captured by using high resolution model such as regional climate model (0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees). This type of study is quite important for a monsoon dominated country like India where Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) faces highest heterogeneity due to its geographic location. Present study compares high resolution model features with satellite data over IGP for monsoon season during a normal rainfall year 2010 to understand the actual performance of model. Almost whole IGP simulates relative humidity (RH) with wide range (similar to 50-100%), whereas satellite shows it with narrow range (similar to 60-80%) during September, 2010. Thus model is able to pick the features which were missed by satellite. Hence further model simulation extends over India and adjoining oceanic regions which simulates data of southwest monsoon with high (similar to 70-100%) RH, high (similar to 0.4-0.7) cloud fraction (CF) and low (similar to 80-200 W/m(2)) outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) over Arabian Sea during June, 2010. Such type of study can be useful to understand heterogeneity at regional scale with the help of high resolution model generated data.

TI  - Mapping and monitoring for a lymphatic filariasis elimination program: a systematic review
T2  - RESEARCH AND REPORTS IN TROPICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is targeted for elimination by the year 2020. The Global Programme for Elimination of LF (GPELF) aims to achieve elimination by interrupting transmission through annual mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole with ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine. The program has successfully eliminated the disease in 11 of the 72 endemic countries, putting in enormous efforts on systematic planning and implementation of the strategy. Mapping areas endemic for LF is a pre-requisite for implementing MDA, monitoring and evaluation are the components of programme implementation. This review was undertaken to assess how the mapping and impact monitoring activities have evolved to become more robust over the years and steered the LF elimination programme towards its goal. The findings showed that the WHO recommended mapping strategy aided 17 countries to delimit, plan and implement MDA in only those areas endemic for LF thereby saving resources. Availability of serological tools for detecting infection in humans (antigen/antibody assays) and molecular xenomonitoring (MX) in vectors greatly facilitated programme monitoring and evaluation in endemic countries. Results of this review are discussed on how these existing mapping and monitoring procedures can be used for re-mapping of unsurveyed and uncertain areas to ensure there is no resurgence during post-MDA surveillance. Further the appropriateness of the tests (Microfilaria (Mf)/antigenemia (Ag)/antibody(Ab) surveys in humans or MX of vectors for infection) used currently for post-MDA surveillance and their role in the development of a monitoring and evaluation strategy for the recently WHO recommended triple drug regimen in MDA for accelerated LF elimination are discussed.

TI  - Lack of survival benefit in sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma with immediate complete lymphadenectomy - a review
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Review
AB  - For decades, melanoma surgery has been guided by the Halstedian concept of stepwise metastasis, first into the lymph nodes and subsequently to distant sites. Early complete lymph node dissection (CLND) was therefore recommended in order to improve survival. Four large prospective randomized trials failed to show any survival benefit of CLND in comparison to observation alone. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was introduced in the 1990's, and CLND was limited to patients with positive sentinel nodes. Based on lymphoscintigraphy, it was pointed out that draining lymph nodes can now be detected more accurately. In one large trial, sentinel lymph node-guided CLND was compared to observation alone, and no advantage for melanoma-specific survival was detected. More recently, two prospective randomized studies tested whether CLND improved melanoma-specific survival or overall survival in patients with positive sentinel nodes. Neither study found a better survival rate for patients with CLND than with observation alone. The reason for the failure of CLND to improve survival is clearly parallel development and not stepwise development of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Immediate CLND in melanoma surgery is therefore called into question.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION OF WET AREAS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDS USING REMOTE SENSING DATA

CP  - 25th Annual International Scientific Conference on Research for Rural Development
CL  - Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technologies, Jelgava, LATVIA
AB  - Wet areas in agricultural lands are usually not fully or properly managed due to problematic accessibility by heavy machinery and are associated with lower crop yields. There are neither studies regarding spatial distribution of wet agricultural areas in Latvia nor large scale soil maps. Being aware of these wet areas, it would be possible to plan actions for effective management of these areas, starting with a scale of landscape. A geographic information system model could serve as an assistant for decision-making, such as, a direct support for the management of amelioration systems, change of land use and management patterns or granting support payments.Remote sensing data like Sentinel-2 satellite images and LiDAR (Light detecting and ranging) technology can be used to identify local wet areas. The focus of this article is to evaluate different remote sensing indices and methods that can be used to identify wet areas in agricultural lands using open access data and software. From 52 indices, which were analysed with soil moisture field measurements in 33 sample plots, only two of them showed statistical significance in linear regression model (p<0.05): normalized height model in resolution of 25 meters (r(2)=0.45) and visible blue spectral band in April (r(2)=0.39). Results from this study help to focus on different aspects of remote sensing data usage and methodology for future improvements in order to fully implement LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data for identification of wet areas in agricultural lands.

AB  - The Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica is home to highly diverse forests which are under threat of degradation due to ongoing climatic changes. There is concern that increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation will force these forests outside of their optimal growth ranges leading to degradation, measured using forest productivity. The objectives of this study are, therefore, to project and assess climatic changes in Guanacaste and the to build a relationship between these climatic changes and forest productivity with the goal of projecting productivity trends into the future. The ClimateSA model was used to project the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios from 2018 until 2080 and then assess these projections for the mean and extreme future conditions. Furthermore, the MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) algorithm was used to build a relationship between forest productivity and the Vapour Pressure Deficit scalar (VPD scalar) and project GPP alteration under future climatic scenarios both seasonally and annually. Results indicate that Guanacastes mean annual precipitation will stay within the historic levels for both the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The monthly and annual temperatures increase in all projections. Results also indicate that the productivity-climate relationship follows a quadratic relationship between GPP and the VPD scalar. This quadratic relationship leads to areas with higher precipitation (high VPD scalar) experiencing an increase in GPP as they dry in the future. In drier areas (low VPD scalar), reduced precipitation will stabilize or decrease GPP.

AB  - The forthcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) will have Compact Polarimetry (CP) modes. A key advantage of CP is that these modes provide more polarimetric information than dual-polarized RADARSAT-2 with no reduction in swath width. To investigate the performance of CP for oil slick characterization, the RCM SC50 and the LNSC modes were simulated from a 10 m resolution RADARSAT-2 Fine quad polarized image. The SC50 and the LNSC had the same 350 km swath width, but differed in resolution, 50 m for SC50 versus 100 m for LNSC, and noise floor, -22 dB for SC50 versus -25 dB for LNSC. There was good visual discrimination between the slick and the ocean for both SC50 and LNSC which was attributed to the similar to 6 dB difference between oil and ocean for RH backscatter. As the resolution went from 10 m to 50 m and then 100 m, the ocean-oil boundary became progressively less well-defined. Therefore, the use of the 50 m SC50 mode versus the 100 m resolution LNSC mode may be a better choice for slick detection, unless there is a need to extract polarimetric information from the -25 dB NESZ LNSC versus the - 22 dB NESZ SC50. The Degree of Polarization (DoP) for both SC50 and LNSC was similar to the DoP calculated from the RADARSAT-2 quad polarized image, thus suggesting that oil slick characterization, specifically the discrimination of sheen and emulsion might be possible with CP imagery.

AB  - Sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity, as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Its growth cycle has a duration of about 12-14 months, and the same plantation can be generally harvested up to 7 times before replanting is needed. In order to both predict the yield and optimize the production processes, sugarcane industries need to be regularly updated on the harvest progress; however, they mainly rely on direct communications from farmers, and this has evident limitations.In this paper we present a method that exploits stacks of Sentinel-1 images for the automatic detection of sugarcane harvest dates. The method has been used to monitor, over a period of 21 months, a large cultivated area in Northern Senegal that comprises 719 sugarcane parcels.The results have shown that the method performs well in terms of both detection and estimation accuracy, and has the potential to be operationally used in the sugarcane production processes.

AB  - Burned area mapping is essential for quantifying the environmental impact of wildfires, for compiling statistics, and for designing effective short-to mid-term impact mitigation measures. The Sentinel-2 satellites are providing an unparalleled wealth of high-resolution remotely sensed information with a short revisit cycle, which is ideal for mapping burned areas both accurately and timely. However, the high detail and volume of the information provided actually encumbers the automation of the mapping process, at least for the level of automation required to map systematically wildfires on a national level. This paper presents a preliminary methodology for mapping burned areas using Sentinel-2 data, which aims to eliminate user interaction and achieve mapping accuracy that is acceptable for operational use. It follows an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach, whereby the initial image is segmented into a set of adjacent and non-overlapping small regions (objects). The most unambiguous of them are labeled automatically through a set of empirical rules that combine information extracted from both a pre-fire Sentinel-2 image and a post-fire one. The burned area is finally delineated following a supervised learning approach, whereby a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained using the labeled objects and subsequently applied to the whole image considering a set of optimally selected object-level features. Preliminary results on a set of recent large wildfires in Greece indicate that the proposed methodology constitutes a solid basis for fully automating the burned area mapping process.

TI  - Broken Bodies, Broken Spirits: How Poor Health Contributes to a Cynical Worldview
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cynical hostility (or cynicism) is often considered as a major factor leading to bad health outcomes. The present research proposes that poor health might represent both a consequence and a source of cynicism. Using cross-lagged path analyses, we documented bidirectional associations between health and cynicism in a nationally representative sample of Germans (Study 1) and a large sample of the American elderly (Study 2): cynical individuals were more likely to develop health problems, and poor health promoted the development of a cynical worldview over time. These results were obtained using different indicators of health status, including both self-reported and interviewer-administered physical measures. Longitudinal mediation analyses showed perceived constraints to mediate the effect of poor health on cynicism. This effect remained robust even when adding an alternative mediator-depressive symptoms. Additional analyses showed that any particular health limitation was prospectively related to cynicism to the degree to which this limitation was associated with an increased sense of constraints in individuals' life.

TI  - Ethnosemiometric Parameterization of Diachronic Core of the Concept TRUTH and its Profiles In the British Axioconceptosphere
T2  - 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE INNOVATION IN LANGUAGE LEARNING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Conference Innovation in Language Learning
CL  - Florence, ITALY
AB  - The article deals with the diachronic core of the value concept TRUTH, which is a mental construct, a model with a complex network of conceptual and motivational features demonstrating a variety of primary semantic features of the designated concepts firstly for a person of pagan consciousness and later for a Christian one. These signs are detected by ethnosemiometric parameterization of the internal form of the name of the concept which holds their primary origins. This objectifies the concept in the value dimension and reflects the collective archetype representation of the British about the concept. Also, the reconstruction of cognitive mechanisms of transfer of its diachronic conceptual features from one sphere to another (established order - faith) is carried out. Therefore, the value is always the center of the concept, since the concept is a "bundle of culture", which is based on a value and significance principle. There are grounds to assert that the axioconceptosphere of each ethnic group is ontological and epistemological synergetic-evolutionary entity, in which their archetypal signs are transformed as historically and evolutionarily, as culturally, socially, spiritually, individually. Depending on the type of values that the concept TRUTH objectifies, some of its features become central, while others are marginalized. To verify this assumption, we propose the 2-stage algorithm of ethnosemiometric parameterization of the value concept TRUTH: the first stage - the analysis of Indo-European and Proto Germanic forms and meanings of its name - the lexeme truth with their semantic transitions, and the second stage - analysis of etymological and semantic profiles of the lexeme truth with the words trust, belief, faith, which have the meaning of faith in the English language. We have made a preliminary conclusion that in the long search of an answer to "What is the truth?" the researchers assert that mentalizing of this concept in consciousness is determined by the peculiarity of national worldview and axioconceptosphere where primary senses of the value concept TRUTH were formed in ontogenesis as its diachronic core. The conceptual and content features are best realized within the framework of separate models of the world: scientific, naive, religious.

M3  - Article
AB  - A new version of the one-dimensional thermo-hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model LAKE2.1 is presented. The model is supplemented with a description of the dynamics and vertical distribution of salinity in an ice cover. Simulation results are compared to in situ and satellite data of water temperature and ice cover at Uvs Nuur Lake (Mongolia) from 2000 to 2015. It is shown that underestimating the mixed-layer depth by the model with standard turbulence closure k-epsilon during summer and autumn leads to a significant shift in the timing of the onset of ice. It is also demonstrated that, while neglecting the salinity of the lake, the freeze-up according to the model happens 16-17 days earlier than in reality. This error is removed if the effect of salinity on water density and freezing temperature is included. However, in this case, the model underestimates the maximal seasonal ice thickness on average by approximate to 0.2 m. In turn, this error decreases an order of magnitude if the dynamics and vertical distribution of salinity in ice are simulated in the model.

TI  - FAST SUBAURORAL DRIFTS OF IONOSPHERIC PLASMA ACCORDING TO DATA FROM YAKUT MERIDIONAL CHAIN OF STATIONS
T2  - SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using long-term data from Yakut meridional chain of Yakutsk - Zhigansk - Batagay - Tixie ionospheric stations, we study ionospheric signatures of fast subauroral ion drift. Sharp drops or "falls" of critical frequencies (FCF) of the ionospheric F layer are shown to be one of the main signatures of the development of fast subauroral ion drifts near or at the zenith of the observation station. Comparison between long-term ground-based and satellite measurements indicates that there is good agreement between seasonal variation in the probability of occurrence of FCF derived from ground-based data and subauroral ion drifts derived from DMSP satellite data. Such a coincidence implies that both satellite and ground-based measurement methods register the same phenomenon in the boundary layers of the plasmasphere, namely, the appearance and development of electric fields of magnetospheric origin. The local time for recording of FCF derived from ground-based data is shown to closely coincide with the time of occurrence of subauroral polarization streams of plasma according to satellite data. We can therefore conclude that most of the observed FCF events derived from ground-based data refer to intense storms.

TI  - Localization yield and seizure outcome in patients undergoing bilateral SEEG exploration
T2  - EPILEPSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We aimed to determine the rates and predictors of resection and seizure freedom after bilateral stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) implantation. Methods We reviewed 184 patients who underwent bilateral SEEG implantation (2009-2015). Noninvasive and invasive evaluation findings were collected. Outcomes of interest included subsequent resection and seizure freedom. Statistical analyses employed multivariable logistic regression and proportional hazard modeling. Preoperative and postoperative seizure frequency, severity, and quality of life scales were also compared. Results Following bilateral SEEG implantation, 106 of 184 patients (58%) underwent resection. Single seizure type (P = 0.007), a family history of epilepsy (P = 0.003), 10 or more seizures per month (P = 0.004), lower number of electrodes (P = 0.02), or sentinel electrode placement (P = 0.04) was predictive of undergoing a resection, as were lack of nonlocalized (P < 0.0001) or bilateral (P < 0.0001) ictal-onset zones on SEEG. Twenty-six of 81 patients (32% with follow-up greater than 1 year) remained seizure-free. Predictors of seizure freedom were single seizure type (P = 0.01), short epilepsy duration (P = 0.008), use of 2 or fewer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at the time of surgery (P = 0.0006), primary localization hypothesis involving the frontal lobe (P = 0.002), sentinel electrode placement only (P = 0.02), and lack of overlap between ictal-onset zone and eloquent cortex (P = 0.04), along with epilepsy substrate histopathology (P = 0.007). Complete resection of a suspected focal cortical dysplasia showed a trend to increased likelihood of seizure freedom (P = 0.09). The 44 of 55 patients (80%) who underwent resection and experienced seizure recurrence had >50% seizure reduction, as opposed to 26 of 45 patients (58%) who continued medical therapy alone (P = 0.003). Seventy-two percent of patients had a clinically meaningful quality of life improvement (>10% decrease in the Quality of Life in Epilepsy [QOLIE-10] score) at 1 year. Significance A strong preimplantation hypothesis of a suspected unifocal epilepsy increases the odds of resection and seizure freedom. We discuss a tailored approach, taking into account localization hypothesis and suspected epilepsy etiology in guiding implantation and subsequent surgical strategy.

TI  - Black Humor on the Film Screen: From Folk to Popular Culture
T2  - ETNOANTROPOLOSKI PROBLEMI-ISSUES IN ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is dealing with the complex phenomenon of black humor. Starting from different definitions about its origin, the author questions its folklore origin in Greek antiquity. Through the prism of the theories of Olga Freidneberg and Michael Bakhtin, parody and/or carneval appear as a worldview contrary and at the same time parallel to the serious, official, hierarchical order. Exactly this image of the world, and conceptualization of death on its grounds, lead in ancient Greece to the appearance of the theatre and comedy, that is regarded to be the predecessor of black film comedies. Pointing out the intertwinement of laughter and death, as well as the existence of black humor in the Greek antiquity, the author also deals with interesting connection between film black comedies and Serbian performative ritual games with motives of death and the dead. Such motives and the atmosphere that they provoke are easily recognized in the Serbian black comedies. As an example, i.e. a case study is taken the film Marathon Family. Apart from that, the paper offers an insight into the theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of black humor in literature and film, which opens the space to trace two more intertwined paths of influence on the mentioned black comedies. One path is literary and goes back to comedies by Branislav Nusic - The bereaved family and The deceased, while the other leads to the whole genre of films with the dark humour that has developed since the 1960s in Europe and the USA. In spite of the undoubtable influences, the short insight into the subgenres of dark humour in the mentioned films reveals the specificity of the black humor in the Serbian cinematography that might be related to folk humoristic games with the motive of death.

AB  - The behavioral features of the actions of Soviet citizens in the context of the exercise of the right to use in the second half of the 20th century and the stereotypes that they have developed in connection with this are examined. The results of a comparative analysis of the dynamics of recorded cases of theft, both material and financial, are presented. The study is based on archival data. The question is raised about the features of the socio-economic development of Soviet society. It is noted that the topic of ownership was one of the key in the life of Soviet society. Particular attention is paid to the reaction of people to situations related to the growing pace of property acquisition. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the author demonstrated the modernization of mental and worldview characteristics, features of consciousness both among the corporate leadership and among urban and rural workers, which later became the basis for the formation of a new society structure. The conclusion is drawn on the formation of new consumer ideals associated with the manifestation of individualism in the realization of property rights, the commercialization of life manifestations, the formation of entrepreneurial initiatives. The author dwells on the problem associated with transformation processes in the spiritual sphere of life in Soviet society, where collectivist ideals collapsed and private property morality was affirmed.

In this context, special attention is paid to the period of the 1960s, associated with the radical social transformation of rural life, which led to the formation in Russian society of new features of worldview and worldview. The study of the manifestations of the level of self-identification of the prose writer and identification of his personality with the rural society allows the author to form a point of view on the changes taking place in literature, official state ideology and book publishing, as well as the processes of regulating the propaganda work of writers, the emergence of the opportunity to << draw >> rural life is contradictory, in a manner inconsistent with the generally accepted views.

AB  - The aim of the study is to give assessment of and monitor the vegetation's condition of the forest areas in which territories the predominantly forest species of the plantations is Eastern Mysian beech (Fagus orientalis), by combinative approach of Remote Sensing's methods and generation of different vegetation indices (NDVI, NDGI). SAR and optical data of the Sentinel when the phenophase of the forest vegetation is the most active, from April to July, respectively, for the years of the selected period were chosen. Tasseled Cap Orthogonal Transformation is applied to the selected images, resulting in three components - TCT component of the "brightness", TCT component of the "wetness" and the TCT component of the "greenness". In the present research, the TCT component of the "greenness" was used, which is giving more accurate and precise data on the current state of the forest vegetation. A comparative analysis of the processed data obtained from the applied different methods and vegetation indices has been made, in order to select the higher quality and more precise results with purpose the analysis and assessment of the state of forest vegetation on the territory of the Natural Park.

TI  - Recent Large Scale Environmental Changes in the Mediterranean Sea and Their Potential Impacts on <i>Posidonia Oceanica</i>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate related changes can have significant effects on Posidonia oceanica, an endemic seagrass species of the Mediterranean Sea (MEDIT). This seagrass is very important for many aspects of functioning of the sea but there is an increasing number of reports about the ongoing loss of its biomass and area coverage. We analysed multiyear data of the sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomalies, ocean colour MODIS-A and ERA-Interim reanalysis. The results provide a description of current environmental conditions in the MEDIT and their spatial and temporal variability, including long-term trends. We defined regions where the extent of the P. oceanica meadows may be limited by specific environmental conditions. Light limitation is more severe near the northern and western coasts of the MEDIT, where the vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient is large. In the zone extending from the Gulf of Lion towards the south, significant wave heights reach large values. Wave action may destroy the plants and as a result the shallow water depth limit of P. oceanica meadows is most likely deeper here than in other regions. The highest SST values are documented in the south-eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. In this area P. oceanica meadows are more endangered by the climate warming than in other regions where SSTs are lower. The absence of P. oceanica meadows in the south-eastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea can be attributed to high temperatures. Our conclusions are partly confirmed by the information about P. oceanica from the literature but more monitoring efforts are needed to fully describe current extent of the meadows and their shifts. Results presented in this paper can help with designing special programs to confirm the role of environmental conditions on the spatial distribution of P. oceanica and their future trends in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - There is a steady tendency to significantly increase the volume of extraction and processing of mineral raw materials on our planet in recent decades. It leads to an increase in the volume of industrial waste, which predominant method of disposal is placement on the Earth surface in the form of anthropogenic arrays. There are accumulated billions tons of waste in such anthropogenic arrays, but its height can reach 100 meters. It determines the deterioration of the sanitary and hygienic situation in these territories, an increase in the morbidity and mortality of the population, a decrease in the species diversity of animals and plants, violation and modification of natural landscapes, and loss of natural resources. In addition, such anthropogenic arrays are especially subjecting to the risk of emergencies, which can entail significant social, environmental and economic damage. In this regard, the development and implementation of environmental monitoring systems on the territory of the impact of industrial waste storages, which can quickly identify sources of anthropogenic load and carry out their timely elimination, is of particular relevance to society, the economy and the state. Monitoring of the state of components of the environment based on remote sensing data is one of the most innovative and developing areas of environmental monitoring today.

AB  - Molecular analysis has revolutionized many applications, including bio-safety, bio-engineering and biofuel research; however, there are limited practical tools for in situ detection during field work. New technology is needed to translate molecular advances from laboratory settings into the practical realm. The unique characteristics of plasmonic nanosensors have made them ideal candidates for field-ready sensing applications. Herein, we discuss the development of a fiber-based plasmonic sensor capable of direct detection (i.e., no washing steps required) of miRNA targets, which are detected by immerging the sensor in the sample solution. This sensor is composed of an optical fiber that is decorated with plasmonic nanoprobes based on silver-coated gold nanostars to detect target nucleic acids using the surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensing mechanism of nanoprobes referred to as inverse molecular sentinels. The fiber sensors were tested in extracts from leaves of plants that were induced to have different miRNA expression levels. The results indicate that the fiber sensors developed have the potential to be a powerful tool for field analysis.

TI  - In-season early mapping of rice area and flooding dynamics from optical and SAR satellite data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice mapping products were derived from Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI multi-temporal imagery over Northern Italy at the early stages of the 2015 growing season. A rule-based algorithm was applied to synthetic statistical metrics (TSDs-Temporal Spectra Descriptors) computed from temporal datasets of optical spectral indices and SAR backscattering coefficient. Temporal series are available up to the tillering/full canopy cover stage which is identified as the optimum timing for delivering in-season information on rice area (i.e. mid July). The approach relies on a-priori knowledge on crop dynamics to adapt time horizons for TSD computation and thresholds to local conditions. Output products consist of maps of rice cultivated areas, rice seeding techniques (dry and flooded rice) and flooding practices. Validation showed rice mapping overall accuracy to be 87.8% with commission and omission errors of 3.5% and 24.7%, respectively. Mapping of rice seeding technique showed good agreement with farmer declarations aggregated at the municipality scale (dry rice r(2)=0.71 and flooded rice r(2)=0.91). Finally, flood maps have an overall accuracy above 70%. Geo-products on rice areas and flooding occurrence are relevant information for water management at regional scale especially during summer in presence of multiple crops and water shortage.

CP  - Ernst Mach Centenary Conference
CL  - Vienna, AUSTRIA
AB  - This article portrays unification of physics as a central tenet of Ernst Mach's thought, and organizes some of the focal issues in philosophy of science around the process of unification of science. Mach finds a natural place in the history. Newton's Principia marked the beginning of the era of mathematical physics, which developed triumphantly in the eighteenth century, until new phenomena were discovered in the nineteenth century whose explanations went over and above Newtonian physics. Also Positivism emerged in the nineteenth century. This was the setting where Mach entered. The notion that a central function of physics is to give mathematical descriptions of perceptions is all over Mach's work, but in Mach's thought mathematics comes together with hypothetical laws of nature and an overall world-view, similarly as in Newtonian physics where mathematics comes together with the laws of motion. Mach's criticism of Newtonian absolute time and space was in line with positivism, and his suggestions about an overall holistic worldview were to function as an intuitive background for the new physics. Thus, as a physicist and a philosopher of physics, Mach should be seen primarily as a unifier, and his famous anti-metaphysics should be seen as derivative from this unificationist project: he did not intend to banish the metaphysical core that he himself proposed, but only metaphysics that is not needed in unified science.

AB  - Proposed a new efficient algorithm for vectorization of remote sensing raster data, which traverses the raster data sequentially using scan line method, organizes the Pixel Edge using the linked list technique to constitute region boundaries dynamically, and determines the ownership of isolated island using hidden ray method. This approach could converts the raster spot into the vector region directly by making use of the spatial information implied in the arrangement of pixels in the raster data. It could obtain the complete vector information of region by traversing the raster data only once without any intermediate data and some other operations like constructing topological relationship of polygons. Experimental results show that the approach is more efficient and easy to implement.

AB  - Accurate estimation of ocean's interior salinity information based on surface remote sensing data is quite significant for understanding complex dynamic processes in the ocean. This study adopts two kinds of ensemble learning algorithm, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) to estimate the subsurface salinity anomaly (SSA) in the upper 2000 m of the global ocean from multisource satellite-based sea surface parameters. The model performance is measured by R-square (R-2) and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE). The results indicate the RF and GBDT models are both well suitable for retrieving SSA in the global ocean's interior and RF model outperforms GBDT model; the models accuracy generally decreased with the depth below 500 m. This study is helpful in understanding subsurface and deeper ocean environment response to recent global warming.

AB  - Mixed pixels are widely existed in remote sensing data. Using the proportion of different land-covers to improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images is a popular method in the field of remote sensing data processing. The proportion data and location of sub-pixels in geometrical shapes can be used as the training data to train the neural network. The trained model can be used to sub-pixel mapping for the real land image. This paper proposed a sub-pixel mapping method based on Logistic Regression and Pixel-Swapping Model (LRPSM). The artificial image and real land image taken by Landsat8 were used to be tested. Experiments showed that the accuracy of LRPSM outperformed PSM based on sub-pixel spatial attraction model and BPNN based on neural network model in sub-pixel mapping.

TI  - Coseismic displacement of the 5 April 2017 Mashhad earthquake (Mw 6.1) in NE Iran through Sentinel-1A TOPS data: New implications for the strain partitioning in the southern Binalud Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The outward expansion of the northeastern Iranian Plateau is mainly accommodated by a series of widely distributed range-normal thrust and range-parallel strike-slip faults. However, the role of the strike-slip faults in this region's strain-partitioning kinematics remains unclear. The occurrence of the 5 April 2017 Mw 6.1 Mashhad earthquake provides us a rare opportunity to study this topic because this earthquake struck the southern Binalud Mountains, which are experiencing an oblique convergence between the northward-moving Lut Block and the NW-striking Binalud and Kopeh Dagh mountain ranges. We process two paired ascending and descending Sentinel-1A radar-image observations to determine the relative contributions from the dip and strike-dip subcomponents in such an oblique collisional domain. The interferograms along the line-of-sight direction and their converted horizontal and vertical displacements indicate that a thrust with a right-lateral strike-slip fault controlled the rupture process of the Mashhad earthquake, with the maximum dextral shearing and vertical displacements reaching 19.5 cm and 14 cm, respectively. Coseismic surface deformation measurements are also used to estimate the fault geometry and invert the slip distribution along the underlying seismogenic fault. Our best-fit faulting model suggests that the coseismic rupture occurred on a fault plane with a dip angle of 37.5 degrees and strike angle of 324 degrees. The strike-slip subcomponent was more significant than the dip-slip, approaching similar to 95 cm, and the dip-slip varied from 10 cm to 47 cm. The seismic-moment release of our preferred fault model is 1.71 x 10(18) Nm, equivalent to a Mw 6.16 earthquake event. We also use the preferred fault model to calculate the Coulomb failure stress (CFS) change at the nearby receiver faults. Combined with an analysis of historical earthquakes and the consistent dextral river deflections along the strike-slip fault systems of the southern Binalud and Kopeh Dagh Mountains, we speculate that the seismogenic structure that triggered the Mashhad earthquake should have been one strand fault of the NW-SE-striking Kashafrud fault system. The strike-slip faults in NE Iran play an important role in accommodating the lateral transport of crustal material from the convergence front of the Lut Block and Binalud fragments and providing commonly distributed anticlockwise rotation around a vertical axis.

AB  - This paper's aim is to analyse the correlation between land change pattern and its topography with Urban Heat Islands (UHI) in Kaliurang Street and surrounding area. Secondly, the effects of daily commuting activities from rural or sub urban area towards urban area are well identified. Kaliurang Street is one of the major streets in Sleman that uniquely represented the transition between rural, suburban, and urban area. Rural area is located in the furthest north, suburban located in the center, while the urban area is located in the southern part. Transect method carried out along Kaliurang Street to obtain primary data mainly temperature and vehicles number. Data collected during daytime (between 12-2 PM) and afternoon (between 3 to 5 PM). Furthermore, LANDSAT 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imagery was analyzed to obtain the Land Surface Temperature (LST) Information, while ALOS PALSAR was analyzed to obtain elevation data. One of the causes of temperature differences is the commuting which affects the variation of surface temperature along Kaliurang Street. Therefore, strong correlation between commuting and the UHI phenomenon are expected.

AB  - Digital Elevation Model is the versatile source for many applications. The elevation accuracy of DEM is the deciding factors for improving their applications in various fields. The accuracy of elevation differs based on the sources of data. The more economical and frequently obtained stereo capable Cartosat-1 is capable in generation of Digital Elevation Model. But the elevation accuracy is comparatively lower than Terrestrial, Aerial, LIDAR generated DEM's elevation. The idea of this study is to develop the prediction model from SPSS software to enhance the elevation accuracy of satellite based data by using ground elevation for different terrain conditions at Tirunelveli. Study covers a part of Tirunelveli, which comes under the Path and Row 550,354 of Cartosat-1 satellite data have been used in this study. The reliability check, correlation and Paired T tests were done before deriving the prediction model using SPSS statistical software in order to check the association between ground elevation and satellite elevation. It was observed from the study area that the minimum and maximum elevation differences between the satellite and ground was 6 m and 10 m respectively for same earth positions. In this study ground elevation used as dependent variable and satellite elevation used as independent variable for the prediction model development. The prediction model have been validated for the data have been collected in the field for the different terrain conditions, it was revealed that the differences between the predicted and measured values maximum was 0.62 meter and the minimum was 0.0009 meter. It was observed from the study that the prediction model identified from the different terrain conditions worked only for the same terrain types.

AB  - Landslide is one of the most common disaster that occurs in Indonesia with meteorological and geomorphological factors as main factors. Purworejo is one of the potential area that could be experiencing landslides, because the geomorphological conditions which are included in Menoreh Hills are topographically sloping to very steep. Based on the Indonesian Disaster Information Data (DIBI) and the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) in the last five years from 2014 to April 2019 there have been 64 landslides in Purworejo. To reduce the impact of landslide, effective evacuation routes are needed. Determining of evacuation routes can be done in various methods, one of methods is use a spatio-cost approach. The purpose of this research is to determine the most effective evacuation routes to reduce the impact of landslide. Spatio-cost parameters obtained by certain paramaters include DEM (Digital Elevation Model) form ALOS Palsar Image, Vector Data (Shapefile) Land Use form interpretation data using SPOT 5 Image, Vector Data (Shape) Roads in Bruno Sub-districs using Indonesiaan Geospastial data with Purworejo Regency, Vector Data (Shape) Assembly Point using field surveying with Avenza Map, and Vector Data (Shape) Evacuation Point using field surveying with Avenza Map and all of the parameters are weighted form each method. Each parameter are processed to look for evacuation routes using Least Cost Path (LCP) method. The expected result of this research is evacuation routes that can help people around disaster-prone areas to prepare. This ongoing research is important to improve disaster management in Indonesia, especially for landslide in Bruno, Purworejo, Central Java.

AB  - Construction of dams in the upstream area will lead to changes in flow water, sediment output in the downstream area and change nutrients entry into estuatries then affects chl-a (Chl-a) concentration. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of the functioning of the dam Jatigede in Sumedang District towards the condition of total suspended solids (TSS) and chl-a (Chl-a) concentration in the sea water around the mouth of the Cimanuk River. In this study, we used multi-temporal Landsat 8 OLI /TIRS imagery to determine the spatial pattern of TSS during the time before and after the functioning of dam Jatigede. The results showed that after the Jatigede Dam operated, the distributions and amounts of TSS concentration > 80mg /l tends to reduce, especially at the water areas close to the coast and the Cimanuk river discharge no longer significantly affects the spatial distribution of TSS concentrations. The watershed discharge also affects the distribution area of Chl-a 0.5-1 mg/m3 which tend to decrease in the water nearby to land.

T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Principles and methods of a digital medium scale soil map (DSM) creation of the Leningrad region, demonstrating the modern state of soil cover (SC) are told in this article. The base of the DSM creation of the Leningrad region are the following principles: reliability, historicity, data harmonization, complexity, a combination of genetic features and factors, modernity, openness, verification. A database to the DSM of the Leningrad region includes the information about soil diversity, resource potential of the SC, factors of soil cover's differentiation (relief, vegetation, soil forming rocks, climate, anthropogenic activity), morphological construction and soil properties. A complexity GIS-project with different thematic maps and optical satellite data of the high spatial resolution is made. Soil diversity of the Leningrad region (more than 50 natural soil subtypes, 70 anthropogenically changed soil subtypes, about 100 soil combinations with natural soils, more than 200 soil combinations with anthropogenically changed and anthropogenic soils) are demonstrated on the DSM. A predominance of anthropogenic-changed over natural soils is determined. Soils with mixed material of soil horizons and soils with oxidized-gley horizons are wide spread and consist about 1/3 from the total amount of anthropogenically changed soils. Anthropogenically changed, and natural soil combinations with not soil formations consist of about 50 % of the total amount of soil combinations (SC). Different types of urbopedocombinations are dominated in the city territories. A digital soil map of the Leningrad region (1: 200 000 scale) is a scientific base for the regional policy's development of the soil resources' rational using.

T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - The research on elephant distribution and habitat preference was carried out in two locations Balai Raja and Tesso Nilo, Riau Province, Indonesia on 2012-2016. Three GPS Collars were installed on one individual adult female at Balai Raja (Desma) and two individuals at Tesso Nilo (Angelina and Butet). For the elephants' habitat, the forest cover identification was performed by spectral color analysis on the 8 ETM+ Landsat images and resulted in land cover detail on MCP (Minimum Convex Polygon), and 50% and 95% fix kernel density of movement of the elephant including in the morning, the day and the night. Based on MCP estimation, Desma habitat area was 328.86 km2, while Angelina and Butet were 632.57 km2 and 701.60 km2, respectively. Land cover in MCP indicated that the oil palm, mixed agriculture, and rubber were dominantly areas used by Desma, while acacia, forest and oil palm plantation were dominantly area used by Angelina and Butet. In habitat preferences, Desma preferred forests and swamp areas to day activity. However, Angelina and Butet selected acacia plantation, forest, infrastructures such as the mills and land opening as the location of movement. Water bodies and shrub were not widely used for the elephants' activities. This study indicated that the pattern of habitat selection is a strategy for elephants to avoid conflict with the human. Although resources are limited, the habitat selection can reduce conflict incidence.

AB  - This paper presents a novel multi-attention driven system that jointly exploits Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the context of multi-label remote sensing (RS) image classification. The proposed system consists of four main modules. The first module aims to extract preliminary local descriptors of RS image bands that can be associated to different spatial resolutions. To this end, we introduce a K-Branch CNN, in which each branch extracts descriptors of image bands that have the same spatial resolution. The second module aims to model spatial relationship among local descriptors. This is achieved by a bidirectional RNN architecture, in which Long Short-Term Memory nodes enrich local descriptors by considering spatial relationships of local areas (image patches). The third module aims to define multiple attention scores for local descriptors. This is achieved by a novel patch-based multi-attention mechanism that takes into account the joint occurrence of multiple land-cover classes and provides the attention-based local descriptors. The last module exploits these descriptors for multi-label RS image classification. Experimental results obtained on the BigEarth-Net that is a large-scale Sentinel-2 benchmark archive show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to a state of the art method.

AB  - This paper presents the BigEarthNet that is a new large-scale multi-label Sentinel-2 benchmark archive. The BigEarthNet consists of 590; 326 Sentinel-2 image patches, each of which is a section of i) 120 x 120 pixels for 10m bands; ii) 60 x 60 pixels for 20m bands; and iii) 20 x 20 pixels for 60m bands. Unlike most of the existing archives, each image patch is annotated by multiple land-cover classes (i.e., multi-labels) that are provided from the CORINE Land Cover database of the year 2018 (CLC 2018). The BigEarthNet is significantly larger than the existing archives in remote sensing (RS) and thus is much more convenient to be used as a training source in the context of deep learning. This paper first addresses the limitations of the existing archives and then describes the properties of the BigEarthNet. Experimental results obtained in the framework of RS image scene classification problems show that a shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained on the BigEarthNet provides much higher accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art CNN model pre-trained on the ImageNet (which is a very popular large-scale benchmark archive in computer vision). The BigEarthNet opens up promising directions to advance operational RS applications and research in massive Sentinel-2 image archives.

AB  - The Javan Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus) was categorized as a red list according to IUCN. Javan Rhinoceros was increasingly threatened due to the lack of available environmental characteristic informations (habitat) that was suitable for Javan rhinoceros to survive in in-situ conservation. The capability of various remote sensing wavelengths sensors can be used to get the environmental characteristics data and obtain information related to Javan Rhinoceros's habitat characteristics through spatial modelling. This research were aimed to (1) knowing the ability of LANDSAT-8 multispectral satellite imagery to identify biophysical parameter of Javan Rhinoceros's habitat in Ujung Kulon National Park and (2) developing a javan rhinoceros's suitable habitat distribution model in order to survive in Ujung Kulon National Park. The data were collected by LANDSAT-8 multispectral satellite imagery interpretation assisted by GIS analysis. The result showed that LANDSAT-8 multispectral satellite imagery can be used to identify several biophysical parameters, such: slope, altitude, vegetation cover index, temperature, and the distance of puddle, river, beach, and glade. Moreover, the result of the distribution model can be visualized as digital maps and software-based maps about Javan rhinoceros habitat information's, and it can be used as guidance for conservation society in order to conserve Javan rhinoceros in Indonesia.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aral Sea has gone through a drastic shrinkage during the past century, from more than 68,000 km(2) in 1960s to less than 10,000 km(2) in 2015. The desiccation was highly severe in 2009 and 2014 due to the west basin changed to an exposed bottom for several months. Then dust storms, fishery recession and degraded plant communities followed, causing tremendous environmental problems and economic deteriorations. In this paper, high frequency water extents of Aral Sea during 2000-2015 were delineated by MODIS images. Water level changes of the lake were analyzed according to a water level database, which was derived on TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, ENVISAT and SARAL altimeter data. Water volume changes during the same period were determined by a combination of lake surface extents and the corresponding water level data. The largest area of Aral Sea was 30,256.46 km(2) in May 2000, and the smallest was 6926.04 km(2) in November 2014. Water storage declination for the whole lake was up to 74km(3) and water level dropped from 43.42 m to 39.73 m during 2000-2015. In a whole, west and east basins of the lake presented declination trends (-191.73 km(2)/yr and -1089.48 km(2)/yr), while the north basin showed a little increase with the rate of 38.18 km(2)/yr. For the three basins (north, west and east), corresponding level tendencies were 0.15 m/yr, -0.5 m/yr, -0.38 m/yr, and volume variations were 0.29 km(3)/yr, -1.36 km(3)/yr, -3.25 km(3)/yr, respectively.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Optical and Dual-Polarized SAR Data With Multiple Kernel Learning for Urban Impervious Surface Mapping
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of impervious surface distribution is important but challenging. Integrating optical and SAR data to improve urban impervious surface estimation has recently shown promising performance. Further investigation and development on this multisensory approach are conducted in this study. A novel multiple kernel learning (MKL) framework is proposed to integrate heterogeneous features from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A data effectively. A linearly weighted combination of basic kernels built using each group of features is learned as the optimal kernel, while the hyperparameters and the weight of each basic kernel are determined simultaneously by using the differential evolution algorithm. Then, the optimal kernel is embedded into the support vector regression algorithm, and the impervious surface abundance of the study area is estimated by applying the developed multiple kernel support vector regression (MKSVR) model. The impervious surface ground truth at a subpixel level is derived from a high-resolution image by means of object-oriented classification. The experimental results indicate that the synergistic use of optical and dual-pol SAR data by employing MKSVR achieves a noteworthy improvement for impervious surface estimation compared to that using optical image alone, the root mean square error is decreased by 4.30%, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) is increased by 9.47%, and that the incorporation of optical and SAR does not guarantee the improved performance, simply stacking all features of multisource data into a vector is not a good choice, and the MKL is a powerful tool to apply as demonstrated by the experiments conducted in this study.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next- Generation Satellites XXIII
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) has been in orbit for more than one and a half years. VIIRS has 22 bands, among which 14 are reflective solar bands (RSBs) covering a spectral range from 0.410 to 2.250 mu m. The RSBs are calibrated on-orbit using an onboard solar diffuser ( SD), whose on-orbit degradation is tracked by an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM). NOAA-20 VIIRS is also scheduled to view the Moon approximately monthly and the lunar observations are used to track the RSB on-orbit changes as well. Both SD and lunar calibration results for the RSBs are shown and it is demonstrated that the two sets of the calibration coefficients diverge with time, especially for short wavelength bands. The divergence is due to the nonuniformity of the SD degradation, a phenomenon observed in SNPP VIIRS and the two MODIS instruments. Because of this divergence, a hybrid method, which properly combines the SD and lunar calibration results, need to be applied to generate the RSB calibration coefficients look-up tables (LUTs) as has been done for SNPP VIIR RSBs. The challenging issues of the RSB calibration using the SD/SDSM and the Moon are also addressed and discussed.

AB  - Scene matching aided navigation is mainly used in autonomous navigation of aircraft. In scene matching field, scene matching areas selecting is a great challenge. The traditional methods focus on extracting image features and building a model to fit the relationship between image features and matching suitability indicators. We propose a new method combing principal component analysis network (PCANet) and multi-layer perception (MLP) to select scene matching areas for the first time. Firstly, we built a dataset based on images captured by TerraSAR-X satellite. Secondly, we extract information of each image by PCANet and generate label based on matching probability. Finally, MLP is used to automatically fit the mapping relation between image and matching suitability. The proposed method avoids the steps of extracting features manually and improves the performance in different task. The method proposed in this paper performs better than convolutional neural network (CNN).

TI  - Roads and Intersections Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Based on Tensor Voting under Big Data Environment
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, big data is a new and hot object of research. In particular, the development of the Internet of things (IoT) results in a sharp increase in data. Enormous amounts of networking sensors are constantly collecting and transmitting data for storage and processing in the cloud including remote sensing data, environmental data, geographical data, etc. Road information extraction from remote sensing data is mainly researched in this paper. Roads are typical man-made objects. Extracting roads from remote sensing imagery has great significance in various applications such as GIS data updating, urban planning, navigation, and military. In this paper a multistage and multifeature method to extract roads and detect road intersections from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery based on tensor voting is presented. Firstly, the input remote sensing image is segmented into two groups including road candidate regions and nonroad regions using template matching; then we can obtain preliminary road map. Secondly, nonroad regions are removed by geometric characteristics of road (large area and long strip). Thirdly, tensor voting is used to overcome the broken roads and discontinuities caused by the different disturbing factors and then delete the nonroad areas that are mixed into the road areas due to mis-segmentation, improving the completeness of extracted roads. And then, all the road intersections are extracted by using tensor voting. The experiments are conducted on different remote sensing images to test the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results show that our method can get more complete and accurate extracted results than the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - In various applications of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), the wildly used low-cost sensors are prone to measurement drift, which requests re-calibration to provide the accurate data. Otherwise, the data gathered by those sensors on massive mobile devices may be unavailable to use. In this research domain, sensor calibration is considered as a challenging problem. In this paper, the authors propose a cooperative calibration method, especially suitable for Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (MWSN). Different from those existing methods, this method introduces auto-calibration among mobile nodes. In the first phase, the calibration is carried out between fixed and selected mobile nodes. The second phase is modeled by the calibration relationship between the mobile sensors. From the experimental evaluation, the proposed scheme shows good efficiency to acquire high calibration accuracy.

AB  - The goal of this paper was to investigate the strength of key spectral vegetation indices for the rice rotation effect related to the rice yield increment. Six widely used spectral indices were investigated in a study of the rice rotation effect in cotton-rice rotation and rice-rice monoculture in Xinghua, China. These six indices related closely with rice yield were investigated for cotton and rice during 2 years (2001 and 2002) on LANDSAT 7 ETM+ images. Six rice vegetation indices of cotton-rice rotation were increased by an average of 6.28% (NDVI), 11.28% (GVI), 6.28% (SAVI), 1.25% (IPVI), 3.40% (RVI), and 7.66% (DVI) compared with that of rice-rice monoculture, respectively.

AB  - Cotton is an important crop playing a key role in both economy and regional environment. In recent years, remote sensing has become the most feasible tool of crop field mapping in large-scale. This study evaluates the feature fusion of time series Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentienl-2 (S2) data for cotton filed mapping in heterogeneous smallholder agricultural systems in Xinjiang, China. A SHP (Statistically Homogeneous Pixel) algorithm originally used for identification of distributed scatterers in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) applications was implemented in de-speckling of SAR intensities. A semi-automated approach based on Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm was used to select optimal combination of SAR or/and optical features in the cotton field mapping to achieve highest accuracy. In experiments, we demonstrated that feature fusion of Sentinel-1&2 is able to improve the cotton mapping accuracy.

AB  - Optical data plays an important role in various remote sensing applications. However, cloud and cloud shadow contamination reduce the availability of optical data, especially in tropical regions. Accurate identification of cloud and cloud shadow is an essential step in optical image preprocessing. The Function of Mask (FMASK) [1] is one of the most widely used cloud and cloud shadow detection methods. In view of the problems of some thin clouds and cloud shadows omission errors in tropical regions of FMASK, we develop an improved FMASK algorithm in tropical regions from the following two aspects: (1) Cloud detection: Firstly, the parameters and thresholds of FMASK are adjusted to generate the basic cloud layer; Secondly, the cloud index layer is calculated based on the bright features of clouds; Then, combining the temporal randomness and spectral characteristics of cloud, other bright objects are excluded and thin clouds are retained. (2) Cloud shadow detection: Firstly, the dark features of cloud shadows are mainly used to detect the basic cloud shadow layer; Secondly, combining the spectral and randomness characteristics of cloud shadow to avoid the interference of other dark objects. We randomly selected three experimental areas in tropical regions to verify the proposed algorithm developed in this paper. Through comparing and evaluating the accuracy of the clouds and cloud shadows mask generated based on the method in this paper with real samples drawn manually, the experiment results show that the average overall precision of clouds and cloud shadows mask generated based on the algorithm in this paper exceeding 80%. This improved FMASK algorithm improves the accuracy of clouds and cloud shadows detection in several tropical regions for Landsat images.

T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer cells with stem cell properties play an important role in tumor progression and thus are key targets for therapy. Here, we show that combined Bcl-2/Src inhibition synergize to deplete stem-like cells. While Src inhibition increases pro-apoptotic PUMA, we find that a significant amount interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, promoting resistance to cell death. Consistent with this, the clinically-approved Bcl-2 selective drug venetoclax was sufficient to overcome resistance by preventing PUMA/Bcl-2 binding, enhancing apoptosis. This effect was specific to stem-like breast cancer cells as there was no effect on luminal or basal-like cell types. In contrast, the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 potently targeted basal-like, but not stem-like cells, highlighting dependency on distinct sentinel Bcl-2 family members. Our findings reveal Bcl-2/Src inhibition as a superior therapy to target sternness, providing a foundation for a potential personalized strategy to reduce breast cancer progression.

TI  - Investigating GF-5 Hyperspectral and GF-1 Multispectral Data Fusion Methods for Multitemporal Change Analysis
T2  - 2019 10TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON THE ANALYSIS OF MULTITEMPORAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGES (MULTITEMP)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Multitemporal change analysis is one of the essential purposes for discovering knowledge from various remote sensing terrestrial earth observation techniques. Particularly, the China Gaofen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral imager provides a new data source for multitemporal change analysis. Its 330 bands, 60 km swath width and 5-10 nm spectrum resolutions make it captures subtle changes in spectrum responses of ground objects across different images. Unfortunately, its 30 spatial resolution still hinders its accurate geospatial location in some specific applications. Therefore, we explore state-of-the-art data fusion methods and seek an appropriate fusing method of GF-5 hyperspectral and GF-1 multispectral data to benefit multitemporal change analysis. We utilize four image fusion methods and implement six evaluation criteria to holistically evaluate the performance of different methods. Experimental results on three datasets of Taihu Lake and Poyang Lake in China show that the Modulation transfer functions-generalized Laplacian pyramid (MTF-GLP) has smaller spectral distortion, better spatial fidelity and requires moderate computational time than the other three methods. It accordingly can be a good choice for fusing GF-5 and GF-1 remote sensing data in both classification and multitemporal change analysis.

TI  - Modeling polarized solar radiation from a snow surface for correction of polarization-induced error in satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow surfaces can be composed of ice crystals, melt-form snow or melt-freeze snow. Solar radiation scattered by such surfaces is polarized and the amount of polarization depends on the surface composition. This can be a source of measurement errors in satellite data if a non-polarimetric radiometric sensor is sensitive to the polarization state of light. To obtain highly accurate spectral solar radiation data from the Earth-atmosphere system for the space-borne inter-calibration studies as proposed in NASA's Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission and the CLARREO Pathfinder (CPF) mission, the spectral polarization state of the reflected solar light at the top of atmosphere (TOA) must be known with sufficient accuracy. The degree of polarization (DOP) and the angle of linear polarization (AOLP) of the light at the TOA as functions of incident and viewing geometry and scene type construct the Polarization Distribution Models (PDMs) for correction of polarization-induced error of satellite data [31. In this work, algorithms for modeling the spectral polarization state of reflected sunlight from various types of snow, including particulate snow, melt-form snow, and melt-freeze snow crusts are developed. A particulate snow surface model based on a mixture of spherical and hexagonal-column particle shapes is used. A rough-surface ice/water facet model is introduced to approximate the melt-form snow and melt-freeze snow crusts. The area fraction of facets for typical (mostly particulate) snow, and for melt-form and melt-freeze snow crusts, is estimated by comparing the model results with the PARASOL satellite data and with ground measurements conducted in Hokkaido, Japan, and in the northwest Greenland ice sheet. Our numerical results demonstrate that the model can provide a reliable approach for making the spectral PDMs for wavelengths between 320 and 2300 nm for satellite inter-calibration applications as proposed in the CLARREO and the CLARREO CPF missions for all kinds of snow surfaces.

TI  - Statistical Characteristics of Cyclonic Warm-Core Eddies and Anticyclonic Cold-Core Eddies in the North Pacific Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A (an) cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy is usually associated with a cold (warm) core caused by the eddy-induced divergence (convergence) motion. However, there are also some cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddies with warm (cold) cores in the North Pacific, named cyclonic warm-core eddies (CWEs) and anticyclonic cold-core eddies (ACEs) in this study, respectively. Their spatio-temporal characteristics and regional dependence are analyzed using the multi-satellite merged remote sensing datasets. The CWEs are mainly concentrated in the northwestern and southeastern North Pacific. However, besides these two areas, the ACEs are also concentrated in the northeastern Pacific. The annual mean number decreases year by year for both CWEs and ACEs, and the decreasing rate of the CWEs is about two times as large as that of the ACEs. Moreover, the CWEs and ACEs also exhibit a significant seasonal variation, which are intense in summer and weak in winter. Based on the statistics of dynamic characteristics in seven subregions, the Kuroshio Extension region could be considered as the most active area for the CWEs and ACEs. Two possible mechanisms for CW-ACEs generation are discussed by analyzing two cases.

TI  - Classification for Remote Sensing Data With Improved CNN-SVM Method
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficient classification of remote sensing images (RSIs) has become the key of remote sensing application. To tackle the high computational cost in the traditional classification method, in this paper we propose a new RSI classification method based on improved convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) (CNN-SVM). In this method, we first designed a seven-layer CNN structure and took the ReLU function as the activation function. We then inputted the RSI into the CNN model and extracted feature maps and replaced the output layer of the CNN network via training the feature maps in the SVM classifier. Next, taking the simulation experiments of MNIST handwritten digital dataset and UC Merced Land Use remote sensing dataset as examples, we tested and verified the proposed method in this experiment. Finally, the empirical study of volcanic ash cloud (VAC) classification from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) RSI was carried out and evaluated. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional methods, the proposed method has lower loss value and better generalization in modeling training; the total classification accuracy of VAC and Kappa coefficient reached 93.5% and 0.8502, respectively, and achieved preferable VAC identification and visual effects. It will enhance the classification accuracy to the massive remote sensing data.

AB  - The classification of crops based on remote sensing technology is a necessary measure for large-scale agricultural monitoring. In the regions with good light conditions, optical satellite data can be used for crop classification with a satisfied result. However, there are also large regions of cloudy and rainy regions on the surface of the earth. In these regions, optical images can only obtained fragmented data through the cloud gap or even impossible to get, which cannot meet the requirements of rapid and accurate agricultural monitoring. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be rarely affected by atmospheric disturbances and sensitive to surface structure characteristics, so the SAR data has good application potential in agriculture. Especially in cloudy and rainy regions, its application for crop classification has more realistic significance. In this study, we classify crops based on Sentinel-1 multi-temporal data in Xifeng County at the geo-parcel scale with a recurrent neural network, the overall accuracy could up to 69 percent. This method can solve the problem of continuous optical data loss in crop classification in cloudy and rainy regions.

AB  - The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) occultation sounder (GNOS) is one of the new generation payloads onboard the Chinese FengYun 3 (FY-3) series of operational meteorological satellites for sounding the Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. The FY-3C/-3D GNOS, onboard the FY-3 satellite C/D launched in September 2013 and November 2017, respectively, was designed for acquiring setting and rising radio occultation (RO) data by using GNSS signals from both the Chinese BeiDou System (BDS) and the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS). So far, the GNOS measurements and atmospheric and ionospheric data products have been validated and evaluated and then been used for atmosphere and ionosphere related scientific applications.This paper reviews the FY-3 GNOS instrument, RO data processing, data quality evaluation, and research applications. The reviewed data validation and application results demonstrate that the FY-3 GNOS missions can provide accurate and precise atmospheric and ionospheric GNSS (i.e., GPS and BDS) RO profiles for numerical weather prediction (NWP), global climate monitoring (GCM) and space weather research (SWR). The performance of the FY-3 GNOS product quality evaluation and scientific applications establishes confidence that the GNOS data from the series of FY-3 satellites will provide important contributions to SWP, GCM and SWR scientific communities.

AB  - Dryland crops in China have a large planting area and wide spatial distribution, which contributes a lot to grain production. Accurate and timely acquisition of information on dryland crop types, planting areas and spatial distribution in dryland can provide an important basis for agricultural production and management, as well as the formulation of national food policy and economic plan, therefore, it is of great significance for promoting structural reform of agricultural supply side and national food security. The key stage of crop growth in the north of China is affected by cloud and rain weather, which makes it difficult to obtain sufficient effective optical data, and the current recognition accuracy of dryland crops based on polarized SAR data is low. In order to solve these problems, this study selected Jizhou City, Hebei Province as the research area, using the full-polarization RADARSAT-2 data of July 17, August 7 and September 24, 2018, and then selected three polarization decomposition methods (Cloude-Pottier decomposition, Freeman decomposition and Yamaguchi decomposition) and two classification methods (maximum likelihood and random forest) to construct 18 classification combinations. The identification of corn and cotton in study area was studied by using various schemes. Finally, the accuracy of dry land crop identification under various combination schemes was compared quantitatively with the ground survey data. The results showed that, Yamaguchi decomposition combined with maximum likelihood classification method was used on August 7 (flowering and boll period of cotton), and the classification accuracy was the highest (production accuracy was 78.98%). For corn, Yamaguchi decomposition combined with random forest classification method was used on September 24 (mature period of corn), and the classification accuracy was the highest (production accuracy was over 90%). I For the decomposition method, Yamaguchi decomposition has the highest classification accuracy among the three decomposition methods, followed by Freeman decomposition, Cloude-Pottier decomposition has the lowest classification accuracy; as far as the classification method is concerned, the maximum likelihood classification method has the highest recognition accuracy for cotton, but the random forest classification has the highest recognition accuracy for corn; in terms of the best identification phase, the flowering and boll period is the best recognition period for cotton, and the maturity period is the best recognition time for corn.. This study will help to improve the recognition accuracy of corn and cotton in fully polarized SAR data, and provide reference for the identification of multi-temporal dryland crops under complex planting structures.

AB  - Dryland crops have a long planting history in China. They are planted in a wide range and account for a high proportion of the total grain output. Quick and accurate acquisition of Dryland Crop Planting area can provide decision support for agricultural production managers, provide basis for food policy formulation, and provide guarantee for national food security. Different from the initial stage of rice growth, the underlying surface water layer and rice plant can form obvious dihedral angle, which can produce strong backscatter to microwave. Intercropping and interplanting of dryland crops are common, and the planting structure is complex, so it is difficult to identify them. At present, there is a lack of research on scattering characteristics of Dryland crops, and the universality of recognition methods is also poor, which leads to the low accuracy of dry land crop recognition based on SAR data. The purpose of studying the scattering characteristics of dryland crops and their changes with time is to provide basis for the identification of dryland crops and improve the classification accuracy. This paper chooses Jizhou City, Hebei Province as the research area, and takes corn and cotton as the research objects. The full polarization RADARSAT-2 data of three phases in 2018 (July 17, August 7 and September 24) were used. The changes of basic scattering characteristics (average scattering angle, entropy, volume scattering, dihedral angle scattering, surface scattering) of crops with different target decomposition methods (Cloude-Pottier, Freeman, Yamaguchi) were studied and compared, and the proportion of basic scattering power and its changing trend at different growth stages were analyzed. The results showed that the counter entropy of the two crops changed little in the whole growth period, and mainly consisted of surface scattering and volume scattering. For corn, with the growth of crops, the entropy and average scattering angle increased first and then decreased, the proportion of surface scattering power decreased from 67% to 48% and then increased to 55%, and the proportion of volume scattering power increased from 33% to 52% and then decreased to 45%. On August 7, the volume scattering power is greater than the surface scattering power. For cotton, with the increase of crop growth entropy and average scattering angle, the proportion of surface scattering power decreases from 66% to 54%, and the volume scattering power increases from 33% to 46%. The surface scattering power is larger than volume scattering in the whole growth period. This study will help to determine the scattering mechanism of corn and cotton, and provide reference for the study of scattering characteristics of other dryland crops.

AB  - A flood, one of the most devastating natural disasters in the world, occurs when water inundates land that's normally dry. Although floods can develop in many ways, river floods (i.e. overflow by rivers or river banks) are the most common. Turkey is one of the flood-affected countries with its 20 main basins in 8 regions. One of the most aggrieved basins in Turkey is the Maritsa river basin in in Eastern Balkans, which also contains the natural border regions with Greece and Bulgaria. 65% of the Maritsa River basin, which originates from the Rila Mountains and joins the Arda and Tundzha rivers, is located in Bulgaria. When the melting snow flow or precipitation in the basin increases, the Maritsa River overflows from the slopes to the Edirne Plain and from time to time exceeds the capacity of the bed, causing floods. On the other hand, since the water level in the dams and reservoirs was kept at the highest level for production purposes, the flood repeat interval increased in the region, since 2000s. Today, it is possible to monitor and evaluate the damages of flood by obtaining very reliable information with space technology. Especially, microwave SAR images that can penetrate clouds, are of great importance in flood mapping because they provide immediate information on the extent of inundation and support the evaluation of property and environmental damages. In this study, rapid flood risk assessment in the region was performed using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) time series images, and calibrated Sentinel 1 SAR images produced on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for 2015-2018 period. GEE is a cloud-based platform that facilitates access to high-performance computing resources to handle very large geographic data sets. The results were compared and verified using meteorological data, riverbed flow data, and digital media news. The results showed that the most affected areas were consistent with the highest measured flow rates and the magnitude of flood damages caused by two main causes in the basin (i.e. opening of shutters in Bulgarian dams or local excessive rainfall) was very different (approximately 8 times larger) from each other.

AB  - The satellite image is a Earth's surface image recorder that is performed without physical contact with the object. Satellite imagery can also be used as a solution to get the information of a wide area that is covered by vegetation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an index depicting the level of a green plant with a combined tally of the Visible Red Band and the Near Infrared Band. Visible Red Band is the band of Landsat satellite image 8 whereas Near Infrared Band is a band 5 of Landsat satellite image 8. This research intends to build a system of counting of NDVI data by making use of satellite images Landsat 8 on the special region of Yogyakarta. The equation used in this study is the equation correction between Visible Red Band and Near Infrared Band from Landsat 8 satellite imagery and NDVI equation. Zoom functions and masking is also built into the system so it can be more focused on the area that wants to the canvas. The results of this research are in the form of value and a map of the NDVI that have been colors segmented in the Province of Yogyakarta.

TI  - Politics of forest fragmentation: a multiscale analysis on the change in the structure of forest landscape in the North and South Korean border region
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we examine the changes in forest structures in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and surrounding areas with different civilian access restrictions in the North and South Korean border region during a 23-year study period from 1992 to 2015 (four to six decades after the end of the Korean War). Forest maps were derived from Landsat images, and forest structures were assessed at multiple spatial scales using lacunarity analysis. The results show that the forest structures changed over the 23-year study period, but the directions of change varied according to the degrees of access restriction. Strict access restriction to the DMZ mitigated small-scale forest fragmentation because forests were regenerated on abandoned farmlands. In spite of the small-scale forest regeneration, infrastructure development associated with the economic cooperation between North and South Koreas in the 2000s aggravated large-scale forest fragmentation in the DMZ. Forest fragmentation was even more serious in the surrounding areas where civilian access is allowed because of farmland and suburban developments. These findings reveal the need to adopt a land use regulation system, such as transboundary protected areas, in the North and South Korean border region, to prevent deforestation under the present divided condition as well as under the one after Korean reunification.

AB  - Sugarcane is one of five important agricultural crops (Rice, Cassava, Sugarcane, Hevea, and Palm) and its critical to Thai's economy. From these important, several decades that government pays attention to support the industry and help to stabilize the sector, enabling sugarcane mills to maintain their profitability even during times of depressed sugar prices in the world market. This role of sugarcane supply chain consists of the growers, millers and associated logistics personnel. Each miller has thousands of smallholders who grow sugarcane with their contract but the farmer can sign more than one contract each crop season depending on various factors such as prices and a loaning rate. Highly these competitive need an efficient monitoring procedure to control their contract in a harvesting peak period. The monitoring of the farmland requires tracking of them at an individual level that almost impossible for field visits. The initiated idea of this research is from the study of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that plan to use remote sensing data (Control with Remote Sensing: CwRS) for controlling and monitoring agriculture land in growing season support a subsidy administration in the post-2020 timeframe. From the aims of the control with remote sensing in CAP and also in this sugarcane industry, the purpose of this study is checking the claimed parcels in an office in order to reduce the number of field visits. This paper introduces an approach for that objective which using Sentinel-2 data for a harvest detection. An algorithm (or a processing chain) in which demonstrated in this paper are an atmospheric correction, vegetation harvest index processing, data composite (cloud-free and the bare soil inspection), and geostatistical calculation of farmland for harvesting indicator. The results show an ability of the detection using remote sensing and the discussion for future improvement are explained in a conclusion.

AB  - Tekina (sic) is a Japanese concept which refers metaphorical expressions. "Teki" functions as a metaphor when an individual desires to express a feeling or explain but is unable to find exact words to portray their point. Furthermore, we can use tekina to refer to an individual's way of thought and worldview. In this paper, we explore the potential of contents in which tekina is embedded in communication processes. The content that is produced acts as a connecting medium between the producer of the content and the audience who encounters the content. Thereon, our interactions with tekina-embedded contents can help us shape and reshape the relationship with our surroundings. To illustrate our point, we refer to examples of a class project conducted in 2018. In this project, students use their perspective, in other words their teki, as a measure to explore Sakuragaoka city in Shibuya. The students designed outputs which concludes the findings of the fieldwork. The results were shown to the public through the exhibition in March 2019. The exhibition setting further enabled us to examine how different individuals interact and form relationships with tekina-embedded outputs.

AB  - Thailand is a developing country that the agricultural sector plays a very important role in the economy. Among all the crops, rice is the main product for domestic use and export. Geographic Information System (GIS) is a major tool for monitoring and forecasting the rice production in the region to minimize the risk of unsuitable crop conditions. The study area focuses on the central of Thailand where higher rice production with two crops annually thanks to the irrigation water available in the region. The Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) is the government organization for publishing statistical data on Thai agriculture. But the data is updated until the year after while water management and rice market price are required updated and near real-time data. Remote sensing is an updated data source and free of charge information that could be applied to solve this problem. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) data is applied to classify rice crops for both major and second crops. The results of the classification are then compared to the OAE statistics data for accuracy assessment. The rice crop areas are calculated and its attribute data includes growing stages as a major and second crop with its productivity estimation.Disciplinary: Agricultural Sciences and Technology (Crop Science), Spatial Information Science and Engineering.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study applied the remote sensing-based drought index, namely, the Energy-Based Water Deficit Index (EWDI), across Mongolia, Australia, and Korean Peninsula for the period between 2000 and 2010. The EWDI is estimated based on the hydrometeorological variables such as evapotranspiration, soil moisture, solar radiation, and vegetation activity which are derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imageries. The estimated EWDI was compared with the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The correlation coefficients between the drought indices are as follows: 0.73-0.76 (EWDI vs ESI), 0.64-0.71 (EWDI vs VCI), 0.54-0.64 (EWDI vs SPI-3), 0.69-0.71 (ESI vs VCI), 0.55-0.62 (ESI vs SPI-3), and 0.53-0.57 (VCI vs SPI-3). The drought prediction accuracy of each index according to error matrix analysis is as follows: 83.33-94.17% (EWDI), 70.00-91.67% (ESI), 47.50-85.00% (VCI), and 61.67-88.33% (SPI-3). Based on the results, the EWDI and ESI were found to be more accurate in capturing moderate drought conditions than the SPI at different geographical regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Arid regions are composite of complex structures. Desertification and land degradation of these arid regions need appropriate measures in accordance with time. Hyperspectral remote sensing data sets have high potential capabilities in estimating land degradation phenomenon. Imaging spectroscopy appears to be an emerging technology for the assessment of soil properties which directly influences land degradation. In this study, soil properties were studied from the arid region in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, India using low bandwidth data like Hyperion along visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared (350-2500 mu m) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spectral reflectance-based algorithms have been applied for the assessment of soil resources of arid regions. The results showed that sand, clay and organic matter content can be adequately estimated from linear models such as principal components and partial least square regression-based model over band reflectance derived from the ground observation and satellite imagery. This study might help in rapid assessment of soil properties in arid regions which might help us in periodic assessment of degradation over any region.

AB  - This paper presents the results of estimating land displacement of the areas after an earthquake by utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time-series images. We selected the nuclear power station in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, damaged by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, and the tsunami triggered by the earthquake. The still ongoing displacement of the areas, especially the underground frozen soil wall installed, should be quantitatively estimated. In usual, the displacement estimated by persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)[1,2] is obtained only in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction. We estimated three-dimensional displacement velocities by applying the least-squares method to the results from PSI and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. We used 13 and 17 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images acquired on the ascending and descending orbits, respectively in addition to the displacement data measured at 10 GPS stations. The obtained results show that local displacement is estimated, and the displacement along the frozen soil wall is different from the neighboring areas. Consequently, it was shown that combining PSI results and geodetic deformation measurements is effective for monitoring land subsidence.

AB  - To date, the results of the clinical trial of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) for endometrial cancer are not reported, and SNNS should be not yet performed as a clinical practice. SNNS is thought to be performed as a clinical trial in the institutions with enough experiences of SN mapping. Regarding the methods of the tracer injection and tracer detection, the diagnostic accuracy of metastasis, the clinical significance of ITC, or micrometastasis, the oncologic significance of solitary metastasis-positive sentinel lymph node (SN) in para-aortic basin, the usefulness of SN biopsy using surgical robots with fluorescence imaging system for detecting ICG, accumulations of clinical trials, and the data analysis in many facilities are needed so that SNNS comes to be safely performed as a clinical practice. Furthermore, the standardization of the diagnosing method for the pathological search for SN and the establishment of the molecular biologic laboratory procedure are necessary, too. However, we think SNNS will emerge as a promising, elegant solution to the ongoing discussion regarding lymphadenectomy in the initial surgical management of endometrial cancer in order to prevent many patients from receiving oversurgery, in order to properly select patients who need to receive lymphadenectomy, and in order to definitely evaluate the risk of recurrence by using ultra-staging or biological diagnosing method in the near future.

TI  - ORGANICITY OF THE PHENOMENON OF CULTURE AS AN EXPLICATION OF VITALITY
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The aim of the article is to clarify the content of the concept of culture as an explication of vitality within the philosophy of life and its further modifications in current problems of contemporary. The analysis performed standing from the point, that contrasting of nature and culture is irrelevant, since culture does not contradict natural determinants and patterns, but rather qualitatively alters them. So, are justified the idea of culture as a phenomenon that exist accordingly and in proportion to nature, need to form its potential and content and not contradict the axioms and values of life. Theoretical basis. In the theoretical field of philosophy of life, the local development of the problem of culture as an explication of vitality produces grounds for analytical and prognostic activity concerning meaningful transformations in a separate historical and social horizon. The fundamental categories of culture: spirit, value, symbol, freedom, justice and harmony receive the requested content and meaning. The idea of the constancy and super-naturality of cultural universals is illusory and dangerous. The consequences of such a "non-cosmological" justification of freedom and will, and the assertion of values, that contradict the logic of life, are the global environmental, economic and social crisis of our time. Originality. The originality of the authors' thought lies in the interpretation of the essence of culture as an explication of vitality, as a logical and natural extension of life. In this formulation of the problem of culture, the possibility of reconciling the natural, social and value determinants of human life is formed. Theorists of the philosophy of life substantiated the primacy and supremacy of the values of life over the values and meanings of culture. The position of authors position consists in the need to understand culture as an environmentally appropriate and dimensional phenomenon, the content and strategies of which are determined by a single ontology. Conclusions. The analysis let authors understand the voluntarily chaotic element of life. Culture in its philosophical analysis took on a clearer anthropomorphic dimension: the immanent logic of being in substantiating the essence and purpose of man and the value of his being localized the universe of transcendence in the concept of "living world", "inhabited space", "human, too human". Accordingly, the range of cultural evaluations has been polarized: from the approving statement of its vital essence, to the disparaging calls for its reform. The chaotic state of voluntarily acts is transformed into cultural codes and stereotypes by rationalization. The modern global nature of crisis phenomena, both in the worldview, in the social, and in the ecological dimension, requires reformatting the understanding of culture as a continuation of nature, and not its antipode.

TI  - Thermokarst and precipitation drive changes in the area of lakes and ponds in the National Parks of northwestern Alaska, 1984-2018
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and ponds are important ecosystem components in arctic lowlands, and they are prone to rapid changes in surface area by thermokarst expansion and by sudden lake drainage. The 30 m resolution Landsat record (1984-2018) was used to derive a record of changes in the area of lakes and ponds in the five National Parks of northern Alaska. Surface-water area declined significantly in portions of the study area with ice-rich permafros t and water bodies of thermokarst origin. These declines were associated with rapid lake drainage events resulting from the thermoerosion of outlets. Thermoerosion was probably favored by the record warm mean annual temperatures in the study area, combined with precipitation that fluctuated near long-term normals. The rate of lake loss by rapid drainage was greatest in 2005-2007 and 2018. In landscapes with permafrost of lower ice content and water bodies in depressions of non-thermokarst origin, surface-water area generally fluctuated in response to year-to-year changes in precipitation, without a long-term trend, and lake drainage events were rare. Loss of surface water in ice-rich lowlands is likely to continue as the climate warms, with associated impacts on aquatic wildlife.

AB  - Excessive energy consumption is of concern to the world today. One of the largest energy consumption through many sectors included supporting facilities is tourism. Bali is the most excellent tourism resort through the precious supporting facility. Modern and comport facility is more attractive now. Electricity supply becomes an issue. It is important to control the uses of excessive energy that emitted carbon and cost. The growth of electricity demands becomes on an exponential scale. In order to keep the sustainability of the environment, the existence of non-tourism industries relate is restrictive. Monitoring and active management energy patterns most effective rather than investing in renewable energy. This paper proposes a method to build community-based initiatives for reducing carbon emissions and saving energy by using nighttime satellite data. This paper consists of detail of procedural to obtain an index of radiance threshold class. The index has three criteria class; ambient, moderate and excessive. The radiance threshold class determined from cross-analysis of nighttime satellite data with light meter surveys through regression analysis. The histogram radiance distribution reveals the profile of the class criteria. The moderate class becomes key to attention. It can be used to reveal any aspect of spatial-temporal dynamical of urban cycle. This paper proposed a new method for assessing the uses of electricity by applying the satellite remote sensing technology.

AB  - Categorization of water bodies and land areas from the satellite image s performed since the prediction of satellite image has become a major challenging issue due to weather condition, atmosphere, etc. Previously, data mining is used for clustering in various application such as text data, similarities in images and bioinfonnatics data. In this paper, a novel approach has been designed by incorporating the PSO and DE algorithm for data mining technique in the satellite image. here feature extraction is carried out by using DWT, PCA, and GLCM techniques. In the proposed method, an optimized PSO-DE algorithm is designed to obtain the best solution in order to get the better satellite data. Finally, the estimated output is compared with the existing method on the bases of performances, and it is found to be efficient. The performance parameters such as PSNR, MSE, RMS, mean, variance, correlation, contrast, energy, homogeneity, SD, and entropy are evaluated for the Landsat and MODIS satellite images.

TI  - Land Cover Changes on Ambergris Caye, Belize: A Case Study of Unregulated Tourism Development
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring land-use, land-cover change in biodiverse, tropical countries is critical for conservation management and sustainable planning because it provides quantifiable data regarding broad environmental changes. This project uses Landsat satellite imagery to document vegetation cover change on Ambergris Caye, Belize, from 2000 to 2017. The close proximity of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System has made Ambergris Caye the most popular tourist destination and economic hub in Belize. As a result, the region has undergone intense commercial and residential development coupled with rapid population growth over the past two decades. Understanding general trends in landscape dynamics is critical for the natural resource-based tourism industry of Belize to continue to thrive. Unsupervised classification methods and a per pixel postclassification comparison were used with Landsat imagery to estimate loss in vegetation cover and increases in urban and barren land. The results indicate a 10.85 percent decrease in vegetation and a 39 percent increase in urban and barren land during the seventeen-year study period with an annual forest loss rate of 0.67 percent per year using a compound interest rate formula. The results of this analysis represent a baseline study of vegetation change on Ambergris Caye to inform management and conservation efforts.

M3  - Article
AB  - The incidence of primary cutaneous melanoma continues to increase each year. Melanoma accounts for the majority of skin cancererelated deaths, but treatment is usually curative following early detection of disease. In this American Academy of Dermatology clinical practice guideline, updated treatment recommendations are provided for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer stages 0-IIC and pathologic stage III by virtue of a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy). Biopsy techniques for a lesion that is clinically suggestive of melanoma are reviewed, as are recommendations for the histopathologic interpretation of cutaneous melanoma. The use of laboratory, molecular, and imaging tests is examined in the initial work-up of patients with newly diagnosed melanoma and for follow-up of asymptomatic patients. With regard to treatment of primary cutaneous melanoma, recommendations for surgical margins and the concepts of staged excision (including Mohs micrographic surgery) and nonsurgical treatments for melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type (including topical imiquimod and radiation therapy), are updated. The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy as a staging technique for cutaneous melanoma is described, with recommendations for its use in clinical practice. Finally, current data regarding pregnancy and melanoma, genetic testing for familial melanoma, and management of dermatologic toxicities related to novel targeted agents and immunotherapies for patients with advanced disease are summarized.

AB  - Period between 18 and 29 years of age, i.e. between adolescence and adulthood is defined by J. J. Arnett (2002) as a period of emerging adulthood. The young are no longer teenagers, but also mostly do not perceive themselves as adults. At this time, there is an intensive development of the identity of the young. It manifests itself in the area of worldview, social relations and work. The last of these areas of activity allows young person to test skills, discover new abilities and take responsibility for oneself and others, which gives the basis for formulating answers to the questions: Who am I, what is the meaning of my life, and therefore identity issues. The identity is characterized along with M. Berzonski (1989), who describes identity both in terms of structure (created by cognitive schemes), as well as the process of cognitive resources application in solving life problems. Processual notion of identity is strictly connected with identity style, which is defined as cognitive strategies and processes, used by the person to: make decisions, processing information compliant with self and shape the identity commitment (Berzonsky, Ferrari, 1996, Berzonsky 2003). Three styles of identity building were distinguished: informational, normative and diffusion-avoiding. Informative style, in comparison to the others, provides the subject with the best adaptation and further development.The aim of the presented study is to check the role that engagement of young people in voluntary work plays in the process of identity building. 76 people aged from 21 to 25 were examined, 36 of whom were involved in volunteering and the remaining 40 were not active. Identity Style Inventory ISI3 by M. Berzonsky was applied to the whole group. In accordance with the theory, the Identity Style Inventory consists of three scales corresponding to identity styles and one additional scale of 'Commitment'.A comparison of both groups in terms of the level of individual identity styles indicates a significantly higher level of informational identity style in volunteers. So, people who work selflessly in various support institutions build their own identity actively seeking knowledge about themselves. They are open to various information about themselves, even those that undermine their previous self-image. Similarly, volunteers revealed a significantly higher 'Commitment' score. This means that people who have undertaken a specific voluntary activity experience a sense and purpose of their actions stronger than their peers and have a stronger motivation to achieve their goals. In addition, the level of informational style increased when people involved were engaged in volunteering during more than one year. The results obtained show that involvement in volunteering can stimulate the development of identities of young people entering adulthood. And, consequently, in the process of education in the period of emerging adulthood opportunities for volunteer work should be created.

AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one important species in the tropospheric layer that has a contribution towards air quality. In urban areas in Indonesia, urbanization and growing industrial activities have increased rapidly, which may have affected tropospheric NO2. This study investigates the effect of green spaces and other environmental variables (e.g., temperature, city, distance from the equator) had on tropospheric NO2 in over thirty (30) urban areas in Indonesia between 2007 to 2016. Data on land cover were obtained from Google Earth's satellite imagery data, tropospheric NO2 readings came from Metop-A, and information on temperature was obtained from the Terra MODIS satellite. Our results show an annual decrease in green space over 10 years in all urban areas except Surabaya. Multiple linear regression analysis also reveals that a decline in vegetation decreases tropospheric NO2 significantly. Other influential environmental factors are surface temperature and distance to the equator. Despite a promising model being obtained from this study, adding variables is important to improve the forecasting.

TI  - Spectral-consistent relative radiometric normalization for multitemporal Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric normalization is a fundamental and important preprocessing method for remote sensing applications using multitemporal satellite images due to uncertainties of at-sensor radiances caused by different sun angles and atmospheric conditions. In case the atmospheric model and ground measurements are unavailable during data acquisitions, relative normalization is an alternative method which minimizes the radiometric differences among images without the requirement of additional information. The keys to a successful relative normalization are the selection of pseudo invariant features (PIFs) from bitemporal images and the regression of selected PIFs for transformation coefficient determination. Previous studies on transformation coefficient determination adopted band-by-band regression. These studies have obtained satisfactory normalization results; however, they have not fully considered the spectral inconsistency problem caused by individual band regression. To alleviate this problem, this study proposed a constrained orthogonal regression, which enforces pixel spectral signatures to be as consistent as possible during radiometric normalization while band regression quality is preserved. In addition, instead of selecting one of the input images as reference for radiometric transformation, a common radiometric level located between bitemporal images is selected as the reference to further reduce possible spectral inconsistency. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of several bitemporal images acquired by the Landsat 8 sensor were conducted to evaluate the proposed method with the measurements of spectral distance and similarity. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to related regression and radiometric normalization methods, in terms of spectral signature consistency.

AB  - Introduction: the article is devoted to the study of Khanty literature. The subject of the analysis is the image of a bear embodied in the artistic works of R. P. Rugin.Objective: to analyze the image of a bear, to identify its functions in the works of Khanty writer.Research materials: the legends in the literary study of R. P. Rugin, his poems, stories and novels with the image of a bear.Results and scientific novelty: the cult of a bear dates back to the ancient mythological consciousness of the ethnos. In the ethnographic literature, interpreting the cult of a bear, attention is focused on the similarity of a bear and a man. This view is confirmed in R. P. Rugin's prose. The writer repeatedly in his work refers to the image of the sacred animal.The image of a bear in R. P. Rugin's prose has particular importance. Through its image the writer introduces a reader to the worldview of the Khanty ethnos. The writer's appeal to the rites, signs, prohibitions reflects the respectful and regulated attitude of the people to the "younger brother". A bear in the works of R. P. Rugin is not just a minor hero. Its image becomes a mean of creation of the main character, his deep understanding.

Due to this destructive event, a post-earthquake damage map is needed for the first step of evacuation and mitigation plan. This study used Landsat-8 satellite images to classified using an artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The method used to generate the post-earthquake damage map was decorrelation method which then the result of the damage map will be compared to the field data. The conformity between ANN and SVM result was analyzed and shows the conformity of 85.83%. The result of post-earthquake damage is useful for assessing the distribution of seismic damage and mitigate damage in the future earthquake occurrence.

TI  - Comparison of unfiltered CERES radiances measured from the Aqua and S-NPP or JPSS1 satellites over closely matched sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF CLOUDS AND THE ATMOSPHERE XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIV, held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The focus of this paper is to introduce a novel strategy for comparison of unfiltered radiances in remote sensing devised for CERES scanners. The strategy is referred to as "matched sites targeting", in which CERES instruments scan at nadir along their respective collocated ground-tracks. This strategy is enabled by similarities in the Suomi-NPP (FM5)/JPSS1 (FM6) and Aqua (FM3) satellite orbits, and a special scan profile available for the CERES scanners. Comparison of collected data in this strategy is done at a footprint level between the instruments (FM5 and FM3 or FM6 and FM3) for specific scene types, determined by their "almost" coincidental ground-tracks. A far more stringent test of the measurement consistency is achieved as averages of 330 collocated nadir samples are compared. A comparison of comprehensive "all-sky" measurements is also included as a reference. Results of the unfiltered radiance comparison are based on ES8 or ERBE-like data product using Edition1 for FM5, Edition1-CV for FM6 and Edition4 for FM3; cloud coverage is verified using MODIS data available in SSFs product.

TI  - Monitoring the spatial range of forested areas in the reclaimed sites using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Presented research investigates the possibility of applying the newest, free available satellite images Sentinel-2 for the automation of land use/cover (LULC) mapping in reclaimed areas, mainly in the aspect of monitoring forested areas. The study was performed for the former sulphur mines: 'Machow' (871.7 ha of the dump area after the opencast strip mine) and 'Jeziorko' (216.5 ha of the afforested area after the borehole exploitation). These areas are characterized by a diverse terrain structure and vegetation cover as the result of reclamation. The applied directions of reclamation were agro-forestry for the Sulphur Mine `Machow' and forestry for the Sulphur Mine 'Jeziorko'. We verified whether processing of Sentinel-2 data allows for reliable LULC classification - mainly identification forested areas in relation to the LULC mapping prepared by manual vectorization of orthophotomaps. Obtained classification results for Sentinel-2 data were also compared to the results of Landsat 8 images processing. The results of Sentinel-2 images classification showed correct graphical representation of the LULC classes, especially forested areas, in the relation to the results of applied on-screen vectorization of aerial orthophotomaps - better than results of the Landsat 8 images processing. The area of the mail class 'Forests' as a result of classification Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images compared to the results of manual on-screen vectorization of the orthophomaps shows differences: 5.4% - Sentinel-2, 12.8% - Landsat 8 for Sulphur Mine 'Machow' and 1.8% - Sentinel-2, 8.8% - Landsat 8 for Sulphur Mine 'Jeziorko'. Research indicates the possibility of automation of LULC classification using Sentinel-2 images. It could be very useful for LULC changes monitoring in reclaimed areas, mainly in the aspect of forested areas mapping as a result of way of reclamation.

TI  - ON (QUASI-)GNOSTIC STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING COGNITIVE DISSONANCE. THE BULGARIAN CASE
T2  - STUDIA CERANEA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article poses a research question, important not only in the studies on (neo-)gnosticism, concerning the relationship between the gnostic strategies of interpreting the world (and especially its typical rules of classifying people, based on the externalization of evil) and the tendency to construct a figure of "hylic" as a person embodying evil, and thus "unworthy of life". In this context, the author is interested in the dynamics of the relationship between the religious worldview declared by the authors, the one they actually profess, and their attitude towards the so-called Jewish question. Bulgarian material, which is a case of a particular kind of aporia, cognitive dissonances emerging due to tension between the pressure of cultural stereotypes, pragmatic (economic), religious, parareligious and humanistic thinking, has been analyzed on the basis of post-secular thought. The investigator posits that Bulgarian culture, despite the "economic" anti-Semitism that exists within it, did not produce a figure of a Jew the hylic that absorbs all evil and that could be inscribed (as is the case in popular Polish culture, among others) in every troublesome local political and symbolic context.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - People most at risk of influenza complications are the elderly with impaired immunity. Clinical picture of influenza virus infection includes symptoms such as chills, increased body temperature, dry cough, chest pain, or dizziness as well as headaches and muscle aches. In the diagnosis of influenza, quick and effective tests are necessary. Sensitive diagnostic methods of molecular biology require more time, but the result firmly confirm or exclude the presence of the genetic material of influenza or other respiratory viruses. Influenza vaccination plays an important role in combating influenza infection. Unfortunately, the awareness of vaccination benefits is insufficient in Poland. In this study we demonstrate the results of examination of 4,507 people aged over 14 years toward the influenza infection in the epidemic season of 2017/18. Most of the confirmed infections were reported in older people aged over 65, a high-risk population group. A low percentage of the vaccinated population may affect an increased number of confirmed influenza viruses in the elderly. The findings demonstrate a need to increase awareness of vaccination benefits, which is particularly essential to avoid influenza infection in the elderly.

TI  - Seasonal to interannual predictability of oceanic net primary production inferred from satellite observations
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal to interannual predictions of ecosystem dynamics have the potential to improve the management of living marine resources. Prediction of oceanic net primary production (NPP), the foundation of marine food webs and the biological carbon pump, is particularly promising, with recent analysis suggesting that ecosystem feedback processes may lead to higher predictability of NPP at interannual scales than for physical variables like sea surface temperature (SST). Here, we assessed the potential predictability of oceanic NPP and SST across seasonal to interannual lead times using reduced dimension, linear dynamical spatio-temporal models (rDSTM). This approach combines empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis with vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling to simplify the analysis of spatio-temporal data. The rDSTMs were fitted to monthly NPP and SST anomalies derived from 20 years of remote sensing data (1997-2017), considering two alternative algorithms commonly used to estimate NPP (VGPM and Eppley-VGPM) and optimally analyzed SST fields (AVHRR OISST). The local decay of anomalies provided high predictability up to three months, and subsequent interactions with remote forcing significantly extended predictability beyond the initial anomaly decay. Indeed, interactions among spatial modes associated with the propagation of major climate modes, particularly the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), extended the predictability horizon above one year in some regions. Patterns of enhanced NPP predictability matched the location of oligotrophic gyres and transition regions between ocean biomes, where fluctuations in biome boundaries generate large biogeochemical perturbations that leave lasting imprints on NPP. In these areas, the predictability horizon for NPP was longer than for SST, although SST was more predictable over large areas of the equatorial and northeast Pacific. Our results support the potential for extending seasonal to interannual physical climate predictions to predict ocean productivity.

AB  - The Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) was launched on May 24, 2014, and it is operating very well in space more than 4.5 years. The designed mission life is five years as nominal operational phase and the target is over seven years since launch the satellite. The mission objectives of ALOS-2 are 1) disaster monitoring, 2) national land and infrastructure information, 3) cultivated area monitoring, and 4) global forest monitoring. To achieve the objectives, ALOS-2 carries on the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2), which is an active microwave radar using the 1.2 GHz frequency band and observes in day and night times even in bad weather conditions as successor PALSAR instrument onboard ALOS satellite operated from 2006 to 2011. PALSAR-2 instrument has several enhanced features from PALSAR e.g. finer spatial resolution, spotlight observing mode, dual-polarisation ScanSAR. This paper summarises an introduction of typical data analysis results for monitoring natural disasters by ALOS-2 during the operational phase. As the response natural disasters, more than 400 times of the emergency observations have been conducted to identify damages caused by volcanic activities, earthquakes, flooding etc. happened in Japan and the World.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the traditional worldview of the Sayan-Altai Turks, determined by their identification and a variety of ways of their positioning in the sacred space. The sacred and the profane are basic to any belief system. It should be noted that the space in the perception of traditional culture is heterogeneous and the object of the study in this article is the sacred space in the worldview of the Altai, Khakas and Tuvinian people. The task to allocate sacral loci from daily and household space is set.Some loci are more semantic than others. The allocation of space elements, their saturation with mythological semantics, either positive or negative, is determined by belonging to the earthly or other-worldly worlds. A special place is occupied by such binary oppositions as "sacred" - "ordinary", "own" - "alien", "developed"- "undeveloped", "East" - "West", "new moon" - "old moon", "day" - "night".

AB  - The anthropocene encountered ecological limitations. The Blade Runner worldview can be interpreted as a political and economic narrative that envisions a capitalist future. 『Blade Runner』(1982) and 『Blade Runner 2049』 (2017) are representative works of exploring future history of capitalism. Ridley Scott's science fiction film immersed the subject in 40 years. This is the story of Replicant, a heterogeneous human being, moving from a human to a producer, a consumer, and a manager. The settings that make up the film inherit the old questions of Marx and Schumpeter. This can be called extrapolation capitalist SF. Can capitalism flock to catastrophe evolve over time, adapting to its limitations? How is this concern related to today's Korean society? I would like to consider the meaning of this question by tracking the context of the blade runner economy around entrepreneurs, consumers and products.

TI  - Retrieval of soil salinity from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a widespread environmental hazard and the main causes of land degradation and desertification, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The first step in finding such a solution is providing accurate information about the severity and extent of the salinity spread in affected areas; this can be done by mapping the electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil. Utilizing the potential of high-resolution satellite imagery along with remote sensing techniques is a promising method to map salinity, as it allows for large-scale monitoring and provides high accuracy and efficiency. This paper, therefore, aims at assessing soil salinity by mapping the EC of soils, using satellite imagery from the newly launched Sentinel-2 satellite as well as Landsat-8 data. A field study was carried out using those data, and various salt features were extracted that relate the EC values of field samples to satellite-derived salt features. The study used two different regression approaches MLP and SVR. Additionally, two feature selection algorithms, GA and SFS, were implemented on the data to improve model performance. The study concludes that the proposed method for modeling salinity and the mapping of soil EC can be considered an effective approach for soil salinity monitoring.

T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: Wheat appropriate harvest date (WAHD) is an important factor in farm monitoring and harvest campaign schedule. Satellite remote sensing provides the possibility of continuous monitoring of large areas. In this study, we aimed to investigate the strength of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Landsat-8 for generating the harvest schedule regional (HSR) map using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a robust prediction tool in the agriculture sector.Area of study: Qorveh plain, Iran.Material and methods: During 2015 and 2016, a total of 100 plots was selected. WAHD was determined by sampling of plots and specifying wheat maximum yield for each plot. The strength of eight Landsat-8 derived spectral VIs (NDVI, SAVI, GreenNDVI, NDWI, EVI, EVI2, CVI and CIgreen) was investigated during wheat growth stages using correlation coefficients between these VIs and observed WAHD. The derived VIs from the required images were used as inputs of ANNs and WAHD was considered as output. Several ANN models were designed by combining various VIs data.Main results: The temporal stage in agreement with dough development stage had the highest correlation with WAHD. The optimum model for predicting WAHD was a Multi-Layer Perceptron model including one hidden layer with ten neurons in it when the inputs were NDVI, NDWI, and EVI2. To evaluate the difference between measured and predicted values of ANNs, MAE, RMSE, and R-2 were calculated. For the 3-10-1 topology, the value of R-2 was estimated 0.925. A HSR map was generated with RMSE of 0.86 days.Research highlights: Integrated satellite-derived VIs and ANNs is a novel and remarkable methodology to predict WAHD, optimize harvest campaign scheduling and farm management.

AB  - The "Advanced Optical Satellite" is a follow-on satellite of the optical sensors onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and is called "ALOS-3" in the series of land observing satellites launched by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). It will achieve approximately three times higher ground resolution of 0.8 m while keeping the wide swath of 70 km as compared with its preceding Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) onboard the ALOS. Though the sensor does not equip with multiple sensor-units which achieve the full-time along-track stereo observation like the PRISM, it will be able to acquire stereo imageries by using a large body-pointing capability within 60 degrees from nadir. The digital surface model (DSM) is expected to be processed from the stereo imageries as one of the high-level products in the ALOS-3 mission. This paper reports on a pre-launch simulation of the DSM generation from the ALOS-3 stereo imageries.

TI  - The Filial Piety Mountain: Kanno Hachiro and The Three Teachings
T2  - JAPAN REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the writings of Kanno Hachiro (1813-1888), a mid scale farmer from Fukushima, and argues that the binary between "religion" (shiikyd) and "morality" (dotoku) is of limited usefulness in comprehending his worldview. Hachiro wrote extensively on the virtue of filial piety (kO) and claimed that it represented the highest ideal of Confucianism, Shinto, and Buddhism. He expressed this through a diagram of what he called the Filial Piety Mountain (kOkozan), in which he depicted Confucianism, Shinto, and Buddhism as three paths leading toward the summit. Utilizing recent scholarship that has illuminated the modern origin of the category of "religion," this article highlights the absence of the dichotomy between "religion" and "morality's in Hachir5's writings and his conception of the Filial Piety Mountain. Just as an uncritical imposition of the category of "religion" on premodern sources can result in distortions, approaching HachirO's writings through the modern lens of "morality" or "conventional morality" (tsfizoku datoku) that is apart from "religion" can lead to an overly compartmentalized view of his thought. The article suggests an alternative approach through Ann Swidler's model of "cultural repertoire."

TI  - Brain metastases from cervical cancer reduce longevity independent of overall tumor burden.
T2  - Surgical neurology international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated brain metastasis (IBM) from cervical cancer is a very rare encounter in neurosurgery. We sought to understand how patients with isolated brain metastases differ from those with metastases in the setting of widespread disease.METHODS: A systematic review was completed using PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Patients with isolated brain metastases (IBM) and non-isolated brain metastases (NIBM, or brain metastases in the setting of disseminated disease), were compared. Two-sided statistical tests were used to determine significance. Survival function was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: A total of 89 patients, 25 with IBM and 64 with NIBM, were identified. The time interval between initial diagnosis of cervical cancer and diagnosis of brain lesion was significantly shorter in the IBM group (median 7.5 vs. 20.05 months, and IBM vs. NIBM, respectively; P = 0.006). Overall survival from initial diagnosis of cervical cancer was significantly shorter for the IBM group versus the NIBM group (7.63 vs. 26.3 months, respectively; P = 0.0005). Data demonstrate a 3.4-fold reduction of median life expectancy to 7.63 months. Survival after diagnosis of brain metastases did not differ between groups (median, IBM 7 months vs. NIBM 4 months, P = 0.08).CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest that for cervical cancer patients with brain metastasis intracranial metastasis itself (and not overall tumor burden) represent a sentinel event in limiting longevity. While the present study is underpowered to compare treatment options directly, further work should be focused on determining the optimal treatment for these patients.

TI  - Global Wind Speed and Wave Height Extremes Derived from Long-Duration Satellite Records
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of extreme-value analysis to long-duration (30 year) global altimeter and radiometer datasets is considered. In contrast to previous extreme-value analyses of satellite data, the dataset is sufficiently long to enable a peaks over threshold analysis to be undertaken. When applied to altimeter data for wind speed and significant wave height, this analysis produces values consistent with buoy validation data and previous numerical model reanalysis datasets. The spatial distributions produced are also consistent with the model reanalysis data. However, the altimeter data shows much greater finescale structure for wind speed, which is consistent with known tropical cyclone activity. The greater data density provided by radiometer measurements offers the potential to address altimeter undersampling. However, issues associated with the radiometer's inability to measure wind speed in heavy rain events appears to create an unacceptable fair weather bias at extreme wind speeds. This renders the radiometer data of wind speed largely unusable for the investigation of wind speed extremes. The study also clearly demonstrates the limitations of the initial distribution method for extreme-value analysis, which is heavily biased by mean conditions.

TI  - Sentinel node navigation surgery in esophageal cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF GASTROENTEROLOGICAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the last 20 years, the sentinel node (SN) concept has been widely applied to the surgical staging of both breast cancer and melanoma. However, the validity of this concept has been controversial for esophageal cancer, because SN mapping for esophageal cancer is not considered to be technically easy because of the complicated multidirectional lymphatic networks of the esophagus and mediastinum. Nevertheless, studies including meta-analyses indicated that SN mapping may be feasible in early esophageal cancer. Transthoracic esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy was developed as a potential curative procedure for thoracic esophageal cancer. However, this highly invasive procedure might increase morbidity and reduce patients' quality of life (QOL) after esophagectomy. Although further validation based on multicenter trials using the standard protocol of SN mapping for esophageal cancer is required, SN navigation surgery would enable us to carry out personalized and limited lymph node dissection which might reduce morbidity and maintain patients' QOL.

TI  - Risk factors for lymph node metastasis in non-sentinel node basins in early gastric cancer: sentinel node concept
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel node (SN) concept is being applied to early gastric cancer. However, when SNs are positive for metastasis, it is unclear how often LNs in other LN basins show metastasis. We aimed to investigate LN metastasis possibility in LN basins without SNs (non-SN basins). We determined risk factors for metastasis in non-SN basins and identified a prediction model for non-SN basin metastasis using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis.MethodsWe enrolled 550 patients who were diagnosed with cT1N0M0 or cT2N0M0 gastric cancer with a single lesion and underwent SN mapping. We adopted a dual-tracer method using a radioactive colloid and blue dye to detect SNs.ResultsOf all, 45 (8.2%) patients had SN metastasis; we divided them into two groups: LN metastasis positive and LN metastasis negative in non-SN basins. Univariate analysis showed that the groups differed significantly regarding lymphatic invasion (p=0.007), number of identified SNs (p=0.032), and macrometastasis in SN basins (p=0.005). The CART decision tree for predicting LN metastasis in non-SN basins had area under the curve value of 0.86. Moreover, there were significantly differences in cancer-specific survival (CSS) between the two groups (p=0.028).ConclusionsMacrometastasis in SN basins, lymphatic invasion, and number of identified SNs5 are risk factors for LN metastasis in non-SN basins among gastric cancer patients. We identified a prediction model with CART analysis; patients with macrometastasis in SN basins and lymphatic invasion were considered to be at the highest risk for LN metastasis.

AB  - The purpose of the research is to identify ethnic auto- and hetero-stereotypes in linguistic consciousness of the bearers of North Ossetic linguistic culture. Sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic approaches to the study of ethnic stereotypes, cognitive-discursive, and interpretational analysis are used in the research. The study of the phenomenon of ethnic consciousness involves the analysis of two levels - the level of community in general and the level of an individual. The article considers the basic features of auto- and hetero-stereotyping of an ethno-cultural type on the material of Internet blogs. The described ethnic stereotypes reflect archetypical "we-images" and "they-images", which serve as guidelines for communicative behavior. The authors proceed from the assumption that ethnic hetero-stereotypes are formed on the basis of those differentiating features that contribute to alienation between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups and subgroups. Ethnic stereotypes, as a rule, distort objective facts and overgrow with surreal layers, which exist separately from the real cognitive characteristics of an ethnos / sub-ethnos. This kind of stereotypes naturally carries ambivalent evaluation. The axiology of images verbalized in national consciousness of representatives of other linguistic and cultural communities or intra-ethnic groups not only captures their own worldview, but also reflects internal and external sociopolitical processes. This article contributes to intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic communication, conflict management and ethnolinguistics. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

AB  - The objective of this paper is to put forward a novel approach to detect the presence of icebergs from Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery obtained from Sentinel-1 radar imagery. Strategies like Image Augmentation are used to increase the sample size of the training data. Features are extracted from the image and important features are selected using the Decision Tree algorithm. Important features are used to train different statistical algorithms for classification like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN). A comparative study of performance of different models is used to select the best performing classification algorithm. The best performing model is validated with the test data to obtain accuracy.

AB  - Geothermal energy sources have a significant influence on renewable energy sources as an affordable and sustainable solution. The aim of this study was to identify geothermal sources at the Sarulla PLTP using remote sensing technology. The method of this study includes field surveys by obtaining hotspots and temperature values in geothermal sources, and identification of geothermal sources is determined by mapping of land use change (NDVI) and heat source distribution (LST). The results show vegetation area has been changed from 0,6 to 0,3, and the temperature value is increasing 25 degrees C to 28 degrees C in 2010 to 2018 over PLTP Sarulla. Negative correlation found between NDVI and LST. Surface changing over geothermal resources as an evidence of environment changes. The geothermal sources increase with the opening of land in the PLTP Sarulla. So the results of this study can be recommended to the public and the government.

TI  - Development of a flood water level estimation method using satellite images and a digital elevation model for the Mekong floodplain
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed a flood water level estimation method that only employs satellite images and a DEM. The method involves three steps: (1) discriminating flood areas and identifying clumps of each flood area, (2) extracting the edges of the identified flood area using a buffering technique, and (3) performing spatial interpolation to transform the extracted elevation to flood water levels. We compared the estimated flood water levels with the observed ones. The RMSE using the RADARSAT was 1.99 and 1.30 m at river and floodplain points, respectively, whereas the RMSE using the MODIS was 4.33 and 1.33 m at the river and floodplain points, respectively. Given that most errors are attributed to the DEM, the method exhibited good performance. Furthermore, the method reproduced the flow directions and flood water level changes during the flooding period. Thus, we demonstrated that the characteristics of flood inundation can be understood even when ground observation data cannot be obtained.

TI  - A comparative analysis of axillary nodal burden in ultrasound/biopsy positive axilla vs ultrasound negative sentinel lymph node biopsy positive axilla.
T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Comparative Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Axillary Ultrasound (AUS) is now performed as a protocol in every newly diagnosed breast cancer in most European countries. It is an inexpensive and sensitive tool in hands of a trained operator. All AUS negative patients undergo Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB), while AUS positive patients bypass SLNB and undergo axillary nodal clearance (ANC) as a standard protocol. We wish to analyse these two groups to see if ANC can be foregone in these patients.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To compare and analyse the axillary disease burden in early breast cancer patients, with positive axilla, detected by AUS+ Biopsy versus those patients with normal axillary ultrasound or negative axillary biopsy that underwent ANC due to positive SLNB.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent axillary lymph node clearance following histologically confirmed positive ultrasound (US) axilla (year 2009-2014) was performed and was compared with data collected for patients with USG negative but SLNB (OSNA- One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) positive axilla.RESULTS: Axillary clearances performed for positive US axilla yielded significantly more positive lymph nodes than SLNB/OSNA positive axilla (p =0.00496). These patients also had larger primary tumours (median 33mm versus 21mm, p =0.01242) of a higher grade. Almost half of the patients in AUS positive group (49%) had high axillary nodal burden (>4 LNs). This is in great contrast with AUS negative, SLNB/OSNA positive group where 82.7% of patients had <4 positive nodes with more than half patients (51.7%) having no further positive nodes in their final histopathology specimen.CONCLUSIONS: ANC should be a standard protocol in AUS positive patients as they invariably have high axillary disease burden while ANC can be omitted in case of select AUS negative and SLNB patients. However, further studies with more subjects may be require to substantiate the findings.

AB  - In this paper, radiometric cross-calibration of Ziyuan-3 Satellite was conducted at the homogeneous field test site in August 2015, using GF1 satellite and Landsat-8. The test site was chosen at Dunhuang site, which has been used for vicarious calibration for Chinese Satellite since 1990s. The radiometric cross-calibration of ZY3, GF1 and Landsat-8 was performed by the simultaneously observation of the three satellites on August 15, 2015. In this study, three calibration coefficients from various methods were compared and analyzed. This paper reveals that the cross-calibration of the ZY3 satellite using GF1 PMS sensor is better than using GF1 WFV sensor. The best result is the cross-calibration coefficient using Landsat-8 OLI, which is consistent with the calibration coefficient of the reflectance-based vicarious calibration method in Dunhuang. The validation results show the accuracy of the cross-calibration for ZY3 sensor using GF1 PMS and Landsat-8 OLI is less than 4% and 2%,respectively. This study can supply reference to the radiometric cross-calibration of Chinese satellite senor, and the results suggest that the radiometric cross-calibration coefficients can be useful for maintaining the quantitative application.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study integrated multi-temporal Landsat images, the Markov-Cellular Automation (CA) model, and socioeconomic factors to analyze the historical and future farmland loss in the Delhi metropolitan area, one of the most rapidly urbanized areas in the world. Accordingly, the major objectives of this study were: (1) to classify the land use and land cover (LULC) map using multi-temporal Landsat images from 1994 to 2014; (2) to develop and calibrate the Markov-CA model based on the Markov transition probabilities of LULC classes, the CA diffusion factor, and other ancillary factors; and (3) to analyze and compare the past loss of farmland and predict the future loss of farmland in relation to rapid urban expansion from the year 1995 to 2030. The predicted results indicated the high accuracy of the Markov-CA model, with an overall accuracy of 0.75 and Kappa value of 0.59. The predicted results showed that urban expansion is likely to continue to the year of 2030, though the rate of increase will slow down from the year 2020. The area of farmland has decreased and will continue to decrease at a relatively stable rate. The Markov-CA model provided a better understanding of the past, current, and future trends of LULC change, with farmland loss being a typical change in this region. The predicted result will help planners to develop suitable government policies to guide sustainable urban development in Delhi, India.

TI  - A re-examination of two methods for estimating daily evapotranspiration from remotely sensed instantaneous observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The significance of estimating land surface evapotranspiration (ET) has been widely recognized in the fields of hydrology, meteorology, agriculture, and global change. This article compares two ET conversion methods, the constant decoupling factor () method and the constant reference evaporative fraction (EFr) method, that estimate daily ETs from instantaneous values. The daily ET was estimated either by (1) summing multiple half-hourly or hourly ET estimates that were derived through an application of the two ET conversion methods to half-hourly or hourly meteorological variables (i.e. aggregating the ET outputs) or by (2) directly applying the two ET conversion methods to daily meteorological variables (i.e. aggregating the meteorological inputs). The comparison was made using ground-based eddy covariance (EC) system measurements and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based latent heat flux (LE) datasets collected from April 2009 to late October 2011 at the Yucheng station over the North China Plain. The results show that both the constant method and the constant EFr method produced daily latent evaporation (LE) estimates that were in agreement with the ground-based EC measurements. When the two methods were applied to the MODIS-based LE datasets that have a small bias of -8Wm(-2) and an root mean square error (RMSE) <60Wm(-2), the validation results of the estimated daily LE against the ground-based EC measurements showed a relative bias of <7% and a relative RMSE of <20%. For both ET conversion methods, aggregating the ET outputs produced better agreement with the ground-based EC measurements than directly obtaining the daily ET by aggregating the meteorological inputs did. No significant difference was observed in the model performance between the constant method and the constant EFr method.

TI  - VALUATION OF WETLAND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN RAPIDLY URBANIZING REGION: A CASE STUDY OF THE NANJING JIANGBEI NEW AREA, CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are considered as one of the most important ecosystems on the Earth. Rapidly urbanizing, being an intense way of human activities, has brought significant impact on the ecological functions of urban wetlands. This study focused on the urban wetland ecosystem in the Nanjing Jiangbei New Area, China, and presented a dynamic integrated approach to assess the monetized value of its services. A classification decision tree model was adopted to interpret the Landsat TM/ETM/OLI images to obtain the LUCC data of urban wetlands in different years. Then an integrated approach was employed to correct the equivalent values and their prices of various ecosystem services, dynamically evaluating the value of wetland ecosystem services. The results showed that the overall value of the wetland ecosystem services of the Jiangbei New Area was 893.99 million USD, 1365.63 million USD and 1016.46 million USD in 2002, 2009 and 2015, respectively. Among the service categories, the regulating service reaches the most and the provisioning service contributes the least to the total value. According to the analysis of annual valuation results, it was inevitable that the ecological conditions of wetlands in the rapidly urbanizing area would deteriorate and the capability to provide ecosystem services would degenerate. This research suggests that rapid urban development should adopt an ecosystem service oriented strategy to align sustainable utilization with conservation and to recognize the interaction between the wetland ecosystem services and the forces of urbanization.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - It is always challenging to acquire satellite sensor data with both fine spatial and fine temporal resolution, especially for monitoring at global scales. Amongst the widely used global monitoring satellites, Landsat sensor data have a coarse temporal resolution, but fine spatial resolution, while MODIS sensor data have fine temporal resolution, but coarse spatial resolution. One solution to this problem is to blend the two types of data using spatio-temporal fusion, creating images with both fine temporal and fine spatial resolution. Reliable geometric registration of images acquired by different sensors is a prerequisite of spatio-temporal fusion. Due to the potentially large differences between the spatial resolutions of images to be fused, the geometric registration process always contains some degree of uncertainty. This paper analyzes quantitatively the influence of geometric registration error on spatio-temporal fusion. The relationship between registration error and the accuracy of fusion was investigated under the influence of different temporal distances between images, different spatial patterns within the images and using different methods.

AB  - While the Afrocentric Worldview is established with elements of interdependence, communalism, and kinship at its foundation, many Afro (of Africandescent) and African-American scholars within social science/helping-fields, such as psychology, have come to view "alternative" sexual orientations (i.e., homosexuality or bisexuality) as functional or dysfunctional solutions to problems existing in Black America. Afrocentric Worldviews include key concepts of racial and cultural survival thrusts. We must examine the marginalized subgroup of Black Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans-, and Queer (LGBTQ) individuals navigating through higher education, especially those within the Afrocentric-driven fields, such as psychology, at a Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCUs). This chapter discusses (1) several theoretical concepts that guide driving philosophies and academic curricula, (2) possible ramifications and experiences Black LGBTQ scholars face as they navigate through such educational contexts and (3) possible stances gay and straight scholars may take when operating under a paradigm/worldview with views that may seem counter to "alternative" sexual orientations.

TI  - DETECTING AND PREDICTING THE IMPACT OF URBAN PLANNING ON LAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGE IN ASHI RIVER WATERSHED, CHINA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing demand for sources of clean water and changing land use and land cover (LULC) practices threatens water resources globally. LULC change impacts negatively on watershed hydrological regime and water quality. Addressing this issue requires best practices to sustainable watershed management with in-depth information on LULC characteristics. This information can be produced by analyzing the status of LULC change and predicting future LULC status under different scenarios at watershed scale. This study therefore, analyzes the LULC in Ashi river watershed of China, from 1990 to 2014. Using Landsat images, LULC change pattern was evaluated through supervised and unsupervised classification concept. Markov-Cellular Automata integrated approach was used to predict LULC distribution of 2014 and authenticated with the actual LULC map of 2014. The results revealed urban, water, agriculture, open canopy and other vegetation experienced an increment from 1990 to 2014 by 227%, 267%, 10%, 63% and 260% respectively, with urban and agriculture showing consistency in increasing trend and a decline in closed canopy forest area by 79%. The predicted LULC for 2030 based on worst-case scenarios indicated more urbanization and agriculture with a potential for expansion to areas near streams and forest, while on best-case scenario indicates a controlled expansion trend of urban and agriculture along the streams and regeneration of closed canopy along the main streams. This study throws an insight for successful implementation of current and future water control program of the Ashi River, as well a guide to other studies aimed at proactive water resource management.

TI  - Unravelling compulsory happiness in exile: Cristina Peri Rossi's <i>The Ship of Fools</i>
T2  - FEMINIST THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of feminist critics of Latin American women writers in exile have suggested that women in exile may flourish as they are freed from the traditional gender restrictions imposed on them in their home countries. In this article I reexamine the association of exile with liberation through analysing Cristina Peri Rossi's 1984 novel La nave de los locos (The Ship of Fools) in the light of the tension between Rosi Braidotti's Deleuzian affirmation of feminism as a 'joyful nomadic force' (1994: 8) and Sara Ahmed's critique of compulsory happiness (2010). Peri Rossi juxtaposes the prescriptive worldview of the captivating medieval 'Tapestry of the Creation' in the Cathedral of Girona in Catalonia, which depicts the Biblical story of Genesis, and the diasporic and unpredictable wanderings of the protagonist Ecks on his journey to feminist enlightenment. I argue that while the novel seems to champion nomadic subjectivity, it also highlights the deceptive charm of imperative positive affect that may function as a disciplinary force, compelling subjects to follow a conventional path in life, and invalidating those who 'stray' from it. My reading of the novel calls for a nuanced approach to exile and diaspora that takes into account wider questions of the privilege and ease of movement - or, indeed, settling - enjoyed by or denied to various subjects.

TI  - Emerging role of sentinel lymph node mapping for gynecologic oncology in the new era
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This study aims to update a review of the recent literature on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in common gynecological cancer. Fifty-eight published English-language articles were obtained. Most of the well-designed studies were conducted in the patient with vulvar, endometrial, and cervical cancer, but SLNB data in ovarian cancer is limited. The result of diagnostic accuracy reported a satisfactory with a high detection rate, a high sensitivity, and an acceptable febrile neutropenia (FN) rate in all cancer types. The technique of SLNB in vulvar prefers combined radiocolloid and dye methods. The common technique in endometrial and cervical cancer is laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery with cervical indocyanine green (ICG) injection injection while laparotomy is the most frequently used in studies of ovarian cancer. This evidence supports that SLN mapping could replace the traditional lymphadenectomy in early-stage vulvar, endometrial, and cervical cancer. The result of feasibility and efficacy of this procedure in ovarian cancer is promising but more studies are required.

M3  - Article
AB  - The authors review the controversial issues regarding the management algorithms, the impact of ultrastaging to adjuvant treatment, and outcomes from the role of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in endometrial cancer (EC) and cervical cancer (CC). According to standard recommendation, side specific nodal resection is required in case of failed mapping. Alternative algorithms were proposed to reduce overtreatment in low risk EC and CC. The positive results of new algorithms may lead to a proper selection of patients in which pelvic lymphadenectomy could be avoided. Ultrastaging had an impact on accuracy by increasing the detection rate by 25-50%. Occult LN metastasis was associated with myometrial invasion in EC, but the relationships between other known factors of CC recurrence are unclear. Prognosis for the patient with either EC or CC in SLN algorithm group was similar to those in the lymphadenectomy group while the latter group had shown a higher surgical morbidity.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of Atmospheric Ammonia Columns over the Indo-Gangetic Plain by Exploiting Satellite Observations
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was aimed at presenting a continuous and spatially coherent picture of ammonia (NH3) distribution over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) by exploiting satellite observations. Atmospheric columns of ammonia were mapped over South Asia by using TES observations on board NASA's Aura satellite. Monthly mean data were used to identify emission sources of atmospheric ammonia across the South Asian region. Data were analysed to explore temporal trends, seasonal cycles, and hot spots of atmospheric ammonia within the study area. The results show that the IGP region has the most ammonia concentrations in terms of column densities, and hence this region has been identified as an ammonia hot spot. This is attributed majorly to extensive agricultural activity. Time series showed a slight increase in ammonia column densities over the study area from 2004 to 2011. Different seasonal cycles were identified across the IGP region with maximum NH3 columns observed during the month of July in most of the subregions. Seasonality in an ammonia column is driven by different cropping patterns and meteorological conditions in the IGP subregions. Global emission inventories of atmospheric ammonia were largely overestimating as compared to satellite observations.

T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing technology has been a useful tool for mapping and characterizing forest cover types and species composition, providing valuable information for effective forest management. This study investigates the application of a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to separate local forest communities at Huntington Wildlife Forest (HWF), located in New York State of the United States, into deciduous, mixed/coniferous and nonforests using Landsat TM imagery. Overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy and kappa coefficient of agreement are employed to assess the performance of the proposed method. Its overall effectiveness is supported by the accuracy of 80.41% and kappa coefficient of 0.56, and its capability of separating the forest cover types is endorsed by the class-wise accuracy measures. This method shows advantages in its limited demands for input features, that only multi-temporal NDVI indices are required; and in its simple and efficient mechanism, which refers to threshold optimization and feature selection.

TI  - Using the Bayesian Network to Map Large-Scale Cropping Intensity by Fusing Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global food demand will increase over the next few decades, and sustainable agricultural intensification on current cropland may be a preferred option to meet this demand. Mapping cropping intensity with remote sensing data is of great importance for agricultural production, food security, and agricultural sustainability in the context of global climate change. However, there are some challenges in large-scale cropping intensity mapping. First, existing indicators are too coarse, and fine indicators for measuring cropping intensity are lacking. Second, the regional, intra-class variations detected in time-series remote sensing data across vast areas represent environment-related clusters for each cropping intensity level. However, few existing studies have taken into account the intra-class variations caused by varied crop patterns, crop phenology, and geographical differentiation. In this research, we first presented a new definition, a normalized cropping intensity index (CII), to quantify cropping intensity precisely. We then proposed a Bayesian network model fusing prior knowledge (BNPK) to address the issue of intra-class variations when mapping CII over large areas. This method can fuse regional differentiation factors as prior knowledge into the model to reduce the uncertainty. Experiments on five sample areas covering the main grain-producing areas of mainland China proved the effectiveness of the model. Our research proposes the framework of obtain a CII map with both a finer spatial resolution and a fine temporal resolution at a national scale.

AB  - The contest against electromagnetic spectrum are making the electromagnetic environment more and more congested. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) requires larger bandwidth to obtain finer resolution, and thus inevitably affected by radio emitters sharing the same frequency band. Most of the radio frequency interference (RFI) originated from the terrestrial emitters, while there are also rare cases with interfering signals from space-borne satellites. In this paper, we analyzed the mechanism of terrain scattered interference (TSI) from space-borne RFI sources, and provide a case study of the interference signatures in Sentinel-1 data.

AB  - Cover crop is an agriculture operation that is planted during the winter and owns several advantages such as improving water quality and soil quality. However, the large-scale effect of cover crop in relieving environmental burden and improving cash crop yield over a region has not been widely investigated. Due to cost and time limitation, it is not favorable to conduct the conventional field trials. Previous study proposed a Random Forest classifier to predict the pattern of cover crop adoption from the remote sensing data. In this study, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron neural network to further improve the performance and reliability of the classification model and achieve an accuracy of 0.93 and Cohen's Kappa of 0.76. Moreover, the Multilayer Perceptron model outperforms two baseline classification models. Finally, we predict the cover crop planting status for the Knox County and found a significant increase in cover crop planting on the corn cropland in 2016.

M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution Earth observation imagery is considered desirable for many scientific and commercial applications. Given repeat multi-angle imagery, an imaging instrument with a specified spatial resolution, we can use image processing and deep learning techniques to enhance the spatial resolution. In this paper, we introduce the University College London (UCL) MAGiGAN super-resolution restoration (SRR) system based on multi-angle feature restoration and deep SRR networks. We explore the application of MAGiGAN SRR to a set of 9 MISR red band images (275 m) to produce up to a factor of 3.75 times resolution enhancement. We show SRR results over four different test sites containing different types of image content including urban and rural targets, sea ice and a cloud field. Different image metrics are introduced to assess the overall SRR performance, and these are employed to compare the SRR results with the original MISR input images and higher resolution Landsat images, where available. Significant resolution improvement over various types of image content is demonstrated and the potential of SRR for different scientific application is discussed.

TI  - <i>Ailanthus altissima</i> mapping from multi-temporal very high resolution satellite images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the results of multi-seasonal WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite images classification for the mapping of Ailanthus altissima (A. altissima), an invasive plant species thriving in a protected grassland area of Southern Italy. The technique used relied on a two-stage hybrid classification process: the first stage applied a knowledge-driven learning scheme to provide a land cover map (LC), including deciduous vegetation and other classes, without the need of reference training data; the second stage exploited a data-driven classification to: (i) discriminate pixels of the invasive species found within the deciduous vegetation layer of the LC map; (ii) determine the most favourable seasons for such recognition. In the second stage, when a traditional Maximum Likelihood classifier was used, the results obtained with multi-temporal July and October WV-2 images, showed an output Overall Accuracy (OA) value of approximate to 91%. To increase such a value, first a low-pass median filtering was used with a resulting OA of 99.2%, then, a Support Vector Machine classifier was applied obtaining the best A. altissima User's Accuracy (UA) and OA values of 82.47% and 97.96%, respectively, without any filtering. When instead of the full multi-spectral bands set some spectral vegetation indices computed from the same months were used the UA and OA values decreased. The findings reported suggest that multi-temporal, very high resolution satellite imagery can be effective for A. altissima mapping, especially when airborne hyperspectral data are unavailable. Since training data are required only in the second stage to discriminate A. altissima from other deciduous plants, the use of the first stage LC mapping as pre-filter can render the hybrid technique proposed cost and time effective. Multi-temporal VHR data and the hybrid system suggested may offer new opportunities for invasive plant monitoring and follow up of management decision.

The determination of the threat of erosion degradation of arable lands and landscape diversity was performed on the territory of two administrative districts with high level of ploughness of agrolandscapes, intense agrarian production and manifestation of erosion degradation of lands. Results. Inadequacy of the traditional system of agroecological monitoring was determined. It was proven that it was reasonable to have comprehensive application of satellite data regarding climate warming within the natural climatic zones and its impact on vegetation according to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), erosion degradation of soils and landscape diversity. According to satellite data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the correlation analysis was performed on the connection between the dynamics of the sum of effective temperatures and the sum of NDVI values for the vegetation period. There was positive impact of climate warming on vegetation state according to NDVI index in the zone of Polissia and Forest-Steppe. The correlation coefficients were R = 0.64 and R = 0.77 respectively. In the Steppe zone the correlation coefficient dropped down to R = 0.35 which demonstrated the elevated risk of droughts. Conclusions. Satellite data of Sentinel-1 were used to determine critical zones of erosion degradation of amble lands, requiring preservation and their inclusion to the natural fields, which had a positive impact on the optimization of agrolandscape diversity.

AB  - The problem of reconstruction of the Earth surface reflection coefficients from satellite data with allowance for radiation polarization is considered. Previously it was shown that in the process of atmospheric correction, optical-geometrical conditions may arise under which the allowance for radiation polarization is essential. In the present paper, the program complex for atmospheric correction of satellite images has been developed that takes into account radiation polarization. It has been used to process the Earth surface images recorded by the MODIS device.

AB  - On the basis of the concept of "Christian realism" in the works of F. M. Dostoevsky and V. F. Odoevsky the article deals with the biologizing and sociologizing concepts of the human nature since the Enlightenment and their connection with the fragmentation of the completeness and integrity of this nature, its complexity and inconsistency, with the descensive processes in the spiritual and moral world of people and entropy trends in the course of history. It is shown how spiritual laws, that go beyond the field of view of the rationalistic and pragmatic consciousness, transform the social and progressive engineering and planning, bring nihilistic elements into them. It is emphasized that the methodology of Christian realism is universal, associates the "mystery of man" with the mystery of history and becomes one of the fundamental principles for assessing the hierarchy of values in various worldview, ideological and social systems for the disclosure ascending and descending processes in them, the analysis of the elements of utopianism and social Darwinism.

AB  - Digital elevation models represent the three-imensional surface over the terrain. In the modern age, DEMs established its strong importance in terrain analysis due to its wide range of applications. In the landscape analysis, especially in delineating watershed boundaries DEMs plays a key role. DEMs are generated through different sources such as PCD LiDAR DEM (1m), CARTOSAT (5m) of Indian Space Research Organization and ALOS/PALSAR (12m) are utilized in the present study to delineated watershed boundaries in the Feather River, California. The present study demonstrates the accuracy of automatically generated watershed networks from DEM of different sources. In order to characterize the watershed parameters extracted from different DEMs, hydro-enforcement technique is carried out ArcHydro tool extension in the ArcGIS. Drainage network acquired through toposheet are used as reference to cross check the accuracy of DEMs generated drainage networks. The results suggest that 1m LiDAR DEM generated best, detailed and most accurate hydro-enforced DEMs while other low resolution DEMs generate reasonably drainage networks.

TI  - Daily River Discharge Estimates by Merging Satellite Optical Sensors and Radar Altimetry Through Artificial Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thanks to the large number of satellites, the multi-mission approach is becoming a viable method to integrate measurements and intensify the number of samples in space and time for monitoring the earth system. In this paper, we merged data from different satellite missions, optical sensors, and altimetry, for estimating daily river discharge through the application of the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. ANN was selected among other retrieval techniques because it offers an easy but effective way of combining input data from different sources into the same retrieval algorithm. The network is trained in a calibration period and validated in an independent period against in situ observations of river discharge for two gauging sites: Lokoja along the Niger River and Pontelagoscuro along the Po River. For optical sensors, we found that the temporal resolution is more important than the spatial resolution for obtaining accurate discharge estimates. Our results show that Landsat fails in the estimation of extreme events by missing most of the peak values due to its long revisit time (14-16 days). Better performances are obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. Radar altimetry provides results in between MODIS-TERRA and MODIS-AQUA at Lokoja, whereas it outperforms all single optical sensors at Pontelagoscuro. The multimission approach, involving optical sensors and altimetry, is found the most reliable tool to estimate river discharge with a relative root-mean-square error of 0.12% and 0.27% and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.98 and 0.83 for the Niger and Po rivers, respectively.

AB  - The international community has recently agreed on the need to address global challenges related to environmental degradation, climate change, poverty, inequality, prosperity, and peace and justice. The United Nations Agenda 2030 sets 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are monitored through 169 societal targets and 232 Indicators that should be accomplished till 2030, in order to ensure sustainability of the systems and the resources for the future generations.Monitoring of this progress can be implemented through the concept of the Essential Variables (EVs) defined as the minimum set of variables required to characterize a change of a system. Remote Sensing, providing multi-scale, multispectral and multi-temporal wide coverage of earth's surface, can facilitate the monitoring of EVs trends over space and time.While global initiatives and research projects are currently work on streamlining the use of remote sensing data to the SDGs and EVs monitoring process, challenges exist on the identification and the selection of the proper variables and Indicators as well as on the efficient processing of large data volumes delivering robust and comprehensible information to policy makers and managers.This study serves as a pilot for the use of EVs quantifying changes in two Indicators of SDGs over terrestrial (SDG 15) and marine ecosystems (SDG 6). Two different Mediterranean sites are selected, and a process based on multi-temporal datasets of freely available satellite imagery is used in order to identify the trends for the selected Indicators.

T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Tin mining is one of the main sectors of the national economy where the Bangka Regency is the largest tin producer in Indonesia. However, this sector cannot be separated from the pros and cons for a long time. In a way, this sector can increase both national and regional income but on the other side, the adverse effects of it can threaten the survival of humans and the environment. Open tin mining activity has converted previously vegetated land cover become the non-vegetated land cover. Furthermore, the land cover changes to the mining area have a major impact on global warming which has become an international issue in the past few decades. This research aims to map and measuring land cover changes especially from vegetated to non-vegetated land cover related to tin mining activity in Bangka Regency. This research using multi temporal Landsat imagery data acquisition in the year 2004 (Landsat 5 TM) and 2017 (Landsat 8 OLI) through digital image processing using Maximum Likelihood Classifier method. Previously, the image as a classification input through relative radiometric normalization. The result shows that tin mining activity in Bangka regency for thirteen years causes an area reduction in vegetated land cover. These results are expected to be an important input in policymaking for local governments to support the action plan which leads to mitigation of climate change.

TI  - Efficient Time-Domain Back-Projection focusing core for the image formation of very high resolution and highly squinted SAR Spotlight data on scenes with strong topography variation
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The upcoming Earth Observation satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions offer sensing capabilities that imply an increasing complexity of the image formation process. Among the major innovations, the ultra-high resolution Spotlight acquisition, performed exploiting long integration time with steering schemas with a wide range of angles obtained through innovative hardware design; more satellite agility is also essential to acquire wider areas even in near-contiguous frames within a reduced time period, addressed by Spotlight squinted geometry obtained through both fast and precise attitude maneuvers and electronic antenna steering. It is worth stating that the acquisition of high resolution squinted spotlight scenes, especially in the case of terrains with strong topography variation, could result in a significant degradation of the SAR data focusing performance, mostly for the algorithms working in the Fourier-domain.Considering the challenging scenario described above, this article aims at presenting a new accurate and efficient Spotlight image formation algorithm that uses a focusing core implemented in the time-domain, where the precise accommodation of high topography variations can be easily handled working on pixel basis. The proposed solution has actually a hybrid design: the focusing of the signal in across-track direction uses a frequency-domain approach, while in the along-track direction the focusing is performed in the time-domain. The focusing core of the signal in the azimuth direction uses a Back-Projection approach, which allows to obtain excellent performances where the traditional algorithms in the frequency-domain can have severe limitations, but it will dramatically worsen the temporal performance making the processing algorithm generally not suitable for operational purposes. For this reason, a sub-aperture processing optimization has been proposed that guarantees significant efficiency improvements primarily for not squinted images and takes into account further considerations in order to obtain a comparable reduction of the computational complexity when applied to data representative of highly squinted geometry.The combination of the described techniques together with the increasing hardware computational power, will allow for a new generation of time-domain focusing algorithms to be implemented in the real world operational scenarios.The performance of the algorithm have been verified and validated mainly by simulation. The accurate Impulse Response Function (IRF) has been measured on a simulated dataset of very high resolution SAR X-Band Spotlight data with squinted and not squinted geometry, with point targets placed at different altitudes using different schemes of topography.The solution has finally been verified on real data from the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) mission, acquired in the Spotlight Enhanced mode. These high quality X-Band SAR data allow verifying the behavior of the algorithm in terms of performance and stability of the focusing core in a real world scenario. The computational burden of the proposed solution vs its processing execution time has also been assessed.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article

AB  - Monitoring vegetation structure and functioning is critical for modelling terrestrial ecosystems and energy cycles. Leaf area index (LAI) is an important structural property of vegetation used in many land-surface, climate, and forest monitoring applications. Remote sensing provides a unique way to obtain estimates of leaf area index at spatially extensive areas. However, the analysis and extraction of quantitative information from remotely-sensed data require accurate cross-calibration with in situ forest measurements, which are generally spatially- and temporally-limited, thereby limiting the ability to compare the seasonal dynamic patterns between field and remotely-sensed time series. This is particularly relevant in temperate broadleaved forests, which are characterized by high level of complexity, which can complicate the retrieval of vegetation attributes from remotely-sensed data.In this study, we performed a long-term comparison of MODIS LAI products with continuous in situ leaf area index measurements collected monthly in temperate and Mediterranean forests from 2000 to 2016. Results indicated that LAI showed a good correlation between satellite and ground data for most of the stands, and the pattern in seasonal changes were highly overlapping between the timeseries. We conclude that MODIS LAI data are suitable for phenological application and for up-scaling LAI from the stand level to larger scales.

AB  - Development across Europe is uneven. This inequality finds its expression e.g. in different settlement pattern characteristics. We assume that increased settlement concentration reflects economic benefits. For capturing these patterns across the continent, we analyze a binary settlement map derived from Earth observation data. From it, we detect urban nodes as anchor points of urban densification. We identify a network of cities when conjugation lines between these urban nodes feature high settlement density. Further, we map regions around connected urban nodes with high settlement densities. We assume that these identified regions belonging to a network of cities express beneficial economic development. We test this hypothesis by assigning the economic indicators 'gross domestic product', 'unemployment rate', and `household income per inhabitant' from Eurostat data sets to the identified regions belonging to a city network. We find economic advantages of these city network regions over other European regions.

AB  - The information from band extraction and calculation of indices which are used for classification imagery of Landsat 8 satellite data using unsupervised methods were studied. The visible and Near Infrared (NIR) bands of Landsat 8 satellite were used to derive Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) image. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is a satellite-derived index from the NIR and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands. Vegetation, non-vegetation, and water features classes were then analyzed by classification experiment of three unsupervised methods: ISODATA, K-means, and fuzzy c-means with guidance of ground truth information of the study area. The accuracy of the classified image is then assessed using a confusion matrix where classification accuracy and kappa coefficient are computed. The result shows that unsupervised methods classification is able to classify the Landsat 8 satellite data with FCM got a high accuracy compared to another two methods.

TI  - Comparison of Methods to Estimate Lake-Surface-Water Temperature Using Landsat 7 ETM+ and MODIS Imagery: Case Study of a Large Shallow Subtropical Lake in Southern Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water temperature regulates many processes in lakes; therefore, evaluating it is essential to understand its ecological status and functioning, and to comprehend the impact of climate change. Although few studies assessed the accuracy of individual sensors in estimating lake-surface-water temperature (LSWT), comparative analysis considering different sensors is still needed. This study evaluated the performance of two thermal sensors, MODIS and Landsat 7 ETM+, and used Landsat methods to estimate the SWT of a large subtropical lake. MODIS products MOD11 LST and MOD28 SST were used for comparison. For the Landsat images, the radiative transfer equation (RTE), using NASA's Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (AtmCorr) parameters, was compared with the single-channel algorithm in different approaches. Our results showed that MOD11 obtained the highest accuracy (RMSE of 1.05 C), and is the recommended product for LSWT studies. For Landsat-derived SWT, AtmCorr obtained the highest accuracy (RMSE of 1.07 C) and is the recommended method for small lakes. Sensitivity analysis showed that Landsat-derived LSWT using the RTE is very sensitive to atmospheric parameters and emissivity. A discussion of the main error sources was conducted. We recommend that similar tests be applied for Landsat imagery on different lakes, further studies on algorithms to correct the cool-skin effect in inland waters, and tests of different emissivity values to verify if it can compensate for this effect, in an effort to improve the accuracy of these estimates.

AB  - Due to climate changes, wildfire breakouts get more frequent and difficult to control. In the mid-July 2017, the wildfire spread from wildland to the city of Split, the second-largest city in Croatia. This unpredictable spread almost caused the collapse of emergency response systems. Fortunately, a greater tragedy was avoided with the composure of the responsible services and the help of the citizens. The citizens helped in extinguishing the fire and timely provided the significant amount of disaster-related information on different platforms and through social media. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying useful Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and georeferenced social media, for improving situation awareness while the wildfire was reaching the Croatian city of Split. Additionally, we combine social media with other external data sources (e.g. Sentinel-2 satellite images) and authoritative data (e.g. Croatian National Protection and Rescue Directorate official data and Public Fire Department of Split data) to establish the geographical relations between the wildfire phenomena and social media messages. In this manner, we seek to leverage the existing knowledge and data about the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Split wildfire in order to improve the identification of useful information from georeferenced social media with other integrated data sources that can be valuable for improving situation awareness in wildfire events.

AB  - Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are non-regular solar events, frequently connected with Space Weather disturbances, some of them with severe magnetic storms. The significant releases of plasma with CMEs impact modulations of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) causing sudden and casual decrease of Cosmic Rays (CR), known as Forbush Decrease. For detection of such kind effects, uninterrupted in situ measurements of secondary CR muons may be used. To deal with the very fast growing data, an application based on Change Point (CP) analysis is used. It is an automatic statistical tool for sequential test analysis of abrupt regime changes in CR time series. For the study, results are reported with in-situ measured data at Moussala peak (2925 m.a.s.1.) for the period of 4 years - from 2014 to end of 2017 year and confirmed with satellite data for geoeffective solar activity connected with detected FD events.

TI  - High-throughput identification and diagnostics of pathogens and pests: Overview and practical recommendations
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES
M3  - Review
AB  - High-throughput identification technologies provide efficient tools for understanding the ecology and functioning of microorganisms. Yet, these methods have been only rarely used for monitoring and testing ecological hypotheses in plant pathogens and pests in spite of their immense importance in agriculture, forestry and plant community dynamics. The main objectives of this manuscript are the following: (a) to provide a comprehensive overview about the state-of-the-art high-throughput quantification and molecular identification methods used to address population dynamics, community ecology and host associations of microorganisms, with a specific focus on antagonists such as pathogens, viruses and pests; (b) to compile available information and provide recommendations about specific protocols and workable primers for bacteria, fungi, oomycetes and insect pests; and (c) to provide examples of novel methods used in other microbiological disciplines that are of great potential use for testing specific biological hypotheses related to pathology. Finally, we evaluate the overall perspectives of the state-of-the-art and still evolving methods for diagnostics and population- and community-level ecological research of pathogens and pests.

TI  - Evaluating the application of the statistical index method in flood susceptibility mapping and its comparison with frequency ratio and logistic regression methods
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical methods are the most popular techniques to model and map flood-prone areas. Although a wide range of statistical methods have been used, application of the statistical index (Wi) method has not been examined in flood susceptibility mapping. The aim of this research was to assess the efficiency of the Wi method and compare its outcomes with the results of frequency ratio (FR) and logistic regression (LR) methods. Thirteen factors, namely, altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, geology, soil, landuse/cover (LULC), topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), terrain roughness index (TRI), sediment transport index (STI), and distance from rivers and roads, were utilized. A flood inventory was constructed from data captured from the destructive flood that occurred in Brisbane, Australia, in 2011. Model performances were compared using the area under the curve (AUC), Kappa index and five other statistical evaluation tools. The AUC prediction rates acquired for LR, Wi and FR were 79.45%, 78.18%, and 67.33%, respectively. A more realistic representation of the flood-prone area distribution was produced by the Wi method compared to those of the other two techniques. Our research shows that the Wi method can be used as an efficient approach to perform flood susceptibility analysis.

TI  - The incidence of symptomatic infection with influenza virus in the Netherlands 2011/2012 through 2016/2017, estimated using Bayesian evidence synthesis
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to differences in the circulation of influenza viruses, distribution and antigenic drift of A subtypes and B lineages, and susceptibility to infection in the population, the incidence of symptomatic influenza infection can vary widely between seasons and age-groups. Our goal was to estimate the symptomatic infection incidence in the Netherlands for the six seasons 2011/2012 through 2016/2017, using Bayesian evidence synthesis methodology to combine season-specific sentinel surveillance data on influenza-like illness (ILI), virus detections in sampled ILI cases and data on healthcare-seeking behaviour. Estimated age-aggregated incidence was 6.5 per 1000 persons (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 4.7-9.0) for season 2011/2012, 36.7 (95% UI: 31.2-42.8) for 2012/2013, 9.1 (95% UI: 6.3-12.9) for 2013/2014, 41.1 (95% UI: 35.0-47.7) for 2014/2015, 39.4 (95% UI: 33.4-46.1) for 2015/2016 and 27.8 (95% UI: 22.7-33.7) for season 2016/2017. Incidence varied substantially between age-groups (highest for the age-group <5 years: 23 to 47/1000, but relatively low for 65+ years: 2 to 34/1000 over the six seasons). Integration of all relevant data sources within an evidence synthesis framework has allowed the estimation - with appropriately quantified uncertainty - of the incidence of symptomatic influenza virus infection. These estimates provide valuable insight into the variation in influenza epidemics across seasons, by virus subtype and lineage, and between age-groups.

TI  - INSTITUTED IMAGINARY, INSTITUING IMAGINARY AND IDENTITY: ASPECTS OF THE CULTURAL TRANSITION IN VIRGIL'S <i>AENEID</i>
T2  - HUMANITAS-PORTUGAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Starting from the assumption that the Aeneid is a work that evokes a historical moment in which a process of cultural transition took place, this article analyzes the way Virgil defines the instituted and instituting imaginaries of Roman society (in books VI and VIII), in order to understand how the poet defines the imaginary of the new political and cultural order in the historical process.Thus, we analyze the worldview of these imaginaries in book VI, arguing that the organization of the historical matter forms an uninterrupted universe and conveys a unified view of History, in which the Augustan project, far from being leveraged in a critical response to institutional symbolism, appears as a re-creation of the previous symbolic edifice.The analysis of the Italic wars (Book VIII) gives continuity to the expression of the imaginary of the Pax Romana and offers new elements for the conceptualization of the Other in the Aeneid. The mission given to the Empire (6. 851-853) by Anchises obtains a qualitative amplification with the Etruscan integration in the coalition since this integration implies the recognition that the native peoples also have aspirations to justice, redefining the concept of Other and endowing the role of Aeneas in these wars with an axiological value.Finally, it is discussed whether Turnus' death obliterates the construction of the imaginary of the Pax defined in books VI and VIII, arguing that Aeneas' decision, rather than questioning this construction, expresses the tensions that typically occur in moments of frontier, marked by the oscillation between the commitment to the historical past of the established society and the adhesion to the project of a society that is intended to be instituted.

TI  - MEDICAL COMMUNITY OF TOBOLSK GOVERNORATE IN 18th - EARLY 20th CENTURIES: FROM THE MODALITY OF IDEA TO THE MODALITY OF REALIZATION
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article under consideration is meant to represent the process of the development of the regional medical community as being continuous and dynamic, from the formation of the structure, meant to provide service to people, to the establishment of the professional associations that became means of mobility, coordination, publicity and support for the socially-minded people.To achieve the above mentioned purpose we will deal with the following objectives: 1) to consider the dynamics of the size and distribution of the medical staff in Tobolsk Governorate, 2) to describe the evolution of the professional communicative practices and connections, 3) to explore the disposition of the person of a doctor in the worldview of the provincial community.The research has been carried out within the methodological frameworks of the modernization theory. It has applied modern sociological definitions of the concept "community" within the semantic field of the antonymous notions "unreal/real". This approach allows avoiding discontinuity of the research discourse and makes it possible to study the regional professional community as an integral social cultural entity with several qualitatively different stages-modalities of the development.The research relies on a wide range of published and archival documents. The materials of the Medical board, the regional statistics data, periodicals and the volunteer associations' documents have been used.As the result of the research, the author has come to the following conclusions. The formation of the medical community presupposes three stages of modality: starting with the modality of idea (or hypothetic - "theoretical" community) through the stage of underachieved reflexion (the modality of potential - "imaginary" community), up to the modality of realization and phenomenological completion (the modality of reality - "real" community). At the stage of idea (i.e. "theoretical" stage) the community is characterized by a small number of medical staff, absolute predominance of instrumental relations and significant distance between the doctor and the provincial community. At the stage of potential modality ("imaginary" community) the number of medical professionals grows, the network of internal communication expands, the first professional associations emerge, the reproduction of health care specialists begins, and the doctor becomes a common character of the social urban landscape. At the stage of realization ("real" community) the number of medical staff significantly increases, the network of health care facilities develops throughout the Governorate, communication intensifies. Thus, the medical community turns into the functioning collective body, comprised of the most active professional forces that are capable of self-organization, setting up claims, decision-making and taking measures. The system of private medical practitioners develops. Doctors take active part in different social events, they become an integral part of the provincial community. The incorporation of the character of a doctor into the provincial community was not an equable process.

TI  - Method for Predicting the Liquid-Sloshing Characteristics of a Microsatellite Propulsion System
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a method for establishing a prediction model for the liquid-sloshing characteristics of microsatellite propulsion systems is proposed. The ideal states of the liquid-sloshing characteristics are considered for the following three models: (1) storage tank, (2) coupled storage tank and microsatellite, and (3) coupled storage tank and microsatellite with a deployment mechanism. The smoothed-particle hydrodynamics method is implemented in ABAQUS to study the effect of sloshing on a storage tank and microsatellite disturbance for the above three cases. Relationship models between the sloshing time, sloshing angular velocity, amount of fluid filled, and satellite attitude angular velocity are established. The analysis results show that the disturbance angular velocity of the empty storage tank and sloshing angular velocity have a linear relationship. Furthermore, the disturbance angular velocity of the liquid-filled storage tank exhibits a surface relationship with the sloshing angular velocity and amount of fluid filled in a three-dimensional coordinate system. Additionally, the disturbance angular velocity in the liquid-filled state of the storage tank is higher than that of the empty storage tank, and the degree of disturbance decreases with the increase in the mass of the coupling. The disturbance of the storage tank and microsatellite with the deployment mechanism is 10(-2)degrees/s when the angular velocities of the satellite are x=3, y=3, and z=2. The maximum and minimum deviations between the calculation and simulation results of the three models are 7.6% and 1.1%, respectively. The model is used to predict the disturbance angular velocity of the microsatellite. When the calculation results of the model are compared with the orbit satellite data, the maximum and minimum disturbance angular velocity deviations occur in the y and z directions with a deviation of 43.36% and 14.86%, respectively. This demonstrates the accuracy of the analysis and model. The results of this study can provide theoretical guidance for the engineering design and attitude and orbital control of a microsatellite propulsion system.

AB  - The present paper aims to train and analyze Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN or ConvNets) capable of classifying plant species of a certain region for applications in an environmental monitoring system. In order to achieve this for a limited training dataset, the samples were expanded with the use of a data generator algorithm. Next, transfer learning and fine tuning methods were applied with pre-trained networks. With the purpose of choosing the best layers to be transferred, a statistical dispersion method was proposed. Through a distributed training method, the training speed and performance for the CNN in CPUs was improved. After tuning the parameters of interest in the resulting network by the cross-validation method, the learning capacity of the network was verified. The obtained results indicate an accuracy of about 97%, which was acquired transferring the pre-trained first seven convolutional layers of the VGG-16 network to a new sixteen-layer convolutional network in which the final training was performed. This represents an improvement over the state of the art, which had an accuracy of 91% on the same dataset.

TI  - KHLEBNIKOV'S INHERITORS: RUSSIAN EXPRESSIONISTS
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the issue of reception of Khlebnikov's personality and creative activity in the Russian poetry of the early 1920s. The creative experience of"the discoverer of poetic continents", as Mayakovsky called him, was very important for the young poets who were entering the world of literature in the era of wars and revolutions. His theoretical studies, "verbal experiments", rhythmical and intonational diversity of his verse became one of the most important sources of the poetry of Russian Futurism. The groups of poets oriented towards expressionistic poetics are considered inheritors of Khlebnikov in this article. The term "expressionism" as the title of a literary group in Russia was introduced in the summer of 1919 by I. Sokolov. Beside the group of Ippolit Sokolov, which existed in 1919-1922, the expressionist "wing" of Russian poetry included fuists (1921-1924), "Moscow Parnassus" (1922-1925) and Petrograd emotionalists (1921-1925) headed by Mikhail Kuzmin. The author examines the theory and practice of Russian expressionists largely in connection with the role and the place of Khlebnikov's creative activity in the Russian poetry of the early 1920s. Taking advantage of comparative and typological methods, the author comes to the conclusion that a number of features in Khlebnikov's poetics are correlated exactly with the expressionist worldview and imagery. The poet opposed spontaneity of creative activity to the positivist aspirations of the majority of futurists; he focused his poetry on the themes of fate and death and antiwar motifs. Various cases of influence of the poetics and philosophical-aesthetic program of Khlebnikov are reported in the article. Poetic dedications of B. Lapin and V. Monina demonstrate the verbal experiment and the features of rhythmic and graphic organization of verse close to Khlebnikov. M. Kuzmin highlights the features of his artistic thinking that were important for the poets of the Russian expressionism: "passion for the Russian language', "strange and fuzzy play of shifts".The given study of reception of Khlebnikov's creative activity in the circle of Russian expressionists gives the opportunity to see the picture of the literary process of the early 1920s more clearly and to reveal the mechanism of inheritance of Khlcbnikov's unique experience.

AB  - World population is constantly increasing and it is necessary to have sufficient crop production. Monitoring crop growth and yield estimation are very important for the economic development of a nation. The prediction of crop yield has direct impact on national and international economies and play important role in the food management and food security. Deep learning gains importance on crop monitoring, crop type classification and crop yield estimation applications with the recent advances in image classification using deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Traditional crop yield prediction approaches based on remote sensing consist of classical Machine Learning methods such as Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN] and Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM] are deep neural network models that are proposed for crop yield prediction recently. This study focused on soybean yield prediction of Lauderdale County, Alabama, USA using 3D CNN model that leverages the spatiotemporal features. The yield is provided from USDA NASS Quick Stat tool for years 2003-2016. The satellite data used is collected from NASA's MODIS land products surface reflectance, land surface temperature and land surface temperature via Google Earth Engine. The root mean squared error (RMSE] is used as the evaluation metric in order to be able to compare the results with other methods that generally uses RMSE as the evaluation metric.

AB  - Machine learning techniques are employed to describe the temporal behavior of soil moisture using meteorological data as inputs. Two different models, a feedforward Artificial Neural Network and the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System, are trained and the results are compared. The soil moisture is expressed in terms of Soil Water Index, derived from satellite retrievals, with the last known value also being used as input. The results are promising as the proposed methodology relies on free-access data with a worldwide coverage, allowing to easily estimate the forthcoming soil moisture. The knowledge of the expected value of this variable could be extremely useful for irrigation scheduling and it is the basis of Decision Support Systems to efficiently manage water resources in agriculture.

AB  - Falls in healthcare facilities are a frequent adverse event and a critical patient safety problem. Since 2008 we joined the Falls Prevention Campaign of the Center for Clinical Risk Management and Patient Safety of the Tuscany Region and sustained a continuous improvement process involving the governing body, medical staff, nurses, patients and their families. Despite the effort to reduce falls, 3 sentinel events resulting in patient deaths occurred in 2016, therefore the local patient safety team decided to revise and update the preventive interventions. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of an improvement program to prevent in-patient falls, on the basis of systemic analysis of reported incidents in one of the province that belongs to Tuscany Northwest Trust.

M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing fractional snow cover area (fSCA) has been increasingly used to get an improved estimate of the spatiotemporal distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) through reanalysis using different data assimilation (DA) schemes. Although the effective assimilation period of fSCA is well recognized in previous studies, little attention has been given to explicitly account for the relative significance of measurements in constraining model parameters and states. Timing of the more informative period varies both spatially and temporally in response to various climatic and physiographic factors. Here we use an automatic detection approach to locate the critical points in the time axis where the mean snow cover changes and where the melt-out period starts. The assimilation period was partitioned into three timing windows based on these critical points. A fuzzy coefficient was introduced in two ensemble-based DA schemes to take into account for the variability in informational value of fSCA observations with time. One of the DA schemes used in this study was the particle batch smoother (Pbs). The main challenge in Pbs and other Bayesian-based DA schemes is, that most of the weights are carried by few ensemble members. Thus, we also considered an alternative DA scheme based on the limits of acceptability concept (LoA) and certain hydrologic signatures and it has yielded an encouraging result. An improved estimate of SWE was also obtained in most of the analysis years as a result of introducing the fuzzy coefficients in both DA schemes. The most significant improvement was obtained in the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed SWE values (site-averaged); with an increase by 8% and 16% after introducing the fuzzy coefficient in Pbs and LoA, respectively.

TI  - Functional syndromes as indicators of ecosystem change in temperate grasslands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of an organizing conceptual framework to address ecosystem changes reduces our capacity to distinguish biophysical from direct human impacts on grassland dynamics. This is particularly important for subhumid temperate grasslands, one of the world's most threatened biomes. We identified and mapped 4 functional syndromes of grassland change at the wettest end of its worldwide distribution, the Campos in Uruguay. Syndromes were defined by differences in precipitation use efficiency (PUE, ANPP/precipitation), and in precipitation marginal response (PMR, slope of the linear regression between ANPP and precipitation) between two periods (1981-1995 and 2001-2011). Temporal trends in aboveground net primary production (ANPP, obtained by splicing two sources of NDVI, LTDR and MOD13Q1) were also characterized. To rule out the effect of precipitation we analyzed temporal trends of the residuals from the relationship between ANPP and annual precipitation (RESTRENDS). Functional syndromes associated with increases in seasonality or in the abundance of annual vegetation (Delta PMR > 0, Delta PUE < 0, 14,000 km(2)) and vegetation cover loss (Delta PUE < 0 and Delta PMR < 0, > 5000 km(2)) were the most abundant. ANPP trends were significantly negative in 3.7% of the area (2475 km(2)) and only positive in 0.3%. However, RESTRENDS were significant in 11% of the area (> 7700 km(2)), and mostly negative (in -7200 km(2)). Most of these negative trends and residual trends were associated to seasonality increase and vegetation loss syndromes. These patterns were consistent with observed changes in the region. We highlight that this conceptual framework is suitable for describing patterns of change and potential causes. Moreover, it provides policymakers with a novel tool to guide management and conservation policies, pointing to sites where intervention (i.e. conservation, restoration) is needed.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF FIELD-IN-FIELD IMRT TECHNIQUE ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER
T2  - ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study is to prospectively evaluate the quality of life in women with breast cancer who underwent radiotherapy through field-in-field intensity modulated radiotherapy technique (FIF-IMRT) after mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery (BCS).Methods: The quality of life of 67 women diagnosed with breast cancer was evaluated by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and breast cancer supplementary measure (QLQ-BR23). The evaluations were performed twice as before the radiotherapy and after the radiotherapy.Results: The total number of the patients analyzed was 67 and the median age was 46 (27-66) years. Mastectomy was performed in 59.7% (n=40) and breast-conserving surgery was performed in 40.3% (n=27) of the patients. Sentinel lymph node dissection was performed in 16.4% and axillary dissection was performed in 83.6% of the patients. 47 women were early stage and 20 women were stage III. The median number of chemotherapy cures was 6, the median FIF-IMRT dose was 50 Gy. All the patients were asked to reply to 30 questions in the QLQ-C30 question scale and 23 questions in the QLQ-BR23 question scale.Conclusions: It was seen that among a total of 53 scores of EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23, there was a negative effect on only 6 scores in women patients with breast cancer who underwent FIF-IMRT. This negative effect was particularly observed in post-menopausal women who underwent mastectomy and axillary dissection (p=0.05). In the acute period after radiation therapy did not affect the other functions on the quality of life (p>0.05).

AB  - Analysis Ready Data (ARD) are satellite data that have been pre-processed for immediate analysis with minimal user effort. The generation of Surface Reflectance (SR) from optical satellite data, involves a series of corrections to standardise the data and enable meaningful comparison of data from multiple sensors and across time. Surface reflectance data are foundational for time-series analyses and rapid generation of other information products. Field based validation of surface reflectance data is therefore critical to determine its fitness for purpose, and applicability for downstream product development.In this paper, an approach for continental scale validation of the surface reflectance data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites, using field-based measurements that are near-synchronous to the satellite observations over multiple sites across Australia is presented. Good practice measurement protocols governing the acquisition of field data, including field instrument calibration, sampling strategy and approach for post-collection processing and management of field spectral data are outlined.This study has been a nationally coordinated, collaborative field data collection campaign across Australia. Permanent field sites, to support validation efforts within the broader Earth Observation (EO) community for continental scale products were also identified. The approach is expected to serve as a model for coordinated ongoing validation of ARD products at continental to global scales.

TI  - The burden of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations in Bhutan, 2015-2016
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Influenza burden estimates help provide evidence to support influenza prevention and control programs. In this study, we estimated influenza-associated respiratory hospitalization rates in Bhutan, a country considering influenza vaccine introduction. Methods Using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction laboratory results from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance, we estimated the proportion of respiratory hospitalizations attributable to influenza each month among patients aged <5, 5-49, and >= 50 years in six Bhutanese districts for 2015 and 2016. We divided the sum of the monthly influenza-attributed hospitalizations by the total of the six district populations to generate age-specific rates for each year. Results In 2015, 10% of SARI patients tested positive for influenza (64/659) and 18% tested positive (129/736) in 2016. The incidence of influenza-associated hospitalizations among all age groups was 50/100 000 persons (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45-55) in 2015 and 118/100 000 persons (95% CI: 110-127) in 2016. The highest rates were among children <5 years: 182/100 000 (95% CI: 153-210) in 2015 and 532/100 000 (95% CI: 473-591) in 2016. The second highest influenza-associated hospitalization rates were among adults >= 50 years: 110/100 000 (95% CI: 91-130) in 2015 and 193/100 000 (95% CI: 165-221) in 2016. Conclusions Influenza viruses were associated with a substantial burden of severe illness requiring hospitalization especially among children and older adults. These findings can be used to understand the potential impact of seasonal influenza vaccination in these age groups.

AB  - Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a critical tool for the economic, social and environmental sustainability of coastal and marine areas. MSP seeks to identify the various human economic activities in these zones and in various depths. In compliance with Directive 2014/89/EU of the European Parliament and Council of the 23rd of July 2014, which aims to establish a common framework where each member state identify the maritime space under its control. This was accomplished in Cyprus through the project "Cross-Border Cooperation for the Development of Maritime Spatial Planning (Thal-Chor)", in short "Thal-Chor", which was co-funded under the Interreg "Greece-Cyprus 2007-2013" framework. The methodology of the project used government data and bathymetry maps to create a GIS database which produced density maps. The Density maps identified a high concentration of activities near the Limassol district and around the ports of Cyprus and over 60 sea and land activities were analysed for conflicts and compatibilities.The further implementation of MPS will take place through the "Cross-Border Cooperation for Implementation of Maritime Spatial Planning ("Thal-Chor 2)". During the project, satellite remote sensing and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles will be used to survey the coastal and marine areas that were identified on the density maps from the Thal-Chor project. SAR data from the Sentinel 1 satellite will provide the necessary data to verify the MSP activities in the first phase of the project. Such data will provide valuable information for the existing geo-spatial database for MSP for the implementation of integrated plans.This research is supported by the project entitled: "Cross-Border Cooperation for Implementation of Maritime Spatial Planning" referred as "THAL-CHOR 2" and is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and by national funds of Greece and Cyprus, under the Cooperation Programme "INTERREG V-A Greece- Cyprus 2014-2020".

AB  - Confusion between the polarimetric radar signatures of rotated buildings and vegetation has been widely studied to compensate for the effect of rotation. We propose in this study to have a new look on this problem. To do this, we have selected different areas in the San Francisco bay and in New Orleans. These selected zones present different orientations with respect to the sensor illuminating the scene, RADARSAT-2 (C-band) for San Francisco or UAVSAR (L-band) for New Orleans. The variations with the orientation angle of the VV/HH and HV/HH responses collected over these areas are almost identical whatever the sensor. These two quantities first grow and rapidly reach a plateau, at a level which is similar to the responses of forests we collected throughout literature. Actually, it seems that, when the rotation angles grows, the polarimetric radar responses of urban areas tend to limit values which are similar to the radar responses of forests.

TI  - Life in a northern town: rural villages in the boreal forest are islands of habitat for an endangered bat
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development is detrimental to many wildlife species; however, endangered little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) may be attracted to human settlements, making them a synurbic species. Buildings likely provide high-quality roosting habitat, which may be a limiting factor in the boreal forest where trees are typically small and potentially unsuitable for hosting large maternity colonies. In the boreal forest, there are relatively few urban developments in a matrix of wilderness and apparently suboptimal natural roosting habitat; thus, we hypothesized that isolated rural villages were islands of summer habitat for little brown bats that may be important for their conservation and recovery. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between little brown bat activity, foraging rates, and proximity to rural villages. We expected bat activity and foraging rates to increase with proximity to villages, as bats should optimally forage near their roosts to minimize flight costs. We used ultrasonic detectors to passively monitor bat activity near three rural villages in Yukon, Canada, and characterized bat habitat with forest measurements and remotely sensed data. Bat activity increased with proximity to village centers, but foraging activity did not, suggesting that human settlements in the boreal forest were important as roosting rather than foraging habitat. Bat activity was higher near water bodies and areas with relatively high densities of linear features (e. g., roads and transmission lines), perhaps because prey were most abundant near water features and along forest edges. The island phenomenon we observed (i. e., higher bat activity near villages) has also been documented in larger human settlements at lower latitudes, where urban areas provided better roosting habitat than surrounding agricultural matrices. Given that little brown bats were concentrated near rural villages, small human settlements should be a focus of conservation efforts in the boreal forest-particularly the identification and protection of buildings used as maternity colonies. Our study advances knowledge of little brown bat habitat requirements in the boreal forest and identifies habitats that may be important for their recovery.

AB  - Commercial off-the shelf systems of UAVs and sensors are touted as being able to collect remote-sensing data on crops that include spectral reflectance and plant height. Historically a great deal of effort has gone into quantifying and reducing the error levels in the geometry of UAV-based orthomosaics, but little effort has gone into quantifying and reducing the error of the reflectance and plant-height. We have been developing systems and protocols involving multifunctional ground-control points (GCPs) in order to produce crop phenotypic data that are as repeatable as possible. These multifunctional GCPs aid not only geometric correction, but also image calibration of reflectance and plant-height. The GCPs have known spectral-reflectance characteristics that are used to enable reference-based digital number-to-reflectance calibration of multispectral images. They also have known platform heights that are used to enable reference-based digital surface model-to-height maps. Results show that using these GCPs for reflectance and plant-height calibrations significantly reduces the error levels in reflectance (ca. 50% reduction) and plant-height (ca. 20% reduction) measurements.

AB  - Contrasting with much of Western discourse, Native American myths frequently ascribe world-creating deeds to non-human animals. Further, Native American stories display a remarkable slippage between the worlds of the human and non-human animals, a slippage that continues into worldview, rituals, and everyday life. Using these stories as a starting point, this article seeks to connect the current theoretical movements in posthumanism with those in mythology, in line with Graham Harvey's call for "academic animism", a re-appraisal of the role of non-human agency and culture.New developments in animal studies have revolutionized the way scholars perceive of non-hominid mental lives and abilities, which has led to challenges to traditional Western beliefs and practices. Many of these new concepts would be old news to Native Americans, whose traditions fundamentally and categorically posit radically different relationships than the non-native. In short, this paper will present a mytho-evolutionary blueprint for broadening our understanding of culture and narrative far beyond the human, yet including the human as well, as part and parcel of cultural life on earth.

AB  - This paper presents a multiscale framework for change analysis using a big dataset of multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. In patch scale, spatio-temporal change information can be extracted by the Patchbased Change Detection Matrix (P-CDM). Then regions and acquisitions of interest that show where and when changes occurred are determined from obtained P-CDMs. In pixel scale, for each such region, changes are detected in details between selected acquisitions using statistical similarity measure. This approach was then applied for analyzing changes along central coast of Vietnam (from Hue to Quang Ngai) by using a time series including 19 Sentinel-1 images. The experimental results have shown the relevancy of the framework in detecting abrupt and seasonal changes, and its effectiveness in processing a long time series with large size images.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence change analysis. This approach is based on the Change Detection Matrix (CDM) which allows the identification of the presence of changes on the ground. Coherence images are first computed from InSAR image time series (ITS) between each two adjacent dates. The CDM approach is then applied to study the obtained coherence time series with patch-wise analysis. The preliminary results on damage mapping related to the tsunami induced by the eruption of Krakatoa volcano, Sunda Strait, Indonesia on December 22, 2018 using Sentinel-1 InSAR ITS have shown the relevancy of the proposed approach.

AB  - Land cover classification and change detection analysis based on remote sensing images using machine learning algorithm has become one of the important factors for environmental management and urban planning. We select Yangon as the study area because the government faces many problems in urban planning sectors due to the population growth and urban sprawl. Therefore, the proposed method aims to perform the land cover classification in Yangon using Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and post-classification change detection between 1987 and 2017 with 5 years interval periods are evaluated. Despite land cover classifications using satellite imagery have been executed in the past decades, the classification of remotely sensed data integrating with multiple spectral, temporal and textural features and processing time for classification using time series data still have limitations. To overcome these limitations, features extracted from Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Landsat-7, Landsat-5 and Open Street Map (OSM) are executed for classification and cloud-based GEE platform is used to reduce the processing time. Some spectral indexes such as NDVI, NDBI and slope from SRTM are calculated to achieve better classification. Land cover classification is performed by using the RF classifier with the different bands' combination. Land cover classification map with 7 classes (Shrub Land, Bare Land, Forest, Vegetation, Urban Area, Lake and River) is obtained with the overall accuracy of 96.73% and kappa statistic of 0.95 for 2017. Finally, change detection analysis over 30 years is performed and the significant changes in build-up, bare land, and agriculture have been resulted.

AB  - The informed perspective presented here may rouse a sensitivity to the differences in reading Marxist philosophy from the perspective of the Inseparability of One and Many worldview and philosophy (a doctrine of internal, constitutive, relations-"intimacy") on the part of Chinese intellectuals, particularly Mao Zedong, a great campaigner for philosophic and discursive Sinicization of Marxism. Marxism has provided an opportunity for a philosophical conversation with Chinese tradition, and this conversation was not launched by a government or official campaign, but instead by the efforts made on the part of countless grassroots intellectuals. It is argued that the reason for this was perhaps due to the fact that certain of Marx's cosmological assumptions, in contrast to those of the main Western categories, are more capable of being understood and Sinicized in terms of particular philosophical currents in the Chinese tradition. This was particularly so for the two decades of the 1950s and 1960s, and until the end of the 1970s when Deng Xiaoping came to power and openly declared the start of his "Economic Reform" with the slogan "Socialism with Chinese Characteristics."

AB  - Tropical cyclone (TC) maximum wind is an important parameter for estimating TC risks such as wind potential damage and storm surge. Previous work has shown that the estimation of TC maximum wind through a series of empirical rules based on the cloud characteristics shown in the satellite cloud image. Deep learning like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has this ability of extracting and understanding these cloud features like the eye, the spiral rainbands that closely associated with its maximum wind. However, CNNs are used for object recognition and classification, CNS has less application in regression. We proposed an integrated architecture based on Convolutional Neural Network for the estimation of the TC maximum wind with higher accuracy. More specifically, it includes input layer, convolutional layers, activation functions and pooling layers for training and capturing non-linear relationships between cloud image and its wind, and a fully connection for the estimation task. We evaluate the state of the art for regression between infrared image and its TC maximum wind, discussing the necessity of different components. It demonstrates an improvement on the ability to estimate the TC intensity.

TI  - A comprehensive 4D-Var vortex initialization using a nonhydrostatic axisymmetric TC model with convection accounted for
T2  - TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) vortex initialization (VI) system is developed for a nonhydrostatic axisymmetric numerical model with convection accounted for (the RE87 model). Derivations of the tangent linear and adjoint models of the RE87 model and the correctness checks are presented. As an initial evaluation of the 4D-Var VI system, a cost function that measures the model fit to satellite microwave retrievals of tropical cyclone (TC), warm-core temperatures and total precipitable water (TPW) from the following four polar-orbiting satellites within a slightly longer than 1-h assimilation window is minimized using the limited-memory quasi-Newton minimization algorithm: the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, NOAA-20, Fengyun-3D and Global Change Observation Mission-Water Satellite 1. An azimuthal spectral analysis in cylindrical coordinates centred on the TC centres shows that the warm core and TPW fields within TCs are dominated by the axisymmetric component. The 4D-Var VI results assimilating the axisymmetric component of the above satellite retrievals produced a significant reduction in the cost function and the norm of the gradient as the minimization process is completed. The gradient of the cost function is accurately computed by a single integration of the RE87 adjoint model. In the cases of Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut, improved forecast of intensifications and more realistic vertical structures of all model state variables (e.g. temperature, water vapour mixing ratio, liquid water content mixing ratio, tangential and radial wind components and vertical velocity) are obtained when compared with a parallel run initialized simply by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 reanalysis.

AB  - Surface albedo, defined as the ratio of the upward to downward solar irradiance, is an important climate parameter in the surface energy budget. In the polar region and other snow-covered areas, surface albedo feedback is an essential mechanism that contributes to climate change. The currently available long-term snow albedo products still need some improvements to achieve a higher resolution and accuracy. This paper takes Greenland ice sheet as an example. We implemented an algorithm to enhance the daily albedo product from MOD10A1 by a set of processing steps, including data pre-processing, de-nosing and gap-filling. The experimental albedo product from 2001 to 2018 of Greenland had been validated with ground-truth albedo from the Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE) provided by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). The preliminary validation results showed that the reanalysis albedo product is temporally and spatially continuous with RMSE under 0.05.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Cover Maps (LCMs) represent the integrated information about general status of a specific region, which are widely used as a baseline for many related purposes. This study aims to extract the land covers of Sanandaj County, Kurdistan, Iran, along with to highlight the occurred changes compared with an old map prepared by the Iranian Institute of Water and Soil in 2010. The combination model of Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 satellite imageries was used for the dates 10/05/2017 and 11/05/2017, respectively. It is noted that based on the location of the study area we acquired Sentinel-1 data (S1A, IW, and GRD) and a pair of Landsat-8 images. Using Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Environment for Visualizing Image (ENVI) softwares all images were corrected, co-registered and stacked. The combination of RADAR, NDVI and thermal bands was utilized as the best combination for the visual interpretation, with which all land covers can be easily differentiated. However, with help of the Google Earth images the land covers (polygon by polygon) were checked and digitized. Results indicate that the visual interpretation of the combination model with the assist of Google Earth is a robust way to extract land covers, provided that the researchers have enough knowledge on the land covers of the study area. This study can be applicable for decision makers of Sanandaj City.

AB  - This study employed Sentinel-1A C-band and Sentinel-2A multispectral data combined with the decision tree ensemble algorithms to map the spatial distribution of five mangrove communities in a coastal area in North Vietnam. The results show that the rotation forests (RoFs) model achieved better overall accuracy and kappa coefficient in mapping mangrove species than those of the canonical correlation forests (CCFs) and the random forests (RFs) models. This research demonstrates the potential of using optical and SAR data together with machine learning techniques to map mangrove species in tropical areas.

CP  - 12th International Engineering Research Conference (EURECA)

AB  - Global challenges are increasing in complexity. Some of these key challenges are expressed in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges. With regards to these challenges, engineers have a vital role to play. Therefore, it is necessary for their training to ensure that they possess the requisite capability. In view of this, a more holistic educational approach, one that emphasizes both the informative and transformative aspects of learning is expected to be necessary. This is because expertise in technological innovation alone may not be wholly adequate due to the complexity of the challenges. The solutions are expected to entail a more holistic approach in which engineers are required to understand the broader context in which technological solutions are situated, appreciate the multi and interdisciplinary nature of the complexity, be able to harness resources to confront them as well as possess an underlying passion, desire and belief to overcome these challenges. Transformative learning differs from informative learning in that its aim is not about adding to a person's store of knowledge but is about facilitating changes to the person's worldview, self, epistemology, ontology, behavior or capacity. This paper seeks to review literature on transformative learning theory and to derive some insight into its potential application in engineering education.

AB  - The increasing urban population and the resulting lack of reliable water, energy and food supply is a big challenge for cities especially in informal settlements (slums). In order to plan new, better supply structures for cities, it is useful to subdivide the cities into sub structures. This subdivision can be performed by using cluster algorithms. In this paper we subdivide the slums in Dhaka using three different cluster methods and evaluate them with different indicators regarding their suitability for infrastructure planning.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of crockery made of faience and porcelain of the Siberian Bukharans of the second half of the XIX - early XX centuries, as one of the important elements of material culture. In the work is the first time described 28 items from collections of rural museums in Ulenkul village of the Omsk region and Embayevo village of the Tyumen region. During the research scientific attribution and classification of the material was carried out. Authors divided utensils into groups: dishware (plates, dishes, tureen) and tea equipage (teapots, teapot, sugar bowl, oiler). In result were made some conclusions. In whole corpus of analyzed utensils predominate products, made at factories of the Kuznetsov family. Among the viewed items were detected some unique and rare samples, such as plate No. 10 and a set of tableware No. 23; soup vase No. 16, teapot No. 21, etc.Authors presupposed some reasons why the crockery, made of fine ceramics, was fined mostly between Bukharans. This group was the most well-off between other Siberian Tatars: their traditional activities were trade, carrier's trade, animal industry. This activities arranged good financial capability and flexible worldview attitudes, which made possible to adopt in household some elements of urban lifestyle, for example, crockery of porcelain and faience.

AB  - The study of influence of a pipeline laid in permafrost soils on surrounding soils is an urgent task to ensure safe operation of pipeline. It is known that increase in temperature field of frozen soils is main factor contributing to activation of negative geocryological processes that affect the reliability of underground pipeline systems. Activation of geocryological processes, waterlogging of the territory of pipeline corridor causes a change in the state and type of vegetation, which can be fixed and observed by means of satellite information interpretation. We used multi-temporal images of Landsat satellite. Decoding was carried out on ENVI software package; to assess the change in vegetation state, vegetation index NDVI was used. Results of the research show that using vegetation index allows identifying and classifying different types of vegetation, assessing changes in vegetation cover and waterlogging of the territory using satellite images at different times, and thus tracking activation and attenuation of geocryological processes and indirectly assess condition of the pipeline. The use of satellite imagery is one of the stages of geotechnical monitoring and makes it possible to quickly receive information over a large area, which is important for extensive linear systems located in remote areas, and complements ground monitoring works well.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal CO<sub>2</sub> Variations near St. Petersburg Based on Satellite and Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of studying spatial-temporal CO2 variations near St. Petersburg in 2014-2017 based on satellite measurements (OCO-2 satellite) and ground-based spectroscopic and local measurements are presented. According to satellite data, the full amplitude of the spatial-temporal variations for the average CO2 mixing ratio (XCO2) amount to 57.7 ppm (over 14%). The maximal XCO2 spatial variations during 1 day of observations (March 17, 2015) were 46.8 ppm (more than 10%). A comparison of CO2 satellite and ground-based spectroscopic measurements has shown that ground-based measurements in the NDACC observation system after the correction of systematic differences from the TCCON system can be used to validate satellite measurements. Ground-based local measurements of the near-surface CO2 mixing ratio at Peterhof do not correlate either with spectroscopic ground-based or satellite measurements due to both mesoscale CO2 variations and significantly different spatial averaging kernels of direct and remote measurements.

TI  - Neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer: how are we choosing?
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNeoadjuvant therapy has revolutionized the management of rectal cancer; however, there is a need to examine the factors driving neoadjuvant treatment allocation. This study aimed to describe patterns of treatment allocation for patients with rectal cancer at our institution and identify predictors for receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and for choice of short- or long-course therapy.MethodsA retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of 122 patients undergoing surgical resection for rectal cancer with curative intent, between 1 November 2012 and 31 October 2017. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors that determined which patients received neoadjuvant therapy, and whether it was short or long course.ResultsEighty-six patients (70%) received neoadjuvant therapy. Independent predictors for receiving neoadjuvant therapy were T3-4 tumours (P<0.001), node-positive disease (P=0.005) and mid (P=0.045) or low rectal cancers (P<0.001). Of those receiving neoadjuvant therapy, 38 (44%) received short course and 48 (56%) received long course. Node-positive disease was the only predictor for receiving long rather than short-course neoadjuvant therapy (P=0.002). Overall, these factors predicted 76% of neoadjuvant treatment allocation. Our predictor model identified important areas of variance in our decision-making.ConclusionUtilizing the identified factors, it appears that consistent decisions regarding neoadjuvant therapy are being made the majority of the time. These decisions are largely driven by T and N stage as well as tumour height. Mesorectal fascia involvement, pre-treatment carcinoembryonic antigen, age and comorbidity also influenced decision-making to a lesser and more variable extent.

AB  - Research objectives: This article discusses some issues related to the problem of the relationship between the concepts of the "Golden Horde", the "White Horde", and the "Blue Horde", with an emphasis on the term "horde" itself - both as a scientific definition and as a historical concept related to the phonetic forms in which it situated in the sources. The author proposes to reveal the original meaning of the term ordo similar to orda and to outline the stages of expansion of its semantics with the delineation of semantic fields.Research materials: The article may be considered largely as a kind of commentary on the research of recent years. Since all materials on the affected issues have been known to researchers for a long time, the selection of sources looks proverbially traditional. These are Mongolic, Chinese, Latin, Muslim (Arabic and Persian), and Old Russian texts containing the word ordo in its various forms. The author did not use the whole body of sources, but rather the most illustrative materials in his opinion. Mostly, the linguistic material was employed which comprises the lexical basis for researching specific languages.Research results and novelty: In the process of researching the contexts of using of the term ordo similar to orda in various sources and different orthographic variants (corresponding to phonetic ones), the author came to the following contention. Secondary senses reflecting one of the aspects of the original sense evolved from the basic meaning recorded among thirteenth-century Mongols - "the abiding-place of a ruler, his family, his entourage, and all the attendants". Since the development took place in parallel, this did not exclude the words being used with different intended meanings in the same texts, which can be revealed only as a result of the analysis of the context. The contexts of the use of the term in the sources make it possible to assert that there was a process of expansion of the term's original meaning, reflected in the perception of different authors being representatives of foreign cultures. This occurs in the period after the middle of the fourteenth century, being directly caused by the events of political history of the Jochid ulus as it was plunged into an era of trouble. Also, the emergence of additional senses associated with the concept of territory was the result of a comprehension of the word in related contexts within the worldview specific for sedentary cultures. The author of the article accepts the point to identity the terms "Golden Horde" and "White Horde", both contrasted with the concept "Blue Horde", originally associated respectively with the designation of the domains of the descendants of Batu in the western part, and the descendants of Urdu in the eastern part, of the Jochid ulus. In addition, it is recognized that the hypothesis on the correlation of these color markers with the traditional geosymbolism of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples is not sufficiently substantiated although it is theoretically permissible. The fact that the term ordo similar to orda with both color markers of "gold" and "white" was more often associated with the sense "qan's tent", corresponds with the source data on similar epithets for tents of different qans. Historically, the possession of such tent was typical for certain leaders, at least in the Mongolian tradition, but from an early age it had come to be claimed as the attribute of the rulers of the Jochid ulus primarily. Nonetheless, a solid identification of the relationship between the concepts "golden" and "white" requires special research.

AB  - In this work, a methodology for the automated classification of Landsat 8 images from the integration of Artificial Neural Networks and the identification of pixels of pure classes is presented. The exercise carried out in this research by using the SEPAL platform, allowed to obtain a mosaic L8 of the study area, fully preprocessed and calibrated, and it was generated automatically in a short period of time. This result represents a significant advance in terms of preprocessing capacity that currently exists for the management of satellite data compared to the state of the area a decade ago. This relevant advance has been possible due to the use of artificial neural networks and the cross-correlation coefficient of the pixels of the Landsat 8 satellite platform images. Their use and differentiation of areas in remote sensing of wooded, agricultural and water areas are discussed.

T2  - AIR POLLUTION: SOURCES, IMPACTS AND CONTROLS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Currently, air pollution is one of the most imperative problems and has a major role in global climate change and premature deaths throughout the world. Various types of air pollutants (e.g. particulate matter, NOx, SOx, CO and O-3) are present in the atmosphere and have significant effects on human health, agriculture, weather and climate. Accurate measurements of air pollutants on local, regional and global levels at high spatial and temporal resolution are needed to quantify their distribution and resulting impacts. Real-time ground-level measurements of air pollutants help to understand secondary aerosol formation through atmospheric chemical transformation. On the other hand, satellite measurements of air pollutants and trace gases provide a good platform to understand the current scenario of air quality and future climate change on a global scale. Measuring air pollutants with higher accuracy is challenging because of a variety of considerations, including their chemical composition, lifetime, emission sources and complex instrumentation. A continuous improvement in air pollutant measurement techniques and instrumentation has occurred during the last two decades; however, more efforts are needed to achieve more realistic data with higher accuracy. In this chapter, an overview of various measurement techniques of air pollutants (from ground-based and satellite-based measurements) are presented.

T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The most important trend characteristic of the Kazakh performing arts is its close connection with the traditional culture. The high popularity of folk music was resulting in and is still resulting in the fact that performers necessarily include folk musical works in their repertoires. The introduction of the wide audience to the academic classical music was not possible without addressing the great inheritance of the Kazakh traditional culture. In the consciousness of society, mass culture exists, as a rule, differentially from the academic one; nevertheless, the problem of interaction of the represented spheres of art is relevant. The desire to universalize the musical language also determines one of the aspects of this problem.

AB  - Phase unwrapping is a key step in the processing of interferometric SAR data. It is a complex operation due to many problems characteristic of InSAR data such as : phase aliasing, noise, and phase discontinuity. The aim of this article is to present a new algorithm for interferometric phase unwrapping. The algorithm minimizes a cost function based on contextual modeling.The contextual model measures the regularity of the phase field at each pixel of the interferogram. Validation tests with simulated images and RADARSAT-2 images showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms standard algorithms of phase unwrapping such as Brunch Cuts, Minimum Cost Flow Networks, or least squares Lp-norm algorithm.

TI  - Improving Alpine Summertime Streamflow Simulations by the Incorporation of Evapotranspiration Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, autocalibration routines have become commonplace in watershed modeling. This approach is most often used to simulate a streamflow at a basin's outlet. In alpine settings, spring/early summer snowmelt is by far the dominant signal in this system. Therefore, there is great potential for a modeled watershed to underperform during other times of the year. This tendency has been noted in many prior studies. In this work, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was auto-calibrated with the SUFI-2 routine. A mountainous watershed from Idaho was examined (Upper North Fork). In this study, this basin was calibrated using three estimates of evapotranspiration (ET): Moderate Resolution Imagining Spectrometer (MODIS), Simplified Surface Energy Balance, and Global Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Model. The MODIS product in particular, had the greatest utility in helping to constrain SWAT parameters that have a high sensitivity to ET. Streamflow simulations that utilize these ET parameter values have improved recessional and summertime streamflow performances during calibration (2007 to 2011) and validation (2012 to 2014) periods. Streamflow performance was monitored with standard objective metrics (Bias and Nash Sutcliffe coefficients) that quantified overall, recessional, and summertime peak flows. This approach yielded dramatic enhancements for all three observations. These results demonstrate the utility of this approach for improving watershed modeling fidelity outside the main snowmelt season.

TI  - Quantitative RT-PCR Assay for Detecting Lymph Node Metastasis in Endometrial Cancer: A Preliminary Study
T2  - ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The detection accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for endometrial cancer (EC) remains unclear and was assessed in this preliminary study. Methods: We studied primary cancer tissues and pelvic lymph nodes (PLN) from 105 patients with EC. qRT-PCR assay was performed to determine the copy numbers of CK19 mRNA in EC tissues, and negative and positive LN samples. Further, qRT-PCR results were compared with pathological findings. Results: CK19 mRNA expression was detected in 98% (104/106) of the tumors, with a median copy number of 3.0 x 10(5)/mu L. Twelve LN were diagnosed as positive by pathological examination. The median copy number of CK19 mRNA for positive and negative LN was 8.1 x 10(4)/mu L and 90.4/mu L, respectively. CK19 mRNA expression was higher in pathologically positive LN than in pathologically negative LN (p < 0.01); the pathological and qRT-PCR findings showed no discrepancy. When the cutoff value was set at 4,500 copies/mu L, qRT-PCR assay using CK19 mRNA exhibited high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that qRT-PCR assay, using CK19 mRNA, exhibits a high accuracy for detecting LN metastasis in EC and represents a useful alternative to conventional pathological diagnosis of EC.

AB  - With the rapid increase of human population, the demand for foodstuff such as vegetable oil has also risen. Palm oil is one of the vegetable oils with highest yield to land ratio and unsustainable development of plantations is highly discouraged. Therefore, optimization of plantation yield has to be done with good plantation management and microwave remote sensing can be used to provide information to plantation owners to perform suitable actions. However, there is currently a lack of understanding in microwave remote sensing in the context of oil palm and studies need to be done to translate microwave satellite imagery to meaningful information for plantation owners. There are previous studies done to classify microwave satellite imagery with the use of machine learning techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). In this work, we study the use of machine learning on microwave satellite imagery to classify growth status of oil palms. We first studied the oil palm biophysical parameters together with the use of theoretical model based on radiative transfer (RT) equation where we were able to identify the key parameters and components that are sensitive to L band microwave imagery obtained from ALOS-PALSAR 2. With this knowledge in hand and feedback from agronomists, we then design 5 classification classes that can suitably portray oil palm growth status with respect under L band microwave imagery. We then proceed to classify the image with ground truth data obtained from the field study. With inspiration from techniques such as generative adaptive network (GAN), we generated simulation data with the use of RT model in order to supplement additional data to the CNN and combine this with SVM to establish the hybrid classification model. By getting the best of both techniques, the hybrid classification model managed to achieve 90% training accuracy. The classified images are then overlaid with Google Earth interface and we qualitatively evaluate the classification results with ground study information and census data. We found that the image of the hybrid classification model was in good agreement with ground truth data.

M3  - Article
AB  - One of the literary discourse features is the embodiment of thoughts in the form of images. The image structures artistic literary space. Artistic figurativeness simulates a particular reality, which has co-referent nature and it has visualization of worldview as the basis of intention. Processes of creating and understanding literary text are identical. Stages of the processes include figurative categorization, unpacking and reading of images. Imagery means, included in a text, form a figurative paradigm which is headed by the base image. The coherence of figurative means is the structuring principle of the literary text. On the one hand, the base image variation is limited by the cognitive matrix corresponding to one or another mental code; on the other hand, it is unlimited and unpredictable and depends on the text author's creative potential. The base image organizes the cognitive activity of the author and the reader. It becomes the basis for artistic communication, ensuring its effectiveness. The base image determines the adequacy of the text understanding. Due to the base image, addressee covers the entire paradigm of figurative means and, to some extent, correctly interprets it. Violation of this pattern leads to destruction of the text imagery integrity, to interference in artistic communication. The base image embodies one of the fundamental principles of hermeneutics: the requirement of a holistic interpretation, subordination of all text elements to a single text-forming foundation.

AB  - Gamification is the use of game elements and game-design techniques in non-game contexts. It has five main elements: points, badges, leader boards, rules and levels. A classroom that has any or all of these elements can be considered a gamified classroom. This study explored the effects of a gamified environment to the motivation and achievement of high school students in Physics. The framework of the study is anchored on the Self-Determination Theory which claims that humans are inherently active, inquisitive and self-motivated even without external reward. However, extrinsic motivators can be converted to intrinsic motivators if they are meaningful, pleasurable and consistent with a person's worldview. To determine if gamification has a significant effect on the student motivation, the students' responses to the pre-gamification and post-gamification administration of the Physics Motivation Questionnaire were compared using the paired sample t-test on SPSS. Its effects to student achievement in Physics, on the other hand, was identified after calculating the mean normalized gains for all the pretests-posttests administration after each of the 5 modules. Feedback from students, teacher-implementer and external observers were collected and analyzed. Results showed that gamified instruction brings about a significant increase in student achievement in Physics but not in student motivation. However, the feedback coming from students, teacher-implementer and external observers substantiate the influence of gamification to student motivation. Implementation must be done properly so that no unhealthy competition develops, no student becomes extremely grade conscious that he or she ends up resorting to cheating and that an environment conducive to learning is maintained inside the classroom. Consequently, it is recommended that more rigorous studies should be done to further confirm or invalidate the effects of gamification in learning Physics that are exposed in this study.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Brazilian Savanna (i.e., Cerrado) are classified as World Biodiversity Hotspots. Our goal was to analyze the spatial distribution of endangered species in both habitats within the Mourao River basin, southern Brazil. Forest remnants were mapped using Landsat 8 satellite images applying NDVI medium and landscape metrics. Locations of endangered species were added as an additional layer. The result was a map of 4015 forest remnants of which 97.66% were smaller than 50 ha, and 2.34% were larger than 50 ha. A total of 41 species was recorded in the Atlantic Forest fragments of the basin (total area: 25 502.6 ha), and 32 species in the Brazilian Savanna (total area: 8.6 ha). The forest fragment with the greatest richness of endangered species was Lago Azul State Park with 29 species endangered at the state level and six at the national level. The second and third most species-rich fragments corresponded to Brazilian Savanna fragments: Cerrado Ecological Station and Lote 7H. The integration of GIS, landscape metrics and spatial distribution of endangered species is an important tool for the identification of priority areas for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Oil palm plantations are expanding at an alarming rate in tropical Asia at the expense of existing forest and farmlands. To better plan future development and conservation in the region, it is necessary to understand the processes of oil palm development. In this study, a pilot study was conducted to test whether remote sensing techniques could be applicable for investigating actual processes of oil palm development in cloud-prone tropical Asia. To achieve the goal, three satellites and sensor types, Landsat, Google Earth, and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, were used together to develop a robust monitoring method of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) specifically aimed at oil palm development. It was confirmed that LUCC information that is ready for in-depth spatiotemporal analysis was successfully obtained with sufficient spatial (8,916 km(2) at 30-m spatial resolution) and temporal (1988 to 2017) coverage.

AB  - The results of estimation of burned area from wildfires in Eastern Siberia using a threshold algorithm and expert evaluation are presented. Atmospheric emissions of CO2 and PM10 particles from wildfires are calculated. Obtained estimations of burned area shows a good agreement with the MODIS and GFED-4 data: the correlation coefficients were similar to 0.95 and similar to 0.87, and the average relative errors were 16.5% and 40.6%, respectively. A preliminary analysis of the dataset allowed us to make a quantitative assessment of the fire activity in the Eastern Siberia during 1984-2000.

TI  - ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON NATURAL VEGETATION GREENNESS USING IMPROVED STATISTICAL VEGETATION INDEX SIMULATION MODEL
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid regions, vegetation growth relies on water availability. Climate change can alter water cycling with subsequent effects on vegetation growth. This study examined the effects of projected climate change on vegetation greenness in the middle-reaches region of the Heihe River Basin, the second largest inland basin in China The relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of vegetation greenness derived from remote sensing data, and meteorological factors of precipitation and temperature was simulated using a modified statistical vegetation index simulation model. The model predicted that along with increases in precipitation and temperature, spring and autumn NDVI will rise about 3.8% and 7.9% by the 2050s, respectively. NDVI in summer increases about 3.9%, as increased precipitation may be superior to higher rates of soil water evaporation due to rising temperature. Hydrological processes in the Heihe River Basin are highly influenced by both climate change and human activities. The findings of this study are valuable for the development of water resource management policies that balance the water demands of both human society and the natural ecosystem.

AB  - Pollutants in urban environments can influence on human health and other organisms such as birds living in the same regions. Therefore, the study of these species, as a sentinel, can realized on the health status of urban environments. The present research was conducted to measure Benzo a pyrene (BaP) concentration in different tissues of Rock Dove Columba livia as a sentinel species in in vitro and in vivo conditions. For this purpose, five groups were exposed to different concentrations (0.1, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mg. kg-1 bw) of BaP. Also, for the comparison of in vitro results with urban conditions, 12 body samples were captured from the Tehran megacity. Results showed different accumulation patterns among the studied groups, which can be due to different intake pathways of pollutants by these birds. According to the results, in case of bioaccumulation factor, the rapid biotransformation rate of BaP in tissues of pigeons might affect their amount. Overall, the fat tissue at first and after that, the muscle tissue of C. livia could serve as a suitable biomonitor for BaP in the Tehran megacity.

AB  - In recent years, lifestyle diseases have become a serious problem in Japan. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, more than half the causes of death in FY 2005 were attributed to lifestyle diseases. To prevent lifestyle diseases, diet improvements and regular exercise are necessary. However, many people cannot continue exercise. In this research, we classified the sports consciousness of participants, measured their motivation during exercise in various TPOs with questionnaires, and clarified these relationships. We also considered the method of motivation for exercise.

AB  - The North-up reference frame on cartographic maps is a cultural convention that originates in the astronomical-geometrical worldview of ancient Greek cosmology. Although a relatively young tradition, it had substantial influence on human spatial thinking from the Renaissance. Recent geo-visualization applications may display maps with dynamic, head-up orientation to support turn-by-turn navigation. Increased GPS use seems not to support survey knowledge related to spatial memory. In the current study we tested the sense of North in a sample of young adults. We created an ecologically valid experimental setting and carefully selected a special location at ELTE university campus in Budapest. Standing near river Danube and heading an easterly direction our 36 participants first indicated North in a vista space; then they pointed toward salient urban landmarks in the city. In the second part they marked graphically the directions of important cities in Europe and, finally, they once again indicated the direction of the North in a geographic reference frame. Our results demonstrate that the participants had a clear sense of geographical North, which was not biased by the setting, buildings and available landmark cues. Furthermore, test subjects living longer in Budapest had a better sense of North, supporting a learned component in this directional knowledge. Our experiment in the physical world resulted in supporting evidence that North is still maintained in human cognitive maps as the cardinal direction for orientation.

AB  - In the last ten years, ESA's Earth Observation (EO) program has been based on three main pillars, i.e. Copernicus, Meteorology and Earth Science Explorer and on some crosscutting activities covering international cooperation and preservation of historical data.In the framework of the Copernicus program, the Sentinel-1 mission is the workhorse for acquiring systematically and providing routinely a large volume of C-band SAR data to the Copernicus services and the global scientific and commercial user community.On the other hand, the availability of high-resolution X-band data is ensured through national European SAR missions, such as TerraSAR- X, Cosmo-SkyMed and Paz, which are referred to as Copernicus Contributing Missions.L-band SAR data are required for applications, such as surface deformation mapping, monitoring of cryosphere dynamics, sea-ice classification and land cover mapping, among others. As such, L-band data provide complementary information to C- and X- band data.As part of the Copernicus expansion, ESA has initiated the study phase for an L-band SAR mission (ROSE-L). At national level, Germany is perusing the implementation of the proposed Tandem-L mission. Recently, disruptive NewSpace smallSat SAR companies have emerged on the EO market. This has triggered discussions on whether or to what extent small-Sats can eventually replace or complement large institutional SAR missions.In this paper we provide the overview of the evolution of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 Space Segment and the Spacecraft development status and we also discuss the challenges for the evolution of the Copernicus SAR Space Component, based upon a review of the Sentinel-1 mission, i.e. its objectives and implementation, the systematic data acquisition strategy including coverage and revisit frequency, and the end-to-end SAR performance

AB  - Conventional pathology in sentinel lymph node biopsy fails to sufficiently evaluate the entire tissue volume, resulting in high rates of false negatives. To address this, a novel imaging system is proposed to augment the current protocol by providing high-resolution molecular imaging of the lymph node prior to sectioning, with the goal of guiding pathology. Optical projection tomography (OPT) offers a potential solution but spatial resolution of conventional OPT is generally quite poor in lymph node sized tissue samples. Here, we demonstrate the ability to use angular-restriction with filtered-backprojection to provide sensitive and accurate localization of clinically relevant sized micrometastases in lymph nodes (through Monte Carlo simulations and porcine lymph node metastases models).

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a primary mean of staging cancer; however, the time-intensive nature of standard pathology limits the volume of the node that can be assessed. As a result, micrometastases can be missed, which have been shown to affect treatment decisions and therefore clinical outcomes. Optical imaging offers a potential solution for improved sensitivity and larger tissue evaluation, but an understanding of optical properties is necessary because of the high scattering nature of biological tissue. Here, time-domain optical imaging and measures of transmittance are used to characterize the optical properties of porcine lymph nodes at 685 nm and 780 nm. Results demonstrated values comparable to that of other soft biological tissue ( 685 nm: mu(a) = 0.09 +/- 0.01cm-1, mu(s)' = 2.60 +/- 0.42 cm(-1), g = 0.95; 780 nm: mu(a) = 0.24 +/- 0.10cm(-1), mu(s)' = 3.35 +/- 0.14 cm(-1), g = 0.92). Based on these coefficients, optical properties of TiO2 were investigated so that a protocol to fabricate a lymph node tissue-mimicking phantom could be defined.

AB  - Microbolometer thermal cameras in UAVs and manned aircraft allow for the acquisition of high-resolution temperature data, which, along with optical reflectance, contributes to monitoring and modeling of agricultural and natural environments. Furthermore, these temperature measurements have facilitated the development of advanced models of crop water stress and evapotranspiration in precision agriculture and heat fluxes exchanges in small river streams and corridors. Microbolometer cameras capture thermal information at blackbody or radiometric settings (narrowband emissivity equates to unity). While it is customary that the modeler uses assumed emissivity values (e.g. 0.99-0.96 for agricultural and environmental settings); some applications (e.g. Vegetation Health Index), and complex models such as energy balance-based models (e.g. evapotranspiration) could benefit from spatial estimates of surface emissivity for true or kinetic temperature mapping. In that regard, this work presents an analysis of the spectral characteristics of a microbolometer camera with regard to emissivity, along with a methodology to infer thermal emissivity spatially based on the spectral characteristics of the microbolometer camera. For this work, the MODIS UCBS Emissivity Library, NASA HyTES hyperspectral emissivity, Landsat, and Utah State University AggieAir UAV surface reflectance products are employed. The methodology is applied to a commercial vineyard agricultural setting located in Lodi, California, where HyTES, Landsat, and AggieAir UAV spatial data were collected in the 2014 growing season. Assessment of the microbolometer spectral response with regards to emissivity and emissivity modeling performance for the area of study are presented and discussed.

AB  - Flood-hazard map delineation is an important task in planning land management activities. This evaluation is usually based on coupled hydraulic/hydrological models, which often require time consuming and expensive measurement campaigns in order to estimate the necessary distributed physical information for their implementation (e.g. digital elevation models, land cover and geological maps); moreover, the observed effects of flood events are needed for their calibration and validation. The obtained flooded maps can allow to perform geomorphic DEM-based procedure, which is a valid tool useful for the rapid identification and mapping of flood-prone areas; in addition remote sensing is a reliable and widespread source of input data for the application of hydrological and hydraulic models: particular interest generate the attitude of the Landsat-8 OLISR data in the definition of the effective flooded area. The goal of this work is to compare performances of remote sensing and DEM-based techniques for the definition of flood-prone areas, using as reference map that obtained by a two-dimensional hydraulic simulation. An objective comparison between these two approaches has been carried out(using linear binary classifiers method and ROC curves) on the case study of Lato river basin, located in the Puglia region, Southern Italy; the satellite indices showed good performances even if the selected geomorphic descriptors still remain the most performing in reproducing the inundated areas.

AB  - This paper summarized a new and precise spatio-morphological mapping of cultivable area located at northern-eastern oasis Algerian region affected by land salinization phenomena. We gave qualitative and quantitative views by mapping the presence of salt deposit transported by watersheds, accumulated in the same region and raised to the surface following the Albien's drainage for the irrigation of the settlements, or by tectonic movement at depth. In order to study a spacious area with a metric precision, processing optical remote sensing data were required. We processed heterogeneous data; from satellites (sentinel-2b multi-spectral) Combined with an old map of the area and field measurements to produce a new and more accurate up-to-date map. The results obtained by applying supervised classifications (Artificial Neural Network) combined with unsupervised (K-means) methods show the amount of salt on cultivable region over the areas of Touggourt. We deduced the risk that the nearest areas (not yet affected by this phenomenon) have to face. Five classes extracted from the satellite image: salt, sand, agricultural land, palm trees, and buildings Show the distribution of salinity levels as well as the cultivability trend of each class. The total salt (salinization) occupation rate of similar to 24%, which represents 1/4 of the area affecting almost all cultivable and palm classes.

AB  - Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design towards a high spatial resolution, wide field of view and large spectral coverage instrument. The mission has already a constellation of 2 satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) launched in 2015 and 2017, each having a 7.25-year lifetime with consumable sized for 12 years. To cover the 20-year overall mission duration, two additional satellites Sentinel-2C and Sentinel-2D were founded by the European Commission and are under development. Some modifications were implemented for the two new satellites: (1) on the technical side, modifications to improve further the instrument performance up to End of Life (thermal improvements to reduce the focal plane temperature, optimization of MTF at detector and instrument level) (2) added in orbit activities to improve inter-instrument calibration with the Moon calibration. The first set of radiometric and geometric performances of the VNIR and SWIR channels from the test campaign performed in 2018 and early 2019 are compared with performances of the two in-flight instruments.

AB  - Cost-effective permafrost characterization and monitoring should be possible due to advances in the technology of earth observation satellites. In particular, the long-penetration capabilities of L-band ALOS2-PALSAR2 should permit large scale mapping of discontinuous permafrost in peatland areas. Recently, it has been shown that the long penetrating polarimetric L-band ALOS is very promising for boreal and subractic peatland mapping and monitoring [1], [2]. The unique information provided by the Touzi decomposition [3], [4], and the Touzi scattering phase in particular,on peatland subsurface water flow permits enhanced discrimination of bogs from fens; two peatland classes that can hardly be discriminated using conventional optical remote sensing. In this study, the Touzi scattering phase is investigated for mapping discontinuous permafrost in peatland regions Northern Alberta. Polarimetric ALOS-2 (FP6-4) and field data were collected in August 2014 over discontinuous distributed within wooded palsa bogs and peat plateaus near the Namur Lake (Northern Alberta). The ALOS2 image is re-calibrated to reduce the residual error from -33 dB down to -43 dB. This permits full exploiting the excellent ALOS2 performance in term of low noise floor (NESZ about -38 dB) to increase the sensitivity of the Touzi phase to deep permafrost. It is shown that the information provided by the scattering type phase permits enhanced mapping of discontinuous permafrost. The results obtained with the long penetrating L-band polarimetric PALSAR2 are much better than the ones obtained with conventional discontinuous permafrost mapping methods based on Lidar and optical (Landsat and Spot) images.

AB  - The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) planned for launch in June 2019 will involve three small SAR satellites flying in a constellation configuration. Each satellite SAR will be equipped with Compact (i.e. Hybrid) capabilities in addition to single-polarization (HH, HV, VV), and conventional (HH-HV, VV-VH, and HH-VV) dual-polarization. Compact (CP) SAR transmits a circular polarization and measures the received signal at the horizontal and vertical antenna polarization. It is now admitted that the actual SAR technology does not permit the generation of a perfectly circular polarization and this may significantly affect CP information [1], [2]. All the existing CP calibration models are mainly based on the Freeman CP model [3], which assumes that the transmitted polarization is perfectly circular. Recently, a new CP calibration mode [2], [4], which explicitly takes into account the non circularity of transmitted polarization, in addition to conventional antenna distortion matrix channel imbalance and Faraday rotation contamination, is introduced and validated using ALOS2-CP data [2], [5]. In this study, the new CP calibration model will be adapted to the RCM. The strategy adopted for RCM CP calibration is described. Preliminary results obtained with RCM data will be presented at the conference.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper describes the possibility of using satellite images of medium spatial resolution from the Sentinel-2 spacecraft to identify areas of mass growth of the Sosnovsky hogweed. Vegetation indices NDVI and ClGreen were used to interpret space images. The calculated indices made it possible to identify in the photographs the types of vegetation that represent a significant- part of the plant communities of the Kirov region (deciduous and coniferous species, meadow vegetation), as well as the mono-community of the Sosnovsky hogweed. The approach to the interpretation of satellite images used in the work has shown that the vegetative indices ClGreen and NDVI can be used to detect and map the spatial distribution of the Sosnovsky hogweed. The best result in the case of the NDVI index is achieved by using spring shots (May), since during this period there is an active growth of the Sosnovsky hogweed. The index of chlorophyll ClGreen is the most informative one for interpretation of satellite images obtained during hogweed flowering. Based on the values of spectral indices, according to Sentinel-2, maps of the distribution of the Sosnovsky hogweed on the territory of the Falyonsky District of the Kirov Region were constructed.

TI  - A framework for mapping sustainability within tertiary curriculum
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sustainability within tertiary curriculum is hard to measure and often perceived to be illusive in nature. Existing higher education sustainability assessment tools rarely focus on the curriculum. This paper aims to establish and implement a tool that can measure sustainability integration within curriculum. The Faculty of Engineering and IT (FEIT) at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is used as a case study.Design/methodology/approach A set of seven sustainability competencies are identified by means of a systematic literature review as the current knowledge of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) competencies. ESD competency integration into the curriculum is assessed by implementing a two-tier scanning mechanism. In the first step, subject outlines (SOs) are used to identify sustainable subject learning outcomes (SLOs) and assessment learning outcomes (ALOs). Step 2 involves analysing ALOs and SLOs for constructive alignment with student experience. SPSS, a statistical software, is then used to statistically reflect the results.Findings An initial scan of SOs found that stated ESD outcomes made up 22.4 per cent of FEIT undergraduate courses. A more detailed investigation which involved assessing subject material and student experience for the seven ESD outcomes resulted in a 7.7 per cent sustainability integration into the FEIT undergraduate courses. SPSS produced tables showing individual competency distribution over course candidature year. Lifecycle assessment was invisible from the curriculum.Research limitations/implications Case study outcomes are limited to UTS, and therefore, specific-study outcomes cannot be generalised. This study attempted to trace sustainability learning outcomes through the curriculum. However, a more detailed study should also assess subject pedagogy and artefacts as these may enable or inhibit sustainability competency.Originality/value Study developed several methods to establish and evaluate subject level ESD claims. Academic staff and management are able to replicate methods of this study to map ESD within their courses, schools and/or faculties triggering conversation around ESD's actual integration within curriculum. Based on ESD distribution, specific intervention recommendations are proposed.

AB  - We propose a deep learning architecture capable of performing up to 8x single image super-resolution. Our architecture incorporates an adversarial component from the super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SRGANs) and a multi-scale learning component from the multiple scale super-resolution network (MSSRNet), which only together can recover smaller structures inherent in satellite images. To further enhance our performance, we integrate progressive growing and training to our network. This, aided by feed forwarding connections in the network to move along and enrich information from previous inputs, produces super-resolved images at scaling factors of 2, 4, and 8. To ensure and enhance the stability of GANs, we employ Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) during training. Experimentally, we find that our architecture can recover small objects in satellite images during super-resolution whereas previous methods cannot.

TI  - Fire-severity classification across temperate Australian forests: random forests versus spectral index thresholding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XXI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Machine learning and spectral index (SI) thresholding approaches have been tested for fire-severity mapping from local to regional scales in a range of forest types worldwide. While index thresholding can be easily implemented, its operational utility over large areas is limited as the optimum index may vary with forest type and fire regimes. In contrast, machine learning algorithms allow for multivariate fire classifications.This study compared the accuracy of fire-severity classifications from SI thresholding with those from Random Forests (RF). Reference data were from 3730 plots within the boundaries of eight major wildfires across the six temperate forest 'functional' groups of Victoria, south-eastern Australia.The reference plots were randomly divided into training and validation datasets (60/40) for each fire-severity class (unburnt, low, moderate, high) and forest functional group. SI fire-severity classifications were conducted using thresholds derived in a previous study based on the same datasets. A RF classification algorithm was trained to derive fire-severity levels based on appropriate spectral indices and their temporal difference.The RF classification outperformed the SI thresholding approach in most cases, increasing overall accuracy by 11% on a forest-group basis, and 16% on an individual wildfire basis. Adding more predictor variables into the RF algorithm did not improve classification accuracy. Greater overall accuracies (by 12% on average) were achieved when in situ data (rather than data from other fires) were used to train the RF algorithm. Our study shows the utility of Random Forest algorithms for streamlining fire-severity mapping across heterogeneous forested landscapes.

T2  - GEOGRAPHIA-UFF
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations of spectral response are directly related to the amount of aboveground biomass vegetation (stored) in addition to other pigments. We estimate the aboveground biomass vegetation through a relationship between aboveground biomass vegetation in grassland native collected in the field and remote sensing data in the hot and cold seasons of the period from 2012 to 2014. To estimate the biomass of grassland native air from spectral data, the data were related to amount of instant air field collected biomass during the period 2012 to 2014 versus the spectral response of vegetation data (measured by MODIS sensor). From the development of a temporal profile of data and a scatter plot between aboveground biomass values and spectral data, conducted analyses of correlation and linear regression analysis, noting the relationship between these two sets of data. In this way, it was observed a relationship between aboveground biomass and the indices EVI and NDVI and NIR spectral band, with highest values in summer and lower in winter. The correlation coefficient was significant for the bands of blue, red, NIR, EVI and NDVI. In this way, the resulting model demonstrated the applicability of MODIS images for the estimation of aboveground biomass of grassland vegetation.

AB  - Y Direct observation to study biodiversity can be time consuming, however, other methods often provide indirect measurements and are possibly biased. To solve these problems, images can be a useful tool and ecologists have started to rely more and more on images as a source of data and on automated image analysis. However, the existing methods mostly perform image classification. In this paper we present an efficient method based on object detection to access deeper information the content of an image. Using high resolution images, we built a pipeline to slice the original images, perform detections and later refine these observations. We illustrate the interest of this pipeline by using it on-field images taken in agroforestery banana-coffee systems to study invertebrate communities around the banana pests Cosmopolites sodidus and Metamasius sp. and the interactions between the different animals within this community. Experimental results show that our pipeline reaches 87.8% F1-score and allows us to successfully detect and identify 23 species and ant castes. These 23 species are divided into 7 super-classes, but the ant super-class, that shows more individuals and interactions is described more precisely. We are then able to study the interaction network between different species of this community and identify major predators of banana pests within this ecosystem.

TI  - Replacement of neuraminidase inhibitor-susceptible influenza A(H1N1) with resistant phenotype in 2008 and circulation of susceptible influenza A and B viruses during 2009-2013, South Africa
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Data on the susceptibility of influenza viruses from South Africa to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are scarce, and no extensive analysis was done. Objectives We aimed to determine oseltamivir and zanamivir susceptibility of influenza A and B virus neuraminidases (NAs), 2007-2013, South Africa. Patients/Methods We enrolled participants through national influenza-like illness surveillance, 2007-2013. Influenza diagnosis was by virus isolation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Drug susceptibility was determined by chemiluminescence-based NA-STAR/NA-XTD assay. Sanger sequencing was used to determine molecular markers of NAI resistance. Results Forty percent (6341/15 985) of participants were positive for influenza viruses using virus isolation (2007-2009) and qPCR (2009-2013) methods. A total of 1236/6341 (19.5%) virus isolates were generated of which 307/1236 (25%) were tested for drug susceptibility. During 2007-2008, the median 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of oseltamivir for seasonal influenza A(H1N1) increased from of 0.08 nmol/L (range 0.01-3.60) in 2007 to 73 nmol/L (range 1.56-305 nmol/L) in 2008. Influenza A isolates from 2009 to 2013 were susceptible to oseltamivir [A(H3N2) median IC50 = 0.05 nmol/L (range 0.01-0.08); A(H1N1)pdm09 = 0.11 nmol/L (range 0.01-0.78)] and zanamivir [A(H3N2) median IC50 = 0.56 nmol/L (range 0.47-0.66); A(H1N1)pdm09 = 0.35 nmol/L (range 0.27-0.533)]. Influenza B viruses were susceptible to both NAIs. NAI resistance-associated substitutions H275Y, E119V, and R150K (N1 numbering) were not detected in influenza A viruses that circulated in 2009-2013. Conclusions We confirm replacement of NAI susceptible by resistant phenotype influenza A(H1N1) in 2008. Influenza A and B viruses (2009-2013) remained susceptible to NAIs; therefore, these drugs are useful for treating influenza-infected patients.

M3  - Article
AB  - We are failing to protect the biosphere. Novel views of conservation, preservation, and sustainability are surfacing in the wake of consensus about our failures to prevent extinction or slow climate change. We argue that the interests and well-being of non-humans, youth, and future generations of both human and non-human beings (futurity) have too long been ignored in consensus-based, anthropocentric conservation. Consensus-based stakeholder-driven processes disadvantage those absent or without a voice and allow current adult humans and narrow, exploitative interests to dominate decisions about the use of nature over its preservation for futurity of all life. We propose that authentically non-anthropocentric worldviews that incorporate multispecies justice are needed for a legitimate, deliberative, and truly democratic process of adjudication between competing interests in balancing the preservation and use of nature. Legitimate arenas for such adjudication would be courts that can defend intergenerational equity, which is envisioned by many nations' constitutions, and can consider current and future generations of non-human life. We urge practitioners and scholars to disavow implicit anthropocentric value judgments in their work - or make these transparent and explicit - and embrace a more comprehensive worldview that grants future life on earth fair representation in humanity's decisions and actions today.

AB  - Remote Sensing satellite such as WorldView-4 has limitations in producing images that have advantages on both spectral and spatial resolution. This problem makes it necessary to divide the images into high spectral resolution multispectral (MS) and high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) images. The method of image fusing such as intensity hue-saturation (IHS) pansharpening causes spectral distortion. This drawback is caused by overusing the pixel values from a PAN image. In this study, a new method was proposed that integrating IHS-pansharpening with Singular Value Equalization (SVE) as equalization process and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for preserving edge and detail information of the PAN image. The SVE method equalizes values on PAN images by intensity values in the IHS transformation process. The spectral quality produced from the proposed method shows the superiority to the original method when tested using spectral quality metrices like: RAISE, Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Relative Dimensionless Synthesis Global Error (ERGAS).

AB  - The significant capability of synoptic coverage of satellite remote sensing data at the time of advent providing accurate and immediate valuable information on various aspects. The progressive development of remote sensing increases its capability to identify and map the precious and valuable materials and minerals. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) is classifiers of supervised classification for mapping and classification. The characteristic of SAM is based on similarity between image spectra and reference spectra on the behalf of tolerance level of specified maximum angle of threshold. In this research work SAM algorithms applied for mapping of Chhabadiya talc mineral. In this research work SAM algorithms defines the applicability of similarity of angle and value of threshold parameters of spectral angle which show capability to interpret or map the maximum and minimum abundance of talc minerals. For this research work Hyperion hyperspectral remote sensing data used for study of applicability and efficiency of SAM algorithms for mineral mapping. The quality and abundance of minerals completely depend on the minimum degree of SAM threshold parameter. Maximum spectral angle shows maximum mapping area with minimum similarity, but low spectral angle shows small and more abundant mapping area with maximum similarity in the hyperspectral image. Conclusion of this research work verify the identification of minerals are depend on the spectral and spectral characteristics of hyperspectral remote sensing data and mapping with qualitative abundance of minerals depend on the lower value of spectral angle and threshold of SAM algorithms or maximum similarity of spectra.

TI  - Multitemporal remote sensing data for classification of food crops plant phase using supervised random forest
T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Food crops monitoring in developing countries such as Indonesia plays an essential role to support national goals in food security and self-sufficiency. One of the fundamental challenges is plant phase classification task which could help to estimate yield before harvest. In contrast to the conventional field survey method which required a large amount of human and capital resources, we explore a more scalable, inexpensive and real-time method using publicly available remote sensing data, i. e. Landsat-8 satellite. Landsat-8 provides rich spatiotemporal features which could support the detection of numerous vegetation and crop-related indices. However, to accurately classify the plant phase, the existing features require additional spectral pattern from different seasons. We found out the existence of temporal autocorrelation among features of food crops plant phase. The aim of this study is to propose a supervised random forest for features engineering to select the best multitemporal features for the classification of rice plant phase. In this study, we focus on the rice plant phase classification in Banyuwangi Regency, Indonesia as a case study. The ground truth data are the monthly kerangka sampel area (KSA) of average rice plant phase at the regency level which officially released by BPS-Statistics Indonesia. The experimental result shows the accuracy of 0.573 with one temporal feature. Furthermore, incorporating four consecutive temporal features gives higher accuracy gain to 0.727 which shows the temporal autocorrelation. Based on the extensive evaluations, our findings and contributions in this study include: (1) insight to capture the temporal autocorrelation to increase the model accuracy (2) a machine learning classification model which is not sensitive to multicollinearity. Our proposed method provides the potential benefit for the government and statistical agencies towards a more scalable agricultural survey.

AB  - The paper describes the first step towards development of GMF for retrieval wind speed and wind stress in hurricanes basing on calibration of the cross-polarized satellite SAR images from Sentinel-1 by the collocated NOAA GPS dropsondes data. The self-similarity of the velocity profile "defect" in the boundary layer known from the fluid dynamics was used to retrieve the parameters of the atmospheric boundary layer (the surface wind velocity and the wind friction velocity) from the dropsonde wind velocity profiles in 10 major hurricanes. Basing on preliminary data processing, the dependencies of the cross-polarized NRCS on the wind speed and wind friction velocity were obtained to be used for constructing the GMFs.

AB  - To maintain the quality and productivity of cultivated pastures, it is necessary to make various kinds of management decisions in a timely manner These include alternation of pens, timing of the mowing of grass stands, application of fertilizers, etc. These decisions should be made based on reliable information about the current state of pastures, which should be assessed according to information from automated monitoring systems. Considering the large areas, to generate reliable information on the state of pastures, it is extremely important to use for these purposes means of remote sensing of the Earth (RSD) of various basing (satellite, aviation, surface). This paper presents a methodology for estimating the state parameters of pasture grass stands based on the integration of remote sensing data and ground-based measurements on test plots. Such integration is implemented in the optimal filtering algorithm, built based on mathematical models of the dynamics of the parameters of the state of herbage and optical measurements of remote sensing. To identify and quickly adapt the models, samples of plants and soil are taken from the test pasture sites. To estimate the spatial in homogeneity of the state parameters of the grass stands, the models were transformed for two-dimensional state variables and methods for obtaining estimates of grazing land were shown. For the development of spatial distribution of estimates, mathematical models were added with bidimensional variable numbers. Different approaches were suggested for their evaluations according to the images of electronic remote sensing. The results of evaluation can be used for making managing solutions, which are directed to keep the quality and the productivity of the pasture plant formation.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 18th International Scientific Conference on Engineering for Rural Development (ERD)
CL  - Jelgava, LATVIA
AB  - The development of the methods for assessing local areas of oppressed vegetation is shown. The field contours were refined according to the Earth remote sensing data (panchromatic, color and multispectral images of the earth's surface) using the complex of automatic decoding and vectorizing. After processing and evaluating the results, the raster orthomosaic is transformed into a set of vector linear objects, known as field contours. In addition to topographic interpretation, a multispectral classification is performed. For these purposes, statistical and textural characteristics were used on any raster channel or on virtual channels and calculated with the formula for computation of the NDVI. The initial information about the fields was used in official electronic resources, for example, the cadastral map of one part of the Stavropol Territory. Aerial photographs of the territory with a topographic interpretation were taken to assess and refine the pasture contours. Selection of local areas of oppressed vegetation on the pasture under the influence of various negative factors and classification of leaf lesions were based on the assessment of the NDVI field change diagram for the period of time from February to November of the current year by detecting and analyzing the NDVI map and the map of the visible frequency range.In order to research the effectiveness of using the pastures during the production season, the development indicators of 4-month young sheep of the Manych Merino breed were researched. In case of decreasing the level of plant biomass on the pasture, when the indicators of the vegetative index were equal to 0.20...0.40, the level of average daily live weight growth of the young animals under control decreased to 0.099 +/- 0.03 (kg).

TI  - How Does Land Use/Land Cover Map's Accuracy Depend on Number of Classification Classes?
T2  - SOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - A land use/land cover map is an important input for different applications. However, the accuracy of land cover maps remains a great uncertainty and mapping accuracy assessment is not well-documented. The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between overall accuracy and the number of classification classes by conducting a literature review of land coved land use studies. The results revealed a weak negative correlation between the map's accuracy and the number of classes. The paper suggests a decrease of 0.77% map's overall accuracy with respect to the increase of 1 land cover class. The average overall accuracy produced by 05 sensor types does not show the big difference. In addition, high spatial resolution sensor such as Airborne might not be always advantageous for producing high overall accuracy map since its accuracy depends on several factors including the number of land cover classes.

AB  - Ecology is a science dealing with relations of living organisms with the environment and the ways of sustaining the harmonious balance in the world. Ecological approach determines the attitude of the people to the environment, it is the basis of their worldview, their behavior and culture. Ecologically oriented economy management and human behavior mean tendency of the mankind to nature preserving and keeping their environment healthy. Using ethnocultural experience helps to save financial, human, and natural resources, contributes to ecologization of industry and agriculture, and to spread ecological culture among the population. It was stated that ethnocultural inheritance of the Slavs contains a whole set of economic and everyday-life domestic rules of dealing with the environment, with the nature. " Ecological inclusion" of people in the natural environment helped to avoid stress, strain, conflicts in the society and conflicts of the society with the nature. Ecological experience of the Slavs is to be used in the process of ecologization of agricultural production and everyday life, as well as in development of ecological education and enlightening.

AB  - The NASA Physical Oceanography DAAC (PO.DAAC) serves as one of the premier repositories for oceanographic satellite data. More recently, however, it is also increasingly archiving and distributing complementary in situ datasets from NASA-sponsored field campaigns. Here we present an overview of these projects, the complex multivariate data they produce, and some of the data interoperability challenges faced when dealing with such a heterogeneous suite of observations. We summarize the range of online tools and services currently available via the PODAAC, including data discovery services, web-services for subsetting/extraction, compliance checking and visualization. We also preview some new capabilities under development that may feature in future. These efforts are indicative of an evolution of DAAC services in pursuit of our broader vision: a more integrated approach to multi-sensor oceanographic data access and delivery spanning NASA satellite missions and field campaigns in support of science and applications for societal benefit.

AB  - It is studied the plume response, formed by the Danube River in the North-Western part of the Black Sea, to the wind forcing. Two cases are considered: the wind of the N-NE and S-SW directions. The plume evolution, alongshore flow formation and suspended matter transfer are analyzed on the base of satellite data at a wavelength of 551 nm for these two wind forcing scenarios. The coastal current dynamics and formation of Danube plume and salinity front are studied on the basis of 3D numerical model which was adapted to the conditions of the North-Western shelf. The obtained results from the satellite data analysis are compared with results of numerical simulation of plume formation under the action of wind in order to estimate the model sensitivity to variations of the wind direction and of the wind speed magnitude.

AB  - The article substantiates the relevance of ethno-sociological and socio-psychological research of worldview, issues of self-identification, as well as the needs and expectations of modern youth. The aim of the research was to study the value systems, the most important stereotypes and mythologies prevalent among young people. At the same time, civil initiatives of the youth of the North Caucasus are analyzed in the deveplopment of the socio-political and cultural spheres. On the example of the activity of youth parliamentarism, aspects of the implementation of regional youth policy are considered. The novelty of socio-psychological research is that in modern society the process of socialization of young people is complicated by the factors that arise as a result of the reassessment of traditional attitudes and norms. At the same time, the family remains an extrinsic value for the younger generation, and in their future life they strive to create their own happy family.In the course of the study, 506 respondents from the cities of Stavropol and Vladikavkaz, aged 1630, were interview. It was revealed that with ideological identification, young people in the region have little interest in politics - a third of the respondents are categorical in their denial of interest in politics, more than a quarter show little interest. The results of the study are considered in the context of significant indicators for the modern youth of the North Caucasus: family, authority, career, good work and business. The last thing - the popularity and compliance with fashion trends. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

TI  - Implementation of Aerosol-Cloud Interaction within WRF-CHIMERE Online Coupled Model: Evaluation and Investigation of the Indirect Radiative Effect from Anthropogenic Emission Reduction on the Benelux Union
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The indirect effects of aerosol are particularly important over regions where meteorological conditions and aerosol content are favourable to cloud formation. This was observed during the Intensive Cloud Aerosol Measurement Campaign (IMPACT) (European Integrated project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air quality Interaction (EUCAARI) project) in the Benelux Union during May 2008. To better understand this cloud formation variability, the indirect effects of aerosol have been included within the WRF-CHIMERE online model. By comparing model results to the aircraft measurements of IMPACT, to surface measurements from EMEP and AIRBASE and to MODIS satellite measurements, we showed that the model is able to simulate the variability and order of magnitude of the observed number of condensation nuclei (CN), even if some differences are identified for specific aerosol size and location. To quantify the impact of the local anthropogenic emissions on cloud formation, a sensitivity study is performed by halving the surface emissions fluxes. It is shown that the indirect radiative effect (IRE) at the surface is positive for both shortwave and longwave with a net warming of +0.99 W/m(2). In addition, important instantaneous changes are modelled at local scale with up to +/- 6 degrees C for temperatures and +/- 50 mm/day for precipitation.

AB  - Economic theory as an independent science arose in the period of the formation of modem market relations. The economic thought history as a separate branch in the system of economic sciences took shape in the first half of the XIX century. The tradition of Russian economic thought at all stages of its development was attention to historical trends and factors of socioeconomic development. The reason for this is in the specifics of Russia's socioeconomic and spiritual development. XIX century is characterized by the struggle of old and new trends in the economic system of Russia. In these conditions, representatives of various branches of economic thought appealed to the historical experience of the country and humanity in order to prove the truth of their position. The paper presents an analysis the historical process of emergence, development, struggle, and the changing of economic ideas. The main attention is paid to the analysis of the main directions of modem economic theory underlying the decision-making at macro and microeconomic levels. The content of the historical and economic knowledge functions: worldview, practical, axiological, factual and methodological, is defined. The necessity of studying the provisions of alternative economic schools is substantiated, what is considered as a prerequisite for the formation of general cultural and professional competencies of specialists in the field of economics.

AB  - Monitoring flood is an important task for disaster management. It requires to distinguish between changes related to water from the other changes. We address such an issue by relying on both spatial and intensity information. To do so, we exploit min-tree that emphasize intensity extrema in a multiscale, efficient framework. We thus suggest a two-step approach operating on satellite image time series. We first perform a temporal analysis to identify images containing possible floods. Then a spatial analysis is achieved to detect flood areas on the selected images. Both steps relies on the analysis of component attributes extracted from the min-tree representation. We conduct some experiments on a flooded scene observed through Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The results show that flood areas can be efficiently and accurately characterized with spatial component attributes extracted from hierarchical representations from SAR time series.

AB  - Morphological attribute profiles have been one of the most effective image features for spatial-spectral classification of remote sensing images during the last decade. The motivation of this paper is to extend attribute profiles to satellite image time series, i.e. taking into account the temporal information. We introduce different approaches and report their performances for land cover mapping. Experiments are conducted on a Sentinel-2 dataset considering well-established supervised classification methods that are Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event (JURSE)
CL  - Vannes, FRANCE
AB  - Monitoring urban growth and change is an important task for urban planning and disaster management. While several change detection approaches have been proposed to deal with growing urban areas, their performances are usually limited due to outliers in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). In this study, in order to discriminate urban growth from the other changes, we exploit spatial connectivity of the changed pixels. To do so, we first stack SITS to a single synthetic image whose pixel values denote the temporal variability along the series. Then, we propose to rely on efficient and well-established spatial filtering by means of the max-tree image representation, leading to a novel approach for detecting changes in urban areas, and more precisely focusing on the spatial extent of such changes in relationship with the urban growth. Experimental results obtained on Landsat imagery of Dar es Salaam showed that our approach helps to remove outliers from the change map and provides satisfactory accuracy.

TI  - Perennial snow patch detection based on remote sensing data on Trollaskagi Peninsula, northern Iceland
T2  - JOKULL
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of permafrost distribution in Iceland is still limited and current knowledge is mainly based on small scale observations and regional modelling using temperature data. In the Alps Perennial Snow Patches have been considered to protect permafrost from solar radiation and are used as an indicator for the occurrence of local permafrost. In this study perennial snow fields are detected and classified based on aerial and satellite images. Effects of climatic and topographic factors on the snow field occurrence are investigated aiming to provide insight into the distribution of local permafrost in northern Iceland. Multi-temporal optical satellite images (Landsat-5/-7/-8 and Sentinel-2, 1984-2017) have revealed a time-variable distribution of perennial snow patches as possible permafrost indicators on the Trollaskagi Peninsula in northern Iceland. Calculated normalized difference snow index in combination with different threshold values at the end of summer season within six selected study areas show that several snow patches are present in a time period of over 30 years. Perennial snow patches in the study areas exhibit strong fluctuations in extent due to different local characteristics, e.g. elevation, aspect or topography (plateau/open slopes vs. valleys/cirques). In three of the six study areas snow patches have a high probability of occurrence and the pattern of the distribution is very similar in each time period. Comparison with climate data from nearby weather stations indicates that perennial snow patches can be used in combination with mean annual air temperatures as indicators for local permafrost distributions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft use a sunlit solar diffuser (SD), with an optional SD attenuation screen (SDS), to calibrate the reflective solar bands. A solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM) is used to track the SD reflectance degradation on orbit, by taking a ratio of the detector response when viewing the SD compared to the response when viewing the sun. The MODIS SDSMs have been operated both with and without the SDS in place. The SDSMs have also been operated in both a fixed and an alternating mode. In the alternating mode, the SDSM detectors view the SD, sun, and a dark background in an alternating pattern with the view changing on every MODIS scan within a single orbit. In the fixed mode, the SDSM detectors are fixed on the sun view for one orbit, and then are fixed on the SD view for the following orbit. This paper reviews the history of the SDSM operational configurations used throughout the MODIS missions and discusses the differences in the SD degradation results, which may be due to differences in sun-satellite geometry, SD signal level, and stray light effects. We highlight Aqua SDSM results from two recent dates in October 2017 and July 2019, where both the fixed and alternating mode calibrations were run on the same day, providing clear examples of the calibration differences. Additionally, we show how mixing the results from calibrations done with and without the SDS for Aqua MODIS can provide more stable results.

TI  - MAPPING BUILT-UP AREAS USING TWO BAND RATIO ON LANDSAT IMAGERY OF ACCRA IN GHANA FROM 1980 TO 2017
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lack of historical land cover and urban growth governance structure makes spatial planning within the economic capitals of developing countries difficult. Monitoring urban built-up growth with in-situ methods is complicated. In this paper, long-term Landsat archive is utilised to map the built-up areas of Accra, the economic capital of Ghana, in Africa. Simple two band ratio and band combination is coupled with historic Google Earth imagery to monitor built-up dynamics from 1980-2017. A 10-year period was sub-divided into three parts each; early period, mid period and late period for analysis. Maximum Likelihood classifier was used for the classification within the ENVI environment. The results show 11.90% as the highest and 4.63% as the lowest built-up growth rates between 2001-2005 and 1996-2000 respectively. Annual loss of non-built-up areas was 1.31%, and 48.57% over the entire study period. Water bodies lost 0.08% annually but 3.1% over the 37-year period. Highest and lowest overall accuracy were 87.18% and 81.31% respectively, with an average kappa coefficient of 0.7618. Gain in the built-up area was 1676.69 km(2) but non-built up areas lost 1576.10 km(2) while water bodies lost 100.60 km(2). Results will be of interest to spatial planners, policy makers and land administrators.

AB  - Actively responding to the key problems of modernity, comprehending relevant sociocultural processes and history, acting as a translator of cultural codes, stereotypes, influencing the worldview of the audience, cinema is one of the central cores in mass audiovisual communication. The flow of film criticism provides filmmakers with a presence in the infosphere, lobbies their interests, attracts distributors and audiences to film production, and promotes films outside national markets. The abundance of information leads to the development of specific forms of media texts. They allow the most optimal structure of content. The development of a repertoire of non-verbal elements of media texts allows optimizing communication. The strengthening of the role of these elements of communication is concerned with the visualization of the pragmatic component of media texts, as well as withthe tendency ofthe unified representation of content. In this work, changes in the field of graphic norm are noted and the functional specialization of non-verbal components in cinema media texts identified.

TI  - Evaluation of CLARA-A2 and ISCCP-H Cloud Cover Climate Data Records over Europe with ECA&D Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are of high importance for the climate system but they still remain one of its principal uncertainties. Remote sensing techniques applied to satellite observations have assisted tremendously in the creation of long-term and homogeneous data records; however, satellite data sets need to be validated and compared with other data records, especially ground measurements. In the present study, the spatiotemporal distribution and variability of Total Cloud Cover (TCC) from the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) Cloud, Albedo And Surface Radiation dataset from AVHRR data-edition 2 (CLARA-A2) and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project H-series (ISCCP-H) is analyzed over Europe. The CLARA-A2 data record has been created using measurements of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument onboard the polar orbiting NOAA and the EUMETSAT MetOp satellites, whereas the ISCCP-H data were produced by a combination of measurements from geostationary meteorological satellites and the AVHRR instrument on the polar orbiting satellites. An intercomparison of the two data records is performed over their common period, 1984 to 2012. In addition, a comparison of the two satellite data records is made against TCC observations at 22 meteorological stations in Europe, from the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D). The results indicate generally larger ISCCP-H TCC with respect to the corresponding CLARA-A2 data, in particular in the Mediterranean. Compared to ECA&D data, both satellite datasets reveal a reasonable performance, with overall mean TCC biases of 2.1 and 5.2% for CLARA-A2 and ISCCP-H, respectively. This, along with the higher correlation coefficients between CLARA-A2 and ECA&D TCC, indicates the better performance of CLARA-A2 TCC data.

TI  - Archaic Elements in the Epic "Dzhangar"
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kalmyk Baga Tsokhor Cycle of the epic "Dzhangar" is constituted by core themes and motifs of the archaic epic that form respective plots. The paper examines the motifs of 'swallower', 'recovery', 'magic invulnerability', 'soul beyond body', and 'command of natural phenomena' that trace origin to archaic ceremonies and rituals. The study proves that in the cycle under consideration these motifs are largely manifested with the image of Baatar (Hero) Khongor, e.g., after a complete initiation procedure ('isolation' - the hero gets swallowed by a huge taimen; 'temporary death' - in hostile lands they perform a ritual of sending him to the other world; 'resurrection' - Khan Dzhangar extracts him from the fish's stomach and cures with a magic remedy) the hero gets immortality and commands over natural forces. Khongor's immortality can be explained by that during the narrative his soul actually separates from the body. The most extended description of immortality is to be traced in depictions of the enemy when there put indications of its, about even consecutive stages / layers explained ('his life / stamina - on the mountain, under the tree, in the doe's womb, inside its golden calf'). Command of natural phenomena, such as rainmaking through use of certain spells or of the magic stone 'zade', were ritual practices based on magic powers of humans. According to ancient beliefs, man could contact master spirits of nature and, thus, influence natural forces. The depicted archaic ceremonies and rituals attended by Baatar Khongor mirror the pre-Buddhist worldview of the Kalmyks, thus evidencing that songs of the Baga Tsokhor Cycle are based on core motifs of the archaic epic belonged to the preceding cultural tradition.

First, the authors discuss Freedom's Journal, next by Freedom's Journal Magazine, and finally illustrate Freedom's Journal Institute. The authors will show how the original purpose of Freedom's Journal's message about the struggle of African Americans has never change, whilevits media continues to remain current from a four page newspaper, to an online resource with its own television and radio channel, which is turning at present into a social political organization. Freedom's Journal Magazine, which is online media devoted to the research, education, and the advancement of public policy that promotes: Responsible government, Individual liberty and fidelity, Strong Family Values, and Economic Empowerment (R.I.S.E Principles), with a biblical worldview. The media takes its name and mission after Freedom's Journal. Freedom's Journal was the first African American newspaper of the XIX c. owned, operated and devoted to African Americans. Freedom's Journal is the first African-American newspaper published by African Americans about African Americans and for African Americans during the period of slavery abolition in the North and its preservation in the South. Being Abolitionary, the periodical argued in favor of the African American community, it served as an information protection tool. (c) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

TI  - Expression of Ki-67 and Estrogen Receptor Beta in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma as a Potential Indicator of Regional Lymph Node Positivity
T2  - APPLIED IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR MORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the early stages of cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM), it is extremely difficult to predict adequately the risk from hematogenic and lymphatic metastasis. We investigate whether the immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67 and estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) in cells of MM could predict the status of regional lymph nodes. A total of 55 tissue samples of primary cutaneous melanomas with known status of regional lymph nodes were retrospectively evaluated for Ki-67 and ER beta expression by quantitative immunohistochemistry and then correlated with the status of regional lymph nodes and relevant clinicopathologic parameters. The ER beta-positive expression was detected in 38 of 55 tumors (69.09%). The Clark level showed a strong correlation with ER beta expression, as well as pT stage. All cases of MM showed Ki-67-positive expression and an elevated Ki-67 expression was strongly associated with increased Breslow thickness, Clark level, ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, number of mitosis, and pT stage. Logistic regression analysis showed that when ER beta levels increase by 1%, the risk of positive lymph nodes decreases by 7% (odds ratio=0.930; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.99; P=0.036), and, when the Ki-67 expression increases by 1%, the risk of lymph nodes' positivity increases by 10% (odds ratio=1.108; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.19; P=0.009). Correlation between expression of Ki-67 and ER beta and the status of lymph nodes has better prognostic significance than the relationship between melanoma thickness and the status of lymph nodes. Our study showed a significant prognostic value of Ki-67 expression in predicting the behavior of MM and the potential prognostic significance of ER beta.

AB  - The study aims to highlight the limits and advantages of two types of remote sensing measurements for the study of urban heat island (UHI) effect at meso- and micro-scales (10(2)-10(3) m(2)) for a medium-size city. The study focuses on Craiova, located in the South-West region of Romania and characterized by a continental-temperate climate with hot summers. The analysis utilizes satellite-based data from MODIS (Land Surface Temperature (LST), Land Cover Type (LCT)) and measurements obtained with the infrared thermovision technique (ITT) in selected days of July 2015, 2016 and 2017 in 6 locations of the city center. Additionally, micro-scale measurements of air temperature and humidity, performed simultaneously with the ITT-based measurements, are available. The analysis focuses on the comparison (e.g. temporal evolution, correlation) between satellite-derived data and ITT-based measurements, as well as on their relationship with air temperature measured at the meteorological station Craiova and at the 6 locations of the city center. The results emphasize the fine-scale characteristics of UHI due to the strong impact of urban built/green small area and the associated thermal discomfort for the pedestrian.

TI  - Distribution of Precipitation Depending on Synoptic Scale Disturbances with Satellite Estimate Comparisons in the Japanese Alps Area during Warm Seasons
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI
M3  - Article
AB  - Gauge-based hourly precipitation data during the 2015-2016 warm seasons in central Japan observed with the Japan Meteorological Agency AMeDAS network and the Japanese Alps Inter-University Cooperation Project (JALPS) mountain observation network are archived. Gauge data are compared to satellite precipitation data (GSMaP_MVK and GPM/DPR) produced by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The distributions of precipitation measured in gauges depend on synoptic scale disturbances showing areas of regional increases/decreases affected by large mountain ranges without year-to-year variability, except for a composite of typhoon cases. Differences in precipitation amounts are less than 2 mm/d depending on satellite product version or timing of passive microwave observations. Larger precipitation amounts of GSMaP_ MVK estimated at more than 2 mm/d are distributed over inner mountain areas and northern coastal areas along the Sea of Japan, and larger amounts of gauge-measured precipitation are distributed in central Gifu and Shizuoka Prefectures. The underestimate of local sporadic heavy precipitation in mountainous areas obtained from GSMaP_MVIC data was expected depending on shallow convections. Further strategies are discussed for conducting case studies to reveal the causes of discrepancies between gauge-measured and satellite-indicated precipitation.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF FULL AND DEFICIT IRRIGATION APPLIED AT DIFFERENT GROWTH STAGES OF EGGPLANT (<i>SOLANUM MELONGENA</i> L.) ON YIELD AND YIELD COMPONENTS UNDER SUB-HUMID CONDITIONS
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the relationship between irrigation water applied at different growth stages and yield/yield components of the eggplant (cultivar Pala 49) and to determine the most critical growth periods of the plant as a response to irrigation during 2016 and 2017 years under the sub humid conditions of Yalova, Turkey. Growth stages of eggplant are vegetative (V), flowering (F), yield formation (Y), and ripening (R). Experimental treatments were determined as non-irrigation (control), full irrigation (VFYR) and 14 different deficit irrigation treatments (V, F, Y, R, VF, VR, YR, FY, VY, FR, FYR, VYR, VFR, VFY). The highest seasonal evapotranspiration (average 735 mm) was obtained from the VFYR treatment. Deficit irrigation practices applied during different growth stages have different effects on yield and yield components. The highest water use efficiency (WUE) (average 6.35 kg m(-3)) was obtained from V treatment. The highest plant height (96.5 cm) and plant diameter (14.9 mm) were obtained from the VFYR treatment as average numbers of two experimental years. Since fruit length (average 22.5 cm), fruit diameter (average 63.4 mm) and maximum yield (average 4143.2 kg) were obtained from the VFYR treatment, it was concluded that this irrigation treatment would be the best choice under local conditions. Since VFY treatment which gave the best statistical results following VFYR, it may also be recommended as a good option for water short areas.

AB  - The merging of images obtained by satellites through remote sensing has evoked into an established protocol. In popular parlance such blending is known as image fusion. This is done chiefly because it gives myriad advantages. Image fusion comes in extremely useful in the observation, study and analysis of diverse fields, including environment, agriculture and other related areas. In essence, what happens in image fusion is that the needed data or information is gleaned from numerous images. These images then are coalesced to form fewer pictures. The ideal, of course, is the blending of them into a lone picture. This is highly sought-after because the image thus intermingled is said to contain all relevant data and, moreover, is more suitable and error free than an image secured from one single source. Needless to say, it also incorporates all the information that is needed. Besides this, there are other benefits. For one, it curtails the volume of data. For another, it produces images that are pertinent and apt. This paper's chief objective is to proffer a suggested methodology on the fusion between the capabilities of optical and microwave satellite images and to improve the visible quality of Landsat image.

TI  - Data Processing, Feature Extraction, and Time-Series Analysis of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery: Examples from Damghan and Bajestan Playa (Iran)
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the Sentinel-1 satellites of the Copernicus Mission of the European Space Agency a new C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system operates and acquires data suited for continued earth observation. The so called Interferometric Wide Swath mode realizes a high spatial resolution of less than fifteen meters and offers a large swath width of about 250 km and therefore overcomes existing limitations. The Sentinel-1 Mission offers the opportunity to extensively investigate the temporal and spatial dimension of surface alterations and to recognize, quantify and monitor changes related to active morphodynamics; preferably in arid and semi-arid regions where the influence of volume and random scattering processes on the SAR signal are minimized. With a focused operation time of more than one decade, the Sentinel-1 Mission has potential to essentially contribute to an increased understanding of earth's dynamic processes. The contribution highlights the processing and application of Sentinel-1 data in time series analyses via the terrain corrected gamma nought intensity and the interferometric coherence for the investigation period from March 2015 to January 2017 in the surroundings of Damghan Playa and Bajestan Playa, Iran. Both SAR features showed to be sensitive to the state and dynamic of the arid land surface. Especially the standard deviation of the temporal dimension of both features revealed as suited indicator when assessing the distribution and magnitude of active dynamics. The approach is therefore promising for the monitoring and characterization of morphodynamic events. However, further validation - including the comparison to in situ collected data - is necessary. As well, transferability to other arid, semi-arid and semi-humid sites must be investigated in future research, along with the general constrains that arise from the SAR acquisition, e.g. geometric distortions, or speckle. Finally, future work must address questions on the size and magnitude of detectable events and the land surface parameters that predominantly alter the signal.

AB  - In this paper, the authors aim to combine the latest state of the art models in image recognition with the best publicly available satellite images to create a system for landslide risk mitigation. We focus first on landslide detection and further propose a similar system to be used for prediction. Such models are valuable as they could easily be scaled up to provide data for hazard evaluation, as satellite imagery becomes increasingly available. The goal is to use satellite images and correlated data to enrich the public repository of data and guide disaster relief efforts for locating precise areas where landslides have occurred. Different image augmentation methods are used to increase diversity in the chosen dataset and create more robust classification. The resulting outputs are then fed into variants of 3-D convolutional neural networks. A review of the current literature indicates there is no research using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and freely available satellite imagery for classifying landslide risk. The model has shown to be ultimately able to achieve a significantly better than baseline accuracy.

TI  - Detecting Potential Biodiversity Hotspots for Development of REDD+ Safeguards Based on Analyses of Land-Cover Complexity in East Java, Indonesia
T2  - AGRIVITA
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined a new method to detect the biodiversity hotspots in terms of complex patch mosaics at a regional scale in East Java, Indonesia, in order to develop the safeguard against further expansion of monocultures by REDD+. A land-cover map consisting of five major land-cover types (forest, agricultural land, bare land, water, and residential) was generated with a 30 m x 30 m resolution by the unsupervised classification of a Landsat8-OLI image. Shannon's diversity index (H') was calculated for each of 10.98 ha (11 x 11 pixels) landscape throughout the study area based on the dominance of the land-cover types by five calculation methods with different combinations of land-cover types. Then, the landscapes of upper 5% in H' was selected as the potential hotspots in terms of highly complex patch mosaics. Among the five potential hotspots, the calculation of H' with four land-cover types (forest, agriculture, water and bare land) was thought to be most suitable to set conservation targets at a regional scale, because the potential hotspots by this method showed aggregated distribution patterns, and was less sensitive to the small residential patches. While, no clear distribution trend was observed along the environmental gradients stage.

CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Topographic feature is one of the several factors affecting the distortion of the real reflectance value of objects. Digital processing used the surface reflectance values of satellite imagery needs the corrected images with the most minimized disturbances, hence several topographic correction methods using digital elevation data have been developed. This study examined the different result of topographic correction from several available elevation data in Indonesia, including SRTM DEM, topographic map (RBI), and DEMNAS. Sun-Canopy-Sensor+C (SCS+C) correction using different DEMs was applied on Landsat-8 data over Menoreh Mountains, Indonesia. The results obtained showed that DEMNAS produced the most topographically normalized images based on statistical and visual analysis. The availability of DEMNAS throughout Indonesia is the advantage to be used as an input of this pre-processing method. However, it needs to be examined first since the quality is not surely similar to our study site.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th International Symposium on LAPAN-IPB Satellite (LISAT)
CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) is an emerging approach in remote sensing image analysis and classification which relies on segments or objects created by a group of pixels on the image. GEOBIA has been utilized for many remote sensing applications with various degree of success. However, from the literature, its application for landform analysis and classification is still rare. This study aims to test GEOBIA interpretation capabilities to identify landform in part of Opak Watershed (Central Java, Indonesia) using Landsat 8 OLI and DEMNAS imagery (30 and 8-meters pixel size, respectively) and evaluate the result. Both image data were fused to create an image with high spectral and spatial resolution and contains elevation data, as an input for the segmentation process. GEOBIA interpretation process was performed gradually; first, initial Multiresolution Segmentation Algorithm was conducted to identify the variation of slope found in the study site. Then, the slope segments/objects were used to identify landform using Ruleset-Based Classification considering the image object information including object values, pattern, shape, and other parameters. The accuracy of the result was evaluated based on the percentage accuracy of the landform classification. From this study, we found that fusion-image and GEOBIA are capable of distinguishing landform elements very well with the percentage of overall accuracy is 89%. This result shows that GEOBIA has potential in identifying and classifying landform objects.

TI  - Model-based target classification using polarimetric similarity with coherency matrix elements
T2  - IEICE COMMUNICATIONS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric similarity is a parameter for measuring the similarity between two scattering mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based target classification technique using a compensated polarimetric similarity parameter between two coherency matrices. In general, the ensemble average coherency matrix elements have magnitude imbalance, thus the contribution degree to the polarimetric similarity differs for each element. We illustrate how to compensate the contribution degree, and then the proposed method is tested on L-band fully polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data sets by using 4 theoretical scattering models (surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, volume scattering, and 22.5 degrees oriented dihedral scattering). The classification results show that the new compensation scheme serves to better classification.

AB  - The detection of the road is one of an area of satellite image classification. The satellite image classification plays a vital role in various area of monitoring different resources available on the earth surface. Here, the high-resolution satellite data from Google earth is acquired from a different region of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India region for detection of road. This research paper used two different algorithms i.e. radial basis function neural network and Naive Bayes classifiers for the detection of reading features from the high-resolution satellite image. Both algorithms are implemented using the Matlab simulation toolbox. Radial Basis Function and Naive Bayes is a supervised classification technique applied on High-Resolution Satellite Image. Extraction of Road from the satellite image is a very difficult task because in the rural areas there are many unstructured roads which may consist of mud and concrete. After applying the algorithms on the image high-resolution satellite, the accuracy of classifiers is calculated using confusion matrix and Kappa coefficient. The accuracy of Naive Bayes found to be 91% with Kappa Value 0.698 and the accuracy of radial basis function found to be 99% with a Kappa value of 0.9831. The accuracy calculation using confusion matrix and Kappa value shows that the radial basis function neural network classifier is better than Naive Bayes classifiers for the detection of the road using high-resolution satellite image.

A unique public relations campaign was initiated by the prime minister Modi which was aired on All India Radio from October 2014 till March 2019. Typically, initial 100 days for a leader after joining the critical position are considered to be significant, and thus we aimed to understand the critical rhetorical appeal-pathos used by Prime Minister's public relations campaign Mann Ki Baat. An analytical framework is also proposed to accomplish the investigation. The public relations scholars, practitioners, and academia will be the primary beneficiary and can utilize the proposed framework to explore the pathos in the unstructured data. (C) 2020 The Authors.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - With more than seven years in space, S-NPP VIIRS has been rigorously calibrated and validated. The global coverage of VIIRS has been doubled after the launch of NOAA-20 in November 2017. Since no direct SNO exist between SNPP and NOAA-20, radiometric consistency between VIIRS sensors onboard these satellites can be quantified through double differencing. This study performs geo-leo interccomparison using SNOs between GOES-16 ABI and VIIRS instruments. A past study suggested that NOAA-20 VIIRS has nearly -2% bias relative to S-NPP for most of the VNIR bands. Similarly, GOES-16 ABI comparison with S-NPP VIIRS using field campaign data over Sonoran desert in the past indicated a large discrepancy (more than 6%) for ABI band 2 (0.86 mu m). This paper attempts to fulfill two major purposes, one is to evaluate the temporal radiometric consistency between VIIRS and ABI and the other is to quantify the radiometric consistency between the two VIIRS instruments through double differencing using ABI as a reference. SNOs over the ocean are analyzed to quantify the bias for both NOAA-20 VIIRS and ABI relative to S-NPP using ray matching technique. The impact on bias due to spectral differences will be corrected using spectral band adjustment factors estimated using hyperspectral measurements from instruments such as Sciamachy.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - This paper investigates the problem of blind noise parameters estimation (BNPE) of multispectral/hyperspectral images (M/HSI) using deep convolutional neural networks. In contrast to single-band images, M/HSI possess property of inter-band correlation that can effectively improve quality and accuracy of BNPE. Therefore, in this work, we extend a previously proposed CNN for BNPE of single-band images, called NoiseNet, to vector case. The proposed vNoiseNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be applied to three-band images including RGB images from Digital Single-Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras, and subsets of M/HSI bands. Training data for the proposed CNN were obtained from three sources: calibrated images captured by DSLR Nikon D80 camera, AVIRIS data with accurately estimated noise parameters, and Sentinel-2 data with synthetic noise. The vNoiseNet estimates both sub-band (component) image noise variance and uncertainty of this estimate from 32x32x3 image patches. On the basis of a set of such estimates, both signal-independent (SI) and signal-dependent (SD) noise component parameters can be robustly estimated. Experiments on NED2012 database, AVIRIS data and Sentinel-2 data demonstrate high accuracy of the proposed CNN.

AB  - Drought is one of the major natural disasters in Thailand, causing significant damage as it greatly affects farming, mostly in the northeastern region of Thailand. The objective of this study was to present a drought analysis using data from the Terra Modis satellite and spectral index in the upper northeastern study area, approximately 52,504.65 km(2). In operation the Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) was analyzed, based on calculations from the normalized differences vegetation index (NDVI) values Terra Modis satellite to examine the distribution of plants during 2014-2016. The study found that the largest drought area was in the year 2014, representing 93.12% (or 48,892.33 km(2)), followed by the year 2015 representing 87.02% (or 45,689.54 km(2)), and the year 2016 representing 86.42% (or 45,374.51 km(2)), respectively. The three-year SVI analysis results showed that the statistical correlation of rainfall during the same period is high. The results of this study indicated that drought analysis based on data from Terra Modis effectively identified the patterns of drought-prone areas.

T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI AGROMETEOROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil heat flux (G) is an important component of energy balance by constraining the available amount of latent heat and sensible heat. There are many methods and formulations in the literature to estimate G accurately. In this study, widely used G estimation models are chosen to test. The models are based on Spectral Vegetation Indices (SVIs) namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) together with leaf area index (LAI), and crop height. Two successive growing periods of winter wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and maize (Zea mays L.) fields, located in the northwest part of Turkey, are used. Midday values (average of 09:30- 13:30) of G and net radiation (R-n) used in order to capture the time period, when G is proven to be much dominant. According to the results, overall the best relation obtained with an exponential NDVI model with a determination coefficient value of 0.83 and a root mean square (RMS) error value of 20.28 Wm(-2) for maize. For winter wheat, G is predicted the best with SAVI based model (r(2) =0.74), and for sunflower, LAI based model worked best with 0.75 r(2) value. Crop height (CH) based nonlinear regression G model that suggested in this study worked better than linear models suggested in the literature with a better determination coefficient (r(2) =0.70) and a lower RMS error value (10.8 Wm(-2)).

AB  - The purpose of this study is to estimate high temporal and high spatial resolution land surface temperature (LST) over different surface types in urban regions. The goal is to estimate high resolution LST by combining Landsat 8 and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R) infrared- based LST. Landsat 8 provides higher spatial resolution (30 m) estimates of skin temperature every 16 days. However, GOES-R which has lower spatial resolution (2 km) has much higher temporal resolution (5 min). The research project aims to match the dates that both GOES-R and Landsat LSTs to find their spatial relationship to develop the downscaling of GOES-R LST. The downscaling approach will account for systematic biases between Landsat and GOES-R LST products.

AB  - Sentinel 2 (S2) satellite provides a systematic global coverage of land surfaces, measuring physical properties within 13 spectral intervals at a temporal resolution of 5 days. Computer-based data analysis is highly required to extract similarity by processing and assist human understanding and semantic annotation in support of Earth surface mapping. This paper proposes an exploratory search methodology for S2 data underpinning both visual and latent characteristics by means of data visualization and content representation. For optimized results, the authors focus on a detailed assessment of top relevant state-of-the-art algorithms for features extraction and classification to determine which one could handle best the characteristics of S2 data.

AB  - The article considers the possibility of application of open cartographic materials for the analysis of reforestation on the territory of Sosnovsky subdivision of forest district in Priozersky district of the Leningrad region, after felling with a limitation of more than 15 years. With the increase in the pace of technological development, there is an annual increase in the natural resources of our planet and the consumption of wood resources, reforestation is a necessary part of the work after felling on the lands of the forest fund. However, studies based on the analysis of Earth remote sensing data allow us to conclude that there is no quality reforestation of forest land.

TI  - Neck dissection-Surgical treatment of cervical lymphatic drainage pathways
T2  - HNO
M3  - Article
AB  - Neck dissection (ND) is an essential component of treatment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The extent of ND depends on primary tumor location and T and Nstage. Trials have demonstrated improved survival for cN+ status with therapeutic ND as well as for cN0status with selective ND if the primary has ahigh incidence of occult metastasis. The accuracy of the procedure is of prognostic relevance. In the prognostic model of the TNM classification, the parameter N does not only reflect the number of affected lymph nodes, but also their size and extranodal tumor extension. Due to its better prognosis, apositive human papillomavirus (HPV) status is also incorporated in the present TNM classification. In order to minimize morbidity after ND, one seeks to limit its extent without reducing survival time. To this aim, sentinel node biopsy or surveillance with positron-emission computed tomography (PET-CT) in cN0necks or after primary radio(chemo)therapy are being investigated.

TI  - Rederivation of transgenic rodent models expressing disease modified tau protein - a report
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Transgenic animals are used extensively as in vivo experimental systems for modelling human diseases. A prerequisite for obtaining reliable experimental results is that the animal models used are free of defined infectious agents, including those that rarely produce disease, but still can modulate immune responses and alter the phenotype of affected animals. We have recently rederived transgenic rodent models of tauopathy to meet specific-pathogen free health standards for breeding in barrier areas. The surgical implantation of 2- cell embryos in three transgenic rat lines SHR24, SHR72 and W72 resulted in a total of 86 pups, out of which 36 were positive for transgene (42% efficiency). An overall 48 % transgenic efficiency was achieved in two transgenic mice lines R3m/4 and R3m/7 following non-surgical transfer of embryos. Microbiological evaluation, based on sentinel screening and serological examinations, confirmed the SPF status of all rederived strains. Most importantly, all rederived transgenic rodents developed AT8 positive neurofibrillary structures demonstrating high reproducibility of the phenotype. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first on rederivation of transgenic models of human tauopathy.

TI  - Cuban Catholic Church: between the Second Vatican Council and the Marxist revolution (1959 - 1966)
T2  - CULTURA Y RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes how the Cuban Catholic Church experienced the convocation, preparation and celebration of the Second Vatican Council. In Cuba, these first phases of Vatican II will be lived in parallel with the establishment of the socialist system, as a previous stage to the construction of the communist society. The construction of socialism, which assumes Marxism as the ideology and methodology for social transformation, presupposes the destruction of the capitalist system and all the institutions that sustain it. Since for Marxism religion, as a worldview, and the Church, as an institution, have been instruments of the ruling class to exercise its control over the exploited classes, the annihilation of capitalism must inexorably pass through the dismantling of religion. This principle, axial for the construction of communism, created a situation of State-Catholic Church confrontation in Cuba. Thus, while the Latin American Catholic Church, under the influence of Vatican II, experienced the most important expansion in its history, Cuban Catholicism, under the Marxist system, had to experience the worst retraction in its history.

TI  - THE CONUNDRUM FACING CHRISTIAN TRADITIONAL LEADERS
T2  - ACTA THEOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Christianity was introduced to and embraced by Batswana over two centuries ago, some Batswana still hold dear to their traditions, customs and cultures, which, at times, are not in line with the Word of God. Volz (2008:112) concedes that, although European missionaries introduced Batswana to Christianity, they had hardly any control over how early Batswana converts perceived and adapted their teachings. In some instances, dikgosi,(1) as traditional leaders, are still facing a serious conundrum of being a Christian, on the one hand, and a custodian of culture, on the other. This is in line with the view expressed by Amanze (2003:43) that many Christians, especially members of the African Independent Churches, live a strange life, with one foot rooted in the African traditional beliefs and the other in Christian beliefs and practices. Given the statement "For there is only one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Tim. 2:5), the question is: Where does this place traditions, customs and culture?

TI  - Tailoring radicality in early cervical cancer: how far can we go?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Today, the patient who is diagnosed with early cervical cancer is offered a variety of treatments apart from standard therapy. Patients can be treated with a less radical hysterectomy (RH) regarding parametrectomy, a trachelectomy either vaginal or abdominal, and this can be performed through a minimal invasive or open procedure. All this in combination with nerve sparing and/or sentinel node technique. Level 1 evidence for the oncological safety of all these modifications is only available from 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two RCTs on more or less radical parametrectomy both showed that oncological safety was not compromised by doing less radical surgery. Because of the heterogeneity of the patient population and the high frequency of adjuvant radiotherapy, the true impact of surgical radicality cannot be assessed. Regarding the issue of oncological safety of fertility sparing treatments, case-control and retrospective case series suggest that trachelectomy is safe as long as the tumor diameter does not exceed 2 cm. Recently, both a RCT and 2 case-control studies showed a survival benefit for open surgery compared to minimally invasive surgery, whereas many previous case-control and retrospective case series on this subject did not show impaired oncological safety. In a case-control study the survival benefit for open surgery was restricted to the group of patients with a tumor diameter more than 2 cm. Although modifications of the traditional open RH seem safe for tumors with a diameter less than 2 cm, ongoing prospective RCTs and observational studies should give the final answer.

TI  - National culture trumps EU socialization: the European central bankers' views of the euro crisis
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Union (EU) response to the euro crisis brought new relevance to the debate on socialization through European institutions. While previous studies differ in their support for EU socialization, many have argued that the euro crisis revealed a far-reaching convergence of views among Europe's leaders. Theoretically, the European Central Bank (ECB) in particular is expected to have the power to socialize its governors into a common worldview. The present article questions this proposition. Using the technique of cognitive mapping to provide an in-depth analysis of the views of five members of the ECB Governing Board, we find that even for ECB governors national culture generally trumps EU socialization. Only for ECB President Trichet significant evidence of EU socialization is found. The study also points to some new scope-conditions for socialization that may further our understanding of how European institutions may foster the sustainable socialization of views.

TI  - Tracking the uptake of outcomes of hepatitis B virus testing using laboratory data in Victoria, 2011-16: a population-level cohort study
T2  - SEXUAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A priority area in the 2016 Victorian Hepatitis B Strategy is to increase diagnostic testing. This study describes hepatitis B testing and positivity trends in Victoria between 2011 and 2016 using data from a national laboratory sentinel surveillance system. Methods: Line-listed diagnostic and monitoring hepatitis B testing data among Victorian individuals were collated from six laboratories participating in the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) of sexually transmissible infections and blood-borne viruses. Diagnostic tests included hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-only tests and guideline-based hepatitis B tests (defined as a single test event for HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B core antibody). Using available data, the outcomes of testing and/or infection were further classified. Measures reported include the total number of HBsAg and guideline-based tests conducted and the proportion positive, classified as either HBsAg positive or chronic hepatitis B infection. Results: The number of HBsAg tests decreased slightly each year between 2011 and 2016 (from 91043 in 2011 to 79664 in 2016; P < 0.001), whereas the number of guideline-based hepatitis B tests increased (from 8732 in 2011 to 16085 in 2016; P <0.001). The proportion of individuals classified as having chronic infection decreased from 25% in 2011 to 7% in 2016, whereas the proportion classified as susceptible and immune due to vaccination increased (from 29% to 39%, and from 27% to 34%, respectively; P < 0.001). Conclusions: The study findings indicate an increased uptake of guideline-based hepatitis B testing. The ongoing collection of testing data can help monitor progress towards implementation of the Victorian Hepatitis B Strategy.

TI  - HUIZE WARMOND ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE HOUSE IN ELLEN WARMOND'S POETRY
T2  - SPIEGEL DER LETTEREN
M3  - Article
AB  - In the early poetry of Ellen Warmond emphasis is placed on the effect of the house on the lyrical 'I'. There is the sense of security, but also of the fear that the dwelling is threatened by vague forces. A Freudian analysis of this relationship can clarify a lot but also needs to be extended with an existentialist approach. After all, in addition to the fear of penetration, Warmond's poems also thematise the fear of the other and his worldview. At the same time, this other also has the opportunity to break the isolated situation of the lyrical 'I'. However, because authentic contact with this other fails to occur, much of Warmond's early verses end up in a deadlock.

AB  - Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu state, India experienced a major disastrous flood during Nov-Dec 2015. The city is characterized by mixed land use with high built-up density. The freely available C-band Sentinel-1 temporal GRDH SAR images are used to analyze this flood event. We used the co-polarized (VV) SAR images for mapping the flood area. A change detection technique (Normalized Change Index (NCI)) which uses a pre-flood image having the same image characteristics as the flood/post-flood images is implemented on the temporal SAR images. An automatic flood mapping approach, i.e. NCI combined with thresholding is used to identify the flood area. This approach has underestimated the flood area for this particular study area which is due to the use of moderate resolution SAR images for high-density urban flood mapping. Despite underestimation, Sentinel-1 SAR images are very useful to get the first insight of flood condition in the high density urban areas.

AB  - Monitoring the flux transfer of mass and energy occurring within the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum is a pivotal key for understanding hydrological and vegetation relationships. Average daily values of the Priestley - Taylor (PT) parameter were calculated for 4 eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites from FLUXNET network, characterized by different vegetation features, over the 2010-12 reference period. Site-by-site feature spaces (built by difference in diurnal and night-time land surface temperature versus enhanced vegetation index, Delta LST-EVI) were obtained by combining satellite data (MODIS) and observed PT parameter (phi) retrieved by FLUXNET surface energy balance (SEB) fluxes. The results revealed the capability of satellite time-series data to monitor seasonal changes in phi. This preliminary observation offers a promising tool for exploring the feature spaces in respect to the time, helping to retrieve useful information for environmental monitoring.

AB  - Accurate and timely information about crop acreage estimation is important for agricultural management. In Turkey, wheat production is very important, and it is widely planted in Anatolia and in Southeastern Turkey. In this study, four different classification types were evaluated for wheat determination. As a study area, the region of Islahiye and Nurdagi counties of Gaziantep, Turkey was chosen. As satellite data, a Landsat 8 OLI image acquired on April 10, 2017 was used. The ground-truth points that were collected in surveying, and additionally field information taken from farmer registration system provided by local administrations were used as references. The application was done by classification of the satellite image using four different methods (Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, Condition-Based and Nearest Neighbor). After the results were obtained, the wheat classes obtained were transformed to vector format to overlay on the satellite image for visual analysis. The area of wheat class obtained from each method was presented and compared. The results were also evaluated by comparing with the data taken from Turkish Statistical Institute. All of the methods provided results close to the Turkish Statistical Institute records. Even the results were not significantly different from each other, wheat area determined using Support Vector Machine classification was better than others. The accuracy assessments were performed by calculating the total accuracy and KAPPA/KIA coefficient. The accuracy assessment analysis showed that the three supervised methods were better than the unsupervised one. As a future study, evaluation of these four classification methods using a multi-temporal dataset is planned.

TI  - Improved Assessment of Atmospheric Water Vapor Content in the Himalayan Regions Around the Kullu Valley in India Using Landsat-8 Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present an approach for improved estimation of atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) from Landsat-8 data. The initial estimates of WVC derived from the split window covariance variance ratio (SWCVR) method are sequentially improved by two exponential models. The first model is designed to apply orographic corrections to the SWCVR estimate using a 1-arcsec Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model based on a scale and bias parameter for the change in elevation. This model is based on the local change in elevation derived using the directional Kirsch compass kernel gradient. A second model for additional improvement in orographically corrected WVC estimate is defined based on the change in the normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) with three parameters, a scale and bias parameter for the change in NDVI and one bias parameter for the WVC estimate. The scale and bias parameters in orographic correction and the NDVI-based correction are derived using regression between a selected training subset of WVC estimates (SWCVR estimate for orographic correction and orographically corrected WVC estimate for the NDVI-based correction) and the corresponding Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Color Instrument (OLCI) integrated water vapor (IWV) product. The study is conducted over the Himalayan regions around Kullu, Himachal Pradesh, India, for two dates, 20 September 2017 and 26 January 2018, corresponding to the autumn and peak winter season in the region. A reduction in error of 0.32and 0.04gm/cm(2) was observed in proposed WVC estimate and the Sentinel-3 integrated water vapor product, for the two data sets respectively.

CP  - IEEE MTT-S International Microwave and RF Conference (IMARC)
CL  - Mumbai, INDIA
AB  - The snow water equivalent is a significant parameter in the determination of the hydrological potential of snow, which requires timely information on snow density and snow depth. For shallow snow depth, the C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be effectively utilized for the estimation of snow density. Although methods exist in the literature for the estimation of snow density, they are largely based on the exploitation of fully polarimetric SAR, which is mostly commercial and highly expensive. In this paper, we assess the capability of the Sentinel-1 polarimetric SAR data for determination of snow density using two bi-temporal dataset pairs based on a novel framework. The method is based on the derivation of incrementaUdecremental factors of the scattering matrix, which are related to the Fresnel transmission coefficients (FTC) and the attenuation constant. The snow density is determined using the permittivity derived from the inversion of the FTC. The experiments are also performed using RADARSAT-2 datasets synchronized with field measurements. The results are observed to be in agreement with respect to the available in-situ measurements as determined by the coefficient of determination of 0.658 and 0.525 for the RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 datasets, respectively.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Department of Energy's Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (SFA), centered in the East River, Colorado, generates diverse datasets including hydrological, geological, geochemical, geophysical, ecological, microbiological and remote sensing data. The project has deployed extensive field infrastructure involving hundreds of sensors that measure highly diverse phenomena (e.g. stream and groundwater hydrology, water quality, soil moisture, weather) across the watershed. Data from the sensor network are telemetered and automatically ingested into a queryable database. The data are subsequently quality checked, integrated with the United States Geological Survey's stream monitoring network using a custom data integration broker, and published to a portal with interactive visualizations. The resulting data products are used in a variety of scientific modeling and analytical efforts. This paper describes the SFA's end-to-end infrastructure and services that support the generation of integrated datasets from a watershed sensor network. The development and maintenance of this infrastructure, presents a suite of challenges from practical field logistics to complex data processing, which are addressed through various solutions. In particular, the SFA adopts a holistic view for data collection, assessment and integration, which dramatically improves the products generated, and enables a co-design approach wherein data collection is informed by model results and vice-versa.

AB  - The author analyzes the origins of interest towards philosophical issues the book and library scientists and researcher bibliographers take. The need for more close interaction between philosophy and the library and information science in the circumstances of transition from information society to knowledge society and digital economy is substantiated. The process of cognitive institutionalization of philosophical knowledge in the library and information science is examined. The author analyzes several works by Arkady V. Sokolov on the content and specific features of bibliosophy as a philosophical system focused on biblioshere within the historical context. The key functions of philosophical knowledge are discussed as related to library and information science which enables rationalizing and reliable, accurate and relevant assessment of multiple and unique processes and phenomena in this disciplines. The focus is made on the worldview, ontological, gnoseological, methodological and axiological functions. The authors emphasizes the role of philosophy in developing conceptual, theoretical, logical and methodological structures for serious study of bibliosphere and its rational perception as one of the fundamental cultural segments.

TI  - Assessing the Capacity of Ecosystems to Supply Ecosystem Services Using Remote Sensing and An Ecosystem Accounting Approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems contribute to economic development through the supply of ecosystem services such as food and fresh water. Information on ecosystems and their services is required to support policy making, but this information is not captured in economic statistics. Ecosystem accounting has been developed to integrate ecosystems and ecosystem services into national accounts. Ecosystem accounting includes the compilation of an ecosystem services supply and use account, which reflects actual flows of ecosystem services, and the ecosystem capacity account, which reflects the capacity of ecosystems to sustainably supply ecosystem services. A capacity assessment requires detailed data on ecosystem processes, which are often not available over large scales. In this study, we examined how net primary productivity derived from remote sensing can be used as an indicator to assess changes in the capacity of ecosystems to supply services. We examine the spatial and temporal patterns in this capacity for the Orinoco river basin from 2001 to 2014. Specifically, we analyze the capacity of six types of ecosystems to supply timber, pastures for grazing cattle, oil palm fresh fruit bunches and to sequester carbon. We compared ecosystem capacities with the level of ecosystem service supply to assess a sustainable use of ecosystems. Our study provides insights on how the capacity of ecosystems can be quantified using remote sensing data in the context of ecosystem accounting. Ecosystem capacity indicators indicate ecosystems change and harvesting-regeneration patterns which are important for the design and monitoring of sustainable management regimes for ecosystems.

AB  - The paper presents a method for estimating parameters of the mixture of Gaussian distributions that can be used for constructing likelihood functions at automatic clustering of remote sensing data. The idea of the method consists in successive improvement of sets of estimated parameters for the mathematical model represented by a mixture of basis functions. To improve the estimates the information on the errors occurring at approximation of the signature empiric distribution at the previous step of the iterative procedure is used. As an example the paper provides the results of automatic generation of the list of classes with their probabilistic descriptions. It also presents the results of further clustering of a satellite image upon the maximum likelihood criterion. The paper proves the efficiency of the developed method. It shows that the method can be used for describing real remote sensing data in the tasks of images recognition and cluster analysis, as it allows defining the number of components in the mixture of Gaussian functions (that corresponds to the number of observed classes of objects) and estimating parameters of those components.

TI  - The assessment of forest coenotic diversity and its dynamics in Moscow region reference landscapes based on remote sensing data
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of the assessment of the coenotic variety of forests of reference landscapes of glacial and water-ice genesis of the Moscow region in different physico-geographical regions, such as Verkhnevolzhskaya lowland, Klinsko-Dmitrovskaya range, Teplostanskaya Upland and Meshcherskaya lowland. The assessment basis was the vegetation map of the Moscow region (1 : 200 000) and space images of the Landsat system. A basic unit of assessment is epiassociation, which presents the ecological condition of the forest cover. It provides the possibility of using the ratio of indigenous, short-and long-term communities to determine the extent of human impact and forest ecological functions preservation. Based on the cartographic method of research, landscape complexes of forest types have been identified, and the ecosystem diversity at the local level has been assessed. The vegetation map of the Moscow region has been updated as a result. The authors found that in the landscape of Verkhnevolzhskaya lowland the main spaces are occupied by fir and pine short-term forests. The landscapes of the Klinsko-Dmitrovskaya range and Meshcherskaya lowland are dominated by coniferous forests; the Teplostanskaya Upland - by coniferous-deciduous forests. In all considered landscapes, the authors noted a strong reduction of forest cover. Primarily it is associated with the human impact increase on natural ecosystems. The strongest reduction in forest areas and forest cover fragmentation occurred in the landscapes of the Klinsko-Dmitrovskaya range and Teplostanskaya Upland. Reduction maps of forest cover of reference landscapes were compiled based on the data obtained.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper I discuss some ideas of Andrey V. Smirnov, presented in his paper Process based Logic and Two Kinds of Apodictic Proofs, and in other works. I accentuate the importance of his hypothesis about two kinds of irreducible apodictic proofs for cultural studies and for our worldview in general. I try to assess the key premises of A. V. Smirnov's conclusions and claim that their success is mostly dependent on the possibility of plausible interpretation of construction "because, and only because", by which the premises of process-based syllogism of non-Aristotelian kind are connected, according to A. V. Smirnov, who have discovered such a syllogism in some works of Arabic philosophers. I claim that if we interpret this construction as a necessary condition, we would open a way for counterexamples, blocking a possibility of treating such a syllogism as an apodictic proof. But if we interpret it as a sufficient condition, we would open a way for reducing this syllogism to the Aristotelian one. Another option is to treat that construction in terms of causation of processes. The problem is, however, that causation is typically interpreted in terms of necessary or sufficient conditions as well. So it seems that to avoid serious problems A. V. Smimov has to adopt such a definition of causation that wouldn't include any reference to those conditions.

AB  - This article deals with linguistic features of the Lower Volga region, reflected in the subculture of the Cossacks. The functioning of the Cossack language is a special ecosystem, being rather closed, but constantly interacting with surrounding language systems of other subcultures representatives. The analysis of definite language means representing the special worldview of the Cossacks as representatives of a separate subculture allows explaining their originality, uniqueness, "survival" in the modern world. The linguistic features of the Lower Volga region are reflected in the subculture of the Cossacks, developed during a long period of time and mainly conditioned by the historical living environment of the Cossacks, the special social way of their life.The studies devoted to characterizing universal categories are topical and relevant; special attention is paid to the category of possessiveness. The prerequisite is as follows: the comprehension of the possessive relations, their development in the process of progressive human activity occurred in each culture differently due to a certain hierarchy of values, primarily national and cultural specificity, reflected in the Cossack language. In this regard, the analysis of a subject-possessor, whose names are recorded in the Cossack language, is presented. The following possessive characteristics were defined: kinship relations, property relations, ownership relations, the subject's characteristics in terms of thrift and avarice. The analysis performed allows tracing the reflection of certain social relations associated with possessiveness in the semantics of linguistic units. These relations are explained by such traits of the Cossacks as thrift and governance. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers irony as a conceptual category of the literary text, that contains author's assessment in the implicit form. The ironic meaning as an integral component of the literary text is an evaluative and emotional way to represent the author's worldview and values. The means of expressing irony in N. V. Gogol's works of different genres (epos, lyrico-epic genre and drama) are determined. The similarities and differences in the author's use of irony expression means in the poem Dead Souls, series of tales Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka, Mirgorod, Petersburg Tales, comedy The Inspector General within the author's ironic character description are determined. The article concludes that genre peculiarities of literary works affect the author's choice of certain means of irony expression. It is not typical of the author to use phraseological units as irony explicators in the genre of the tale; however, these linguistic means frequently verbalize ironical meaning in the drama genre - the comedy The Inspector General. The use of such textual means as author's retreats and comments is not typical due to high plot dynamism and dialogization of the author's narrative being characteristic genre features of the comedy. The article considers the means of irony expression in the author's character description. It is shown that irony is manifested both in the characters' and the author's speech and is aimed at assessing the characters' personality and behavior.

AB  - The Restore-L mission will capture and robotically service Landsat 7 in the early 2020s. The rendezvous will be autonomous with onboard sensors providing relative navigation measurements and onboard guidance algorithms controlling to a reference trajectory. The trajectory design is predicated on maintaining passive safety through any fault until relative navigation is sufficiently accurate to proceed within proximity of Landsat 7. This requirement must be addressed with consideration for sensor range, measurement accuracy, dispersions, thruster faults, and lighting, among others. This paper presents the Restore-L rendezvous trajectory design, which incorporates a series of co-elliptic transfers for gradual far-field approach and periodic relative motion strategies for near-field approach and inspection.

AB  - What makes this research relevant is the changes in the society's and an individual's value space, which affect the young the most, as the youth is more dynamic and sensitive to social changes, to changes in the society's ideology and values. This research is aimed at addressing the problem of transforming the modem teacher education in the context of changes in the young students' life values.The basic method behind the research is the Schwartz Value Survey, which in this case involved 120 boys and girls aged 19 to 24.Analysis of the younger generation's values shows that none of the Schwartz-stated universal values is crucial for young people. What is noteworthy is not the hierarchy of values but the universal values being below average on the scale, although Schwartz (1992) considers them the primary drivers of life.On the one hand, the research results suggest that young people struggle the most to cope with the socioeconomic and political changes taking place in the society, as the youth does not yet have a well-established worldview or a stable system of values, which renders many young people to experience apathy and indifference towards themselves and others. On the other hand, traditional methods, measures, and values cannot be used as a proper reference to understand a young person unless their life values, which do not fit the familiar views and belief, are well-represented. One of the major challenges of the modem teacher education is to find ways and approaches to understanding the core values of the youth, to help the youth shape such life values what would fit the modem realities.

AB  - Network theory has established itself as an appropriate tool for complex systems analysis and pattern recognition. In the context of spatiotemporal data analysis, correlation networks are used in the vast majority of works. However, the Pearson correlation coefficient captures only linear relationships and does not correctly capture recurrent events. This missed information is essential for temporal pattern recognition. In this work, we propose a chronological network construction process that is capable of capturing various events. Similar to the previous methods, we divide the area of study into grid cells and represent them by nodes. In our approach, links are established if two consecutive events occur in two different nodes. Our method is computationally efficient, adaptable to different time windows and can be applied to any spatiotemporal data set. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluated the proposed approach by constructing chronological networks from the MODIS dataset for fire events in the Amazon basin. We explore two data analytic approaches: one static and another temporal. The results show some activity patterns on the fire events and a displacement phenomenon over the year. The validity of the analyses in this application indicates that our data modeling approach is very promising for spatio-temporal data mining.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Congress on Grapevine and Wine Sciences
CL  - Logrono, SPAIN
AB  - A classification between three vineyards belonging to the Appellation of Origin Rueda (Castilla y Leon, Spain) has been established in veraison to determine the productive capacities of each vineyard and to study their impact on the grape quality. Several open-access multispectral images obtained from the SENTINEL-2A satellite in the year 2016 were used to calculate the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which provides information about the vigour of the vineyards. Eleven cloud-free images were assessed and based on the NDVI, three vigour levels were established: high vigour (0.356-0.458), medium vigour (0.285-0.355) and low vigour (0.166-0.284). A level of vigour was assigned to each vineyard according to the NDVI mean values of its pixels. Significant differences were found in the pruning wood weight and yield: high, medium and low vigour values were 2438, 1895 and 1487 kg.ha(-1) and 15984, 12990 and 10576 kg.ha(-1), respectively. The highest values of total acidity (6.04 g.L-1) and tartaric acid (9.05 g.L-1) have been obtained in low vigour, as well as the lowest values of pH (3.26), malic acid (0.42 g.L-1) and potassium (1640 ppm). Finally, one wine per vigour was produced and a tasting was carried out to check if the differences between the vineyards were perceptible. According to the obtained results, the NDVI is a good indicator to classify vineyards, finding notable differences between the experimental treatments studied.

AB  - Wildfires are recurring in many terrestrial ecosystems all over the world. Accurate assessment of the forest ecosystem, affected by fire is of great importance for the fires spread predicting and modelling of the post-fire activities for recovery of the affected territories. High spatial and spectral resolution satellite data were used to evaluate the vegetation variation on a fire-affected territory, located on the northwest slopes of the Rila mountain, considering its spatial heterogeneity. The forest fire was spread on the area of deciduous forests Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.), and coniferous: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European larch (Larix desidua, Mill.). Different spectral indices like Disturbance index (DI), Normalized difference greenness indices (NDGI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and derived from remote sensing methods (satellite data from different sensors Landsat and Sentinel) as well as the Geographical Information System (GIS) were applied for the forest disturbance assessment in two periods after forest fire occurrence. The results of the applied integrated model provide a quantitative information about the fire effects for distinct forest types. The documented spatial distribution of the territory based on the obtained DI values shows clear differences between the fire-affected forest types, thus demonstrating the usefulness and accuracy of the approach followed.

AB  - Forest fires are among the most dangerous natural threats that cause significant changes in forest ecosystems. For the better management of the wildfire-prone territories, the fire weather components like temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration predictions and monitoring within the extreme fire seasons are of great importance. Remote sensing has been identified as an effective tool for better understanding how forest ecosystems respond to these components. Respective spectral indices, like Normalized difference greenness indices (NDGI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Improved Modified Chlorophyll Adsorption Ratio Index (MCARI2) and Moisture Stress Index (MSI), derived from remote sensing methods (satellite data from different sensors-Landsat and Sentinel) as well as the Geographical Information System (GIS) were applied for the monitoring of the climatic parameters in forest fire vulnerable regions in Bulgaria. The climatic parameters dataset from 2008 consisting of the ten-day period mean temperature and precipitation data were collected. The NDVI trends for the studied periods exhibited significant correlations with the mean precipitation and weak or no correlation with the temperature recorded. These results are largely linked to the relative air humidity. Different vegetation types were found to show distinct spatial responses to climatic changes.

AB  - Knowledge of the morphometric characteristics and land cover are essential for the development of plans that aim at understanding hydrological processes. The objective was to characterize the morphometry and to evaluate the rate of deforestation in the microbasin of the Manicore River. Images (Palsar sensor) were used for altitude and relief, and images of the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites were used to evaluate soil cover for the years 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015. The microbasin has a dendritic drainage, pattern of 5th order, with high drainage density, 2.96 water source km(-2), sinuous drainage with concentration time of 7 hours and 48 min. Deforestation increased from 1985 to 2005, but there was an increase in forest area from 2005 to 2015, mainly in areas of riparian forests. The microbasin has low susceptibility to flooding, but due to the size of the anthropic area, conservation techniques are necessary.

TI  - NDVI-Climate relationships in high-latitude mountains of Alaska and Yukon Territory
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-latitude systems in northwestern Canada and Alaska have warmed rapidly. The aim of this study was to examine how a remotely sensed proxy of vegetation productivity varied among mountain ranges with respect to elevation and climate from 2002-2017. Our study area included high-latitude mountains in Alaska, USA, and Yukon Territory, Canada, ranging from cold arctic mountains in the tundra biome to warmer interior mountains areas within the boreal biome. We used the annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the 250-m MODIS NDVI product as a proxy of maximum growing season photosynthetic activity. The long-term (16-year) and interannual pattern of maximum NDVI was investigated with respect to elevation, July temperature, and July precipitation classes within four climatic mountain regions. The July temperature lapse rate was consistently linear, whereas the long-term maximum NDVI lapse rate was nonlinear. At lower elevations, the high-precipitation region had the highest NDVI, whereas the interior mountains region had the highest NDVI at higher elevations. The long-term maximum NDVI was negatively correlated with July precipitation for areas with July temperature below 12 degrees C. Above 12 degrees C, NDVI was positively correlated with July precipitation, with the greatest rate of NDVI increase with precipitation at the warmest July temperature class. The pattern of interannual peak NDVI with respect to July temperature was not as strong as the long-term pattern; however, the only interannual negative correlation between peak NDVI and July temperature was at lower elevations within the interior mountains. We concluded that among a regional climatic gradient of mountain areas, low growing season temperature and length were likely constraining vegetation productivity, and lower growing season moisture may be an important constraint at the warmest interior mountains region.

TI  - BOOK OF POEMS AS A GENRE IN THE WORKS OF "PEREVAL" POETS (P. DRUZHININ, N. ZARUDIN, D. SEMENOVSKY)
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - Creative activity of the poets from the literary Association "Pe reval" has still been insufficiently studied, although it was a special phenomenon in the Russian literature of the 1920s-1930s. The contem-poraries, including one of the founders of "Pereval" A. Voronsky, underestimated the lyrics of these poets, giving preference to prose. But their poetry epitomizes one of the important program theses of "Pereval" sincerity. This makes their poetry an artistic document of the epoch.The article studies the books of poems by P. Druzhinin, N. Zarudin and D. Semenovsky by such parameters as title, composition, motives, and meta-plot. The analysis has revealed the characteristic features of cyclization, the common aesthetics and poetics of the literary group and the individual authored specificity. In each case, the authors of the article emphasize the poet's special relationship with the time, with the literary tradition and with the poetry of the predecessors and contemporaries: F. Tyutchev, A. Fet, A. Tolstoy, A. Blok, S. Yesen in, M. Svetlov, E. Bagritsky, etc. The lyrics of"Pereval" recreate the dialectics of the formation of a new picture of the world in which lyrical emotions drown out the "noise of time". P. Druzhinin and N. Zarudin, participants of the Civil War, reflect those events in different ways. For the new peasant poet P. Druzhinin war is a dark and cruel time that disrupts the natural course of life. N. Zarudin, a poet inclined towards a pessimistic worldview, on the contrary, presents the events of the Civil War in bright, romantic tones. The optimistic poetry of D. Semenovsky is timeless, abstract, and based on general literary imagery.The books of poems by the "Pereval" poets are lyrical, i.e. they basically do not reflect the large-scale changes in socialist construction in the state as the official literary criticism of the 1920s required from the poets. For these poets, lyricism remains to be the main means of expressing reality. It was lyrics that embodied the dramatic experiences of the time aestheticizing the main themes of the then modernity: the natural cycles of peasant labor (the book by P. Druzhinin The Straw Noise), the memories of the battles and victims of the civil war and its romanticization (the book by N. Zarudin Across the Field ofYouth), the joy of life and new religiosity (the book by D. Semyonovsky Under the Blue Cover).

AB  - In the present work, the effect of surface roughness on the soil moisture in growing stage of wheat field has been analyzed using the Sentinel-1 SAR data. For this purpose, VV polarized equation from Dubois model has been used to measure dielectric constant by varying surface roughness value from 1 cm to 3 cm. These dielectric constant values were used to measure soil moisture by using Topp's model. Further, measured and observed soil moisture values were correlated to measure root mean square error (RMSE). On the basis of RMSE, surface roughness value in growing stage of wheat field for study area has been found as 1.2 cm. The validation of present study has been carried out using PRISM-2 and Campbell's methods and results obtain by PRISM-2 method satisfy our measured roughness values.

TI  - Approximating Empirical Surface Reflectance Data through Emulation: Opportunities for Synthetic Scene Generation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Collection of spectroradiometric measurements with associated biophysical variables is an essential part of the development and validation of optical remote sensing vegetation products. However, their quality can only be assessed in the subsequent analysis, and often there is a need for collecting extra data, e.g., to fill in gaps. To generate empirical-like surface reflectance data of vegetated surfaces, we propose to exploit emulation, i.e., reconstruction of spectral measurements through statistical learning. We evaluated emulation against classical interpolation methods using an empirical field dataset with associated hyperspectral spaceborne CHRIS and airborne HyMap reflectance spectra, to produce synthetic CHRIS and HyMap reflectance spectra for any combination of input biophysical variables. Results indicate that: (1) emulation produces surface reflectance data more accurately than interpolation when validating against a separate part of the field dataset; and (2) emulation produces the spectra multiple times (tens to hundreds) faster than interpolation. This technique opens various data processing opportunities, e.g., emulators not only allow rapidly producing large synthetic spectral datasets, but they can also speed up computationally intensive processing routines such as synthetic scene generation. To demonstrate this, emulators were run to simulate hyperspectral imagery based on input maps of a few biophysical variables coming from CHRIS, HyMap and Sentinel-2 (S2). The emulators produced spaceborne CHRIS-like and airborne HyMap-like surface reflectance imagery in the order of seconds, thereby approximating the spectra of vegetated surfaces sufficiently similar to the reference images. Similarly, it took a few minutes to produce a hyperspectral data cube with a spatial texture of S2 and a spectral resolution of HyMap.

TI  - The perseverance of the saints, persecution and mission, and its implications for Reformed churches
T2  - IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
M3  - Article
AB  - The confession of saints' perseverance in the Canons of Dort gives much comfort to the Christian. This was one of the most important challenges the Synod of Dort had to address. It also has many implications for the mission of the church. Not only does it highlight the message that God, in his salvation, will always complete his act of redemption, but also that he will not reject the believer once he or she has become a true Christian. It also comforts many in times of persecution, because God, in his faithfulness, will be the One to empower the believer to remain steadfast and also to vow for those who doubt and even struggle to keep the faith. For Reformed churches, this means that, in the endeavour of mission, a message of great comfort can be proclaimed to all. In Jesus Christ there is certainty of eternal life not because of human power or godliness, but because of God's faithfulness. Theologically it is, however, also important to challenge philosophical views where certainty of faith is rejected for a worldview of uncertainty. The truth of faith is, however, found in God, not in the human possibilities. In this regard, Dort is important for the church to be guided to the fullness of service to the triune God. Mission becomes a wonderful act of peace for the troubled soul in a troubled world.

TI  - Collapse of the Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Compartment in Advanced Cutaneous Melanomas by Components of the Tumor Cell Secretome
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma is an immunogenic neoplasm infiltrated by T cells, although these adaptive T cells usually fail to eradicate the tumor. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) are potent regulators of the adaptive immune response and can eliminate melanoma cells via TLR-mediated effector functions. The PDC compartment is maintained by progressively restricted bone marrow progenitors. Terminally differentiated PDCs exit the bone marrow into the circulation, then home to lymph nodes and inflamed peripheral tissues. Infiltration by PDCs is documented in various cancers. However, their role within the melanoma immune contexture is not completely known. We found that in locoregional primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM), PDC infiltration was heterogeneous, occurred early, and was recurrently localized at the invasive margin, the site where PDCs interact with CD8 thorn T cells. A reduced PDC density was coupled with an increased Breslow thickness and somatic mutations at the NRAS p.Q61 codon. Compared with what was seen in PCM, high numbers of PDCs were found in regional lymph nodes, as also identified by in silico analysis. In contrast, in metastatic melanoma patients, PDCs were mostly absent in the tumor tissues and were significantly reduced in the circulation, particularly in the advanced M1c group. Exposure of circulating PDCs to melanoma cell supernatant (SN-mel) depleted of extracellular vesicles resulted in significant PDC death. SN-mel exposure also resulted in a defect of PDC differentiation from CD34 thorn progenitors. These findings indicate that soluble components released by melanoma cells support the collapse of the PDC compartment, with clinical implications for refining TLR agonist-based trials.

TI  - Evaluation of Sub-Kilometric Numerical Simulations of C-Band Radar Backscatter over the French Alps against Sentinel-1 Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares numerical simulations and observations of C-band radar backscatter in a wide region (2300 km) in the Northern French Alps. Numerical simulations were performed using a model chain composed of the SAFRAN meteorological reanalysis, the Crocus snowpack model and the radiative transfer model Microwave Emission Model for Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS3&a), operating at a spatial resolution of 250-m. The simulations, without any bias correction, were evaluated against 141 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar observation scenes with a resolution of 20 m over three snow seasons from October 2014 to June 2017. Results show that there is good agreement between observations and simulations under snow-free or dry snow conditions, consistent with the fact that dry snow is almost transparent at C-band. Under wet snow conditions, although the changes in time and space are well correlated, there is a significant deviation, up to 5 dB, between observations and simulations. The reasons for these discrepancies were explored, including a sensitivity analysis on the impact of the liquid water percolation scheme in Crocus. This study demonstrates the feasibility of performing end-to-end simulations of radar backscatter over extended geographical region. This makes it possible to envision data assimilation of radar data into snowpack models in the future, pending that deviations are mitigated, either through bias corrections or improved physical modeling of both snow properties and corresponding radar backscatter.

TI  - An attempt to perform inter-band calibration validation for Sentinel 2 using snowy sites such as Dome C in Antarctica
T2  - SENSORS, SYSTEMS, AND NEXTGENERATION SATELLITES XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next- Generation Satellites XXIII
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - In the frame of the monitoring of Sentinel 2 MSI sensors in orbit, a method for inter-band calibration validation, using Antarctic site, has been developed and tested. The method relies on the directional hemispheric reflectance found in ASTER data base. In order to consider that the spectral shape of the directional directional reflectance is the same as the directional hemispheric one, wavelengths have to be limited to the spectral range below 0.9 mu m. Thus this method cannot perform the inter-band calibration for the whole set of spectral bands of MSI but only from B1 to B8A. Results for B9 seem also correct although the central wavelength is a little bit beyond 0.9 mu m.Given a clear day acquisition on DomeC site, a first set of computations of Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectances for MSI spectral bands is performed using the three ASTER reflectances corresponding respectively to small, medium and coarse grain size for snow. The spectral reflectances are normalized by the B2 value. The comparison of the three normalized TOA reflectances to the actual one given by MSI enables to select the right snow grain size. Then the second step is the atmospheric parameters adjustment. Water content is assessed thanks to B9 band centered at 0.945 mu m and ozone is assessed thanks to mainly B3 band centered at 0.56 mu m. For a clear day, the aerosol optical thickness is weak and thus the TOA reflectance is not very sensitive to the more or less low abundance of continental aerosols. The ratio of normalized reflectance given by MSI to the normalized reflectance given by the computation is assessed for each spectral band between B1 and B9 and is compared to the inter-band calibration validations performed with other methods.

AB  - Wildfires are one of the most widespread disturbances of forest ecosystems. Countries of the Mediterranean basin registered the largest number of fires and burned area in the last decade. Optical remote sensing, particularly Landsat images, has been commonly used to characterise forest disturbance and subsequent recovery for long time series. Time series techniques such as temporal segmentation algorithms have been developed to facilitate the understanding of postfire vegetation recovery dynamics.This study aims to extract the main types of natural recovery trajectories from a Large Forest Fire occurred in 1994 from a thermophilous pine forests (Pinus Halepensis and Pinus Pinaster) in the long-term (1994-2018). We built annual composites from Landsat Surface Reflectance images and calculated Tasseled-cap components, which are sensitive to canopy moisture and structure (Wetness - TCW) and percent vegetation cover (Angle - TCA). We evaluated fire severity and fire recovery relationship. The differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) was used as a fire severity proxy, whereas recovery processes were assessed from spectral profiles using LandTrendr temporal segmentation algorithm. TCW and TCA were used as inputs to LandTrendr and the outputs of fitting were subsequently used to classify recovery types based on a k-means classification with the optimum number of clusters based on the Elbow Method. Groups of continuous positive recovery, non-continuous recovery and continuous recovery with slope changes were identified. The proposed method could be an approach to model the long-term recovery for the Mediterranean areas and help decisionmakers in determining which areas could not recover naturally.

AB  - When floods hit populated areas, quick detection of flooded areas is crucial for initial response by local government, residents, and volunteers. Space-borne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) is an authoritative data sources for flood mapping since it can be acquired immediately after a disaster even at night time or cloudy weather. Conventionally, a lot of domain-specific heuristic knowledge has been applied for PolSAR flood mapping, but their performance still suffers from confusing pixels caused by irregular reflections of radar waves. Optical images are another data source that can be used to detect flooded areas due to their high spectral correlation with the open water surface. However, they are often affected by day, night, or severe weather conditions (i.e., cloud). This paper presents a convolution neural network (CNN) based multi-modal approach utilizing the advantages of both PolSAR and optical images for flood mapping. First, reference training data is retrieved from optical images by manual annotation. Since clouds may appear in the optical image, only areas with a clear view of flooded or non-flooded are annotated. Then, a semi-supervised polarimetric-features-aided CNN is utilized for flood mapping using PolSAR data. The proposed model not only can handle the issue of learning with incomplete ground truth but also can leverage a large portion of unlabelled pixels for learning. Moreover, our model takes the advantages of expert knowledge on scattering interpretation to incorporate polarimetric-features as the input. Experiments results are given for the flood event that occurred in Sendai, Japan, on 12th March 2011. The experiments show that our framework can map flooded area with high accuracy (F1 = 96:12) and outperform conventional flood mapping methods.

AB  - Land cover information is essential data required by urban planners and policy makers to understand existing development and to protect natural resources in a city or town. With the availability of high resolution satellite images from Sentinel-2A, it is now possible to prepare accurate land cover maps and the present study is an attempt in this direction. An approach based on unsupervised classification plus a post-classification editing (recoding) by referring to Google satellite images is proposed in this study and has been tested for the city of Chennai, India An unsupervised classification using ISODATA technique with 150 clusters and 36 iterations was carried out first and then Google satellite images were used on the background to assign each cluster to a particular land cover type. The proposed approach is very promising as the overall accuracy was found to be 96% with Kappa coefficient of 0.94. It was found that the proposed approach performs well when compared to the supervised and object based classification. The land cover map from Sentinel-2A was compared with the topographical map of 1971 and it was found that there was a fourfold increase in built-up area over the years. Built-up area was induced to develop in proximity to important highways in Chennai as ribbon type of sprawl is noticed. The results showed that the availability of green space is only 7.626 m(2) per person in Chennai against the recommended value of 9 m(2). It was also found that almost 6 km(2) of water bodies have disappeared in Chennai and buildings were constructed over them illegally. The government should ensure proper land use planning and control built-up area development in order to protect the natural resources in the city.

AB  - The Long Term Data Record (LTDR) has the goal of developing a quality and consistent AVHRR surface reflectance product using the MODIS instrument as a reference. When a surface reflectance time series is acquired from satellites with variable observation geometry, the directional variation generates an apparent noise which can be corrected by modeling the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The well-established MODIS-based VJB method estimates a target's BRDF shape and corrects for directional effects, maintaining the high temporal resolution of the measurement, but its viability and optimization for AVHRR data hasn't been fully explored. In this study we explore different approaches to find the most robust way of applying the VJB correction in AVHRR data, considering that high noise in the AVHRR's red band (B1) makes the VJB method unstable. Our results show that 1-the VJB method can be modified to improve the stability of the correction parameters in AVHRR by similar to 5% and that 2- the time series noise using MODIS correction parameters is comparable to that using AVHRR derived parameters.

TI  - Metallothionein Induced Time Dependent Histomorphometric Analysis of <i>Clarias gariepinus</i> Exposed to Cadmium
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cadmium(Cd), an extremely toxic heavy metal is extensively used in modern era because of its constructive chemical and physical properties. Recently Cd contamination was estimated in India's major cities fresh water ecosystem, which may have firm impact on human health. Hence, this study was aimed to detect the time dependent effect of cadmium in fresh water fish C. gariepinus, a bioindicator species of water pollution. In a controlled environment, fishes were exposed to cadmium for different duration and analyzed for Cd accumulation. Cd induced toxicity was assessed by estimating metallothionein biomarker protein of heavy metal toxicity and histomorphometric changes in liver andkidney. Our results revealed that fish exposed to Cd induced apoptosis in fish tissues via induction of caspases and in contrast the metallothionein was also increased consistently with different doses of Cd exposure. Hence we conclude Cd induced structural damages to fishes are attributed to induction of caspases and estimating MT level in tissues can be effective biomarker to analyze the effect of acute environmental exposure to Cd.

AB  - Of late, the science of Remote Sensing has been gaining a lot of interest and attention due to its wide variety of applications. Remotely sensed data can be used in various fields such as medicine, agriculture, engineering, weather forecasting, military tactics, disaster management etc. only to name a few. This article presents a study of the two categories of sensors namely optical and microwave which are used for remotely sensing the occurrence of disasters such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, avalanches, tropical cyclones and suspicious movements. The remotely sensed data acquired either through satellites or through ground based-synthetic aperture radar systems could be used to avert or mitigate a disaster or to perform a post-disaster analysis.

TI  - REMOTE SENSING DATA AS BASIS FOR THE MODELLING AND REASSEMBLY OF DISMANTLED HERITAGE STRUCTURES

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 27th CIPA International Symposium on Documenting the Past for a Better Future
CL  - Avila, SPAIN
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are invaluable for the documentation and preservation of built heritage. The techniques facilitate fast documentation of highly complex heritage structures with improved accuracies. Furthermore they improve the degree of detail substantially. This is extremely useful for the restoration of collapsed elements or the reassembly of dismantled structures. These entities are often challenging to puzzle back together. Moreover, the differential settlements of the elements over time heavily influence the relative position and orientation of the remaining pieces, further complicating the reconstruction. Digital modelling solutions with a 3D model of the current situation as take-off, are desperately needed by the industry to tackle the present obstacles. In this work, a framework is proposed that facilitates a more accurate reassembly of dismantled heritage elements. It consists of three major phases starting with the accurate recording of the current situation as well as the preserved components. Subsequently, the new design is dititally modelled, reducing the necessary time for the reassembly of the structure, which is the last step in the rebuilding workflow. The presented framework allows for an efficient and comprehensible reconstruction of the structure. A key aspect in the approach is the detection of missing components and the estimation of their dimensions for the production of accurate replicas. The potential is showcased by means of two case studies on the reassembly of flying buttresses and rib vaults of the Saint-James church in Leuven, Belgium, which is currently undergoing major stabilisation works. The presented approach allows heritage experts to gain better oversight over their reassembly project and work more efficiently.

T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the world, tropical glaciers are rapidly receding and some are at risk of complete loss within the next several decades. It is therefore important to monitor these glacial regions to better understand the factors affecting glacier loss and risks to nearby communities. Here, we provide an update on the summit glacier extents of Pico de Orizaba (19.03 degrees N, 97.27 degrees W) and Iztaccihuatl (19.18 degrees N, 98.64 degrees W) in central Mexico, reporting areas every 1-11 years between 2001 and 2019 (depending on the availability of high-quality imagery). Glacier extents are derived from multispectral satellite imagery (Landsat 7-8 and the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2) using a semi-automated mapping method that takes the ratio of the near-infrared (or panchromatic) and shortwave infrared bands and applies appropriate threshold(s) for glacier identification. We also use thermal band imagery from Landsat 7-8 to estimate surface temperatures of both the glaciers and the surrounding terrain to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the summit environment. We find that glacier retreat has continued on both summits, and surface temperatures (even over glacier ice) can be at or near the melting point of water during some parts of the year, particularly on lower-elevation Iztaccihuatl, suggesting a risk of continued ice loss in the future.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - From 1 June to 29 August 2018, Kerala, a state in southwestern India, recorded 36% excess rainfall than normal levels, leading to widespread floods and landslides events and resulting in 445 deaths. In this study, satellite-based data were used to map the flood inundation in the districts of Thrissur, Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Idukki and Kottayam. Specifically, flood delineation was enabled with Sentinel-1A radar data of 21 August 2018 and was compared with an average pre-flood, water-cover map based on Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) that was developed using a January and February 2018 Sentinel-2A dataset. A 90% increase in water cover was observed during the August 2018 flood event. Low lying areas in the coastal plains of Kuttanad and the Kole lands of Thrissur, had marked a rise of up to 5 and 10 m of water, respectively, during this deluge. These estimates are conservative as that the flood waters had started receding prior to the August 21 Sentinel-1A imagery.

TI  - Pansharpening Based on Deconvolution for Multiband Filter Estimation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of a multispectral (MS) image and a panchromatic (PAN) image, the so-called pansharpening, allows to produce very appealing images that are useful both for visual interpretation and for feature extraction. The state-of-the-art multiresolution analysis pansharpening algorithms are based on the extraction of spatial details from the PAN image through image filters matched with the MS sensors' modulation transfer function. However, this knowledge is often poor due to measurement inaccuracies and/or its aging. Thus, deconvolution algorithms have been proposed to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we propose a multiband filter estimation (FE) approach to improve the solutions in the literature. The main idea in this paper is to exploit a preliminary pansharpened image to estimate the spatial filter used for detail extraction associated with each spectral band. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art FE approaches by employing data sets acquired by the IKONOS, the Quickbird, and the WorldVievv-3 sensors.

AB  - We examine the main natural features and the present status of geosystems across the territory of the northeastern Hovsgol region. The source of observational evidence concerning the state of the landscapes was provided by field expedition-based investigations, with emphasis placed on the study of the species and age composition of vegetation in conjunction with dynamical processes as well as geomorphological characteristics of the study area. The present status of geosystems across the study territory was analyzed by methods of visual interpretation and automated processing of spatial information using GIS technologies on the basis of Earth remote sensing data, field investigations of landscapes, topographic maps as well as literature sources. Special attention was paid to the analysis of the digital elevation model that was generated on the basis of SRTM 4 data in order to determine the morphometric characteristics of the location of geosystems, assign them to a particular type of classification of geosystems and compile the map legend. The legend to the landscape map was produced on the basis of a classification of a number of geomers as developed by V.B. Sochava in his theory of geosystems. As a result of the work done, we compiled the medium-scale landscape-typological map of geosystems (Sc 1:200000) on the level of groups of facies.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Smallholder Irrigated Agriculture in the Horn of Africa Using GEOBIA and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated agriculture practiced by smallholders is essential for food security in East Africa. Insight in the spatio-temporal distribution of irrigated agriculture is required to optimize irrigation water use. Irrigation-mapping efforts in the complex smallholder-dominated agricultural landscape in the Horn of Africa so far are generally too coarse and often the extent of smallholder irrigated agriculture is underestimated. The arrival of Sentinel-2 (10-m resolution) considerably enhanced the prospect of analyzing agriculture at field level. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility to map spatio-temporal patterns of smallholder irrigated agriculture in the Horn of Africa using a novel method based on object-based image analysis and Sentinel-2 imagery. The method includes segmentation at field level and smart process-based rules on neighbouring objects and NDVI time series to distinguish irrigated agriculture from rainfed agriculture. The assumption is that irrigation is applied at field level, while a rainfall event is not restricted to field borders and that this information on the local context of irrigated agriculture can be exploited in an object-based approach. Monthly land-use maps on irrigated agriculture were produced for September 2016 to August 2017 at 10-m resolution field level (objects). Three different spatial-heterogeneity thresholds were used to describe the vegetation development of neighbouring objects and to assign crop growth to either rainfall or irrigation. This method is unique as it can discriminate irrigation-and rainfall-induced crop growth, even in the rainy season. The estimates of irrigated agriculture in the Horn of Africa range from 27.96 Mha to 37.13 Mha. This is 2.8 to 3.7 times higher than the current highest estimate, the Global Irrigated Area Map at 1000 m resolution, and 1.2 to 1.7 times higher than the Irrigated Area Map Asia (2000-2010) and Africa (2010) when including water-managed non-irrigated croplands. For the dry season (October-March), the estimates of irrigated agriculture range from 17.67 Mha to 23.72 Mha. The irrigation frequency, the number of time steps (months) with irrigation events in the studied year, varies strongly. Irrigated area with an irrigation frequency of 1 to 2 events has a mapped surface area of 22.57 Mha to 23.13 Mha. Irrigated area with an irrigation frequency of 3 or more events has a mapped surface area of 4.83 Mha to 14.56 Mha. The produced maps will provide valuable information for the development of irrigated agriculture and optimization of irrigation water use in the Horn of Africa. In addition, the portability of this method to other (semi-) arid regions seems feasible as the local context of irrigated agriculture, used in this study for irrigation classification, describes universal characteristics regarding irrigated agriculture. This is especially valuable in the context of food security and water availability for other large data-poor regions in low-and middle-income countries.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) is a surgical method to stage certain cancer types in a minimally invasive manner. However, the current sensing methods for SNB are limited in accuracy, as they are based on acoustic feedback radiation probes to detect tracer enriched sentinel lymph nodes. We present a deep neural network approach to learn the latent spatial activity distributions from a simulated gamma source on 2D activity images. Data processing can then be applied for multi-pinhole collimator optimization, lymph node visualization or surgical navigation to further support SNB. Using simulations of photon multi-pinhole collimator interaction, we generate labeled synthetic 2D activity images to train convolutional neural networks (CNN). These CNNs are then evaluated on synthetic as well as on real experimental data from a radioactive point-like source, collected by our own stationary small form factor multi-pinhole collimator. We achieve good results on synthetic data for the xy-component ensemble learners with a localization class accuracy of 0.97, while depth estimation achieves a localization class accuracy of 0.55. Accuracy on real experimental data is limited due to the small sample set and its variability, compared to the simulation.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to substantiate the mechanisms of public administration, the use of which is necessary for the development of the educational potential of elderly citizens. The authors apply theoretical and comparative analysis of the experience of different countries using such types of mechanisms of public administration as legal, organizational and social, necessary to create conditions for the development of educational potential (as an element of human capital) of elderly citizens. The result of the study is to identify the need for a comprehensive application of the legal, organizational and social mechanism, as well as public-private partnership by public authorities. Scientific novelty consists in the substantiation of characteristics peculiar to different types of public administration mechanisms. Also, the scientific novelty of the study is to prove that the social mechanism affects not only the educational potential of older citizens, but also the worldview of public servants who develop laws, strategies under the influence of specific ideas and values. The result of the impact of the social mechanism should be the formation of new ideas in society and new types of behavior of both elderly citizens in education and representatives of public administration. Ideas about the need to develop the educational potential of older citizens, based on the best international experience, are reflected in official documents, in the availability of different types of programs, in creating conditions for the development of new life knowledge and skills, in obtaining new professions or continuing successful work.

TI  - The Philosopher's "Cursed Chance": Lev Shestov and Varvara Malakhieva-Mirovich
T2  - RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the causes of Lev Shestov's psychological and worldview crises that he experienced in 1895, forcing the thinker to abandon his idealist philosophy and to embark on a path of groundlessness and adogmatism. Furthermore, the author traces the stages of Shestov becoming a philosopher, beginning with his early works on Shakespeare and Vladimir Solovyov. According to Silver-Age polemicist, translator, and poet Varvara Malakhieva-Mirovich, Shestov's philosophy of tragedy was born of the thinker's own personal drama. The encounters between Malakhieva-Mirovich and Shestov left a noticeable trace in Malakhieva-Mirovich's worldview and work: she assimilated Shestov's ideas about "creativity from nothing," "the seventh day of creation," and hopelessness as a source of hope.

AB  - The typical activities in a harbor mainly concern logistics, traffic and transportation that need to be monitored or optimized. This paper reports a measurement campaign whose goal is to evaluate the performance of activity surveillance in a harbor using satellite SAR systems. The measurements were conducted in the southern Baltic sea, around the Verko harbor in Karlskrona, Sweden in the middle of 2018. The SAR data acquisition was with TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X operating in staring spotlight mode as high resolution was desired. For an accurate evaluation, all activities in the Verko harbor were video recorded by a drone during the satellite measurement time. Some radar corner reflectors were also deployed on the ground that are available for co-registration. The data associated with two measurements in the end of August and in the beginning of September is presented in this paper. The SAR change detection processing and the initial analysis show the possibility to monitor activities concerning logistics, traffic and transportation using satellite SAR.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of urban water and energy regimes, yet our understanding of the role of vegetation in the urban water cycle is still poor. In order to assess the diurnal and seasonal variability of ET from urban vegetation types, an interdisciplinary sampling campaign integrating remote sensing and field-based methods is currently underway at a study site in Berlin, Germany. The sampling is being conducted from spring to winter 2019 in order to characterize the seasonality in hydroclimatic drivers and phenological effects on ET. Three main vegetation types (urban grassland, trees, and shrubs) are sampled. Drone flights with multispectral and thermal cameras are being undertaken. Leaf Area Index and soil moisture are being measured, at monthly and 15-minute resolution, respectively. Using LI-6800, the diurnal and seasonal variation of gas exchange and stomatal conductance is being measured. ET estimates from drone data will be derived using algorithms, such as the "Triangle Method" [1] and 3T model [2] and validated with field-based ET estimates. Eddy flux data will be analyzed to validate modelled ET and provide hydroclimatic data. Sap flow monitoring will quantify tree transpiration. In the first stage of this study, a time series of ET across seasonal and diurnal scales of a single year will be generated for the local study area. Then, the fieldvalidated UAV data will be combined with satellite data to upscale ET spatially and temporally to provide multi-year estimates of ET for the entire urban area (Berlin). This study will provide an enhanced understanding of the spatio-temporal variability of ET of urban vegetation, which will be essential for urban planning in the context of climate change.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable in characterizing the surface energy and water balance at the land surface-atmosphere interface [1, 2]. Vegetation reduces the LST by providing shade and absorbing radiation energy via transpiration and photosynthesis [3, 4]. A review of research on urban green spaces recommended that future research should incorporate functional, structural, and configurational parameters of urban vegetation in order to more fully assess the thermal effect of green spaces [5]. This study aims to fill this research gap by considering satellite-derived LST (Landsat 8), biotope types and 3D vegetation data in a study of LST across diurnal and seasonal temporal scales in a mid-latitude city (Berlin). Four cloud-free Landsat 8 scenes representing each season were analyzed. Day and night summer scenes with comparable air temperatures were used to assess the day/ night difference in LST. Kruskall-Wallis tests and Dunn's post-hoc tests were applied to assess the significance of difference between LST of biotope classes and subclasses. Overall, LST varied significantly between the majority of biotope classes and subclasses. The relative coolness of each biotope class differed based on the season. The lowest and highest day/night LST variation could be noted for water biotope classes and dwarf shrub heaths, respectively. Vegetation height was significantly negatively correlated with LST (p-value<0.001) for all day scenes. Our results contribute to an enhanced understanding of how biotope types influence LST in an urban environment, which will be vital to urban planning in light of climate change.

AB  - This dataset contains 8-day imagery of chlorophyll-a size distribution (CSD) slope, which is an index of phytoplankton size structure, derived by the CSD model. The CSD slope is calculated from emote sensing reflectance at 8 MODIS bands (412, 443, 469, 488, 531, 547, 555, and 678 nm). A large CSD slope indicates a large proportion of smaller phytoplankton, whereas a small CSD slope suggests that larger phytoplankton dominate. To avoid unrealistic values of the CSD slope, we defined the upper and lower limits of the CSD slope as 3.0 and 0.0, respectively.

AB  - Agricultural monitoring is of growing importance due to an increasing world population, slowing growth of agricultural output and concerns regarding food security. Remote sensing and dynamic crop modeling are powerful tools for yield prediction and frequently applied in literature. A large question arising in this context is the assimilation of remote sensing data into the model process. We present a novel technique employing Particle Swarm Optimization in an updating scheme flexibly incorporating different sources of uncertainty in both the model simulation and remote sensing observations. We tested the technique with the AquaCrop-OS model for winter wheat yield prediction by updating canopy cover obtained from remote sensing datasets. Preliminary results showed that the new method can outperform both a simple replacement update and a Kalman filter approach. It succeeded in removing the bias from field- level yield predictions and reducing the RMSE from 1.32 t/ha to 0.89 t/hm.

AB  - The objective of this study is to detect flooded area in rice paddy fields in Indonesia by using remotely sensed data. We used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for this purpose, because it is capable of getting high-resolution data in almost all-weather conditions. The paper gives a result of detecting flooded area occurred in our research sites located close to Bandung area, Tegalluar in Bojongsoang district, from the end of February to the beginning of March in 2018. The C-band SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1 were used for this analysis. We derived the gamma-naught threshold for dividing flood and non-flood areas by using a linear discriminant analysis. Discriminant accuracy reached 98% using VV polarization. By using the gamma-naught threshold and rice paddy field mask (GIS data), the rice paddy flooded area could be extracted with good accuracy.

AB  - The goal of this research was to evaluate the effect of Arctic climate change on the surrounding land area. In this research, we investigated a method to monitor the ice condition of shallow lakes in the Arctic region using C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and provide a strategy to evaluate the effect of climate change on the Arctic land area. A method to monitor the ice condition of these lakes was investigated using the SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1 from 2015 to 2018. We confirmed that the C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 could monitor the ice condition of shallow lakes in northern Alaska. The backscattering threshold between floating and grounded ice was -14.8 to -16.8 dB depending on the incidence angle. We could also successfully monitor the growth of floating ice by using the interferometric SAR approach.

T2  - INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR ENERGY TRANSITIONS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Conference on Applied Energy (ICAE)
CL  - Hong Kong, HONG KONG
AB  - Solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most promising technologies for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy production. Accurate spatial and temporal modelling of solar irradiance is a key factor in the evaluation of PV technology potential for harvesting solar energy. We present here a data-driven approach based on an ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines using geographic and topographic features in input to predict the global horizontal irradiance in Switzerland from coarse-resolution satellite measurements. This provides a precise mapping of hourly global solar irradiance for each (250 x 250) m2 pixel of a grid covering the entire country. The uncertainty on predicted values is quantified through a variance-based analysis, able to distinguish between model and data uncertainty. The former amounts to 1%, whereas the latter is close to 15% of the predicted values. The presented methodology is scalable and applicable to any large environmental dataset. Our modelling of solar irradiance at hourly temporal resolution and of its uncertainty will allow for an estimate of hourly PV potential in Switzerland to facilitate a more efficient integration of solar photovoltaics into the built environment.

TI  - Information on doctor and pharmacy shopping for opioids adds little to the identification of presumptive opioid abuse disorders in health insurance claims data
T2  - SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Doctor and pharmacy shopping ("Shopping") for opioids is related to opioid abuse and is associated with opioid overdose and death. Lacking identifiers for prescribers and pharmacies, many data resources (notably the US FDA's Sentinel System) cannot evaluate Shopping. We used data in which presumptive Shopping could be identified. We investigated whether US health insurance claims data could perform as well as Shopping to identify people with evidence for opioid abuse.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we examined health insurance claims from 164,923 persons with at least two dispensing of opioids in 18 months, the first occurring in 2012. Evidence for the presence of a possible opioid abuse disorder was drawn from predictive patterns of drug fills, diagnoses and care-seeking identified in a companion research project, and Shopping was determined using a published index. The prevalence of presumptive opioid abuse was examined across levels of Shopping. The comparison between Shopping and insurance-claims-derived covariates in the detection of apparent opioid abuse was examined in multiple regression analyses.Results: Despite a strong correlation between presumptive opioid abuse and Shopping, most persons with extensive Shopping did not manifest presumptive opioid abuse, and half of the population with presumptive opioid abuse did not exhibit Shopping. As Shopping ranged from "None" to "Extensive," the prevalence of presumptive opioid abuse increased from 0.28 to 5.0 per 100. The discriminating power of Shopping for identifying opioid abuse could be replaced using insurance claims data.Conclusion: The results suggest that patient characteristics that can be inferred from insurance claims data provide as complete discrimination of persons with presumptive opioid abuse as does a full assessment of doctor and pharmacy shopping. The inference rests on patterns of health services and drug dispensing that are indicative of doctor-pharmacy shopping and of opioid abuse. There was no direct evaluation of patients. The extent to which the conclusions are generalizable beyond the study population - Americans with health insurance coverage in the early part of this decade - is uncertain in a quantitative sense. The qualitative conclusion is that diagnostic data in health insurance databases can be predictive of behaviors consistent with opioid abuse and that more elaborate indices such as doctor and pharmacy shopping may add little.

TI  - Whose Foot(print)? An Analysis of Aspects of the Implied Worldview of Daniel Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, Michel Tournier's <i>Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique</i> and Stephen King's "<i>Survivor Type</i>"
T2  - GERMANISCH-ROMANISCHE MONATSSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay attempts to develop a reading strategy by means of which aspects of the implied worldview of a literary text - especially a narrative text - can be systematically analysed. Taking Lotman's notion of the world-modeling function of literature as its point of departure, the article argues that with regard to a given worldview topic such as 'belief in God' and the 'essence of life', a literary text is ultimately determined by an overriding hypothesis. It then applies this working assumption to a foundational work of the English novel, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and to two twentieth-century re-writings, Michel Tournier's Vendredi and Stephen King's "Survivor Type". The article concludes that the assumption of such a dominant hypothesis can indeed serve as a helpful tool in order to access and describe the ideological deep structure of narrative texts, although further testing is required.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Symposium on Education in Astronomy and Astrobiology (ISE2A)
CL  - Utrecht, NETHERLANDS
AB  - In a preliminary empirical study of social-science and humanities students enrolled in teacher-training programs at two German universities, the authors have found a disparaging view of technology and science among said students. Their material knowledge of technology and science is the result of content they learned in high-school themselves. After having graduated, they chose social-sciences or humanities as their subjects. There is little or no overlap between science and engineering subjects and social-science and humanities subjects in teacher training programs. Apart from the students choices, this is also the consequence of an institutionally established and strict segregation of the academic fields that does not, unlike in other university systems, require the students to enroll in at least basic interdisciplinary courses. The result for science and technology awareness among the students is problematic, to say the least. While their knowledge of science and technology -being the product of high-school education - is often not up to date and also lacking in current developments, their moral and ethical judgement about the implications of scientific research and use of technology is strong. The preliminary study also showed that the students are interested in new technological and scientific developments, they just lack the ability to include this into their worldview, which is very strongly influenced by their choice of subjects in the humanities and social-sciences. Teaching these students has convinced the authors that their lack of technology and science knowledge combined with their inherent tendency to judge science and technology from the point of view of their respective field, impairs their ability to take an adequate part in science and technology discourse. Their awareness, and thus, their competence to rationally engage with science and technology is lacking. That is in part due to the depiction of science and technology in humanities and social-science courses, and on the other hand due to a lack of current science and technology education as part of a humanities and social-sciences program. The result becomes even more alarming if we assume that the future teachers will continue to relay their heavily biased opinions on science and technology in general, as well as their deficient knowledge of specific technologies to their future students, thus generating a vicious cycle of inadequate technology and science awareness. As the authors' study has shown, these students are really interested in science and technology, they just lack key competencies to make an analytical connection between their field of choice (humanities and social sciences) and technology and science, without resorting to moral and ethical judgement.

TI  - Imaging the 2013 explosive crater excavation and new dome formation at Volcan de Colima with TerraSAR-X, time-lapse cameras and modelling
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The summit region of steep volcanoes hosting lava domes often displays rapid geomorphologic and structural changes, which are important for monitoring the source region of hazards. Explosive crater excavation is often followed by new lava-dome growth, which is one of the most dynamic morphometric changes that may occur at volcanoes. However, details of these crater formations, and the ensuing new dome growth remain poorly studied. A common problem is the lack of observational data due to hazardous field access and the limited resolution of satellite remote sensing techniques. This paper describes the destructive-constructive crater activity at Volcan de Colima, Mexico, which occurred between January and March 2013. The crater geometry and early dome formation were observed through a combination of high-resolution TerraSAR-X spotmode satellite radar images and permanently installed monitoring cameras. This combined time-lapse imagery was used to identify ring-shaped gas emissions prior to the explosion and to distinguish between the sequential explosion and crater excavation stages, which were followed by dome growth. By means of particle image velocimetry, the digital flow field is computed from consecutive camera images, showing that vertical dome growth is dominant at the beginning. The upward growth is found to grade into spreading and a lateral growth domain. After approximately two months of gradually filling the excavated craters with new magma, the dome overflows the western margin of the crater and develops into a flow that produces block and ash flow hazards. We discuss and compare the observations to discrete element models, allowing us to mimic the vertical and lateral growth history of the dome and to estimate the maximum strength of the bulk rock mass. Moreover, our results allow a discussion on the controls of a critical dome height that may be reached prior to its gravitational spreading. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Registration of image collections and video sequences is a critical component in algorithms designed to extract actionable intelligence from remotely sensed data. While methodologies for registration continue to evolve, the accuracy of alignment remains dependent on how well the approach tolerates changes in capture geometry, sensor characteristics, and scene content. Differences in imaging modality and field-of-view present additional challenges. Registration techniques have progressed from simple, global correlation-based algorithms, to higher-order model fitting using salient image features, to two-stage approaches leveraging high-fidelity sensor geometry, to new methods that exploit high-performance computing and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The latter offers important advantages by removing model assumptions and learning feature extraction directly through the minimization of a registration cost function. Deep learning approaches to image registration are still relatively unexplored for overhead imaging, and their ability to accommodate a large problem domain offers potential for several new developments.This work presents a new network architecture that improves accuracy and generalization capabilities over our modality-agnostic deep learning approach to registration that recently advanced the state of the art. A thoroughly tested ConvNet pyramid remains the core of our network approach, and has been optimized for registration and generalized to begin addressing derivative applications such as mosaic generation. Further modifications, such as objective function masking and reduced interpolation, have also been implemented to improve the overall registration process. As before, the trained network ingests image frames, applies a vector field, and returns a version of the input image that has been warped to the reference. Qualitative and quantitative performance of the new architecture is evaluated using several overhead still and full-motion video (FMV) data sets.

TI  - Retrieval of Green-up Onset Date From MODIS Derived NDVI in Grasslands of Inner Mongolia
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to retrieve the onset date of spring phenology in grasslands of Inner Mongolia from 2002 to 2017. To validate the application of MODIS derived data, long-term retrieval and investigation on its reliability was performed. The correlation between MODIS derived green-up onset date and ground observations from 2002 to 2012 were given medium to high strength (R-2: 0.58-0.81). Besides, the relationship between seasonal climate variables, including winter and spring precipitation and temperature, and MODIS derived green-up onset date from 2002 to 2017 were established. Overall, linear regression analysis shows that there are 8-12 days RMSE for climate variables explaining green-up onset date shifting. This satellite method might have a poor performance in sparse and snow-cover grasslands but is fitted well in medium to dense vegetation and snow-free grasslands. These suggest that MODIS estimated spring phenology has the potential to be applied in grass resources utilization in Inner Mongolia.

AB  - Mapping of native plant species and noxious weeds is critical to monitor grassland degradation in the Three-River Headwaters Region. The grass species in the study area were divided into native plant species and noxious weeds based on the applicability of grazing. Field data of the two kinds of grass species were collected and divided into ten coverage grades with an interval of 10%. The eight original bands were used to derive 37 features by Random Forest (RF) algorithm, including first derivative (FD), vegetation indexes (VI), biochemical indexes (BI), hat transform (KT) and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The importance of each feature was calculated and 17 of them were selected by RF, reflecting their superiority in identifying native plant species and noxious weeds. The random forest algorithm was also used in classification of the native plant species with an overall accuracy (OA) of 43.2% (8 bands), 45.9% (37 features) and 51.3% (17 selected features) and an 10% grade expansion accuracy (GEA) of 59.4%, 64.8% and 70.2%, respectively. The noxious weeds with a higher overall accuracy (OA) of 62.1% (8 bands), 64.8% (37 features) and 67.5% (17 selected features) and an 10% grade expansion accuracy (GEA) of 86.4%, 83.7% and 89.1%, respectively. Therefore, the classification of native plant species and noxious weeds coverage grades with the interval of 10% demonstrated the potential of the WorldView-2 data for mapping native plant species and noxious weeds in the typical area of Three-River Headwaters Region.

TI  - Oasis Landscape Pattern Dynamics in Manas River Watershed Based on Remote Sensing and Spatial Metrics
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Constant alterations of oasis landscape pattern, triggered by specific natural and human driving forces, have aroused some heated discussions in the field of regional environmental change research especially in arid areas. In this study, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Soil Brightness Index have been selected to successfully identify discrete land cover classes derived from a series of Landsat satellite images of Manas River watershed in 1989, 1998, and 2014. FRAGSTATS and principal components analysis were used to recognize independent components of landscape structure. Nine land cover classes combined with ten landscape metrics indicated variations in the composition and configuration of landscape pattern. Results related to historical data were analyzed to identify driving forces, mainly including population growth, agricultural modernization, urbanization, and water resource provision. The results revealed a trend toward less landscape fragmentation, as indicated by a steady decrease in the number of patches as well as an increase in mean patch size and contagion. To be more specific, we found substantial increases in cropland (72.3%) as well as built-up land (43.7%) with larger and more compact patches, while water (64.1%), snow cover (52.0%), and saline-alkali soil (48.5%) dropped sharply. Our findings suggested that population influx and reclamation of saline-alkali soil were two major driving forces critical to those landscape pattern changes.

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter for describing vegetation change and growth trend. Due to various problems of satellite observation and retrieval algorithm, spatio-temporal complete LAI data is limited, which hindered the application of LAI in different areas. In this paper, a data fusion method, multiresolution tree (MRT) model, was used to develop LAI of different spatial resolution. Three LAI data sets of Landsat (30 m), MODIS (450 m) and GLASS (900 m) are used. MRT was performed in Ukraine area including farmland, forestland and grassland. Results indicate that MRT is an efficient algorithm to get spatial complete LAI estimation at different resolution. LAI of different spatial resolution consists well, R 2 and RMSE are 0.8612 and 0.3986 when compare Landsat LAI with MODIS LAI, which are 0.7568 and 0.4736 when compare Landsat with Glass.

AB  - Sun light reflected from sea surface forms a high intensity solar ray. Sun-glint is created by Fresnel reflection which contaminates ocean color products. It covers up the real physical characteristics of water bodies and interferes with the inversion of ocean remote sensing data precision. In this paper, sun glint regional characteristics are simulated and analyzed in consideration of the different satellite attitude angles and time phases based on Cox-Munk model. The numerical simulation shows that through the satellites adjust attitude dynamically, the contamination area decreases by 11.8%.On-orbit test data are used to evaluate the method precision and it will contributes to the estimation of sun glint regional characteristics and strategy of on-orbit use.

AB  - Coastal Zone Imager(CZI) was designed for coastal water body and islands. To analyze the potential application of Chinese ocean color satellite in coastal zone area and evaluate the image quality, we used subjective and objective evaluation method and took a comparison between Chinese ocean color satellite and gaofen series satellite. Subjective evaluation showed that Chinese ocean color satellite images had a better performance than gaofen series satellite images in water bodies. Based on statistical information,objective evaluation showed that each band gray distribution of Chinese ocean color satellite images was more dispersed and had a higher separability feature. Applying evaluation showed that Chinese ocean color satellite also performed better in terms of texture property and classification accuracy. Overall Chinese ocean color satellite had a high image quality and potential applications in coastal areas.

AB  - Millions of wave mode synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are routinely acquired by the ESA's two sentinel-1 satellites every month over the open ocean. These SAR images capture clear imprints of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) roll vortices. This provides a new and unique opportunity to investigate the characteristics of ABL rolls globally and statistically. In this study, we take advantage of the deep learning classification tool that has been successfully developed to automatically identify ABL rolls. For each SAR image classified with ABL rolls, roll wavelength and orientation are extracted through spectral analysis. Surface meteorological variables are also collocated with each SAR image to address the atmospheric conditions of roll occurrence. Results show that roll vortices are prevalent over the whole ocean and mainly occur in unstable to near-neutral stratification. Roll characteristics follow the theoretical expectation and are in good agreement with previous studies.

AB  - Plastic-mulched landcover (PML) is an important type of agricultural landscape and remote sensing is an effective way for monitoring and mapping PML. Based on Gaofen-2 (GF-2) and Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) fused data, this study applied an object-based random forest classification (OBRFC) method, which combines object-based image analysis (OBIA) technology with random forest (RF) model, to map PML. The method consists of the following steps: (1) image segmentation with a multiresulution segmentation (MRS) algorithm; (2) selection of sample objects (or segments) and 50 features of index, texture, and shape based on prior knowledge and relevant references; and (3) determination of two particularly important parameters, the number of decision trees-T and the feature number of split nodes -F, by comparing classification accuracy of a series of experiments. The results from applying the OBRFC method on the study area show: 1) the best overall accuracy (OA) of OBARFC reaches 91.73%; 2) by setting T to 50, OA curve presents a downward trend with the highest value of 91.72% at F = 5; and 3) by setting F to 5, OA reaches its best value at T = 50.

AB  - In order to accurately extract landslide disaster information from SAR images, we propose a clustering algorithm for landslide detection using multi-temporal fully polarimetric SAR image. By combining Freeman-Durden decomposition with H /alpha /A decomposition method, this algorithm makes full use of scattering power and scattering entropy information. Furthermore, a hierarchical method is proposed to overcome the drawback that fuzzy membership function family of multi-region classification cannot always satisfy the constraint conditions to guarantee functional convexity. Such method ensures that the constraint conditions can always be satisfied and improves the accuracy of classification. Finally, the landslide disaster area is accurately extracted from the two classification maps by change detection. The results of the C-band RadarSat-2 data are provided to demonstrate its competitive general performance of image classification.

TI  - An optimized two-stage spatial sampling scheme for winter wheat acreage estimation using remotely sensed imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable information on crop acreage is essential for formulating grain production policies and ensuring national food security. The combination of available satellite-based remotely sensed images and traditional sampling methods offers the possibility of improved crop acreage estimation at a regional scale. Due to the administrative convenience, reduced survey cost and workload, two-stage sampling has widely been used for crop acreage survey at the large-scale regions. However, compared with single-stage sampling, the two-stage sampling can introduce larger estimation errors, since it has multiple sampling stages. This study's aim is to optimize the two-stage sampling scheme using satellite-based remotely sensed imagery to improve the accuracy of crop acreage estimation. Taking Mengcheng County, Anhui Province, China, as the study area, this study explored the influence of stratum boundary and sample selection method on the sampling efficiency at the first sampling stage, analysed the impact of sample size on population extrapolation accuracy and then optimized the sample size of the second sampling stage using crop thematic map retrieved by ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) AVNIR (Advanced Visible light and Near Infrared Radiometer)-2 images in 2009. The results showed that the relative error (RE), coefficient of variation (CV), standard error (SE) of population extrapolation, and sampling fraction (f) using the cumulative square root of frequency (CSRF) method is the minimum among three methods for the stratum boundary determination at the first sampling stage, followed by the equal interval (EI) and equal sample size (ESS) method. Moreover, the RE, CV, and SE of population extrapolation using the ST sampling method is the minimum, compared with simple random (SI) and systematic (SY) sampling method. Therefore, the sampling scheme of the first stage can be optimized by CSRF method for stratum boundary determination and stratified sampling (ST) sampling method for samples selection. At the second sampling stage, RE and CV values of population extrapolation decrease as the sample size increases. Comprehensively considering the accuracy, stability of population extrapolation and sampling cost, the most cost-effective sample size for estimating the winter wheat acreage of the study area is 4. From the perspective of the reasonable selection of sample selection methods, sample size and determination of stratum boundaries, this study provides an important basis for formulating a cost-effective two-stage spatial sampling scheme for crop acreage estimation.

TI  - The Assessment of Landsat-8 OLI Atmospheric Correction Algorithms for Inland Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensor on Landsat-8 has the potential to meet the requirements of remote sensing of water color. However, the optical properties of inland waters are more complex than those of oceanic waters, and inland atmospheric correction presents additional challenges. We examined the performance of atmospheric correction (AC) methods for remote sensing over three highly turbid or hypereutrophic inland waters in China: Lake Hongze, Lake Chaohu, and Lake Taihu. Four water-AC algorithms (SWIR (Short Wave Infrared), EXP (Exponential Extrapolation), DSF (Dark Spectrum Fitting), and MUMM (Management Unit Mathematics Models)) and three land-AC algorithms (FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes), 6SV (a version of Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), and QUAC (Quick Atmospheric Correction)) were assessed using Landsat-8 OLI data and concurrent in situ data. The results showed that the EXP (and DSF) together with 6SV algorithms provided the best estimates of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and band ratios in water-AC algorithms and land-AC algorithms, respectively. AC algorithms showed a discriminating accuracy for different water types (turbid waters, in-water algae waters, and floating bloom waters). For turbid waters, EXP gave the best R-rs in visible bands. For the in-water algae and floating bloom waters, however, all water-algorithms failed due to an inappropriate aerosol model and non-zero reflectance at 1609 nm. The results of the study show the improvements that can be achieved considering SWIR bands and using band ratios, and the need for further development of AC algorithms for complex aquatic and atmospheric conditions, typical of inland waters.

TI  - A new privacy attack network for remote sensing images classification with small training samples
T2  - MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solving overfitting problems of privacy attacks on small-sample remote sensing data is still a big challenge in practical application. We propose a new privacy attack network, called joint residual network (JRN), for deep learning based privacy objects classification of small-sample remote sensing images in this paper. Unlike the original residual network structure, which add the bottom feature map to top feature map, JRN fuses the bottom feature map with top feature map by matrix joint. It can reduce the possibility that convolution layers extract the noise of training set or consider the inherent attributes of training set as the whole sample attributes. A series benchmark experiments based on GoogleNet model have been enforced and finally, we compare the model process output and the classification accuracy on small-sample data sets. On the UCMLU data set, the GoogleNet-Feat model which is integrated with JRN is 1.66% higher of accuracy than the original GoogleNet model and 1.87% higher than the GoogleNet-R model; on the WHU-RS dataset, GoogleNet-Feat model is 1.04% higher than the GoogleNet model, and is 3.12% higher than the GoogleNet-R model. Compared with the contrast experiments, the classification accuracy of GoogleNet-Feat is the highest when facing the overfitting problems resulting from the small samples.

TI  - Comparison of machine learning algorithms for soil salinity predictions in three dryland oases located in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XJUAR) of China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many different machine learning approaches have been applied for various purposes. However, there has been limited guidance regarding which, if any, machine learning models and covariate sets might be optimal for predicting soil salinity across different oases in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XJUAR) of China. This study aimed to compare five machine learning algorithms, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest tree ensembles (RF), and Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), to predict soil salinity in three geographically distinct areas (the Qitai, Kuqa, and Yutian oases). A total of 21 data sets from three oases were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and to screen the optimal variables. The results show the following indices are considered to be important indicators for quantitative assessment of soil salinity: EEVI, CSRI, EVI2, GDVI, SAIO, and SIT. Comparison results show that SGT is the most suitable algorithm for predicting soil salinity in arid areas. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of machine learning techniques for soil salinity prediction and may assist in the modeling and variable selection of digital soil mapping in the XJUAR of China.

AB  - China's new generation of geostationary weather satellite, FengYun-4A (FY-4A) carrying the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) was launched on December 1 2016 and its data became publicly available on March 12 2018. The availability of high temporal observation at visible, near infrared, short-wave infrared and long-wave infrared bands over stable snow covered areas in China inspired this study to investigate the feasibility of FY-4A AGRI to estimate fractional snow cover. In this preliminary study, we present the multiple end-member spectral mixture analysis on FY-4A AGRI's 5-band reflectances for snow covered area estimation. The end-members were extracted automatically from multispectral images and typical end-members were selected using the vector length. To account for the reflectance variation due to sun-target-sensor geometry, the end-member extraction and selection and subsequent estimation were implemented by the 5 degrees x5 degrees spatial window. The fractional snow cover estimates were evaluated by using reference data from corresponding Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)'s 30- m resolution observations. The outcome indicated that FY-4A AGRI's fractional snow cover agrees well with Landsat-8 OLI's 30 m estimates. Comparisons showed that root mean squared error of FY-4A AGRI fractional snow cover ranges from 0.10 to 0.16 with R2 exceeding 0.7.

AB  - In 2016, the first Chinese synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite, was launched. Unlike the single-polarized wave mode SARs in Europe, GF-3 is the first satellite acquiring the quad-polarized SAR data in wave mode configuration, which could benefit the ocean wave estimation. Here, the ocean wave spectra estimation from quad-polarized GF-3 wave mode is presented and its performances are evaluated. For the period from January to October in 2017, the ocean wave spectra were inverted from GF-3 wave mode data. The quad-polarized SAR-ocean spectra inversion scheme was utilized, in which the azimuthal and range wave slopes are obtained from the vertically and linearly polarized normalized radar cross sections and then converted to ocean wave slope spectra. The validation was also performed through comparisons against directional wave buoy observations. The spatio-temporal criteria of 100 km and 0.5 h, yield 87 match-ups. Two representative cases illustrate the consistency between the GF-3 SAR ocean wave spectra and buoy measurements. Statistical assessment shows the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.35 m, 19.52 m and 24.89 degrees for the significant wave height, peak wavelength and wave direction, respectively. Evaluation results indicate that the quad-polarized algorithm is suitable for spectral ocean wave estimation from GF-3 wave mode, and encouraging for operational implementation.

AB  - Magnetomotive ultrasound (MMUS), capable of imaging in vivo magnetic nanoparticle distribution, has shown its potential in extravascular ultrasound molecular imaging, magnetic nano-drug delivery monitoring, and sentinel lymph node identification. To date, most of the research teams in the world mainly implemented forward mode MMUS where the imaging object has to lie in between an ultrasound probe and an electromagnet, which is not clinically translatable. However, in our previously proposed backward mode MMUS, the MMUS displacement map was relatively noisy because of the backward-mode setup. Learning from the principle of magnetic particle imaging, we propose a new strategy to improve the backward-mode MMUS via pre-magnetization of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The new MMUS probe consists of an electromagnet for magnetic excitation and a static magnet for pre-magnetization of SPIONs. The pre-magnetization is to magnetize the SPIONs with a preset magnetic field in advance so that according to the nonlinear characteristics of the SPION magnetization curve, SPIONs can have higher magnetic susceptibility of SPIONs during magnetic excitation; thus increasing the magnetomotive force applied to SPIONs. Therefore, the displacement resulting from the magnetomotion of the SPIONs can be increased, which in turn improves the MMUS detectability of the SPIONs in backward mode. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in the improvement of the backward mode MMUS.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the retrieval of crop phenology using polarimetric decompositions and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. To realize this objective, we used multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data and ground measured vegetation characteristics acquired during the SMAPVEX16-MB (Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2016 in Manitoba) campaign in Canada. Polarimetric parameters with the potential to quantify the volume scattering mechanism were extracted, and then analyzed with respect to ground identified phenology for different crop types. The RF algorithm was subsequently trained based on 60% of the data, and validated using the remaining data. Results show that the crop phenology can be monitored, through the combination of multiple polarimetric parameters to build different decision trees in the RF algorithm. By averaging the estimates from multiple decision trees, the complex relative patterns between the polarimetric parameters and crop phenology were recognized, leading to appropriate estimations on crop phenology. The obtained spearman correlation coefficients between the retrieved and ground identified crop phenology were 0.94, 0.91, 0.81 and 0.89 for canola, corn, soybean and wheat, respectively. This study also suggests suitable polarimetric parameters for a timely monitoring of crop phenology.

AB  - Although nanotechnology has led to important advances in in vitro diagnostics, the development of nanosensors for in vivo molecular detection remains very challenging. Here, we demonstrated the proof-of-principle of in vivo detection of nucleic acid targets using a promising type of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanosensor implanted in the skin of a large animal model (pig). The in vivo "smart tattoo" nanosensor used in this study employs the "inverse molecular sentinel" (iMS) detection scheme, which is a label-free homogeneous biosensing system based on a non-enzymatic DNA strand-displacement process and conformational change of stem-loop (hairpin) oligonucleotide probes upon target binding. In this study, plasmonics-active nanostar was utilized as an efficient in vivo SERS sensing platform due to their tunable absorption bands in the near infrared region of the "tissue optical window. The results of this study illustrate the usefulness of SERS iMS nanosensors as an implantable skin-based in vivo biosensing platform, providing a foundation for developments in continuous health status sensing, disease biomarker monitoring, and other clinical translation applications.

AB  - During process of satellite attitude control, the star sensor provides accurate attitude information for the entire control system, and then ensures the precision of following control operations and the stabilization of flight track. To these satellites in the medium and high Earth orbit, the transmittance of entire system will rapidly attenuate after suffering a long time irradiation of space particles, which leads to the inefficacy of total star sensor and inability of providing accurate attitude information for the satellite control system. This paper presents an optical system of long-life star sensor, with optical characteristics that focal length is 49.7mm, relative aperture is 1/1.18, circular field of view is 14.14 degrees, and the spectral range is 0.5 similar to 0.8 mu m. That can meet the requirement of work time at least eight years in space. The optical system is designed by all spherical mirrors with an compact structure which is just composed by six lenses. the first lens of optical system is fused quartz, the other are just made of two different optical glasses. There are some advantages that its energy is more concentrated because of small dispersed spot and low chromatic aberration, it is to be the benefit of overall debugging with better adaptability to the environmental temperature, and it has the function of optical filtering that the transmittance is higher in the work range of spectrum and is lower out the work range of spectrum, which is benefit to eliminate the stray lights.

TI  - Variation trend of total phosphorus and its controlling factors in Lake Taihu, 2010-2017
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the water quality of water bodies in Lake Taihu Basin has improved significantly because that all provinces and municipalities in the basin have intensified their efforts in pollution governance. In Lake Taihu, the concentration of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen showed a significant downward trend, while a upward trend for the concentration of total phosphorus (TP). To explore the reasons for such TP increase, this paper used the measured data and remote sensing data between 2010 to 2017 from Lake Taihu Basin Authority of Ministry of Water Resources. We analyzed the correlation between the pollution load of inflow river, aquatic vegetation and cyanobacteria and the TP. The results showed that the TP in the inflow rivers was higher than those in the Lake Taihu, and TP was not easy to remove from the lake. There was a significant positive correlation between the continuous accumulation of TP loading and the epilimnetic TP in Lake Taihu. It is concluded that the basic factor of the high TP concentration is the large amount of phosphorus loading into the lake. Aquatic vegetation can absorb nutrients from lake sediments and inhibit the resuspension of sediment so as to reduce the release of endogenous nutrients. The substantial decrease of aquatic vegetation led to the increase of TP concentration in East Lake Taihu. Recently the abundance of blue-green algae in Lake Taihu showed an increasing trend. Under such circumstance, the monitoring TP also increased.

AB  - Sensor play an important role in the growth of big data. It is a basic operation for nodes to periodically transmit reports to a sink in many applications in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Because of the limited energy of the nodes, it is important to process data efficiently. Under such applications, a tree is generally adopted the path structure for maintaining the routing tables of sensors. In this paper, considering the difference in the amount of data collected and the speed of data acquisition, we assign different acquisition frequency to the nodes. In addition, we propose a new Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm which is devoted to construct a data aggregation tree with the lowest energy consumption so that the network lifetime is maximized. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional MST in terms of energy consumption.

TI  - What Determines the Change of Lakes in Large Cities under Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activities? Evidence from Eastern China
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are one of the most important wetland types on the earth with many ecosystem functions. With continuing economic growth and climate change, lake abundance and surface areas throughout the world have been threatened by many factors, including by human and environmental disruptions. However, we still have limited knowledge on how human activities and climate change affect lake reductions and associated ecosystem services. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of lake shrinkage will help maintain an ecological balance in urban planning, especially in rapidly developing countries. We explore the determinants of lake shrinkage and abundance reduction from the 1980s to the 2010s using remote sensing data of lakes in two large cities in eastern China: Nanchang and Shanghai. In order to account for the non-independence of time-series data, time series auto-regressive generalized least squares (GLS) models were used to examine the relationship between lake area/abundance and human activities and climate change. Our results show that human activities rather than climate change, are the most important determinants for the areas and numbers of lake shrinkage, and gross domestic product (GDP) and population size could explain more than half of the variation in the number and area of lakes with areas larger than 20 ha in the two cities. GDP and lake area shrinkage do not exhibit a linear relationship. This highlights the importance of wetland protection in the early development stage. Because the main determinants are human activities, cities have the ability to protect wetlands via suitable planning.

AB  - Agile satellites are gaining prevalence in Earth observation missions since they can acquire images over a wide area on the Earth's surface while simultaneously carrying out attitude maneuvers. The coverage belt of a single satellite refers to the sensor's swath on the Earth's surface as the satellite moves on its orbit. This paper presents an adaptive interpolation algorithm for the rapid determination of the coverage belt of a single agile satellite, which is possibly implementing attitude maneuvers. The contribution of this paper consists of two parts. First, an analytical model to compute the coverage belt of an agile satellite on the Earth's surface is established by involving all the projections of the sensor's field of view. Two bounding curves of the coverage belt are analytically determined by a series of discrete swath points, which are related to the position, velocity of the satellite and the shape of the sensor's view field at a specific moment. Second, an adaptive interpolation algorithm, featured with autonomously searching for the interpolation points is utilized to rapidly compute the waveforms of coordinate values of the swath points on the three axes of the Earth Centered Fixed reference frame. Numerical simulation using the Chinese GAOFEN-1-02 satellite is implemented to demonstrate the determination of its coverage belt on the Earth's surface. This adaptive algorithm is appropriate for all orbital types and can reduce over 99% computation cost in the determination of bounding curves compared with the traditional step-by-step method.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF EVAPOTRANSPIRATION FOR IRRIGATED ARTIFICIAL GRASSLANDS IN TYPICAL STEPPE AREAS USING THE METRIC MODEL
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated artificial grasslands can help in achieving a large amount of forage in the Inner Mongolia typical steppe areas of China. However, developing irrigated artificial grasslands requires the consumption of water resources, and also affects the hydrological cycle. In this study, mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC) model has been used to estimate regional evapotranspiration during the crop growth season (from May to September) in irrigated artificial grasslands in 2011. The results were verified based on the data obtained from eight monitoring points of irrigated silage maize farms using water balance method, with a mean relative error value of 13.8%. The average evapotranspiration for irrigated artificial grasslands during the crop growth season is 611.42 mm. To further analyze the consumption of local water resources, concept of groundwater consumption (GW) is proposed. The GW value for irrigated artificial grasslands during the crop growth season was estimated to be 457.96 mm; the GW values at each of these farms, including Woyuan cow, Maodeng, Baiyinxile, Hezhongmumin, exceeded 400 mm. The results show that these areas, which exhibit high water consumption face difficulties in water resource management, particularly when there is no external water supply.

AB  - The thematic report on "Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Global Carbon Sources and Sinks" is an important port of "Annual Report on Remote Sensing Monitoring of Global Ecological Environment" in 2018. The thematic report gives fiat play to the technological advantages of TanSat, the first global scientific experimental satellite for monitoring atmospheric carbon dioxide in China, monitors and analyses the temporal and spatial distribution pattern of global atmospheric carbon dioxide from 2010 to 2017 combining with multi-source remote sensing data, generates the first TanSat global chlorophyll fluorescence product in 2017, analyses the temporal and spatial distribution of carbon sources and sinks in the world and key regions, discusses the driving mechanism of global carbon source and sink change, and provides effective scientific data for realizing national emission reduction targets and coping with climate change. The report pointed out that TanSat can accurately retrieve the atmospheric CO2 column concentration and monitor the atmospheric CO2 concentration distribution. TanSat is an important part of the global multi-satellite carbon concentration observation platform and contributes to the construction of the GEO carbon concentration observation system. However, the global carbon concentration remote sensing observation is difficult to achieve all-weather, All-perspective and all-round real-time monitoring of carbon emissions and terrestrial carbon sources and sinks. The construction of global carbon concentration satellite monitoring network still needs the joint efforts of all countries to improve.

AB  - With the growing demand for satellite network technology in military and commercial applications, a large number of LEO(Low Earth Orbit) satellites have been launched in various countries around the world. One of the most important tasks is to download the data collected by these satellites to the Earth Stations(ESs) for processing. Previous research efforts have focused on how to download satellite-collected data to ESs. They didn't consider the situation that the satellites continuously collect data when downloading data. In this paper, our goal is to optimize the data download from the satellites to the ES in the case of dynamic collection of satellite data. We use inter-satellite links (ISLs) to offload data from heavily loaded satellites to the light ones. We build a topology map based on the interaction time between satellites and the interaction time between the satellite and the ES, and allocate the download time to the satellite carrying the largest amount of data. Then, the time slice is dynamically divided and the inter-satellite scheduling is determined by a way of classifying the idle satellites. Finally, the maximum flow algorithm is applied to determine the specific inter-satellite transmission scheme. In this way, the ES idle time is minimized. Simulations results show that our solution can greatly improve the data download efficiency from the satellites to the ES.

AB  - Forest resources play an important ecological role on the earth. The traditional forest resource inventory methods are grueling and time-consuming. It is insufficient by using single-date remote sensing data to identify the forest vegetation types. Fortunately, multi-temporal images have advantages of seasonal variation pattern in different forest vegetation. Duchang County as a study case, GF-1, Landsat8 and MODIS NDVI data were fused to obtain enough spatial and temporal resolution for forest types distinguished by utilizing STNLFFM model and Savitzky-Golay filter. Then, the forest types were classified with the aid of forest inventory data by the SVM method. The classification results showed that the overall accuracy of twice confusion (82%) are significantly better than that of single fusion (72%) only based on Landsat8 and MODIS data. It proved that the more complete temporal data series with higher spatial resolution is very vital even they are derived from different sensors.

AB  - Nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) can monitor winter wheat nitrogen status precisely. Current studies by remote sensing data are to construct the above-ground biomass (AGB) and plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) with spectral indices, respectively, and then substitute them into established NNI equation. This leads to an accumulation of unavoidable error. Therefore, the objective in the study was to construct a direct NNI equation with remote sensing data to reduce this error. Field measurements data including AGB, PNC and canopy hyperspectral at different winter wheat growth stages during 2012/2013, 2013/2014, 2014/2015, 2015/2016 growing seasons in Beijing, China were collected. This study was endeavored to establish a vegetation index critical N dilution curve (N-vic) with two different spectral indices, RTVI (Red edge Triangular Vegetation Index) and NDV/PPR (the ratio of the normalized difference vegetation index to the plant pigment ratio), which are sensitive to AGB and PNC, respectively. The vegetation index NNI (NNIvi) was calculated from the ratio between the NDV/PPR and N-vic. Results showed that (1) N-vic can be described by an equation, N-vic = 1106.4(VIRTVI)(-1.512), where RTVI ranged from 2.39 to 22.14; the determination coefficient (R-2) was 0.57; (2) The NNI based on the above N-vic dilution curve was in good accordance with the classical NNI, with the root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (nRMSE) and normalized average error (NAE) of 0.194, 22%, and 11%, respectively. The critical nitrogen dilution model constructed in this study was available for winter wheat nitrogen status monitoring. Thus, this study offers a new method which was suitable and convenient for estimating the NNI of the winter wheat and it can reduce quadric error for constructing NM through indices directly instead of inversing AGB and PNC.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - More and more synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites in orbit provide abundant data for remote sensing applications. In August 2016, China launched a new Earth observation SAR satellite, Gaofen-3 (GF-3). In this paper, we utilize a small stack of GF-3 differential interferograms to map land subsidence in Beijing (China) using the time-series SAR interferometry (InSAR) technique. The small stack of differential interferograms is generated with 5 GF-3 SAR images from March 2017 to January 2018. Orbit errors are carefully addressed and removed during differential InSAR (DInSAR) processing. Truncated singular-value decomposition (TSVD) is applied to strengthen the robustness of deformation rate estimation. To validate the results of GF-3 data, an additional deformation measurement using 26 Sentinel-1B images from March 2017 to February 2018 is carried out using the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique. By implementing a cross-comparison, we find that the retrieved results from GF-3 images and Sentinel-1 images are spatially consistent. The standard deviation of vertical deformation rate differences between two data stacks is 11.24mm/y in the study area. The results shown in this paper demonstrate the reasonable potential of GF-3 SAR images to monitor land subsidence.

AB  - Accurateestimation of rice phenology is of critical importance for agricultural practices and studies. However, the accuracy of key phenological parameters extracted by remote sensing data cannot be guaranteed because of the influence of climate, e.g. the monsoon season, and limited available remote sensing data. With China Remote Sensing career advancement, a large number of independent researches and development satellites have launched. Among a new generation of middle to high resolution satellites, H.I-1 stands out. It sets fine spatial resolution (30 m), multi -spectral and high temporal resolution (2 -day for constellation) with 360 km swath in a fusion technology with strategic significance. The time -series vegetation indices (VIs), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the 2 band Enhanced Vege-tation Index (EV[2) are widely used in the studies of crop land classification, plant productivity, phenology, and crop growth monitoring. It has been shown that Nis values are relatively insensitive to the differences in angular viewing factors and atmospheric disturbances and thereby can be used as a benchmark for direct comparison between sensors. In order to explore the adaptability of Chinese H.I-1 images in rice phenological parameters extraction, two widely used VIs, NDVI and EVI2, were adopted to minimize the influence of environmental factors and the intrinsic difference among the sensor. Savitzky-Golay (S -G) filters were applied to construct continuous VI profiles per pixel. Before phenological parameters extraction, the planting area of single-cropped rice was estimated using a stepwise classification strategy. Divided by the heading date, the growth phases of single-cropped rice can be classified into vegetative growth and reproductive growth. Because the maximum VI usually appears around the heading date, we defined the heading date as the date of the maximum VI on the VI profile. In general, the rice fields are flooded before transplanting and the VI of rice fields decreases during this period and then increases after rice planting. Therefore, we defined the transplanting date of rice as the minimal point along the VI profile. Due to the etiolation and senescence of the rice leaves, the VI decreases after the heading, and the maturation date of rice is identified by the maximum slope method. The results were validated with the field survey data collected by the local agro-meteorological station. The results showed that, compared with NDVI, EVI2 was more stable. Compared with the observed phenological data of the single cropped rice, the VI time -series had a low root mean square error (RMSE), and EVI2 showed higher accuracy compared with NDVI. We also demonstrate the application of phenology extraction of the single -cropped rice in a spatial scale in the study area. While the work is of general value, it can also be extrapolated to other regions where qualified remote sensing data arc the bottleneck but where complementary data arc occasionally available.

AB  - Landsat-based rasters (30m) of land surface temperature (LST) for the Boston, MA area spanning. LST was calculated by adjusting thermal radiance for atmospheric and emissivity effects for each of 391 images spanning 2000-2013. LST data represent the long-term mean of summertime (day of year 180-240) and springtime (representing leaf-off, day of year 120-180) images. Surface urban heat island (SUHI) calculated by the difference of the mean LST and the 5th percentile LST (typically in rural areas) within the long-term mean LST images, representing enhancements in LST due to urban land use. Additionally, impervious surface area (ISA), buffered by 300m, are included, as well as the accompanying impacts on microclimate due to impervious surface area estimated by linear models with observations from a network (n=25) of meteorological sensors across an urban-rural gradient that measured for two years (2014-2015). Enhancements to local air temperature (dT) and vapor pressure deficit (dV) are averaged over the spring and summer time periods, as above, and for daytime versus nighttime.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand landscape pattern dynamics in a rapidly urbanizing area, this paper analyzes land use patterns and land cover data of Zhengzhou, Henan, China, using data from three Landsat TM images taken in 1988, 2001, and 2014. By combining gradient analysis and landscape pattern analysis, and by using multiple landscape on both class and landscape scales, we quantified the spatial dynamics of the landscape patterns of the study area. Our results revealed dynamic changes in the landscape patterns of the Zhengzhou area. We found that the urban landscape had expanded, and unused land had decreased from 1988 to 2014. Indexes of patch density, spread and landscape diversity showed regularity in the gradient belt near the administrative center, and their peak values expanded over time. We also found that gradient changes of urban outskirts areas in 2014 were significantly different from those in 1988 and 2001, indicating that the urban construction has resulted in considerable ecological disturb. Finally, we discuss the impact of urbanization processes on the urban core and suburban areas at different time points. We hope that these results may be beneficial for the regional land use policy-making and sustainable development planning.

TI  - A Review: Individual Tree Species Classification Using Integrated Airborne LiDAR and Optical Imagery with a Focus on the Urban Environment
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - With the significant progress of urbanization, cities and towns are suffering from air pollution, heat island effects, and other environmental problems. Urban vegetation, especially trees, plays a significant role in solving these ecological problems. To maximize services provided by vegetation, urban tree species should be properly selected and optimally arranged. Therefore, accurate classification of tree species in urban environments has become a major issue. In this paper, we reviewed the potential of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to improve the accuracy of urban tree species classification. In detail, we reviewed the studies using LiDAR data in urban tree species mapping, especially studies where LiDAR data was fused with optical imagery, through classification accuracy comparison, general workflow extraction, and discussion and summarizing of the specific contribution of LiDAR. It is concluded that combining LiDAR data in urban tree species identification could achieve better classification accuracy than using either dataset individually, and that such improvements are mainly due to finer segmentation, shadowing effect reduction, and refinement of classification rules based on LiDAR. Furthermore, some suggestions are given to improve the classification accuracy on a finer and larger species level, while also aiming to maintain classification costs.

AB  - CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) are satellite data that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort and interoperability both through time and with other datasets. In this paper, key input data (e.g. aerosol optical depth, precipitable water, BRDF parameters) needed for atmospheric and BRDF corrections of Landsat data are identified and a sensitivity analysis is conducted using outputs of a physics based atmospheric and BRDF model. The results show that aerosol impacts more on the visible bands where the average variation of reflectance could reach 0.05 of reflectance unit. The variation over dark targets can be much higher so that it is a critical parameter for aquatic applications. By contrast, precipitable water (water vapor in the rest of the paper) only impacts the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave (SWIR) bands and the extent of change is much smaller. BRDF parameters impact time series most on winter and summer images of highly anisotropic areas and when they are normalized to 45 degrees solar angle. Different BRDF levels for different spectrum ranges not only impact the magnitude of reflectance, but also the signature for these areas. It seems that it is necessary to normalize surface BRDF to ensure time series consistency of the Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) product.

CP  - 36th International Communications Satellite Systems Conference (ICSSC) - Space based Communications, Applications and Technologies in the 5G Era - Moving forward to the Third Decade of the 21st Century

AB  - Adjacent channel interference is one of the major impairments that reduces achievable capacity in communication satellites, especially in high capacity throughput satellites (HTS) with densely packed spot beams. Adjacent channel interference (ACI) arises due to leakages in channel filters in any satellite repeaters. Because all filters are finite response filters, adjacent channel interference is always present. The most common technique to suppress ACI is to design multi-pole Butterworth filters with very steep roll-offs and thus very low leakages. However, the steeper the filter is, the higher its insertion loss will be, and the more expensive it will get. A very simple and low cost technique to suppress ACI is presented here. The technique is based on optimizing carrier assignment scheme to users in a ground system. The proposed technique allows maximum bandwidth usage without ACI impairment thus maximizing the achievable capacity throughput in any communication satellite system.

TI  - SAR-to-Optical Image Translation Using Supervised Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing (RS) data suffer from the limitation of bad weather and cloud contamination, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can work under all weather conditions and overcome this disadvantage of optical RS data. However, due to the imaging mechanism of SAR and the speckle noise, untrained people are difficult to recognize the land cover types visually from SAR images. Inspired by the excellent image-to-image translation performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a supervised Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (S-CycleGAN) was proposed to generate large optical images from the SAR images. When the optical RS data are unavailable or partly unavailable, the generated optical images can be alternative data that aid in land cover visual recognition for untrained people. The main steps of SAR-to-optical image translation were as follows. First, the large SAR image was split to small patches. Then S-CycleGAN was used to translate the SAR patches to optical image patches. Finally, the optical image patches were stitched to generate the large optical image. A paired SAR-optical image dataset which covered 32 Chinese cities was published to evaluate the proposed method. The dataset was generated from Sentinel-1 (SEN-1) SAR images and Sentinel-2 (SEN-2) multi-spectral images. S-CycleGAN was applied to two experiments, which were SAR-to-optical image translation and cloud removal, and the results showed that S-CycleGAN could keep both the land cover and structure information well, and its performance was superior to some famous image-to-image translation models.

TI  - Integrative 3′ Untranslated Region-Based Model to Identify Patients with Low Risk of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Operable Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard surgical staging approach for operable triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with clinically negative axillae. In this study, we sought to develop a model to predict TNBC patients with negative nodal involvement, who would benefit from the exemption of the axillary staging surgery. Materials and Methods We evaluated 3 ' untranslated region (3 ' UTR) profiles using microarray data of TNBC from two Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Samples from GSE31519 were divided into training set (n = 164) and validation set (n = 163), and GSE76275 was used to construct testing set (n = 164). We built a six-member 3 ' UTR panel (ADD2, COL1A1, APOL2, IL21R, PKP2, and EIF4G3) using an elastic net model to estimate the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM). Receiver operating characteristic and logistic analyses were used to assess the association between the panel and LNM status. Results The six-member 3 ' UTR-panel showed a high distinguishing power with an area under the curve of 0.712, 0.729, and 0.708 in the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. After adjustment by tumor size, the 3 ' UTR panel retained significant predictive power in the training, validation, and testing sets (odds ratio = 4.93, 4.58, and 3.59, respectively; p < .05 for all). A combinatorial analysis of the 3 ' UTR panel and tumor size yielded an accuracy of 97.2%, 100%, and 100% in training, validation, and testing set, respectively. Conclusion This study established an integrative 3 ' UTR-based model as a promising predictor for nodal negativity in operable TNBC. Although a prospective study is needed to validate the model, our results may permit a no axillary surgery option for selected patients. Implications for Practice Currently, sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard approach for surgical staging in breast cancer patients with negative axillae. Prediction estimation for lymph node metastasis of breast cancer relies on clinicopathological characteristics, which is unreliable, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-a highly heterogeneous disease. The authors developed and validated an effective prediction model for the lymph node status of patients with TNBC, which integrates 3 ' UTR markers and tumor size. This is the first 3 ' UTR-based model that will help identify TNBC patients with low risk of nodal involvement who are most likely to benefit from exemption axillary surgery.

TI  - Exploring the Response Mechanism of Remote Sensing Images in Monitoring Fixed Assets Investment Project in Terms of Building Detection
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fixed assets investment is a driving factor in facilitating urbanization and economic growth. The local governments have spent a lot of budgets on the construction of fixed assets. However, such investment lacks a scientific and objective mechanism to supervise the construction process continuously to guarantee on-time delivery. Owing to the development of remote sensing technology, the availability of high spatial resolution images makes it possible to visualize the construction process continuously. By synthesizing the amount of fixed assets investment, we can build a reasonable monitoring system to supervise the fixed assets projects mutually in both terms of visual construction and statistical money spent. However, as far as we know, there is not much work exploring the methods in monitoring fixed assets investment yet. We collected the continuous investment records of fourteen fixed assets projects from the year 2015 to 2017 and the corresponding GaoFen satellite images in nine-time nodes. Semantic segmentation deep learning technology is applied to detect buildings from the high spatial resolution images. The monitoring system is built by regression between the ratio of investment and the ratio of building area at nine-time nodes. Compared with the regression model from the ratio of investment and that of ground truth building area, our model achieves an RMSE of 0.0136 in the test samples. It indicates the strong potential applicability of remote sensing images in supervising the reasonability of the construction process of fixed assets and the investment allocation.

AB  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of fuel moisture content (FMC) is vital to assessing the wildfire risk and its behavior. Optical remote sensing data-based FMC estimation have been wildly explored in previous studies. However, limited studies focused on FMC retrieval from the active microwave technique represented by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which processes the advantage of higher sensitivity to surface moisture and better all-weather and all-time work capability than optical data. This is the first study to assess the performance of time series dual-polarization Sentinel-1A data for FMC estimation from coupled the bare soil backscatter Linear Model and the vegetation backscatter Water Cloud Model. The results show that the simulated backscattering coefficients and FMC are in line with the measured Sentinel-1A data and FMC with R-2 and RMSE are 0.549, 0.354 dB, and 0.543, 13.579 %, respectively.

AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) is a critical variable in assessing wildfire risk and its behavior. Previous studies normally focused on the methodologies based on optical remote sensing data for FMC retrieval. However, active microwave technique, which processes the advantage of high sensitivity to surface moisture, all-weather and all-time work capability and strong penetrability, attracted more attention in surface parameter monitoring, particularly for the polarimetric SAR which provides more sufficient object scatter characteristic. In this paper, we retrieved the FMC for a grassland based on the multiple linear regression analysis of polarimetric decomposition parameters from Radarsat-2 data. The results show that the correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE) reached to 0.658 and 30.319% when compared to the measured FMC. Finally, the presented method was used for spatial and temporal mapping of FMC in the target study area.

TI  - Assessment of Different Vegetation Parameters for Parameterizing the Coupled Water Cloud Model and Advanced Integral Equation Model for Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Time Series Sentinel-1A Data
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important state variable of the land surface ecosystem. In this paper, the water cloud model (WCM) and advanced integral equation model (AIEM) are coupled to retrieve soil moisture using time series Sentinel-1A data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), are cross-combined to initialize the calibrated model. The calibration results show the following: (1) Vegetation parameters have a great influence on model calibration; and (2) The combination of (NDVI, LAI) is recommended to calibrate the coupled model, the RMSE, R-2 is 0.739 dB, and 0.716 for the observed and estimated backscattering coefficients. The soil moisture inversion results show that: (1) the accuracy of model calibration and soil moisture inversion are inconsistent; and (2) The normalized vegetation parameters, such as NDVI, EVI and FPAR, are suitable for WCM to describe vegetation characteristics, and NDVI is the optimum. When V2 is the NDVI, the average bias, MAE, RMSE, ubRMSE and R-2 are -0.007 m(3)/m(3), 0.074 m(3)/m(3), 0.087 m(3)/m(3), 0.087 m(3)/m(3) and 0.750, respectively.

TI  - Retrieval of Vertical Mass Concentration Distributions-Vipava Valley Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol vertical profiles are valuable inputs for the evaluation of aerosol transport models, in order to improve the understanding of aerosol pollution ventilation processes which drive the dispersion of pollutants in mountainous regions. With the aim of providing high-accuracy vertical distributions of particle mass concentration for the study of aerosol dispersion in small-scale valleys, vertical profiles of aerosol mass concentration for aerosols from different sources (including Saharan dust and local biomass burning events) were investigated over the Vipava valley, Slovenia, a representative hot-spot for complex mixtures of different aerosol types of both anthropogenic and natural origin. The analysis was based on datasets taken between 1-30 April 2016. In-situ measurements of aerosol size, absorption, and mass concentration were combined with lidar remote sensing, where vertical profiles of aerosol concentration were retrieved. Aerosol samples were characterized by SEM-EDX, to obtain aerosol morphology and chemical composition. Two cases with expected dominant presence of different specific aerosol types (mineral dust and biomass-burning aerosols) show significantly different aerosol properties and distributions within the valley. In the mineral dust case, we observed a decrease of the elevated aerosol layer height and subsequent spreading of mineral dust within the valley, while in the biomass-burning case we observed the lifting of aerosols above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). All uncertainties of size and assumed optical properties, combined, amount to the total uncertainty of aerosol mass concentrations below 30% within the valley. We have also identified the most indicative in-situ parameters for identification of aerosol type.

AB  - Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a useful procedure for many remote sensing applications. However, paired high-resolution and low-resolution remote sensing images are actually hard to acquire for supervised learning SR methods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network named Cycle-CNN to handle this problem. Our network consists of two generative CNNs for down-sampling and super-resolution separately, and can be trained with unpaired data. Experiments on panchromatic and multi-spectral images of GaoFen-2 satellite indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SR results and is robust against noise and blur in the remote sensing images.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Global Communications Conference (IEEE GLOBECOM)
CL  - Waikoloa, HI
AB  - In the multi-antenna satellite communication system, beamforming and artificial noise are usually adopted to enhance physical layer security. However, due to the long distance between the satellite and the terrestrial terminal, the coverage of the main lobe in the satellite downlink is so large that the eavesdropper can get into the coverage easily despite of using spot beams. When the eavesdropper is close to the legitimate user, the difference between the main channel and the wiretap channel is small, which makes the secrecy capacity decrease rapidly. This paper proposes a novel scheme to solve this problem by using two different beams which work on different frequencies to transmit the same signal to the legitimate user. This dual-beam dual-frequency scheme can enlarge the difference between the desired channel and the wiretap channel. Then, if we add some artificial noise set the proper beamforming vectors, the secrecy capacity will remain high when the eavesdropper is in the small zone near the legitimate user. In order to derive the artificial noise and the beamforming vectors, we transform the problem into a semidefinite problem and use CVX tools to solve the problem. Simulation results prove that this scheme can achieve high secrecy capacity even when the eavesdropper is very close to the legitimate user.(1)

AB  - High resolution infrared remote sensing can realize all-day, noncontact, high-precision temperature measurement such as the atmosphere, water and other objects, which is an important means of environmental monitoring and resource detection. But High-resolution infrared data are relatively scarce data sources, especially thermal infrared. This paper introduces the research on instrument requirements and configuration for high resolution infrared observations. By using large aperture and integrated optical system combined with linear push broom, high resolution multi-spectral imaging can be realized which covers multiple detection channels from visible light, short wave infrared, mid-wave infrared and long wave infrared spectral bands, and remote sensing data with a panchromatic resolution better than 1 m and an infrared resolution better than 5 m can be obtained, which can serve environmental protection, mineral exploration, and urban remote sensing after ground processing. Through the research in this paper, it provides a reference for the design and engineering of high resolution infrared payload.

AB  - Remote sensing data from GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) and GOSAT-2 in the future ameliorate inversion analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions([1,2]). Meso-scale atmospheric transport model AIST-MM (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology-Mesoscale Model)([3,4]) and global-scale transport model NICAM-TM (Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model-Transport Model)([5]) have been coupled for data assimilation in order to estimate CO2 emission from mega-city Tokyo. However, forests west and north of Tokyo Metropolis in the Kanto plain generate significant biogenic CO2 fluxes and such atmosphere-biosphere gas exchange remains to be properly calculated during the modeling processes. In this study, we use MODIS products[6,7] to simulate regional gross primary production (GPP), vegetational and soil respirations based on Biosphere model integrating Eco-physiological And Mechanistic approaches using Satellite data (BEAMS) algorithms([8,9]). By integrating this atmosphere-terrestrial ecosystem carbon balance module to our regional inversion analysis, we aim at more precise estimation of CO2 emission from Tokyo.

TI  - 3D Surface velocity retrieval of mountain glacier using an offset tracking technique applied to ascending and descending SAR constellation data: a case study of the Yiga Glacier
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - COSMO-SkyMed is a constellation of four X-band high-resolution radar satellites with a minimum revisit period of 12 hours. These satellites can obtain ascending and descending synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with very similar periods for use in the three-dimensional (3D) inversion of glacier velocities. In this paper, based on ascending and descending COSMO-SkyMed data acquired at nearly the same time, the surface velocity of the Yiga Glacier, located in the Jiali County, Tibet, China, is estimated in four directions using an offset tracking technique during the periods of 16 January to 3 February 2017 and 1 February to 19 February 2017. Through the geometrical relationships between the measurements and the SAR images, the least square method is used to retrieve the 3D components of the glacier surface velocity in the eastward, northward and upward directions. The results show that applying the offset tracking technique to COSMO-SkyMed images can be used to derive the true 3D velocity of a glacier's surface. During the two periods, the Yiga Glacier had a stable velocity, and the maximum surface velocity, 2.4 m/d, was observed in the middle portion of the glacier, which corresponds to the location of the steepest slope.

AB  - As an important supplement facilities for traditional low earth orbit mobile satellite systems (LEO-MSSs), especially in hot-spot regions, high-altitude platforms (HAPs) have been widely concerned by researchers in recent years. To reduce the additional spectrum cost, the spectrum sensing and sharing in LEO-HAP cognitive system deserve to be studied. In this paper, we study the spectrum sharing problem in LEO-HAP cognitive system for the first time and focus on the imperfect estimation problem before allocating resource. We propose a dynamic spectrum and power allocation strategy to maximize the capacity of HAP-ground downlinks without reducing the QoS of LEO-ground downlinks by introducing a correction coefficient. Simulation results validated that the capacity of HAP-ground downlinks could achieve a better value with the proposed strategy in imperfect estimation scenario compared with the method of ignoring the estimation errors.

TI  - Analysis of a southerly buster event and associated solitary waves
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE EARTH SYSTEMS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is a detailed case study of the southerly buster of 6-7 October 2015, along the New South Wales coast. It takes advantage of recently available Himawari-8 high temporal- and spatial-resolution satellite data, and other observational data. The data analyses support the widespread view that the southerly buster is a density current, coastally trapped by the Great Dividing Range. In addition, it appeared that solitary waves developed in this event because the prefrontal boundary layer was shallow and stable. A simplified density current model produced speeds matching well with observational southerly buster data, at both Nowra and Sydney airports. Extending the density current theory, to include inertia-gravity effects, suggested that the solitary waves travel at a speed of 20% faster than the density current. This speed difference was consistent with the high-resolution satellite data, which shows the solitary waves moving increasingly ahead of the leading edge of the density current.

TI  - The evolution of landscape ecological security in Beijing under the influence of different policies in recent decades
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is an important force driving the development of the social, economic, and ecological environments in urban China. As the capital of China, Beijing has experienced a shift in the development process from emphasizing economic development to emphasizing ecological livability in recent decades. During this period, the Olympic Games, real estate development, and environmentally friendly construction policies were major events that affected Beijing's urban ecosystem and its safety. Based on the Pressure-State-Response (P-S-R) framework model, this paper establishes an indicator system for assessing the ecological security of Beijing from 1995 to 2015. The indicators were generated through coupling of an ecological model with time-series multi-source remote sensing data such as night light images and Landsat ETM images. We assessed ecological security during different policy periods and developed an ecological security early warning system for Beijing. After the effects of the economic development policy and the bid for the Olympic Games from 1995 to 2005, the urban area of Beijing with falling ecological security continues to expand. From 2005 to 2010, due to the joint effect of 2008 Olympic venue construction, urban environmental remediation policies, and real estate policies, the overall safety level in the central city was better, but the suburbs showed the opposite trend. In 2010-2015, real estate developed explosively in Beijing, while environmentally friendly development became strongly emphasized and the economic status of the capital weakened. The ecological security of the main urban area began to improve significantly, but the outer urban area and suburban areas were greatly affected by real estate development and exhibited a clear decline in ecological security.

AB  - Due to the rapid urbanization, the impact of urban spatial form on surface temperature cannot be ignored and is becoming increasingly significant. This study investigates the impact of the urban spatial form which includes building form and urban land surface moisture (ULSM) on the land surface temperature (LST) of communities in Wuhan, China. The LST was retrieved in the summer and winter by Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data. Thirty typical communities in the three-ring area were selected to represent general residential area in Wuhan. By extracting the building height (BH), building density (BD), floor area ratio (FAR), sky view factor (SVF), frontal area index (FAI) and ULSM of each community, the result shows that BH, BD, FAR, SVF and ULSM are critical variables in lowering LST in both winter and summer.

AB  - Cloud plays a significant role in the study of the Earth's radiation balance. Particularly, it is still a big challenge to derive longwave radiation under cloudy-sky conditions for the community for a long time. In this paper, a scheme to estimate the upward longwave radiation (LWUR) under cloudy skies is proposed by accounting for the solar-cloud-satellite geometry (SCSG) effect. The application of the new method to MODIS data indicates that the new scheme can work well and the LWUR under the cloud layers can be successfully recovered. And accordingly, the fraction of valid LWUR for a typical image is correspondingly improved. Although MODIS data was employed here, this method can be applied to any optical remote sensing images as long as the required parameters for correcting the SCSG effect are provided.

AB  - Quad-polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery can be well used to identify bivalve beds on dry-fallen intertidal flats and to investigate radar backscattering mechanisms on exposed sediments. In this study, a general classification approach to use spaceborne SAR data to distinguish sediment types, especially mud and sand, and to detect mussel beds, is presented. We propose a new feature set including Double-bounce Eigenvalue Relative Difference (DERD) and the Kennaugh elements, and combine those indicators with the unsupervised Wishart classifier. The main classification results of sediments and habitats agree with data from regular monitoring campaigns, which are frequently performed to fulfill the requirements of coastal environmental monitoring.

AB  - Poor visibility by sea fog is a navigational hazard for maritime transport. Due to the lack of observation stations on the sea, monitoring large-scale sea fog and assessing navigation risk in foggy season are challenges. Thus, the paper introduced MODIS data for monitoring sea fog and proposed an approach of assessing navigation risk along fairway during foggy season. Sea fog is firstly identified from MODIS images using supervised classifier and then navigation risk along fairway is quantitatively evaluated by means of spatial analysis. Using GIS based Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model, a risk index layer is respectively constructed for various marine environmental factors, which include sea fog, wind, wave and etc. and these risk index layers eventually are integrated into navigation risk assessment layer through the order weighted average (OWA) operator.

TI  - Posteruptive Thermoelastic Deflation of Intruded Magma in Usu Volcano, Japan, 1992-2017

M3  - Article
AB  - Secular ground subsidence at Usu volcano (Japan) has been reported around the eruption vents following the four eruptions in 1910, 1943, 1977, and 2000. However, the mechanisms accounting for the subsidence have not been well understood. In this study, we systematically investigated the posteruptive deformation at Usu volcano using interferometric synthetic aperture radar based on 111 JERS, ALOS-1, and ALOS-2 images acquired from 1992 to 2017. We also calculated quasi east-west and vertical ground displacements between 2006 and 2017. Our results show three localized deformation regions from west to east of Usu volcano with their locations corresponding to the 2000, 1977, and 1943 eruption vents, respectively. All the deformation sites show patterns of east-west contraction and subsidence. The extent and rate of posteruptive subsidence declined dramatically at the vent of the 2000 eruption site from 2006 to 2017, decreased gradually at the 1977 vent, and show a steady pattern for the 1943 site during 1992-2017. We ascribed the observed posteruptive subsidence to thermoelastic contraction of a sphere intruded at the time of the eruptions to constrain locations, depths, and volumes of heat sources with the assumption of the spherical source shapes. Thermoelastic modeling reveals that the heat sources are embedded at shallow depths not deeper than 400m below sea level with volumes of about (8.720.19)x10(6), (132.185.21)x10(6), and (49.512.02)x10(6)m(3) for the 2000, 1977, and 1943 eruption sites, respectively. The modeling also highlights the importance of underground water in assessing the thermal diffusion process and the associated posteruptive deformation.

AB  - Lake ice is a sensitive indicator for the environment and climate change. In the comparative study of climate change from the three poles (Antarctic, Arctic, and the Tibetan Plateau), the lake ice phenology which is mirrored the seasonal changes of lake ice, and it is an important index for assessing the synchronization and difference of climate change. Based on passive microwave, lake ice phenology of 48 lakes from 1978 to 2017 were extracted for northern Europe, Tibetan Plateau and Mongolia Plateau. A comparative analysis of the temporal variation for the lake ice phenology shows that from 1978 to 2017, the average ice cover duration showed a shortening trend of all regions, and the Northern Europe with the most dramatic shortening. The year of 2000 may be a turning of the lake ice cover duration in three regions. Especially in the northern Tibetan Plateau where is a trend of prolonged ice cover duration after 2000, and the delay of the break-up end date plays a more important role than the advance of the freeze-up start date. For the spatial changes, the variation of lake ice cover duration in the Tibetan Plateau shows a spatially aggregate phenomenon, and both the Northern Europe and Mongolian Plateau show changes with latitude. The comparison of lake ice phenology changes of three regions can provide more basis for climate characteristics analysis or climate change research. In the future work, various remote sensing data will be comprehensively used to obtain more information on lake ice phenology in High Mountain and cold regions. Meanwhile, it will combine other reanalysis data to find the reasons that affect the lake ice phenology, and provide support for the comparative study of the three-pole environment.

AB  - Spatiotemporal simulation of Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC) is of great significance for the protection and management of the ecological environment. In this study, the growing season FVCs of the South Qilian Mountains from 2000 to 2017 were extracted from the MODIS vegetation indices product (MOD13Q1), and then that were used to train the Back Propagation (BP) artificial neural network to estimate the annual FVCs of the South Qilian Mountains in the next 7 years (2019-2025). The results show that the established model has a good performance through verification FVC data in 2018, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) is 0.9462 and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.0118. The simulation results of the model indicate the FVC will present a trend of growth in the following years. This study indicates that the combination of BP neural network and remote sensing data can effectively simulate the spatiotemporal pattern of fractional vegetation coverage, which can further contribute to the environmental protection.

T2  - IN SITU-REVUE DE PATRIMOINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Kinmen Island, only about 10 kilometres away from mainland China, is located opposite the city of Xiamen, Fujian Province. After retreating from the mainland in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan and made this island a military base where the KMT (the Chinese nationalist party) stationed much of the army with a view to retaking the mainland. Taiwan's martial law was lifted in 1987 and the de-militarisation of Kinmen has led to a gradual influx of tourists. Visitors come to Kinmen for different reasons. Some people come to appreciate the natural scenery and historic dwellings that have not been affected or damaged by urban expansion, while others come to visit the remaining fortifications and military heritage of the Civil War. Given its crucial border situation, Kinmen has become an ideal field of observation to study Chinese culture and the natural heritage. Through the ethnographic fieldwork on the heritagisation process of Kinmen, the author tries to explain how the widely prevalent concept of 'the wind of Wen blows strongly' (Wen Feng Ding Sheng, flourishing literature and education) is reflected through the post-war heritage buildings. This expression actually reveals the Kinmen citizens' strong attachment to their own history and environment. By describing and analysing the architectural and cultural phenomena in this particular border area between mainland China and Taiwan, this article helps us to obtain an in-depth understanding of the concept of 'literary culture' (Wen) in Chinese culture, as well as how residents of Kinmen establish and maintain a new post-war collective identity through the wind of Wen.

AB  - Land use and land cover change (LUCC) is the hotspot and frontier issue of global environmental research. In this paper, the LUCC of Qingdao was studied from the different aspects using Landsat ETM+ and OLI satellite imagery. Combined with manual visual interpretation, we used the maximum likelihood method to classify the images respectively, and finally formed the 3 phases land use status maps and the corresponding land use status attribute database. Then, the land use dynamic change model and the land use type transfer matrix are adopted to analyze the LUCC situation of Qingdao from 2008 to 2017.The results show that land use change is significant in Qingdao in the past ten years: the cropland and water area continued to decrease, and the residential construction land increased greatly. The cropland mainly convert to the residential construction, and as a result, urbanization process of Qingdao is accelerating now.

T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) successor, VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) can achieve on a global scale continuous monitoring of aerosols. As a mature product of aerosol remote sensing, the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is an important atmospheric parameter in energy budget and climate change researches. But because of heavy aerosol loading, the application of VIIRS AOD product from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is limited in China. By using a new cloud mask method, improving the pixels selection process, widening the range of AOD inversion, and constraining the aerosol model selection, we improved the retrieval algorithm and enhanced the performance in haze area. Based on validation with ground-based AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) observation, our AOD product overcame the underestimation of satellite retrieval result and had better correlation and smaller root mean square error (RMSE) than that of NOAA. In order to verify its performance in polluted air condition, we compared them in two degrees of pollution (0. 6 < AOD(AERONET )<1 and AOD(AERONET) >1). For the heavy pollution conditions (AOD(AERONET) >1), availability proportion of data increased effectively from 32. 3% to 68. 8%. Validation results showed that the slope of the regression analysis, correlation coefficient, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was enhanced to 0.80, 0. 76 and 0.307 respectively. In the conclusion, the accuracy of AOD products was guaranteed on the basis of increasing of data coverage.

AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology, the utilizations of multi-spatial and multispectral resolution remote images have proved to be very important in monitoring the growth and estimating the yield of agricultural crops. The light energy utilization models using remote sensing have got the wide application because of its simple data acquisition, less parameters and capabilities for time series analysis. In this research, the yield estimation has been carried out using the net primary productivity (NPP) and the contents of soil organic matter which are obtained by Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model and our proposed approach respectively. More specifically, NPP of maize in the study area from 2007 to 2017 was estimated using CASA model, and the characters of spatio-temporal variation were explored. After that, the retrieval model of the soil organic matter content was established based on the relationship analyzation between the soil organic content and NPP. The characters of spatio-temporal variation also have been explored. Then the yield of spring maize in Yitong County from 2007 to 2017 was estimated using an improved yield estimation model. Moreover, the maize harvest index and the yield of maize per unit area in the study area were obtained. Finally, the growth and development information of maize in Yitong County were comprehensively evaluated combining with these mentioned data.

AB  - It's well known that wind speed anomaly (WSA) are positively correlated and very nearly collocated spatially with the sea-air temperature difference anomaly (SATDA). The coupling relationship between SATDA and WSA has been discussed using the satellite data firstly. A phenomenon that the coupling coefficients, which can represent the degree of the response of WSA to SATDA, have a regular seasonal variation has been revealed in this paper: a higher value in summer and a lower value in winter. According to the atmospheric stability theory, the neutral wind speed may depend upon both background mean wind speed (MWS) and mean sea-air temperature difference (MSATD), these two are also the significant characteristic parameters in different seasons and different regions. In order to explain the seasonal variation of the coefficients, we analyze the influences of these two parameters on the coupling coefficients in 4 sea regions where the air-sea interaction is intense, respectively. It turns out a strong negative correlation with SATD in unstable layer which is the main reason for the seasonal variation, and a weak positive correlation with WS in unstable layer.

AB  - After revaluating the validity of the assumption made in the existing decomposition algorithms for the quad-pol SAR datasets, we proposed a two-step algorithm to resolve the invalid assumption. The algorithm was assessed using the quad-pol ALOS/PALSAR and NASA/JPL UAVSAR datasets. The results were satisfactory. The algorithm should be valid.

TI  - URBAN AREA EXTRACTION FROM POLSAR DATA USING OPTIMIZED ROLL-INVARIANT FEATURES AND SELECTED HIDDEN POLARIMETRIC FEATURES IN THE ROTATION DOMAIN

AB  - Due to the variability of urban structures, buildings with significant cross-polarized scattering may be misclassified as forests. Therefore, urban area extraction is still a challenging problem. In this paper, a new urban extraction method using optimized roll-invariant features and selected hidden polarimetric features in the rotation domain is proposed. The optimal coherency ratio along radar line of sight is calculated by traversing the rotation angle within permissible values, and hidden features are selected based on the similarity processing and principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm in the rotation domain. The fusion of correlated probabilities (FCP) algorithm is applied to commendably enhance the classification accuracy. Spaceborne Gaofen-3 full PolSAR data is used to validate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of extracting urban areas from natural areas.

AB  - In this paper, a hierarchical extended adaptive general four-component decomposition method (AG4U) is proposed to solve the overestimation problem of volume scattering (OVS). In the proposed method, the transformed coherency matrix and branch conditions are determined by choosing one of the two unitary transformation matrices, and the refined volume scattering model is transformed adaptively in order to adapt to various terrain types. Spaceborne Gaofen-3 full PolSAR data is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition method. Comparison experiments show that the proposed method can effectively represent the scattering characteristics of the ambiguity regions, and the oriented building areas can be well discriminated as dihedral or odd bounce structures.

AB  - The spatial information of high-resolution remote sensing images is more abundant, and the expression of ground object information in detail is clearer. Vegetation is a component of the environment and the most important component of terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, vegetation information extraction from remote sensing images is particularly significant. This paper takes Shanghai Pudong New Area as the research area, adopts threshold classification method and membership function classification method to extract vegetation information, and introduces normalized vegetation index as feature to extract vegetation information from WorldView-3 satellite remote sensing image. The results show that the accuracy of vegetation information extraction based on membership function classification method is higher. The classification accuracy of typical vegetation area is higher than 90%, and the Kappa coefficient is higher than 0.86, which can significantly reduce the fragmentation caused by classification. At the same time, high-resolution remote sensing images show great potential for the extraction of vegetation information in urban areas.

AB  - In this study, the performance of the MODIS C6 multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) 1-km aerosol optical depth (AOD) products in China during 2008-2016 are validated using 17 AERONET sites. The results show that the correlation coefficient (R) for MAIAC in C6 is 0.942 and the RMSE is 0.2. Meanwhile, the fraction above the EE is shown as 49.85%, indicating that the MAIAC retrievals will integrally overestimate AOD values in China. Especially, significant overestimation of MAIAC is found at vegetation sites with high elevation and in areas round water. The scale of high-resolution AOD distribution is fine while an obvious boundary caused by aerosol models is also observed.

AB  - The SARptical dataset(1) consists of about 10,000 matching pairs of very high resolution optical and SAR image patches extracted from TerraSAR-X very high-resolution spotlight images and aerial UltraCAM optical images in dense urban areas of the city of Berlin, Germany. This dataset is distinct from any other existing SAR optical dataset, because the 3D location of the center pixels of the SAR and optical were explicitly matched. Still, creating such dataset poses a fundamental challenge. The reason is that a pixel level matching between SAR and optical images is generally impossible to achieve a without the assistance of a precise 3D model. This is especially true in dense urban areas, because of the inevitable layover caused by the side-looking SAR imaging geometry. Such misalignment will affect applications like joint classification using SAR and optical images, and raise the difficulty in designing machine learning algorithms. This paper will discuss the challenge of jointly using SAR and optical images for remote sensing applications and propose possible methods to mitigate those misalignment errors.

AB  - Due to the harsh environment, observation networks over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are very sparse, which makes satellite data valuable for spatially explicit analyses. This study focuses on satellite-based estimations of minimum temperature (Tn) for the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). First, seasonal variation in the relationship between nighttime land surface temperature (LSTnight) and Tn at meteorological stations was investigated and winter time was found to be the period when LSTnight has the strongest predictive power for Tn. Then, a thin-plate spline interpolation method incorporating LSTnight as a covariate was implemented to obtain 1 km winter Tn over the TAR. Finally, the trend in winter Tn over 2000-2013 and the impacts of snow cover and elevation on the trend were explored. The main findings are as follows. (1) The introduction of LSTnight can greatly increase Tn estimation accuracy. (2) Negative Tn trends were prevalent over western and northern TAR regions, and a decreasing trend was detected in the regional mean Tn (-0.18 degrees C/decade). (3) The southeastern TAR, which has lower elevations (<4000 m) and higher snow coverage than other areas, showed the most significant warming trend in Tn (0.84 degrees C/decade). Temperature in this area was close to the melting point, indicating that snow-albedo feedback can be easily triggered. (4) There was a stronger correlation between LSTnight and Tn and an enhanced cold bias in LSTnight over higher elevations or areas with larger snow coverage.

AB  - In the past decades, optical remote sensing data were widely used to retrieve water quality parameters including total suspended matter (TSM) and Chlorophyll a (Chla). However, the chemical and mineral properties of TSM are not detected and characterized. In this study, feature-orientated principal component analysis based on Crosta method using multispectral optical remote sensing data was conducted. The results show that this technique can retrieve not only routine parameters including TSM and Chla, but also the chemical and mineral properties of TSM such as Fe-bearing level and clay/carbonate mineral variations. The mapping results in Pearl River and inland lake/reservoir show good agreements with the observation and measurement. Combined the analysis of chemical and mineral correlation of catchment soil/rock outcrops, the source of TSM and Chla can be tracked. And it also implies that the water quality such as TSM and Chla as well as their chemical and mineral properties can be retrieved from the long-term historical image data of multispectral optical remote sensing, which can provide useful information for regional water pollution prevention and environmental protection.

AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization and the change of land use, the urban heat island effect has been significantly enhanced, leading to the rise of urban temperature, changing local air circulation, and influencing local microclimate. For investigating the temporal and spatial rules of the urban heat island effect in Xi'an City, China, this study combined Landsat TM, ETM remote sensing image, and surface meteorological station observation data to probe the trend of the urban heat island intensity in Xi'an City from 1993-2013 and to analyze its influencing factors. The results show that, from 1993 to 2009, the heat island intensity presented an increasing trend, with a temperature rise rate of 0.38 degrees C/10y, while the heat island intensity showed a decreasing trend from 2009 to 2013. There was a positive correlation between heat island intensity and the urban area in Xi'an city. By a comprehensive analysis, the expansion of the urban land area, the heat island intensity followed a constantly increasing radius of influence are the main reasons.

AB  - Accurate mapping of the spatio-temporal dynamic information of conversion from cropland into forest/grassland is necessary for studying hydro-ecological effects of implementation of Grain to Green Project (GTGP) on the Loess Plateau, China. Currently, the accuracy of change detection of farmland and forest/grassland at 30-m scale in this area is seriously affected by insufficient temporal information from observations and irregular fluctuations in vegetation greenness caused by precipitation and human activities. In this study, an innovative method for continuous change detection of cropland and forest/grassland using all available Landsat time-series data. The period with vegetation coverage is firstly identified using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. The intra-annual NDVI time series is then developed at a 1-day resolution based on linear interpolation and S-G filtering using all available NDVI data during the period when vegetation types are stable. Vegetation type change is initially detected by comparing the NDVI of intra-annual composites and the newly observed NDVI. Finally, the time of change and classification for vegetation types are determined using decision tree rules developed using a combination of inter-annual and intra-annual NDVI temporal metrics. Validation results showed that the change detection was accurate, with an overall accuracy of 88.9% +/- 1.0%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.86, and the time of change was successfully retrieved, with 85.2% of the change pixels attributed to within a 2-year deviation.

AB  - This research is based on Australian Data Cube Data Organization and Management Framework. Through data cleaning, data segmentation and data index, remote sensing observation data collected in Wuhan from 2000 to 2017, are organized into a data cube with time series as the Z-axis. Then, extraction of MODIS-NDVI data about 414 tile images. The mean value and standard deviation value of the tile matrix were calculated to detect the areas with frequent changes in vegetation coverage in Wuhan during the 18 consecutive years. The vegetation coverage curve was extracted using the time series as the z-axis to further explore the specific time nodes and change process of vegetation coverage. The experiment results show that: (1)During the period from 2000 to 2010, the area covered by vegetation in Wuhan decreased dramatically when the city expanded; (2)After 2010, due to the follow-up of green work in the later stages of urban development, the area of green space in Wuhan was restored; (3)In recent years, with the large-scale transportation projects carried out inWuhan, to a certain extent, it has affected the existing green areas.

TI  - Multi-Source Evidence Data Fusion Approach to Detect Daily Distribution and Coverage of <i>Ulva Prolifera</i> in the Yellow Sea, China
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ulva prolifera (U. prolifera), a seaweed species in the family Ulvaceae, has been causing green tides in the Yellow Sea, China, every year since 2008. This has attracted the attention of the government and the scientific community because of its influence on the region's marine economy and coastal zone environment. Remote sensing, surveillance ships, and airplanes are three common surveillance approaches used by the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) for U. prolifera detection in the Yellow Sea. However, improving the accuracy and convenience of daily U. prolifera detection by fusing the data from these sources, and obtaining the coverage area and distribution of U. prolifera without human intervention, are two challenges that need to be addressed. To this end, this study proposes an improved multi-source evidence fusion method based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to detect the distribution and coverage area of U. prolifera using data from multiple sources (MODIS images, Sentinel-2A images, and surveillance ship data). This improved approach can handle the conflicts caused by differences in image characteristics and spatial resolutions as well as differences between surveillance ship data and remote sensing data. The capability of the improved method to extract the distribution and coverage area of U. prolifera was tested experimentally. The results agree with the reference data supplied by SOA in terms of spatial position and geometry. The fusion of multi-source data demonstrates better results in the detection of U. prolifera coverage area and spatial distribution compared with those from individual data sources. The improved approach can be applied to daily and emergent monitoring tasks for U. prolifera detection.

AB  - The salinity of the Arctic Ocean is influenced by the fresh water input from sea ice melting, river discharge and precipitation, and its variation could provide a useful reference for the study of changes in Arctic environment. Since the SMOS satellite launched in 2009, there have been three microwave salinity satellites (Aquarius, SMOS and SMAP satellites) that could provide us sea surface salinity (SSS) data from space. In this study, we compared the SSS products derived from these three salinity satellites: the Aquarius satellite data have a limited spatial resolution and a short time series of less than 5 years, the SMOS SSS product for the Arctic from Barcelona Expert Center provide a 7-year record of the Arctic SSS in 2011-2017, the SMAP-SSS data is more sensitive in low salinity regions. With the data from the SMAP and SMOS satellites, we presented a general view on summertime SSS variation during 2011-2017 in the Arctic area. The SSS maps showed that the SSS mainly varied in the plume area and were stable in the Arctic open sea. Satellite-derived salinity could detect the extremely low SSS area caused by sea ice melting and continental runoff. We extracted the ice-melt water area by combing the microwave salinity satellite data and the ocean color satellite data, which could exclude the continental fresh water input. The result showed consistence with sea ice concentration and former literature. The distribution of the ice- melt water could be of great significance for the study of Arctic sea ice anomaly and relative biogeochemical changes.

TI  - Using TSX/TDX Pursuit Monostatic SAR Stacks for PS-InSAR Analysis in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS-InSAR) has become an indispensable tool for monitoring surface motion in urban environments. The interferometric configuration of PS-InSAR tends to mix topographic and deformation components in differential interferometric observations. When the upcoming constellation missions such as, e.g., TanDEM-L or TWIN-L provide new standard operating modes, bi-static stacks for deformation monitoring will be more commonly available in the near future. In this paper, we present an analysis of the applicability of such data sets for urban monitoring, using a stack of pursuit monostatic data obtained during the scientific testing phase of the TanDEM-X (TDX) mission. These stacks are characterized by extremely short temporal baselines between the TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X acquisitions at the same interval. We evaluate the advantages of this acquisition mode for urban deformation monitoring with several of the available acquisition pairs. Our proposed method exploits the special properties of this data using a modified processing chain based on the standard PS-InSAR deformation monitoring procedure. We test our approach with a TSX/TDX mono-static pursuit stack over Guangzhou, using both the proposed method and the standard deformation monitoring procedure, and compare the two results. The performance of topographic and deformation estimation is improved by using the proposed processing method, especially regarding high-rise buildings, given the quantitative statistic on temporal coherence, detectable numbers, as well as the PS point density of persistent scatters points, among which the persistent scatter numbers increased by 107.2% and the detectable height span increased by 78% over the standard processing results.

TI  - Current Strategies for the Management of Locoregional Breast Cancer Recurrence
T2  - ONCOLOGY-NEW YORK
M3  - Review
AB  - Advances in the treatment of breast cancer have decreased the rate of isolated locoregional recurrences (ILRRs) over time. Surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapies are used to manage these failure events and their associated poor prognosis. Operable ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTRs) are treated by either salvage mastectomy or, in select cases, repeat lumpectomy. Axillary nodal recurrences and postmastectomy chest wall relapses are commonly amenable to surgical resection, too. Repeat sentinel node mapping may be undertaken after IBTRs and chest wall recurrences. Aberrant lymphatic drainage, especially after previous mastectomy, is frequently observed. Adjuvant radiation is recommended for most ILRR cases; the dose and volume must be adjusted for prior to receipt of therapy. Implementation of adjuvant systemic therapies after ILRR should be based on the expression of molecular markers in the recurrent tumor. Administration of chemotherapy for estrogen receptor-negative ILRR is indicated, since it significantly decreases the rate of distant metastases.

AB  - The patient was a 50-year-old woman. She had been diagnosed with bilateral breast tumors at another hospital 5 years previously and was followed up every 2 months. Ultrasonography showed hypoechoic masses in her breasts. The largest tumor in the right breast was 15mm in diameter and located in region A, while that in the left breast was 8mm in diameter and located in region B. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)showed multiple bilateral breast tumors. The largest tumor was 12mm in diameter and was suggestive of breast cancer. Core needle biopsies(CNB)of the largest tumors in both breasts were performed. Intraductal papilloma(IDP)and low-grade intraductal papillary carcinoma were diagnosed in the right and left breasts, respectively, on immunohistochemical staining. We performed left nipple-sparing mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and right tumor excision for diagnoses of carcinoma of the left breast(cTisN0M0)and IDP of the right breast. The histopathological diagnosis of the left breast tumor was pT1aN0M0, triple negative breast cancer with extensive intraductal components, and that of the right breast tumor was IDP with atypical ductal hyperplasia. Chemotherapy was administered postoperatively. Several studies have reported that peripheral IDP often coexists with or follows the development of carcinoma. Therefore, we should also closely follow-upthe patient's right breast.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a rare and multifactorial disease, which involves noninfectious and ischemic pathogenesis. ONFH has been designated as one of the targeted intractable diseases by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan and its medical cost for treatment has been subsidized by public expenditure. Together with these policies, the epidemiology of ONFH in Japan has also been systematically elucidated by the Study Group on ONFH with academic support from the Study Group on Epidemiologic Research for Intractable Diseases (ERID), both of which are funded by the MHLW. This chapter summarizes the findings of descriptive and analytic epidemiology on ONFH which have been accumulated through collaborative efforts of the ONFH Study Group and the ERID Study Group. Methodologies in these epidemiologic studies include a nationwide epidemiologic survey and a hospital-based sentinel monitoring system to assess frequency and distribution of ONFH. Furthermore, case-control and cohort studies have been conducted to evaluate systemic steroid use and alcohol intake as two major risk factors for ONFH.

AB  - The use of earth surface remote sensing in geology is increasing thanks to the continuous development of sophisticated sensors and the improvements in digital image processing techniques. Here we focused on new remote sensing tools and techniques capable of delivering high-resolution data for geologic hazard investigations. These include airborne imaging systems such as UAVs (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), as well as new radar sensors onboard of Earth-orbiting satellites. We emphasize the applications of advanced synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques referred to as multi-temporal interferometry (MTI). With the free imagery availability from the current (since 2014) European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 mission, MTI can now be more affordably exploited for long-term (years), regular (weekly-monthly), precise (mm) measurements of ground displacements over large areas (thousands of km(2)). This, in turn, means improved detection and monitoring capability of landslide/slope instability, seismic and volcanic hazards.

AB  - JJ-FAST is the first SAR-based global and early deforestation monitoring system, and started the operation from November 2016. In this paper, improved deforestation detection algorithm were suggested for using JJ-FAST system. One of the improvement is to increase maximum number of data used from 15 to 20 to suppress error detection occurred in mountain area and swamp forest. The other improvement is to adopt 0.5 dB lower threshold level to increase number of deforestation detection. Suggested algorithm were evaluated by using optical satellite data (GLAD), obtained in one of the active deforestation spots in Peru, Brazil, Cambodia, and Mozambique. User's accuracies increases by 6.7%, and number of correctly detected deforestation polygon make it 1.3 times as large.

AB  - The estimation of precipitation using weather satellite is beneficial to measure global rainfall with high temporal and spatial resolution. Understanding of accuracies and limitations of precipitation satellite data is essential to study by verifying the satellite estimation with the observation data from rain gauges. This study aims to verify the radar and rain gauges rainfall data in rainy season (December 2013 to March 2014), which consist three approaches namely point-to-grid, area-weighted and grid-to-grid for daily interval in Ciliwung watershed and point-to-grid for hourly interval in Darmaga and Pondok Betung stations. The verification methods consist of two namely continuous verification statistics and categorical verification statistics. The average of hourly observation rainfall is higher than radar hourly rainfall and have mostly similar standard deviation, while the average and standard deviation of daily observation rainfall are lower than radar rainfall. Results of continuous verification statistic show the highest correlation is point-to-grid and the variability of errors ranging 0 to 45.76 according to magnitude of MAE and radar rainfall are underestimated to observation with ME negatives. The categorical verification statistics shows that accuracies of those three approaches have the average of 0.44 and biases below 1.5. The correlations in hourly interval with point-to-grid approach in Pondok Betung and Darmaga are lower than daily interval, while the accuracies are higher. Application of remote sensing such as radar technology, satellite precipitation estimation feasible to detail rainfall data in a watershed, especially in locations which observation stations are not available.

AB  - Reported by National Disaster Response Agency of Indonesia (BPBD) as many as 94 dies, 149 injured, and more than 88 thousands homeless caused by floods in 2018. Besides bringing casualties to people and environment, the floods also affect the damages to transportation infrastructures in which vital to disaster emergency response operation e.g. evacuation process. Due to the complex impact of current disaster, the demands of providing a short-term response increases accordingly. Therefore, this research proposes a prototype of flood evacuation route utilizing network analyst method. The network analyst method particularly focus on finding alternative route based on time and distance. This research uses a flood simulation model derived from Landsat 8 imagery and terrain data. Subsequently, the simulation model divides the flood severity based on the depth which consist of < 0.3 m (slight), 0.3-0.5 m (moderate), and > 0.5 m (serious) in order to generate an impact analysis regarding the estimation of damages and casualties. In order to resemble the real situation of flood, barriers (e.g. flood area) are applied into the finding evacuation route procedure. Thereby, the estimated evacuation route can be executed considering the safest and fastest way. Moreover, some comparisons between before and after flood are conducted in order to know the effectiveness of evacuation routes. By such comparison proves that network analyst enables to support disaster management operation with respect to handling the evacuation procedure.

AB  - Climate research is a field where computer science is of increasing importance. This includes atmospheric science where global observations as well as model simulations provide large volumes of data. Large-scale data processing offers opportunities but also introduces challenges. This thesis founds on atmospheric data retrieved from remote sensing satellite instruments and has two major contributions. First, we present with adaptive low-rank matrix approximation a compression technique that reduces storage requirements through matrix factorization. Since remote sensing data as well as compression are error-prone, we propose a statistical error metric that compares the existing error in the remote sensing data with errors introduced by approximation under consideration of atmospheric properties. In contrast to general-purpose error metrics, we can estimate the practical impact for relevant applications. Together with our parameterizable implementation, we individually choose a good tradeoff between compression ratio and loss in information for each retrieved atmospheric gas. With a compression ratio adapting to the matrix structure, the average storage requirements of the given data are reduced to 42% of the original size. Second, we apply data mining techniques to atmospheric data. The transport of water vapour is related to many atmospheric processes and its modelling belongs to major challenges in climate research. As a first step towards a data driven analysis, we compare the clustering algorithms DBSCAN and HDBSCAN with application to pairs of water vapour concentrations and its isotopologue ratios (denoted as {H2O, &delta;D}-pairs) and their spatio-temporal context. The resulting patterns in {H2O, &delta;D}-space are useful for further analysis, since they correlate with atmospheric processes. For a first objective quality assessment of clustered results, we compare different cluster validation indexes and discuss their validity. Judging by the validation scores and plots of subsamples, HDBSCAN outperforms DBSCAN for the given data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Metastasis is one of the most threatening aspects of cervical cancer. We developed a method to intraoperatively map the primary tumor, metastasis and metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), providing real-time intraoperative guidance in cervical cancer.Methods: TMTP1, a tumor metastasis targeting peptide, was employed to modify the indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded poly (ethylene glycol)- poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) micelles. The cervical cancer subcutaneous tumor model and lung metastasis model were established to determine the active targeting of ICG-loaded TMTP1-PEG-PLGA micelles (ITM) for the primary tumor and occult metastasis of cervical cancer. Human cervical cancer HeLa cells engineered by firefly luciferase were injected into the right hocks of BALB/c nude mice to develop the SLN metastasis model. The ITM and control ICG-loaded PEG-PLGA micelles (IM) were injected into the right hind footpads in the SLN metastasis model, and the migration and retention of micelles were recorded under near-infrared fluorescence. K14-HPV16 transgenic mice were also used to detect the image capability of ITM to target cancerous lesions.Results: ITM could actively target imaging of the primary tumor and cervical cancer metastasis. ITM quickly diffused from the injection site to SLNs along lymphatic capillaries and remained in the SLNs for 12 h. Moreover, ITM specifically accumulated in the tumor metastatic SLNs (T-SLNs), which could be successfully distinguished from normal SLNs (N-SLNs).Conclusion: ITM could achieve active targeting of the primary tumor, metastasis and T-SLNs, providing precise and real-time intraoperative guidance for cervical cancer.

TI  - Multi-Temporal SAR Data Large-Scale Crop Mapping Based on U-Net Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the unique advantages of microwave detection, such as its low restriction from the atmosphere and its capability to obtain structural information about ground targets, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is increasingly used in agricultural observations. However, while SAR data has shown great potential for large-scale crop mapping, there have been few studies on the use of SAR images for large-scale multispecies crop classification at present. In this paper, a large-scale crop mapping method using multi-temporal dual-polarization SAR data was proposed. To reduce multi-temporal SAR data redundancy, a multi-temporal images optimization method based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance was applied to the time series of images after preprocessing to select the optimal images. Facing the challenges from smallholder farming modes, which caused the complex crop planting patterns in the study area, U-Net, an improved fully convolutional network (FCN), was used to predict the different crop types. In addition, the batch normalization (BN) algorithm was introduced to the U-Net model to solve the problem of a large number of crops and unbalanced sample numbers, which had greatly improved the efficiency of network training. Finally, we conducted experiments using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data from Fuyu City, Jilin Province, China in 2017, and we obtained crop mapping results with an overall accuracy of 85% as well as a Kappa coefficient of 0.82. Compared with the traditional machine learning methods (e.g., random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM)), the proposed method can still achieve better classification performance under the condition of a complex crop planting structure.

AB  - The detection of remote sensing image aircraft targets based on deep learning has practical and important significance in the fields of military reconnaissance and disaster rescue. As a typical representative of the two mainstream detection algorithms, YOLOv3 and Faster_R_CNN have good detection effects on remote sensing image aircraft targets. However, for low quality remote sensing images, the two detection algorithms also have the phenomenons of omission and false detection. To deal with this, this paper proposes a target detection algorithm (YF R_CNN) for 'Separate training, joint detection', which realizes the cross-platform detection feature fusion of YOLOv3 based on darknet framework and Faster_R_CNN based on tensorflow framework, effectively alleviating the problems of existing algorithms. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of YF_R_CNN algorithm reaches 94.8%, which is 3.7% and 3.1% higher than YOLOv3 and Faster_R_CNN respectively. The detection accuracy is obviously improved, and the algorithm has better flexibility and robustness.

TI  - Rain- and water-use efficiencies of a shrub ecosystem and its resilience to drought in the Central Asia region during 2000-2014
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the more dominant and relatively stable ecosystems in arid Central Asia, the shrub ecosystem plays an important role in the maintenance of ecosystem stability; therefore, interpreting the results and increased understanding of rain use efficiency (RUE), water use efficiency (WUE) and the corresponding resilience to drought may result in positive environmental implications for the conservations and restoration of vegetation in this arid region. In this study, the RUE and WUE of a shrub ecosystem in Central Asia were analyzed and ecosystem resilience based on RUE and WUE was evaluated by the contextual Mann-Kendall test and resilience index using datasets including MODIS and CRU data during 2000-2014. The results indicated that RUE and WUE had spatial patterns that decreased from low latitudes to high latitudes across the region. At the whole-region scale, RUE and WUE were relatively stable in most years. Spatially, more than half of the shrub patch area experienced an increasing trend in RUE and WUE over the past 15 years. For resilience assessments, a negative correlation was found between resistance and recovery, as reflected by WUE and RUE. The WUE- and RUE-based resilience components both captured a drop in WUE and RUE related to drought occurrence in shrubs, but the magnitudes of the RUE indices were much higher than those of the WUE indices in most shrub patches, suggesting that the negative impact of RUE on carbon accumulation of shrub encountering drought was greater than that of WUE. Based on RUE and WUE, resilience assessments were consistent in 41.81% of the shrub patch area and different over 58.19% of the area. Considering the characteristics of ET and precipitation datasets and convenient accessibility of precipitation data in underdeveloped areas, RUE should be easy to use in assessing ecosystem resilience to extreme drought.

AB  - Snow plays an important role in global hydrological cycle and climate system. In addition, snow as a key variable factor is important indicator to climate change. In recent years, applying passive microwave remote sensing to retrieval snow depth has made greatly progress. Snow depth retrieval algorithms and snow products can provide spatial and temporal information on snow cover distribution, which is an important data source to snow monitor. Based on the survey project of snow cover characteristics and snow distribution in Northeast China, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature data and MODIS product data are used in this paper. Original resolution brightness temperature observations are used in AMSR2 algorithm, except for the 89GHz channel which is resampled according to 36GHz footprint, and brightness temperature corrections made on the original measurements rather than using the aggregated brightness temperature observations. The original algorithm takes advantage of the expanded range of channels available on the AMSR2 instrument compared with the SSM/I and SMMR, and it undertakes a forest correction. However, the original AMSR2 snow depth retrieval algorithm greatly overestimate measured snow depth, especially in forest areas where is a challenge to retrieval snow depth, the error between 20 to 30cm. In order to improve the retrieval accuracy of snow depth in Northeast China, an improved snow depth retrieval algorithm in forest areas is proposed in this paper, the improved snow depth retrieval algorithm in forest areas is SDf = 1/ln(pol(36)) x (Tb-18V - Tb-36V)/(1 - fd x 0.6). The results proved that the error is less than 5cm after using the improved algorithm, the root mean square error and deviation are 4.82cm, 3.55cm, respectively.

AB  - As an important factor for global climate change, snow affects local and global radiative balances of the earth. Excessive snow can cause destroy for global hydrological cycle and climate system. In recent years, the use of passive microwave remote sensing to retrieval snow has made greatly progress. Snow deep retrieval algorithms and snow-covered products can provide spatial and temporal information on snow cover distribution, which is an important data source for snow monitoring. The accuracy validation and contrastive analysis of snow deep retrieval algorithms are helpful to further development of snow retrieval in China. Northern Xinjiang, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Inner Mongolia-Northeast China are stable snow areas in China. Relying on the survey project of snow cover characteristics and distribution in China, the snow survey route has been carefully designed to continuously observe whole dry snow period (December 2017 to March). FengYun3B microwave radiation imager (FY3B-MWRI) brightness temperature data and MODIS land cover product data are used in this paper. The accuracy of snow depth retrieval algorithms, including FY operational algorithm, NASA series algorithm and GlobSnow snow water equivalent product algorithm, shows that the FY operational algorithm has the best result, and the root mean square error and deviation are 8.91cm, 6.4cm, respectively. However, the accuracy of NASA series algorithms and GlobSnow snow water equivalent product algorithm is seriously influenced by land cover type.

TI  - Multi-Source Remote-Sensing Monitoring of the Monsoonal Maritime Glaciers at Mt. Dagu, East Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research presents a precise evaluation of the recession of monsoonal maritime glaciers at Mt. Dagu, based on multi-source remote-sensing data of an aerial topographic map from 1966 and Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and OLI data from 1975 to 2017 for six sub-regions of the glacier covering 1.747 +/- 0.068 km(2) at present. The results show that: first, the area of glacier exhibits an exponentially decreasing trend and retreated as much as 5.094 +/- 0.301 km(2) during 1975-2017, with a shrinkage rate of 0.120 +/- 0.004 km(2)a(-1). Second, the highest area shrinkage rates of glaciers are in the north, northwest, southwest, and south aspects. The largest retreat altitude of the glacier terminus is in the southwest aspect of region 2. Of which, the absolute retreat elevation is 303 m (from 4587 to 4890 m a.s.l.), at a mean rate of 7.2 m a(-1). Third, the temperature has increased at a rate of 0.02754 degrees C a(-1) (R-2 = 0.6132, p < 0.05) by a total of 0.9 degrees C (1961-2017), more higher than the region's average increase. However, there is no significant increasing precipitation trend. The warm-dry trend is aggravated and this is the main reason for the glacier recession. Finally, the accelerated retreat presents a severe challenge to the sustainability of the glaciers and glacier-oriented tourism. Active intervention to maintain the glacier should be urgently considered.

TI  - Estimation of surface downward shortwave radiation over China from AVHRR data based on four machine learning methods
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is one of the major driving forces of climate system. Knowledge of the Earth's radiation budget is essential for improving our understanding of the Earth's climate. Therefore, accurate estimation of DSR has great significance. Satellite remote sensing is a practical way to derive DSR with high spatial resolution and coverage. In this study, four machine learning methods, including gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), random forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), and artificial neural network (ANN), were applied to estimate DSR at a spatial resolution of 5 km and a temporal resolution of 1 day using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. The DSR estimates based on four machine learning methods were evaluated using ground measurements at 96 sites over China. The measurements were collected from the Climate Data Center of the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CDC/CMA) from 2001 to 2003. The evaluation results showed that the GBRT method performed best at both daily and monthly time scales under both clear and cloudy sky conditions. The validation results at the daily time scale showed an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 30.34 W m(-2) and an R value of 0.90 under clear sky conditions, whereas these values were 42.03 W m(-2) and 0.86, respectively, under cloudy sky conditions. The DSR estimates had an overall RMSE value of 16.93 W m(-2) and an R value of 0.97 at the monthly time scale. The Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) data sets were also used for comparison with the DSR estimates based on the GBRT method. The DSR estimates based on the GBRT method exhibited similar spatial distributions with those of the CERES-EBAF DSR product. Moreover, the DSR estimates based on the GBRT method did not show a clear overestimation tendency, as the CERES-EBAF DSR product did, at the CDC/CMA sites.

AB  - In this paper, we address urban scene interpretation on the basis of multi-modal data acquired from aerial sensor platforms. These data comprise RGB color information, hyper-spectral information and 3D shape information. As hyperspectral data are known to contain a high degree of redundancy which, in turn, might affect the quality of derived classification results, we also involve techniques for dimensionality reduction and feature selection as well as a transformation of hyperspectral data to high-resolution multispectral Sentinel-2-like data. We use the different types of data to define sets of radiometric and geometric features which are provided separately and in different combinations as input to a Random Forest classifier. To assess the potential of the different types of data and their combination for urban scene interpretation, we present results achieved for the MUUFL Gulfport Hyperspectral and LiDAR Airborne Data Set.

AB  - SENTINEL-2 observations are particularly well suited for crop management due to the short revisiting time and decametric spatial resolution. In this context, Green Area Index (GAI), the fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation Intercepted by the green vegetation (FIPAR), the fractional green vegetation cover (GF(0)) and Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC), are four variables of particular interest since they relate to the canopy state and can eventually be assimilated into crop functioning models to predict crop yield and optimize management practices. We present the results from the first year of the P2S2 project (Produits Pour Sentinel-2) that consisted in acquiring an extensive calibration and validation dataset over agricultural areas based on DHP measurements for GAI, GF(0) and FIPAR combined with SPAD-502 Minolta chlorophyll meter acquisitions for LCC.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) downscaling has become more and more crucial for assisting the application of the coarse-resolution SM product, such as climate change, sustainable development of agroforestry, efficient management of water resources, and monitoring of natural hazards. The main idea of downscaling methods lies on the help of fine-resolution auxiliary data, such as the widely used, land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, in the downscaling process, the ancillary data, especially for the daily LST, is strongly affected by cloud cover, resulting high frequency of blank areas in the final downscaled SM products. By contrast, the impact is usually omitted or paid less attention in current downscaling studies. To obtain the spatially continuous fine-resolution SM product, this study firstly introduced an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model to fill the gaps in daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product induced by cloud cover. Then the 36-km SM product from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was downscaled from 36-km to 1-km spatial resolution with the synergistic use of the filled LST and MODIS NDVI to estimate spatially continuous fine-resolution SM product.

AB  - Tropical cyclones typically exhibit warm cores aloft and their locations vary, depending on their development stages. In our recent studies, typhoon thermal structures can be derived reasonably well from satellite microwave sounding instruments such as AMSU and ATMS through better constraints of background profiles in 1dvar. The background profiles should be scene-dependent according to cloud type. It is found that the scene-dependent observation error covariances are also required to further improve the retrievals. With newly launched FY-3D satellite, MWHS data at 118 GHz are used to retrieve the atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. Comparing to ATMS, MWHS can define the warm core locations very well although the warm core magnitude is weaker than that from ATMS.

AB  - Oceanographic conditions, physical development, cultivation, and sedimentation in river estuaries are dynamic trends occured in Jepara Regency, which determine the position of the shoreline in Jepara Regency. Landsat imagery can be an alternative source of data for shoreline mapping, while shoreline extraction methods can be conducted using water index, which is easy to perform. The research objective is to map the Jepara shoreline using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) transformations and compare the water index performance. Shoreline data is extracted from Landsat 8 OLI imagery, while the reference shoreline for accuracy assessment is obtained from visual interpretation of PlanetScope imagery. Threshold 0 and subjective threshold based on experiments per coastal physical typology samples are used to separate land-sea. Regulation published by the Head of the Geospatial Information Agency Number 6 of 2018 is used as a standard for shoreline maps accuracy obtained from Landsat 8 OLI imagery. The difference in the shoreline length on the eight shorelines are due to the limited capability of the water index in obtaining the shoreline. MNDWI shoreline with a threshold of 0 gives the lowest RMSE value (RMSE= 25,33 m) among another index, while the NDWI shoreline with a threshold of 0 gives the highest RMSE value (RMSE= 43,77 m).

AB  - Forest fire in Indonesia occurred mostly in peatland area when the peatland areas were dried with groundwater table more than 40 cm. This peatland condition has become degradation areas with high potentials to fire. Some previous research utilized optics data remote sensing to detect the potential combustible peatland area while others concerned on backscattering information of synthetic aperture radar data compared with Forest Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS) data to identify a peat fire risk area. Peatland is prone to fire, usually associated with land that is open, close to the road, and dry conditions. In this research, polarimetric decomposition and interferometric SAR techniques have been used to determine the potential of combustible peatland area. Polarimetric Decomposition is easier to use to recognize open peatland areas. Besides that, it can also be used to identify roads and canals in peatland areas. Based on the research carried out this time, by implementing the Yamaguchi three-component model-based decomposition, we easily distinct areas that are exposed to peatlands. The dominant surface scattering marks open spaces. By using interferometric SAR technique, we also easily map areas experiencing subsidence. Regions that experience subsidence in peatland areas are usually dry areas with low groundwater conditions. Based on the results of interferometric synthetic aperture radar by using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, subsidence conditions have been found in this area of peatland. SAR ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 image acquired on May 9, 2015, is used as master image and image received on March 25, 2017, is used as a slave image. Phase interferogram generated with multi-looking 5x5 pixels, Goldstein filtering 5x5 pixels, and normal baseline -43 m, and H-ambiguity 1049.4. Annual subsidence rate average was 2.8 cm/year, minimum 2.5 cm/year, and a maximum of 3.5 cm/year. The subsidence rate then converted to groundwater level information based on Woosten model and validated by using groundwater table measurement from the field. The simulation of groundwater table in average is 69.4 cm, with minimum value 63 cm and maximum value 87 cm. Based on validation and compared to the field data with correlation 0.85, and the area confirmed as high potential of combustible peatland area.

TI  - Detection of Peat Fire Risk Area Based on Impedance Model and DInSAR Approaches Using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire in Indonesia occurs mostly in peatland area. Dry peatland areas with groundwater table (GWT) more than 40 cm from the soil surface have become degradation areas with high potentials to fire. This paper presents a new novel to detect a peat fire risk area by incorporating two methods: the impedance model and the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) technique which is based on the knowledge of annual subsidence rate associated with the GWT. The previous impedance model is modified in this paper by integrating the surface roughness information in the model as a part of novelty. The proposed method was then validated with ground truth data of GWT. By using an impedance model, this paper successfully detected peat fire risk area based on the backscattering coefficient simulation of dry peatland. Based on the simulation model, the average, minimum, and maximum of backscattering coefficient of dry peat are -13.97, -11.5, and -17.29 dB, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the simulated backscattering coefficient and backscattering from ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data is 0.8 with root mean square error of 1.4. By using the DInSAR method, detection of dry peatland area was successful. The significant relationships confirmed between GWT measurement and model are 0.71 for Pair A and 0.85 for Pair B. Both methods showed that peat fire risk areas were identified successfully. The dielectric constant of the peat soil also revealed that the soil condition of the area of interest is very dry indicating the potential to peat fire risk. Employing two models, respectively, were recommended to get precision of detection analysis.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE TARGET DECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUE ATTRIBUTES AND POLARIMETRIC RATIOS TO DISCRIMINATE LAND USE AND LAND COVER CLASSES OF THE TAPAJOS REGION

AB  - This study aims to analyze the capability of the target decomposition techniques and the polarimetric ratios applied to the ALOS/PALSAR-2 satellite polarimetric images to discriminate the land use and land cover classes in the Tapajos National Forest region, Para State. Three full polarimetric ALOS/PALSAR-2, level 1 single look complex scenes were selected to generate the coherence and the covariance matrices to derive the Cloude-Pottier and the Freeman-Durden target decomposition attributes. From the radiometrically calibrated PALSAR-2 images, we generated the backscatter coefficients, the cross polarized ratio (RC; HV/HH), the parallel polarized ratio (RP; VV/HH) and the Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI). The images resulting from these polarimetric attributes were processed by the Maximum Likelihood (MAXVER) classifier coupled with the Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) contextual algorithm. We found that the classifications derived from the target decomposition attributes, mainly from the Cloude-Pottier technique, with a Kappa index of 0.75, presented a significant higher performance than those derived from the RC ratio, RP ratio, and RFDI.

AB  - Using sea ice information generated from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) products can increase the safety and efficiency of ship operations in ice-infested waters. For the purpose of operational sea ice classification, the results need to be highly reliable. The combination of multiple SAR acquisitions can be used to estimate the reliability of sea ice classification and to overcome existing limitations. In this paper, we present a new approach for comparing sea ice classification results from pairs of independent TerraSAR-X acquisitions and additionally overlay it with information on sea ice movement. For this purpose, we combine our processors for estimating sea ice drift and classification. The sea ice drift field is used to compensate the ice movement between two SAR acquisitions and differentiate areas of homogeneous and inhomogeneous ice zones. The processing chain is developed for operational usage in near real-time.

AB  - Monitoring of the forests of Indonesia is performed by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) in collaboration with the Indonesian Space Agency (LAPAN). The MoEF mapping method entails the visual interpretation of Landsat, with national-scale map products made from 1990 onward. As part of the development of a national carbon accounting system, LAPAN developed a method for processing national-scale mosaics, which were used to prototype forest loss algorithms. The mosaics are now used as the primary reference for the MoEF map updates. We assessed the accuracy of the MoEF time-series maps of forest cover and found a high accuracy for tracking primary and secondary forest loss. However, improving the efficiency and timely delivery of the annual update is now the primary focus of the MoEF/LAPAN collaboration. A new spectral product that highlights areas of likely land change based on a spectral index and forest loss indication map are now used to help target analysts efforts in updating the annual map. This review of the national Indonesia forest monitoring system highlights 1) the strategic collaboration by operational and research agencies, 2) the desire to maintain a consistent methodological framework, 3) and the recent improvements in product latency and accuracy.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the most effective type of heterogeneous catalyst such as natural zeolite (ZA), Zr-natural zeolite (Zr/ZA) and zeolite Y (H/ZY) in esterification of alpha-pinene. alpha-terpinyl acetate was successfully synthesized from alpha-pinene and acetic anhydride by their heterogeneous catalysts. The esterification reaction was carried out with reaction time, temperature and zeolite catalysts. The most effective catalysts used in the synthesis of alpha-terpinyl acetate is catalyst H/ZY with the yield is 52.83% at 40 degrees C for the time 4 h with a selectivity of 61.38%. The results showed that the effective separation of catalyst could contribute to developing a new strategy for the synthesis of alpha-terpinyl acetate.

TI  - Estimating the syphilis epidemic among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Australia following changes in HIV care and prevention
T2  - SEXUAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Syphilis control remains a challenge in many high-income countries, including Australia, where diagnoses are concentrated among gay, bisexual men and other men who have sex with men (GBM). The aim of this study is to project the syphilis epidemic among GBM under a range of scenarios. Methods:A dynamic coinfection model of HIV and syphilis transmission among GBM in Victoria, Australia, was parametrised to test data from clinics in Melbourne and syphilis case notifications in Victoria. Projected outcomes were new syphilis infections between 2018 and 2025 under seven testing and behaviour change scenarios. Results:Among HIV-negative GBM, the model estimated that increasing syphilis testing coverage (69% - 75%) and frequency (similar to 8-monthly - 6-monthly) could prevent 5% and 13% of syphilis cases respectively between 2018 and 2025 compared to the status quo. Among HIV-positive GBM, less syphilis testing due to changes in HIV care increased syphilis cases by 29% between 2018 and 2025 compared to the status quo. Under a scenario of 20% HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) coverage among HIV-negative GBM (and associated increased serodiscordant sex, reduced condom use and increased syphilis testing), syphilis cases were estimated to decrease by 6% among HIV-negative GBM and by 3% among HIV-positive GBM compared to the status quo, driven by increased testing among PrEP users. Conclusion:The present study findings support syphilis control policies focusing on increased testing among GBM. Current Australian PrEP guidelines of quarterly syphilis testing are likely to negate any increases in syphilis due to risk compensation occurring with PrEP scale-up.

M3  - Editorial Material
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - William Angliss Institute (WAI) aspires to become a University of Specialisation. This chapter outlines some of the reasons behind this objective and the challenges involved in seeking to achieve it. The author contends that the Institute and the industry it services must co-evolve and transform their worldviews if they are to meet the challenges of an uncertain future: a task that entails developing more complex epistemologies. Based on the author's doctoral research that suggest a catalytic correlation between participation in certain forms of scenario planning and epistemic development, a transformative approach to scenario based research is proposed as a vehicle for bringing about this transformation. The methodology for a proposed scenario research project is explained and its potential short and long term benefits for both WAI and the industry are identified. The proposal represents innovation in WAI's own development and its industry partnerships.

TI  - Human and Deltaic Environments in Northern Egypt in Late Antiquity
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY IN THE LONG LATE ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This paper analyses the relationship between archaeological sites from the Roman-Late Roman period in the north-central Delta of Egypt and the palaeotopography and environmental conditions from the 1st millennium BC to 1st millennium AD. The location of the archaeological sites is mapped according to survey maps of the 19th and 20th c. and digital topographic models from satellite data. The Ptolemaic and Roman context for the apparent `boom' in settlement during the late antique period (3rd-7th c. AD) is described to assess the way in which the diverse environments of floodplain, wetland and marsh, and sand-bars were managed, and to propose a possible reconstruction of the ancient landscape. The results of the correlation are discussed in terms of connectivity to waterways, lagoons and the sea, spatial organisation, hierarchy and site function. The way in which the evidence from this time period may provide a potential proxy for understanding earlier and later settlement density is explored. Throughout, the historical trajectory and the environment will provide the background for the development of the Delta in the Medieval and Modern period.

TI  - Inverse Solution to the Electronic Crosstalk Correction of Bands 27-30 in Terra MODIS
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - In the Terra MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Level-1B (L1B) product, an electronic crosstalk correction is implemented for bands 27 - 30 using a linear algorithm. In this algorithm, the measured (contaminated) signal from the detectors in the bands was used as a reference signal for deriving the correction coefficients from lunar images and for applying the correction to the calibration and L1B data. As the mission progressed, the level of contamination steadily increased in each detector, with an additional large increase associated with the Terra MODIS safe-mode anomaly in February of 2016. In this work, we developed a modified algorithm for deriving the crosstalk coefficients and applying the correction which uses the inverse crosstalk coefficient matrix in order to remove the contamination from the reference signal. We apply the coefficients using this modified algorithm to calibration and Earth-view data in order to assess the difference with the data in C6.1. We also perform calculations using simulated contamination to show the difference in the recovery of the corrected signal between the C6.1 algorithm and the modified algorithm. We will show, that although the current levels of contamination are much higher than early in the mission, the overall impact of having contamination on the reference signal for the correction is small. However, this impact is non-linear as a function of the magnitude of the contamination level, so it should be monitored as the mission continues.

TI  - Electronic Crosstalk Characterization and Correction for MODIS Bands 1 and 2 Using Lunar Observations
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Electronic crosstalk is an issue that has affected several bands on the MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua platforms. For bands 1 and 2 in MODIS, electronic crosstalk signal contamination is observed at relatively consistent levels throughout the entire mission for each instrument. As in many previous efforts, including the correction of electronic crosstalk in Terra MODIS bands 27 - 30 in Collection 6.1, regularly scheduled lunar observations are used in order to identify the source of the crosstalk contamination as well as derive the correction coefficients throughout the mission. For each detector in bands 1 and 2, the source of the contamination follows a pattern determined by the band and detector being sampled from bands 13 - 19 at approximately the same time. These bands are on the same focal plane assembly but are sampled on a different electronic output than bands 1 and 2. The contamination was found to be non-linear as a function of the sending signal and will be shown to occur before the analog-to-digital conversion of the signal. In this work, we will derive quadratic crosstalk correction coefficients for bands 1 and 2 in both Aqua and Terra MODIS. The correction will be applied to the lunar and solar diffuser calibration data and then applied to the Earth-view imagery. While the correction to the lunar data shows an improvement to the calibration and spatial characterization results, the solar diffuser and Earth-view data corrections are complicated by signal saturation in the sending bands.

T2  - SMELL AND TASTE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The sense of taste relies on well-defined neuroanatomical structures, namely, the taste buds and afferent nerve fibers. Taste buds are clusters of 50-100 neuroepithelial cells located throughout the oral cavity, including the epiglottis and larynx. They are responsible for the initial transduction process that ultimately results in the perception of bitter, sour, salty, sweet, and umami (savory) sensations. They service as the initial sentinel for a sensory system critical in evolution for distinguishing "dangerous" food components, often perceived as bitter or unpleasant, from "useful" ones, often perceived as pleasant, salty, or sweet. This chapter describes the anatomy and development of the human peripheral taste system and provides historical context for what is presently known about this element of this important sensory system. Its main focus is on the fundamental question of how tastants are perceived-a question that has been of philosophical and scientific interest for more than two millennia. Descriptions of lingual and extralingual taste buds, their blood and nerve supplies, and the associated salivary glands are provided, including details of their microstructure and transduction mechanisms.

AB  - The global population has quadrupled over the last century. This has increased the global food demand and water sector. In the state of Qatar, the annual freshwater extraction from aquifers is four times the rate of natural recharge, and the depletion is driven by agriculture which represents only 1.6% of the total land area of Qatar, providing approximately 8-10% of domestic food consumption and contributing 0.1% to the domestic GDP. Considering the need for the sustainable intensification of food production systems, satellite technology has the ability to provide a frequent monitoring mechanism enabling the availability of physically-based spatial information useful for reliable environmental monitoring studies. The objective of this research paper is to assess the demand side water footprint of crops using satellite-driven technology in order to optimise the supply side irrigation requirements. The key vegetation indices, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) estimated from the remotely acquired information from the Landsat satellite is used for the water footprint assessment. Finally, the water resources demand in agriculture is met by optimising the water supplied from the various decentralized treated sewage effluent plants (TSE). A mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) formulation was used to model the spatially-dependent demands, and the TSE plants allocated 80% and 20% of their capacity to fields 1 and 2 respectively. The findings of this paper are promising and a high correlation of -0.93 is found between NDVI and crop water demand, demonstrating that satellite images can be used to monitor the crop vegetation development. vegetation stress can be differentiated using NDVI, thereby demonstrating its applicability for agricultural and water sectors.

T2  - AAA-ARBEITEN AUS ANGLISTIK UND AMERIKANISTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most graphic ways in which the world-modelling function of literary texts comes to the fore is the use of spaces, owing to the various meanings which are attributed to them in the process of `semanticization'. Although Jurij Lotman's theory concerning literary space, which is arguably one of most illuminating discussions in the field, was developed mainly with reference to fiction, drama and the theatre are no less important in this respect, including, of course, Shakespeare's plays. In the past few years, Macbeth in particular has come under scrutiny in this context, albeit space in this tragedy has mostly been analysed in an unsystematic and partial way (with special emphasis on the castles). The present essay, while drawing on previous research, purports to complement it by systematizing the spaces and their forms of semanticization in Macbeth, extending the spaces under discussion so that imagery and 'transcendental' spaces (heaven and hell) are also included; above all, it My highlights the remarkably ambiguous, 'equivocal' and unstable use of spaces in this play as indicative of a profoundly ambivalent worldview.

AB  - <The Light in Your Eyes (Nooni Booshige)> is good text for a aesthetics of Current status of Korean TV dramas. This work is well received by the public and critics. This article noted some of the significant features inherent in the text of the TV drama in <The Light in Your Eyes (Nooni Booshige)>. <The Light in Your Eyes (Nooni Booshige)> is particularly noteworthy in that it effectively implements a semantic structure through overlapping elements of contrast in various aspects of the play, including narratives, genres and themes.I’d like to go into more detail about this. First of all, I want to analyze the narratives of <The Light in Your Eyes (Nooni Booshige)>, which go beyond the nuances of seriousness and lightness, while focusing on the serious subject of the life of an elderly comet in her 70s who has lived with the trauma of her husband's death, her son's accident and disability. Next, we will take a look at the genre characteristics of this piece, which features a mix of different genres. Finally, in the theme aspect of this work, I want to analyze the consciousness, unconsciousness, life and death overlay that the work recreates through the divisive and vigilant subject of an old man suffering from Alzheimer’s. When an organic combination of universality and specificity has been successfully achieved in almost every area of popular art, it can be its own aesthetic value and orientation. In this regard, <The Light in Your Eyes (Nooni Booshige)> can be evaluated as a successful outcome. This article was significant in the light of the fact that these <The Light in Your Eyes (Nooni Booshige)> are effectively implementing a semantic structure through overlapping the contrasting elements.Boundaries and distinctions are dismantled through overlay. Overlapping, which means overlapping, is what separates ‘me’ from ‘the man’ and ‘we’ from ‘them’. And it will be me, interest and us that remain in the position. With the distinction and separation becoming meaningless, it will inevitably be that which remains.

AB  - The Tongsinsa in 1590, who was dispatched to Japan immediately before the Japanese invasion, has been controversial since it was linked to the war responsibility argument because of all the things that were in the process of diplomatic trip in Japan and different reports of the invasion by Japan.In this paper, we tried to approach this problem from on idelogical perspective, getting out of controversial perspective. In other words, it is not the conspiracy theories based on the conflict but the judgments and measures based on their own values and Japanese perceptions. More fundamentally, from the viewpoint of worldview and philosophy, and the difference on external perception and recognition of Japan.Kim Seongil inherited the teachings of the master in Confucianism as the supreme master of the Toegye school, but he pioneered his own unique position in the field of ritual study. Kim Seongil's recognition of Japan is characterized by thoroughness of confucian world idea and ritual theory. He applied this idea to the international community and understood it in a consistent logic system. Diplomatic trip to Japan was also a good opportunity to apply and practice it. In the trip he showed off his appearance as a practical ritual scholar.He ignored Japan as a barbarian nation on the basis of the traditional recognition of Japan since the early Joseon dynasties, ignored the changes of Japanese society, and did not pay attention to the culture of Japan. When he saw their disrespectful behaviors, heterogeneous cultures, and customs, his notion of contempt was deepened. He thoroughly observed Japan in a cultural superiority, but ignored Japan's military power and economic prosperity. He did not think that Japan had the capacity to easily invade Joseon, and such thoughts were reflected in his reports.Kim Seongil was faithful to his sense of duty to establish the right ceremony. So, he tried to fix the conflicts about the existing erroneous practices and rituals that are against the justification. As a result, he fought fiercely with the Japanese side, Hwang Yungil, and Huh Sung also when they argued.On the other hand, Kim Seongil was not very successful in his mission to spy on the Japanese situation. In comparison, Hwang Yungil and Huh Sung, who recognized the possibility of invasion in their home country, emphasized improvement of relations with Japan from a realistic point of view. They had a strong argument with Kim Seongil. In this paper, I have focused on the theory of national prestige and the theory of ritual.Kim Seongil thought that it has been able to regulate all situations and issues in terms of universal ideology and methods such as heavenly, righteous, and justified. But for him there are aspects overlooking the reality, history, and originality of Japanese society based on the superiority of universal culture. It can be said that ideology overwhelmed reality. I think that there is a fundamental difference between the idea and the epistemology in the background that the two people confront each other.

AB  - This paper presents a change detection system using Planet's mosaic dataset. This dataset has higher resolution but fewer bands than data captured from Landsat or Sentinel satellites. Here, an object-based random forest regressor is used to detect vegetation change. The mosaic was separated into individual images, which were then ranked in a list. Results indicate adequate performance with a tradeoff in precision and recall.

AB  - Agricultural land cover is characterized by fast changes within time. The phenological dynamic of plants can deliver crucial information for crop classifications. To enhance a crop classification multi-temporal indices are proposed. They are calculated based on the time series of coherence matrices and parameters of H/alpha decomposition derived from dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images (Sentinel-1). The study shows that the use of multi-temporal indices increases the accuracy of crop classification by 9% in comparison to classification based only on the time series of coherence matrices.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next- Generation Satellites XXIII
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The newly launched polar-orbiting NOAA-20 satellite is the follow-on mission to the SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite. Both satellites are in an afternoon orbit with a close equatorial cross time. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a key sensor onboard NOAA-20 and SNPP. The two VIIRS sensors are within the same engineering design with nearly identical spectral ranges. Its on-board calibration components include a solar diffuser and a solar diffuser stability monitor for the reflective solar bands (RSB), a V-groove blackbody for the thermal emissive bands (TEB), and a space view as background reference. This study evaluates calibration performance of the NOAA-20 VIIRS RSB using the first internally released L1B data product by NASA Land SIPS, which has consistent calibration coefficient look up tables (LUT) throughout the entire mission. Several independent vicarious approaches are used to examine the stability and consistence of reflectance. The first approach is based on a double difference method by comparison with SNPP VIIRS using observations from simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNO) with Aqua MODIS. The second is based on the reflectance trends from 16-day repeatable orbits obtained over the widely used Liby-4 desert site so each data point has the nearly same viewing angles relative to the site. The third approach is to use the frequent overpasses over the Dome C snow site. Results of this study provide NOAA-20 VIIRS post-launch calibration stability performance and radiometric agreement with SNPP for the first 18 months of mission.

AB  - Quantifying the spatiotemporal changes of Open Pit Mining Area (OPMA) are of important to understand the influence of mining activities on ecological, environmental and socioeconomic impact assessment procedure. This study uses the morphological mining feature index (MMFI) to identify and map surface mining areas and its dynamic changes in Changting county southeast china during 1998 to 2010, with the specific goal of understanding surface mining activities on vegetation deterioration and recovery. Serials of Landsat datasets during 1988-2010 period were collected, and the spatial distributions and change patterns of OPMA disturbances were detected and mapped. The results indicated that the changes of OPMA in Changting county have shown two stages, where the prior was the out-of-order exploitation of rare earth elements, and the next was dominated by the mining of quarry due to urbanization process in recent years.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Laser Communication and Propagation through the Atmosphere and Oceans VIII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Laser beams used in many open space applications, such as in defense, optical communication, and remote sensing, will subject to turbulence distortions that disrupt the intended beam profiles at the end of propagation. To guide the transmitted beam properly through an open space channel, adaptive optics (AO) are often used to implement beam corrections based on the reciprocity principles. In specific, if wave distortion from a remote spot can be determined and field conjugated at the site of the transmitter, the transmitted light will focus to the same spot at the receiver. Many experiments have demonstrated such a principle using a cooperative laser guide star on the target plane. However, finding or creating a well-defined guide star is impractical in real-world applications. The second best beacon choice is temporal glint signals that are relatively refined in geometry and brighter than ambient target illumination. To date, the best approach to extract information from arbitrary glint signals to instruct AO correction is still unknown. We propose the plenoptic sensor technique to extract phase distortion information from glint signals with minimum loss of information. In addition, as the addressed turbulence channel is typically a lateral path near the ground, we also validate the function of the plenoptic sensor in revealing the anisotropic state of turbulence.

AB  - Recently, the technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many disciplines such as remote sensing and control via the Internet in various industries. However, it is still difficult to find solutions directly from an appropriate textbook for learners. For this reason, this paper aims to provide a platform for remote sensing data collection from different locations. The proposed system presents a case study to collect and monitor sensed data, e.g., temperature and humidity, with Wi-Fi modules. The human interface using Visual C# is designed to control the Wi-Fi module that can transmit data up to a distance of 200 m. The collected data can be transmitted to the server via the Message Queueing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Once the data is received, it is then uploaded to the MySQL database. Therefore, the historical data from the cloud can be viewed and monitored on line by the PHP dynamic data management system. Experimental results verify that the proposed platform is feasible for practical applications in terms of robust, stable, and fast responses.

TI  - Examining the sensitivity of spatial scale in cellular automata Markov chain simulation of land use change
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial scale sensitivity of cellular automata is crucial for improving the accuracy of land use change simulation. We propose a framework based on a response surface method to comprehensively explore spatial scale sensitivity of the cellular automata Markov chain (CA-Markov) model, and present a hybrid evaluation model for expressing simulation accuracy that merges the strengths of the Kappa coefficient and of Contagion index. Three Landsat-Thematic Mapper remote sensing images of Wuhan in 1987, 1996, and 2005 were used to extract land use information. The results demonstrate that the spatial scale sensitivity of the CA-Markov model resulting from individual components and their combinations are both worthy of attention. The utility of our proposed hybrid evaluation model and response surface method to investigate the sensitivity has proven to be more accurate than the single Kappa coefficient method and more efficient than traditional methods. The findings also show that the CA-Markov model is more sensitive to neighborhood size than to cell size or neighborhood type considering individual component effects. Particularly, the bilateral and trilateral interactions between neighborhood and cell size result in a more remarkable scale effect than that of a single cell size.

AB  - With the deepening of urbanization and industrialization in China, large amount immigration flocked into the metropolis. As the capital of China, Beijing has become a huge immigration community. Most of the immigrants live in temporary buildings in urban-rural fringe areas because of high rents. It is difficult to supervise the quantitative changes of immigrants living in urban-rural fringe areas using traditional method. In order to study the variation of immigration communities, we try to detect and analyze the changes in temporary buildings using remote sensing data, in Daxing district, Beijing. Firstly, the TBI (Temporary Building Index) extraction method is used to extract Temporary buildings from 5 periods Sentinel-2A remote sensing images of Daxing District from 2016 to 2018. According to the extraction results, we found the immigration community is changing rapidly and intensely in three years. Affected by policy, the immigrants gathered close to the urban area, is rapidly moving away and the number of immigrants lived in suburban is increasing significantly.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Sharpening by Integrating Multispectral Image Super-Resolution and Convolutional Sparse Representation Fusion
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, it is quite necessary to fuse spectral information of low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images and spatial information of panchromatic (PAN) images for obtaining high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. In this paper, an effective fusion method integrating multispectral (MS) image super-resolution and convolutional sparse representation (CSR) fusion is proposed to make full use of the spatial information of remote sensing images. First, for enhancing the spatial information of LRMS images with suitable sizes, a fast iterative image super-resolution algorithm based on the learned iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm (LISTA) is exploited in the first stage. It employs a feed-forward neural network to simplify the solution of sparse coefficients in the process of super-resolution. In the fusion stage, we propose a CSR-based image fusion framework, in which each MS super-resolution image and PAN image is decomposed into a basic layer and a detail layer, then we fuse the basic layers and the detail layers of the images, respectively. This hierarchical fusion strategy guarantees great performance in detail preservation. The experimental results on QuickBird, WorldView-2, and Landsat ETM+ datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of both objective evaluation and visual effect.

Primary findings of this study are summarized as follows: (i) the HH polarization mode is the best mode for shoreline detection; (ii) SAR scenes with incident angle ranging from 30 degrees to 50 degrees under sea-to-land observation direction are recommended for shoreline detection; (iii) clear contrast of the backscattering coefficient between the beach and sea is expected when the nearshore significant wave height is smaller than 0.5 m for L-band SAR scenes; and (iv) X-band SAR scenes may be preferred to L-band SAR scenes for shoreline detection especially where the grain size of the beach material is relatively fine.

AB  - For those satellites in low earth orbit(LEO) satellite networks, due to limited storage capacity and other factors, an important task is to download their data collected in the space to earth stations (ESs). To maximize the throughput of data downloading from satellite to ESs, thus far, the existing research work has extensively studied how to efficiently allocate download time of ESs to satellites. However, a considerable part of satellites have barely contact time with ESs, because of the uneven contact between satellites and ESs. In this paper, we aim at optimizing data downloading from satellites to multiple ESs by using our inter-satellite link(ISL) routing method to offload data from the satellites that have surplus data to the satellites that have surplus contact time with ESs. First the entire satellite operation period is divided into several time intervals, a lime interval is a time unit of data transmission. Then we allocate the download time between satellites and ESs. Lastly, the topology of satellites is modeled as Twisted Manhattan topology and our offloading algorittun is proposed to offload data among the satellites. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The simulation results show that our scheme can significantly increase the overall system throughput of data downloading.

TI  - A Hierarchical Multiscale Super-Pixel-Based Classification Method for Extracting Urban Impervious Surface Using Deep Residual Network From World View-2 and LiDAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution optical imagery can provide detailed information of urban land objects for impervious surface extraction, while airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data can provide height features of land objects. Therefore, synergistic use of high-resolution imagery and LiDAR data is considered as an effective method to improve impervious surfaces extraction. In this paper, a novel hierarchical multiscale super-pixel-based classification method is proposed and applied to the urban impervious surfaces extraction from WorldView-2 and normalized digital surface model (nDSM) images derived from airborne LiDAR data. Three subsets in rural, rural-urban, and urban subsets are selected as the study areas. First, we split nonground and ground objects based on nDSM thresholds. Second, a hierarchical multiresolution segmentation method is used to generate nonground and ground super pixels. Then, we determine the multiscale input images based on the size of super pixels. Third, we construct optimal deep residual network (ResNet) and Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP-net) to train the model using multiscale input images. Finally, we use our deep models to predict hierarchically total super pixels in three subsets and generate the classification and impervious surfaces results. Our proposed method adopts hierarchical classification based on LiDAR nDSM height, which significantly improves the impervious surfaces extraction accuracies. Then, the deep residual network is applied further on multispectral and height fused data to extract urban impervious surfaces. Moreover, we propose an adaptive method to determine multiscale input images based on the segmentation of super pixels, which are inputs into the ResNet+SPP-net to train the deep model. Our proposed method reduces the uncertainty of multiscale input images and extracts better multiscale features. The results of the experiment show that our proposed method has a significant superiority to traditional pixel-based method and single scale method for urban impervious surfaces extraction.

TI  - Land-cover classification using GF-2 images and airborne lidar data based on Random Forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and its change are one of the important factors of global environmental change. The new GaoFen-2 (GF-2) satellite provides abundant spectral features and texture information, and airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) provides accurate three-dimensional coordinates at a finer scale. Fusing these data has the potential to improve land-cover classification. In the article, we selected the Random Forest (RF) as a classifier. The spectral bands of GF-2, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized digital surface model derived from lidar data, and their grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures including mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment, and correlation were generated to create seven scenarios with different combination of RF input variables. We estimated the classification performance on GF-2 satellite data, compared and assessed the individual and combined contributions of GF-2 and lidar data with regard to classification accuracy using fusion data, and identified the optimum combination of input variables that best balances classification performance with the computational challenges for land-cover classification. The results showed that GF-2 multispectral data alone or the fusion of GF-2 data and other sources can provide relatively good classification mapping accuracy in complex urban environments. The classification accuracy of fused data from the GF-2 satellite and lidar data exceeded those of GF-2 or lidar data alone. Moreover, GLCM textures significantly improved the classification performance whether using GF-2 satellite data or lidar height data. A fusion of GF-2 multispectral data, NDVI, lidar data, and their texture features (102 RF variables) achieved the best classification accuracy in seven scenarios. Using the optimum set of variables (55 variables) for RF yielded the most satisfactory classification result, achieving a total accuracy and kappa coefficient of 94.51% and 0.93, respectively. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy exceeded 90% for almost all classes. This study aims to provide a reference for the efficient improvement of land-cover classification and offer support for extending the applications of classification algorithms and data sources.

AB  - To further improve the accuracy of remote sensing classification and land-cover recognition at sub-pixel level, a novel sub-pixel mapping (SPM) model was first proposed by introducing the concept of pixel aggregation degree (PAD) which could simulate the spatial distribution of small-sized land-cover. In the proposed novel SPM model, based on the distribution of sub-pixel random initialization, PAD algorithm was optimized sub-pixel distribution to obtain final SPM results. Using a Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, related SPM experiments were performed to verify both accuracy and effect of PAD SPM model. The experimental results indicated that the SPM accuracy based on PAD model were superior to the classification results of the K-mean and the SPM results of traditional spatial attraction model. It was shown that the PAD model had certain feasibility and applicability which provided a new idea to better break the limitations of remote sensing image spatial resolution, and was beneficial to the subsequent research and application of remote sensing image.

TI  - Prediction of the livestock carrying capacity using neural network in the meadow steppe
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to predict the livestock carrying capacity in meadow steppe, a method using back propagation neural network is proposed based on the meteorological data and the remote-sensing data of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. In the proposed method, back propagation neural network was first utilised to build a behavioural model to forecast precipitation during the grass-growing season (June-July-August) from 1961 to 2015. Second, the relationship between precipitation and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index during the grass-growing season from 2000 to 2015 was modelled with the help of back propagation neural network. The prediction results demonstrate that the proposed back propagation neural network-based model is effective in the forecast of precipitation and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. Thus, an accurate prediction of livestock carrying capacity is achieved based on the proposed back propagation neural network-based model. In short, this work can be used to improve the utilisation of grassland and prevent the occurrence of vegetation degradation by overgrazing in drought years for arid and semiarid grasslands.

TI  - Cross-Comparison between GF-2 PMS2 and ZY-3 MUX Sensor Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, China has launched a variety of Earth observation satellites with many newly-developed sensors onboard. Meanwhile, researches on the cross-comparison of these China-made new sensors are in progress. Nevertheless, no study has been published with respect to the comparison between Gaofen-2 (GF-2) PMS2 and Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) MUX sensor data up to now. The quantitative relationship between the two sensor data is unclear, and it is uncertain whether the two sensor data can be used for the same project directly. To meet this special requirement, this study carried out a cross-comparison between the GF-2 PMS2 and ZY-3 MUX sensor data based on three synchronous image pairs of the two sensors. The cross-comparison was performed using two methods. The first one is making use of image statistics based on large areas in common between the image pairs. A pixel-by-pixel comparison method was used to investigate quantitative relationship between GF-2 PMS2 and ZY3 MUX sensor data based on the whole test area. The other method is a comparison based on the region of interest (ROI) in common to avoid the problem due to the difference in spatial resolution between the GF-2 PMS2 (4 m) and ZY-3 MUX (6 m). The ROIs had appropriate size and were selected from homogeneous areas that excluded complicated terrain conditions. A linear regression model was adopted for the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance-based comparison between the ROIs of the GF-2 PMS2 and ZY-3 MUX images. Through the two methods, we obtained the quantitative relationship models between GF-2 PMS2 and ZY-3 MUX sensor data. This comparison study found that the results obtained by two methods, i. e., pixel-by-pixel comparison and ROI-based comparison, are almost consistent. However, the ROI-based comparison achieves a higher accuracy because the spectral information of the corresponding pixels may be offset when using the pixel-by-pixel comparison due largely to the mis-registration of image pixels. This will lower the accuracy of the pixel-by-pixel comparison method. The results showed that the TOA reflectance of GF-2 PMS2 and ZY-3 MUX sensors has a high degree of agreement, with R2 values greater than 0. 9 for all the four bands. However, the higher R2 values in blue and green bands indicated that the TOA reflectance between the two sensors in both bands has a better agreement than that of red and near-infrared bands. Scatter plots showed that almost all data points lie under the one-to-one line in the spectral feature space with GF-2 data in x-axis and ZY-3 data in y-axis. This suggested that the GF-2 PMS2 sensor data generally have higher TOA reflectance than ZY-3 MUX, especially in blue and green bands. It should be noted that the difference of TOA reflectance between the two sensor data can be affected by land cover types in red and near infrared bands. In the image pairs dominated by bare soil, the difference between the TOA reflectance of two sensors decreases with increasing wavelength, while for vegetation-dominated image pairs, the difference increases with increasing wavelength. In order to further examine the differences caused by the land cover types, more ROIs of pure vegetation and pure bare soil were extracted separately. The results showed that the signal difference between the two sensors is mainly affected by bare soil in the red band and by vegetation in the near infrared band. The more vigorous the vegetation grows, the greater the difference between the two sensors is.The band-by-band comparison has yielded the conversion equations for each corresponding bands of the two sensors, which were applied to convert the TOA reflectance between each corresponding bands of the two sensors. The validation of the conversion showed that the obtained conversion equations have high accuracy. It can be observed that the GF-2 PMS2-simulated ZY-3 MUX data are almost identical with the actual ZY-3 MUX data with R2 values close to 1 and RMSE less than 0. 01. The conversion has resulted in a significance reduction in RMSE by up to 64. 79%, as well as a significant decrease in ME. This study showed that such a conversion can significantly improve the agreement between the two sensors data. The converted data are more conducive to the synergy between the GF-2 PMS2 and ZY-3 MUX sensor data. The analysis showed that the differences in TOA reflectance between the two sensor data result probably from the differences in their spectral response function and spatial resolution. We found that the spectral response curve of ZY-3 MUX is smoother with no obvious fluctuations than that of GF-2 PMS2, which is fluctuant in all of four bands. Such a difference in the spectral response functions may have led to the difference in TOA reflectance between the two sensors. In addition, the spatial resolution of GF-2 PMS2 is 4 m, which is higher than ZY-3 MUX's 6 m. A higher spatial resolution will help GF-2 PMS2 sensor to detect subtle spectral information of small ground objects and thus cause the difference in TOA reflectance between the two sensors.

TI  - Outage Performance for Multiuser Threshold-Based DF Satellite Relaying
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite communication plays an important role in future seamless wireless network. In this paper, we investigate the system outage performance of a multiuser threshold-based decode-and-forward (DF) satellite relaying network, where the satellite employing spot beam technology is used as an aerial relay to assist the signal transmission between the terrestrial equipments with multi-antenna. Assuming that maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) are utilized to achieve the optimal performance, we first obtain the equivalent output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expression of the considered system, where frequency division multiplexing access (FDMA) scheme is exploited in the uplink. Then, we derive the closed-form system outage probability (SOP) expression for the considered system, where both uplink and downlink are subject to shadowed-Rician (SR) fading with path loss and antenna gain being considered. The main advantage of our theoretical formula is that it can be used in the case of integer and rational Nakagami-m fading parameters. Furthermore, asymptotic SOP formula at high SNR is also presented to show the diversity order and coding gain of the considered system. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the correctness of the exact and asymptotic SOP expressions and reveal the effects of representative parameters on the system outage performance of the satellite relaying system with threshold-based DF protocol.

TI  - A Satellite Handover Strategy Based on the Potential Game in LEO Satellite Networks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite network, handover management across satellite spot beams needs to be addressed to decrease handover times while using network resources efficiently since the speed of LEO satellites is much higher than that of mobile nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel satellite handover strategy based on the potential game for mobile terminals in a LEO satellite communication network. To continue communication with the counterpart, the user has to switch among the covered LEO satellites. In a software-defined satellite network (SDSN) architecture, the satellite handover can be viewed as a bipartite graph. To balance the satellite network workload, we propose a terminal random-access algorithm based on the target of userspace maximization. The simulated handover conducted on a typical LEO satellite network, Iridium, corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed handover strategy.

AB  - Objective: To explore the mechanism of lysosomal cathepsin L on apoptosis of rat cerebral ischemia-perfusion cells through JNK signaling pathway.Methods: The rats were then divided into the sham operation group, model group, JNK inhibitor SP600125 group (SP group), Cathepsin 1: inhibitor Z-FY-DMK group (CLI group). The model group, SP,group and CLC group were divided into 2 It group, 6 h group, 12 h group and 24 h group according to the time point of cerebral ischemia and repelfusion. There were 12 rats in model group, SP group, CLC group 2 h subgroup, 6 h subgroup, 12 h subgroup, and 18 rats in CLC group 24 h subgroup. The area of cerebral infarction was calculated by picture analysis system. Apoptosis u'as detected by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl tramferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. The protein expression of lysosomal cathepsin L and c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JVK) was detected by western blotting assay.Results: There was no obvious infarction lesions in the sham operation group. The pale-white infarction lesions of different sizes could be found in the model group, SP group and CLI group. The area of relative infarction in the sham operation group was significantly smaller than that in other groups, and that in SP group and ('LI group was remarkably smaller than that in model group (P<0.01). The expression of apoptosis in sham operation group was obviously lower than that in other groups (P<0.0.1). The expression of apoptosis was positively correlated with time in each group. The apoptosis expression in SP group and CLI group was significantly lower than that in model group (P<0.01). The expression of catapsin L, p-JNK protein in each time-point subgroup of model group was significantly higher than that in the sham-operated group (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in the expression of Cathepsin L between SP group and model group at each time point (P>0.05). The expression- of pJNK was markedly lower in the subgroup of SP group than that in the model group (P<0.011. The expression of Cathepsin L and p-JNK protein in CLI group at each time point was significantly lower than that in model group (P<0.01). There was a positive correlation between Catapsin L and p-JNK by Spearman rank-related nonparametric test (r=0.765, P<0.01).Conclusion: Cathepsin L may be located upstream of p-JNK signal molecules to regulate apoptosis. The specific inhibitor of Cathepsin L has inhibitory effect on cathepsin L and p-JNK protein, and plays an important role in reducing the number of apoptosis and improving nerve fnnction.

TI  - Preliminary comparative assessment of various spectral indices for built-up land derived from Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI imageries
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization in China has been rapid over the past three decades causing substantial replacement of the natural landscape by built-up land. In this paper, we present a comparison of Sentinel-2A MSI (S2A) and Landsat-8 OLI (L8) data in the retrieval of five built-up indices, namely Urban Index (UI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Index-based Built-up Index (IBI) and two visible based indices, i.e. VgNIR-BI and VrNIR-BI. All the built-up indices maps water-masked were classified into built-up and non-built-up land using Otsu's method. Simultaneously, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed to classify the two imageries into three respective classes. The accuracy assessment results show that all built-up indices had higher Overall Accuracy for S2A (up to 98.14% for VrNIR-BI) and L8 (up to 98.42% for VrNIR-BI) imageries compared to SVM. The percentage differences demonstrate that L8 estimates higher built-up area compared to S2A between 1.48% and 8.45% via the built-up indices and 13.40% compared to the SVM. Cross-checking with the Statistical Yearbook, S2A is superior to L8 in built-up land mapping capability, especially utilizing built-up indices. The difference caused by spatial resolution and spectral response functions should be taken into consideration in synergistic scientific application.

AB  - Accurate mapping of Dynamics of surface water is essential for supporting sustainable water source management and socio-economic development. To obtain a dynamic map of surface water, we obtained all available Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images (16760 scenes) of Huai River Basin from 1989 to 2017 based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The water surface extraction method combining vegetation index and water index was used to map the spatio-temporal pattern of the surface water body. Results show as follows: (1) the maximum, average and seasonal surface water area in the Huai River Basin shows a downward trend in the past three decades, but the minimum surface water area shows a slight upward trend; (2) both the number of maximum and the minimum surface water body show a downward trend in the past three decades; (3) the changes of numbers of surface water bodies are mainly depended on the number of small surface water bodies, and the changes in the area of water bodies are mainly controlled by larger surface water bodies area. The results of the Surface water mapping are expected to provide detailed information for optimizing water structure and water source management which are critical issues in this region.

AB  - This paper presents building damage mapping based on transfer learning techniques. Due to the different spatial resolutions of optical (WorldView, 0.5m) and SAR (Sentinel-1, 10m), we adopt different methods: pixel-level for moderate-resolution SAR images, and patch-level for very high-resolution optical images. For SAR images, the performance of fast unsupervised transfer learning methods, such as overall centroid alignment (OCA) and CORrelation ALignment (CORAL), are investigated. For the optical images, two public databases are used to predict the building damage mapping of Palu with WorldView-3 images via ResNet50. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of transfer learning on the building damage mapping using different data sources.

TI  - A comparison of two methods for estimating surface soil moisture based on the triangle model using optical/thermal infrared remote sensing over the source area of the Yellow River
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important surface parameter, surface soil moisture (SSM) plays a significant role in water resources management, crop growth, land degradation, and vegetation coverage as well as global climate change studies. In particular, the triangle model based on the spatial relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation index from optical/thermal infrared remote sensing data has been widely used for the estimation of SSM. In the present study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data, including the MOD11A2 LST and MOD13A2 normalised differential vegetation index (NDVI) from July to October, 2008 to 2010, over the source area of the Yellow River (SAYR) in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau, are selected to construct the LST/NDVI triangle space. Two methods based on the triangle space, namely, the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) method and second order polynomial method, is used to estimate the SSM at the regional scale. Finally, an analysis between the estimated SSM and ground-measured SSM is carried out to explore not only the quality of these two methods in triangle space but also the applicability of these two methods in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the spatial distribution of SSM in the study area is investigated. The results of the validation of the estimated SSM results using ground-measured data show that the accuracy of the second order polynomial method is significantly higher than that of the TVDI method. The TVDI method root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.072m(3)m(-3), coefficient of determination R-2 is 0.461, and bias is -0.022m(3)m(-3), while the second order polynomial method RMSE is 0.075m(3)m(-3), R-2 is 0.519, and bias is 0.007m(3)m(-3). Moreover, the SSM decreases from west to the east; this distribution can be obtained with the estimated results by using either of the two methods. In addition, the SSM estimations by using the two methods are in good correlation with the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture product. The present study indicates that the second order polynomial method can simulate the change in SSM in the triangle space more realistically and effectively and that the second order polynomial method is more suitable for the estimation of SSM over the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - In the area of transportation construction and road safety, road structures need to be frequently inspected in order to discover damage threatens and potential risks. Therefore, the automatic technique of detecting road surface anomaly is very important. The paper aims to extract road surface anomaly from remote sensing data. The anomalies can be regarded as possible road damage candidates. This is a very challenging task, and we focus on the targets whose sizes are not too tiny to be seen in remote sensing image, like landslide, pothole, ponding, and so on. The basic idea of the proposed approach is to firstly identify the road pavement materials, and then analyze their characteristics to find abnormal conditions. We treat the task of road material identification as an image object segmentation/classification process, for which the methods based on deep learning framework can be applied. Then, an approach is developed to detect if there exits any abnormal subjects in the road region, and these subjects are the candidates of desired anomalies. These candidates are further analyzed based on the shape and spectral features, to output the final anomaly results.

TI  - Aerosol Data Assimilation Using Data from Fengyun-3A and MODIS: Application to a Dust Storm over East Asia in 2011
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is the most basic parameter that describes the optical properties of atmospheric aerosols, and it can be used to indicate aerosol content. In this study, we assimilated AOD data from the Fengyun-3A (FY-3A) and MODIS meteorological satellite using the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation three-dimensional variational data assimilation system. Experiments were conducted for a dust storm over East Asia in April 2011. Each 0600 UTC analysis initialized a 24-hWeather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model forecast. The results generally showed that the assimilation of satellite AOD observational data can significantly improve model aerosol mass prediction skills. The AOD distribution of the analysis field was closer to the observations of the satellite after assimilation of satellite AOD data. In addition, the analysis resulting from the experiment assimilating both FY-3A/MERSI (Medium-resolution Spectral Imager) AOD data and MODIS AOD data had closer agreement with the ground-based values than the individual assimilation of the two datasets for the dust storm over East Asia. These results suggest that the Chinese FY-3A satellite aerosol products can be effectively applied to numerical models and dust weather analysis.

AB  - Optical remote sensing images are inevitably corrupted by clouds during the acquisition process. To reconstruct the missing information contaminated by clouds, this paper introduces a new cloud removal method based on X-fork generative adversarial network with multitemporal data, which can be named X-MTGAN. By utilizing the auxiliary differential image between two imaging times, X-MTGAN can be well trained with multitemporal SAR-optical data. Then, the target optical image is synthesized with an end-to-end generator of the X-MTGAN, which has advantages in capturing change information between two temporal images. Finally, the cloud-free image can be subsequently acquired by replacing cloud-contaminated regions with the simulated image. By utilizing Setinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the results illustrate that X-MTGAN is visually and quantitatively effective in the removal of clouds, which has favorable applicability and competitive performance.

TI  - Individual Tree Detection and Crown Delineation with 3D Information from Multi-view Satellite Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Individual tree detection and crown delineation (ITDD) are critical in forest inventory management and remote sensing based forest surveys are largely carried out through satellite images. However, most of these surveys only use 2D spectral information which normally has not enough clues for ITDD. To fully explore the satellite images, we propose a ITDD method using the orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM) derived from the multi-view satellite data. Our algorithm utilizes the top-hat morphological operation to efficiently extract the local maxima from DSM as treetops, and then feed them to a modified superpixel segmentation that combines both 2D and 3D information for tree crown delineation. In subsequent steps, our method incorporates the biological characteristics of the crowns through plant allometric equation to falsify potential outliers. Experiments against manually marked tree plots on three representative regions have demonstrated promising results - the best overall detection accuracy can be 89%.

AB  - This paper introduces a method of road extraction using dual-temporal high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Firstly, multiplicative Duda operators are applied to detect line features. Then, coherence and backscattering coefficient are combined to distinguish road from river and shadow and the coefficient of variation is used to remove heterogeneous areas. Next, road is segmented via path opening and thresholding. At last, a novel thinning and gap connection approach is proposed to gain the thinned and more complete road map. The experiments were test on TerraSAR-X images and results showed that the proposed method improved considerably the results of road extraction compared with approach using single-temporal SAR image.

TI  - Multipath Smearing Suppression for Synthetic Aperture Radar Images of Harbor Scenes
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the periodic and non-periodic variations in the sea surface, smearing is caused by the multiple paths between the sea surface and man-made objects in synthetic aperture radar images of harbor areas. This smearing can cover real targets and lead to false alarms. To derive the relationship between the motion of the sea surface and blurring in synthetic aperture radar images, a sway signal model is established, and the Doppler spectrum of the sea surface is found to undulate for well-focused targets with different shapes. Based on this finding, a subaperture combined detection algorithm based on an inverse coherence factor filter is developed to separate the unwanted pixels from the resultant synthetic aperture radar image. An energy balance is used to suppress interference and maintain the resolution of the real scene. The algorithm can be automatically applied to synthetic aperture radar images. The experimental results with TerraSAR-X spotlight mode data show that this method can effectively detect and mitigate the effects of the time-varying multipath phenomena.

AB  - Urban areas have profound environmental impacts, while the existed products of urban areas have some issues, such as low spatial resolution and confused definition of urban. In this study, we developed a method based on image pattern recognition is developed to classify urban and rural from the artificial surfaces class in GlobaLand30. The global urban areas with 30m resolution in years 2000 and 2010 are extracted. The results are compared with the data from the China City Statistical Yearbooks (CCSY) and the US Census Bureau (USCB) in year 2010. The correlation coefficient between our urban areas and CCSY reached at 0.877. The user accuracy between our urban areas and USCB can reach at 91.82%. The major difference is from the green land and water in the urban areas and the urban fringe with more green lands, where are ignored by our data.

The ZY-3-02 laser altimetry data and two scenes optical stereo-imageries are deployed for validation. The results show that the absolute vertical accuracy of optical stereo-imagery with the ZY-3-02 laser data instead of the field-surveyed GCPs (ground control points) can be improved to about 3 meter.

TI  - Downscaling of ASCAT Soil Moisture with MODIS Products Based on Apparent Thermal Inertia in Areas around 54 FLUXNET Stations

AB  - The ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) soil moisture product with 10-km spatial resolution was retrieved based on the soil water index (SWI) algorithm from the data acquired by the scatterometer on board the Meteorological OPerational (MetOP) satellites (MetOP-A, MetOP-B). In this study, the ASCAT product was downscaled from 10-km to 1-km spatial resolution based on the Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) estimated from MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Albedo retrievals in 54 grids (1 degree * 1 degree) around 54 FLUXNET stations. First, the ATI was estimated at 1-km spatial resolution by using MODIS LST and Albedo data at the same spatial resolution and then resampled to 10-km. Second, the relationship between ASCAT soil moisture and ATI at 10-km spatial resolution was established. Finally, the spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture at 1-km spatial resolution was retrieved using the obtained relationship between ATI and ASCAT at 10-km spatial resolution, and the ATI data at 1-km spatial resolution. However, there were many missing values in the MODIS LST maps leading to spatiotemporal discontinuity in LST and calculated ATI data. To obtain spatiotemporal continuous ATI data, this study first reconstructed the MODIS LST data by finding similar points that had the same land cover type and similar NDVI (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) value. In this study, we found that the LST data of similar points in a pair of temporal adjacent LST images had a linear relationship. The LST data of these similar points in a pair of temporal adjacent LST images were used to establish a linear relationship and then used to reconstruct the pair of temporally adjacent LST images. The reconstructed LST data were used to obtain the spatiotemporal continuous ATI data at 1-km and 10-km spatial resolutions. In this study, downscaled 1-km spatial resolution soil moisture product within the 54 grids around the FLUXNET sites were obtained in 2013. Results indicated that the spatial distribution of the downscaled soil moisture using the reconstructed MODIS LST data is better than that using original MODIS LST data. Additionally, the downscaled soil moisture was evaluated against in-situ soil moisture measurements at 54 FLUXNET stations. The average of RMSE (the Root Mean Square Error) was 0.098m(3)m(-3) and the average of MAE (the Mean Absolute Error) was 0.08m(3)m(-3).

TI  - Predicting surface reflectance using time series harmonic model and all available Landsat imagery

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - A time series harmonic (TSH) model for predicting surface reflectance using all available Landsat 8 images in three years is developed. First, a cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection algorithm called Fmask is used for eliminating "noisy" observations. Then, a time series model that has components of overall, seasonality and trend are estimated for each pixel of each spectral band. The model is capable of predicting surface reflectance for pixels at any location and any date assuming persistence of land cover. The algorithm was applied to one Landsat 8 scene in North China (WRS Path 123 and Row 32). All available (a total of 63) Landsat 8 images acquired between 2014 and 2016 in Google Earth Engine were used. Three clearest scenes were used for quality assessment of the predicted surface reflectance. The average R-2 of 6 bands were 0.75, 0.69 and 0.67 for 04/13/2014, 09/04/2014 and 10/06/2014 scene, respectively. The average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6 bands were 0.025, 0.026 and 0.028 for 04/13/2014, 09/04/2014 and 10/06/2014 scene, respectively. The results demonstrate that the predicted images are in good agreement with the real images. In addition, the performance of TSH model for cloud-gap fill was assessed and was compared with Best-Available-Pixel (BAP) composite method. The MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance product (MCD43A4) was used to assess the error of cloud-gap fill. For the three selected cloud-covered test regions, the average R-2/RMSE were 0.8/0.022, 0.63/0.014 and 0.8/0.018 for TSH model, and were 0.72/0.026, 0.53/0.016 and 0.66/0.032 for BAP composite method. The results conclude that prediction accuracy of TSH model is superior to that of BAP composite method. The TSH model-derived cloud-free images are of great importance for multi-temporal land-cover classification and change detection.

TI  - Prediction model of rice crude protein content, amylose content and actual yield under high temperature stress based on hyper-spectral remote sensing
T2  - QUALITY ASSURANCE AND SAFETY OF CROPS & FOODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crude protein and amylose constitute two main representative components of rice quality. The non-destructive, quick assessment of grain crude protein content (GCPC), grain amylose content (GAC), and actual yield (AC) are necessary for quality and yield diagnosis in rice production. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of high temperature stress on rice GCPC, GAC and AC, to define the relationships of GCPC, GAC, and AC to ground-based canopy hyper-spectral reflectance and derivative parameters, and to establish quantitative models for real-time monitoring of rice GCPC, GAC, and AC using sensitive spectral parameters under high temperature stress. Two field warming experiments were performed in Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, China, to investigate the effects of high temperature ((treated for continuous 3 days from 9:00 am to 14:00 pm, average temperature was set at 35, 38 and 41 degrees C) and a control (CK)) at flowering stage in Liangyoupeijiu rice cultivar, using a free air temperature increase apparatus. Canopy hyper-spectral reflectance, GCPC, GAC, and AC were measured under high temperature treatments during different growth stages (flowering stage, grain-filling and ripening stages). The results showed that GCPC, AC (GAC) in Liangyoupeijiu were clearly reduced (increased) under high temperature stress in this study compared with the values of CK, and the reducing extent of GCPC and AC (the increasing extent of GAC) was increased with the increase of high temperature level. The hyper-spectral reflectance in different wavelength regions under high temperature stress was different. They increased in visible light region with the elevation of temperature, but reduced in near-infrared region. Among some selected spectral indices at three different growth stages used to estimate GCPC, GAC and AC, the optimum indices were difference vegetation index(810,450) and perpendicular vegetation index- Landsat multispectral scanner with high R-2 when regressed against GCPC, GAC and AC. Furthermore, GCPC, GAC and AC prediction based on flowering stages were preferred than that on grain-filling and ripening stage by much bigger correlation coefficients. The six regression models developed in this study showed the agreement between the predicted and observed values when testing independent data under high temperature stress. Thus, the selected key hyper-spectral parameters can be reliably used to estimate GCPC, GAC and AC in rice under different high temperature treatments.

AB  - In this study, along-scan performance of FengYun-3C microwave radiation imager (MWRI) is examined utilizing one-year data over ocean. Generally-good uniformity along azimuth scan position is found with a TB bias less than 1 K at the edge-of-scan. However, discernible errors can be still found and the behaviors of the scan-position-dependent bias are different for ascending and descending phases of the orbits. It is thus suggested that descending and ascending passes should be taken into account, separately, when correcting antenna pattern in calibration processes.

TI  - Classification of Land Cover, Forest, and Tree Species Classes with ZiYuan-3 Multispectral and Stereo Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global availability of high spatial resolution images makes mapping tree species distribution possible for better management of forest resources. Previous research mainly focused on mapping single tree species, but information about the spatial distribution of all kinds of trees, especially plantations, is often required. This research aims to identify suitable variables and algorithms for classifying land cover, forest, and tree species. Bi-temporal ZiYuan-3 multispectral and stereo images were used. Spectral responses and textures from multispectral imagery, canopy height features from bi-temporal stereo imagery, and slope and elevation from the stereo-derived digital surface model data were examined through comparative analysis of six classification algorithms including maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). The results showed that use of multiple source data-spectral bands, vegetation indices, textures, and topographic factors-considerably improved land-cover and forest classification accuracies compared to spectral bands alone, which the highest overall accuracy of 84.5% for land cover classes was from the SVM, and, of 89.2% for forest classes, was from the MLC. The combination of leaf-on and leaf-off seasonal images further improved classification accuracies by 7.8% to 15.0% for land cover classes and by 6.0% to 11.8% for forest classes compared to single season spectral image. The combination of multiple source data also improved land cover classification by 3.7% to 15.5% and forest classification by 1.0% to 12.7% compared to the spectral image alone. MLC provided better land-cover and forest classification accuracies than machine learning algorithms when spectral data alone were used. However, some machine learning approaches such as RF and SVM provided better performance than MLC when multiple data sources were used. Further addition of canopy height features into multiple source data had no or limited effects in improving land-cover or forest classification, but improved classification accuracies of some tree species such as birch and Mongolia scotch pine. Considering tree species classification, Chinese pine, Mongolia scotch pine, red pine, aspen and elm, and other broadleaf trees as having classification accuracies of over 92%, and larch and birch have relatively low accuracies of 87.3% and 84.5%. However, these high classification accuracies are from different data sources and classification algorithms, and no one classification algorithm provided the best accuracy for all tree species classes. This research implies the same data source and the classification algorithm cannot provide the best classification results for different land cover classes. It is necessary to develop a comprehensive classification procedure using an expert-based approach or hierarchical-based classification approach that can employ specific data variables and algorithm for each tree species class.

TI  - Assimilating Multiresolution Leaf Area Index of Moso Bamboo Forest from MODIS Time Series Data Based on a Hierarchical Bayesian Network Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The highly accurate multiresolution leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter for carbon cycle simulation for bamboo forests at different scales. However, current LAI products have discontinuous resolution with 1 km mostly, that makes it difficult to accurately quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of carbon cycle at different resolutions. Thus, this study used MODIS LAI product (MOD15A2) and MODIS reflectance data (MOD09Q1) of Moso bamboo forest (MBF) from 2015, and it adopted a hierarchical Bayesian network (HBN) algorithm coupled with a dynamic LAI model and the PROSAIL model to obtain high-precision LAI data at multiresolution (i.e., 1000, 500, and 250 m). The results showed the LAIs assimilated using the HBN at the three resolutions corresponded with the actual growth trend of the MBF and correlated significantly with the observed LAI with a determination coefficient (R-2) value of >0.80. The highest-precision assimilated LAI was obtained at 1000-m resolution with R-2 values of 0.91. The LAI assimilated using the HBN algorithm achieved better accuracy than the MODIS LAI with increases in the R-2 value of 2.7 times and decreases in the root mean square error of 87.8%. Therefore, the HBN algorithm applied in this study can effectively obtain highly accurate multiresolution LAI time series data for bamboo forest.

AB  - It has been challenging for medium wave infrared (MWIR) optical imaging system to work in a large temperature range and stationary effective focal length, on account of the thermal effect of optical elements and machinery. Performances of a MWIR space remote sensor in an advanced passive thermal-free design are presented with a fronting R-C system and a rear spherical lens group. A general analytical expression for eliminating thermal defocus and chromatic aberration is obtained, and it is demonstrated that these defocus and aberrations are minimized when this MWIR space remote sensor is operated at a broadband (3um to 5um) and large temperature range (-40 degrees C to 40 degrees C). The ZEMAX software is used to obtain the final parameters of space remote sensor by global optimization, which realize 100% cold shield efficiency. The MWIR space remote sensor has a focal length of 2150mm, F number of 3.58, full field of view of angle of 0.4 degrees x0.4 degrees and pixel size of 15 mu m. This optical system provides a high ground sample distance (GSD) of 251m and wide single landscape width (SLW) of 251kmx251km in geosynchronous orbit. The imaging quality of the space optical remote sensor is almost diffraction limited which can be inferred from metrics such as root-mean-square spot diagram, MTF, wavefront function etc.

AB  - Significant advances have been made in recent years by many countries and agencies in Earth observations via remote sensing instruments operated onboard LEO and GEO satellites. For passive optical sensors, reflective solar (RS) calibration remains extremely challenging in terms of calibration traceability, accuracy, stability, and consistency. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of sensor RS calibration approaches with examples from the MODIS on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft and the VIIRS on the S-NPP and N-20. Lessons and calibration strategies developed to address various challenging issues are also discussed.

AB  - MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments are key contributors to the NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua missions. Launched in December 1999 and May 2002, Terra and Aqua MODIS have successfully operated for more than 19 and 17 years, respectively. MODIS has 36 spectral bands covering wavelengths from visible (VIS) to long-wave infrared (LWIR). Observations from both Terra and Aqua MODIS instruments have been used to generate a wide range of data products that have enabled many studies of the Earth's atmosphere, land, and oceans. Sixteen of the 36 MODIS spectral bands, with wavelengths ranging from 3.7 mu m to 14.4 mu m, are referred to as the Thermal Emissive Bands (TEBs). Key calibration parameters that are related to detector gains of the MODIS TEBs are calibrated on a scan-by-scan basis using an on-board blackbody. As both sensors continue to operate beyond their specified design lifetime of 6 years, it has become increasingly important to constantly monitor and evaluate the on-orbit performance and calibration consistency of their long-term data records. In this study, we examine the long-term calibration stability of each sensor and the calibration consistency between two MODIS instruments using multiple daily (nadir) observations over Dome Concordia. The near-surface temperature measurements from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) are used as a proxy reference to help determine the calibration stability and relative bias between the Terra and Aqua MODIS TEBs.

AB  - For nearly 20 years, Terra MODIS observations have generated a broad range of data products, enabling the remote sensing community and users worldwide for their studies of many key geophysical parameters of the Earth's system. MODIS collects data in 36 spectral bands, covering wavelengths from 0.41 to 14.4.m, that are calibrated by a set of on-board calibrators (OBC). Also contributed to sensor on-orbit calibration and characterization are near monthly-scheduled lunar observations and long-term trends of sensor responses over select ground targets. The quality of MODIS data products relies strongly on the dedicated efforts to the operate instrument, derive and update calibration parameters, and improve calibration strategies and algorithms in order to address on-orbit changes of sensor characteristics and its OBC functions. This paper provides an overview of Terra MODIS on-orbit operation and calibration activities over the last 20 years, including changes made to extend and preserve instrument and OBC functions and their implementation strategies. It illustrates sensor on-orbit performance using data from its OBC, lunar observations, and select ground targets and discusses major changes in sensor characteristics and corrections applied to the L1B algorithms or updates of calibration look-up tables (LUTs). Also described in this paper are lessons learned from Terra MODIS and future efforts to further extend its long-term data records.

TI  - Quantitative monitoring of grazing intensity in the temperate meadow steppe based on remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grazing intensity (GI) is difficult to measure accurately because of the diversity of grazing livestock, their mobility in the grazing space and the uncertainty of grazing times. Thus, GI monitoring is often only qualitative, while quantitative monitoring is scarce. In this study, models correlating GI, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) were established based on a controlled GI experiment. The GI derived from NDVI was evaluated using the GI derived from AGB samples, under the principle that AGB is similar for the same GI in the same grassland type. The results showed that the appropriate time to build the model in the study area was from July to August, when there was a negative correlation between GI and NDVI. The simulated GI derived from NDVI was similar to GI derived from AGB, and the R-2 (coefficient of determination) values for fresh weight and dry weight were 0.3770 and 0.4292, respectively; the root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.2302 and 0.1953 animal units (AU) ha(-1) (1AU=500kg of adult cattle); and the relative error from -20% to 20% accounted for 62.07% and 72.41% of the total samples. Most of the study area was under heavy grazing according to monitoring results from 2010 to 2016, except for a few pastures with rational utilization (0.23AU ha(-1) - 0.46AU ha(-1)), and continuous heavy grazing often occurred for many years without rest grazing.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIV, held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference

AB  - The surface reflectance is an essential parameter for the quantitative applications using remote sensing satellite data; therefore, it is of great importance for the scientific community to produce standard surface reflectance products using an operational running algorithm and system. There have been various medium- to high-resolution satellites in China, yet there is still a lack of relevant surface reflectance products and systems. In this paper, high-resolution GF-1/GF-2 data from the year 2014 and 2017 were utilized for retrieval of surface reflectance products over land by using an operational atmospheric correction algorithm, adaptive to most multispectral satellites with visible and near-infrared bands (VNIR), namely, the VNIR approach. This method was based on the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum, Vector (6SV) code and the look-up tables (LUTs). The surface reflectance products over land were validated against the ground-based atmospherically corrected reflectance over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions and middle and lower regions of the Yangtze River in China. The preliminary validation results showed that the surface reflectance products agreed quiet well with the ground-based corrected reflectance, with the linear regression fitting coefficients being 1.09-1.03, the correlation coefficients of R-2 being 0.97-0.99, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being 0.01. Simultaneously, the mean reflectance normalized residuals between the surface reflectance products and the ground-based corrected reflectance were 19.7 %, 13.5 %, 8.7 %, and 6.6 %, respectively, indicating that the surface reflectance products over land derived from VNIR atmospheric correction approach had a good accuracy.

AB  - The ocean surface net radiation (R-n) characterizing the ocean surface radiation budget, is a key variable of interest in ocean climate modeling and analysis, which determines the climate model of ocean surface with heat, freshwater and momentum flux. Most available ocean surface Rn data face various issues in accuracy, spatiotemporal patterns, and coarse spatial resolutions. J-OFURO3 (The third generation of Japanese Ocean Flux Datasets with Use of Remote Sensing Observations) released recently is considered to be one of the best datasets in ocean Rn, but its spatial resolution is also at 0.25 degrees. In this study, we downscaled ocean surface Rn from J-OFURO3 using AVHRR TOA observations with Random Forest (RF) method. The accuracy of the downscaling daily surface ocean R-n is satisfactory with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 29Wm(-2), which is better than other reanalysis data and comparable to that of CERES-SYN.

TI  - Farmland Extraction from High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on Stratified Scale Pre-Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting farmland from high spatial resolution remote sensing images is a basic task for agricultural information management. According to Tobler's first law of geography, closer objects have a stronger relation. Meanwhile, due to the scale effect, there are differences on both spatial and attribute scales among different kinds of objects. Thus, it is not appropriate to segment images with unique or fixed parameters for different kinds of objects. In view of this, this paper presents a stratified object-based farmland extraction method, which includes two key processes: one is image region division on a rough scale and the other is scale parameter pre-estimation within local regions. Firstly, the image in RGB color space is converted into HSV color space, and then the texture features of the hue layer are calculated using the grey level co-occurrence matrix method. Thus, the whole image can be divided into different regions based on the texture features, such as the mean and homogeneity. Secondly, within local regions, the optimal spatial scale segmentation parameter was pre-estimated by average local variance and its first-order and second-order rate of change. The optimal attribute scale segmentation parameter can be estimated based on the histogram of local variance. Through stratified regionalization and local segmentation parameters estimation, fine farmland segmentation can be achieved. GF-2 and Quickbird images were used in this paper, and mean-shift and multi-resolution segmentation algorithms were applied as examples to verify the validity of the proposed method. The experimental results have shown that the stratified processing method can release under-segmentation and over-segmentation phenomena to a certain extent, which ultimately benefits the accurate farmland information extraction.

TI  - Crop Classification Based on Temporal Information Using Sentinel-1 SAR Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing temporal resolution of space-borne SAR, large amounts of intensity data are now available for continues land observations. Previous researches proved the effectiveness of multitemporal SAR in land classification, but the characterizations of temporal information were still inadequate. In this paper, we proposed a crop classification scheme, which made full use of multitemporal SAR backscattering responses. In this method, the temporal intensity models were established by the K-means clustering method. The intensity vectors were treated as input features, and the mean intensity vectors of cluster centers were regarded as the temporal models. The temporal models summarized the backscatter evolutions of crops and were utilized as the criterion for crop discrimination. The spectral similarity value (SSV) measure was introduced from hyperspectral image processing for temporal model matching. The unlabeled pixel was assigned to the class to which the temporal model with the highest similarity belonged. Two sets of Sentinel-1 SAR time-series data were used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison between SSV and other measures demonstrated the superiority of SSV in temporal model matching. Compared with the decision tree (DT) and naive Bayes (NB) classifiers, the proposed method achieved the best overall accuracies in both VH and VV bands. For most crops, it either obtained the best accuracies or achieved comparable accuracies to the best ones, which illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - A typhoon (as well as a hurricane or tropical storm) is one of the largest air-sea interaction processes on the synoptic scale, which can greatly enhance the air-sea exchange of material and energy within a short time; meanwhile, a typhoon can significantly alter the water structure, seabed topography and geomorphology, and particle transport and deposition, as well as biogeochemical processes in the affected areas. Satellite remote sensing is the main approach to study the impact of typhoon on the sea surface temperature(SST) and the ocean color environment at present. The Taiwan Strait plays an important role in water and sediment exchange between the East China Sea and the South China Sea. This paper uses the data of the MODIS satellites to analyses the effects of Haitang(2005) on the SST, sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration(Chl-a) and total suspended matter(TSM) in the Taiwan Strait over different periods. During the typhoon-active period, the concentration of TSM significantly increased. The SST for the typhoon-active period was lower than that both the pre- and post-the typhoon periods. During the typhoon, Chl-a concentration increased. After the typhoon, the Chl-a concentration decreased, but still higher than before the typhoon. The Chl-a concentration near the Minjiang Estuary during the typhoon was slightly lower than that before the typhoon and after the typhoon. During the typhoon, the strong cyclonic wind-stress of the typhoon enhanced heat exchange between the water and the atmosphere, and a large amount of rainfall and run-off significantly decreased the SST. During the typhoon, the increased sediment discharged into the strait by rivers, and the re-suspension of seafloor sediment, increased the concentration of TSM in the coastal waters. Seawater with relatively high sediment concentration was transported to the middle of the strait after being carried by wind-induced flows. During the typhoon, in the waters near the typhoon's path, Chl-a concentration increased. After the typhoon, Chl-a concentration near the Minjiang estuary dramatically increased than before the typhoon. Nutrient-rich bottom water stirred by the typhoon promoted an outbreak of aquatic organisms. The increase of Chl-a concentration has a certain delay because the growth of organisms takes time.

TI  - Metallogenic characteristics and prospecting of granitic pegmatite-type rare metal deposits in the Tugeman area, middle part of Altyn Tagh
T2  - ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The middle part of Altyn Tagh, Ruoqiang County, Xinjiang, is a favorable area for granitic pegmatite-type rare metal mineralization. At present, the Tugeman Be-Li, Tugeman North Li-Be and Washixia South Li-Be deposits have been discovered. Among them, the Tugeman Be-Li and Tugeman North Li-Be ore deposits, occurred in middle and northern part of the Tugeman layered granite, had been evaluated to be medium scale. This paper summarizes types of rare metal granitic pegmatites in the Turgman area, and introduces characteristics and formation ages of the Turgman Be-Li and Turgman North Li-Be deposits. Distribution of granite and granitic pegmatite were revealed based on granitic and pegmatitic spectral information extraction of ASTER remote sensing data. It is pointed out that the Tuoba and Ayag granitic pegmatite groups in the middle part of Tuoba gneissic monzonitic granite and south contact zone of the Ayag biotite-plagioclase granite, respectively, are two potential rare metal prospecting targets. The corresponding dominant rare-metal minerals for the Tugeman Be-Li, Tugeman North Li-Be, and Washixia South Li-Be deposits were beryl, spodumene and lepidolite , respectively. The Tugeman Be-Li granitic pegmatites are characterized by development of K-feldspar, whereas albite crystals are major rock-forming minerals in the Tugeman North Li-Be and Washixia South Li-Be deposits. The Tugeman Be-Li granitic pegmatites were emplaced along some shear fractures or faults with dendritic or echelon shape, some pegmatites contain typical zoning with border aplite zone, intermediate K-feldspar zone, core-margin tourmaline-beryl zone and quartz core. Moreover, the Tugeman BeLi granitic pegmatite deposit was formed in late Middle Ordovician (ca. 460Ma) during post-collision stage of the collision between the Middle Altyn block and Qaidam block after the closure of the southern Altyn Ocean.

TI  - Modeling and assessing agro-hydrological processes and irrigation water saving in the middle Heihe River basin
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use conflicts between agriculture and ecosystem have become a more severe and acute problem in the Heihe River basin (HRB). Excessive irrigation water use in the middle oasis of the HRB has caused gradual deterioration of water quality and eco-environment both in middle and lower HRB. The urgent issue is to make a quantitative analysis and an improvement of irrigation water use in middle oasis. In this paper, distributed agro-hydrological modeling was conducted to access the irrigation water use and potential water-saving in the major irrigation system of middle HRB (MOIS), using the GIS-based SWAP-EPIC model. The modeling work was based on the abundant data from field experiments, remote sensing, surveys and statistics, and previous eco-hydrological studies. The reliability of the distributed simulation was evaluated using the remote sensing data of actual evapotranspiration (ET alpha). Then, spatial distribution of irrigation water depth, ET alpha, deep percolation and crop yield and the related impact factors were systematically analyzed in MOIS. Results indicated that only 53% of total applied water was efficiently used through ET alpha, whereas deep percolation loss and canal conveyance loss accounted for 22% and 25% of the total applied water, respectively. The beneficial water use fraction was still low in MOIS, averaging only 0.70 on field scale and 0.52 on district scale. Water-saving analysis predicted that 15% of irrigation amount could be saved efficiently, with especial emphasis on the rational water allocation and distribution. In addition, our results related to agro-hydrological processes could provide very valuable information for improving the existing watershed hydrological modeling in the HRB.

TI  - Detection of alteration zones using hyperspectral remote sensing data from Dapingliang skarn copper deposit and its surrounding area, Shanshan County, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In application of hyperspectral remote sensing, alteration zones are primarily detected by identifying alteration mineral assemblages, but the interpretation of alteration mineral maps is often complicated by surface materials and by minerals not directly associated with alteration. This study was conducted in the Dapingliang skarn copper deposit and its surrounding area, the Shanshan County of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, China. In order to successfully detect alteration zones associated with skarns, this study identified skarns rather than alteration minerals using field spectra of skarn outcrops. In this study, skarn in pixels was identified from spectral overall shape and spectral shapes of absorption-bands; SAM (spectral angle mapper) was applied in the identification. When SAM scores of spectral overall shape were less than 0.022 rad, the identified skarns were mainly distributed in the contact zones of intrusive rocks and carbonates; in particular, the three identified skarns areas (R1, R2 and R3) were consistent with the skarn areas in the geological map of the study area. The field inspection of skarns showed that the identified objects of the three marked targets (A, B and C) were almost consistent with the ground objects. These obtained results demonstrated that using the field spectra, it was possible to identify skarns in the hyperspectral image. To evaluate the identified skarn zones for use in mineral exploration, the end-member spectra extracted from the image were analysed, and alteration zones were detected using these end-member spectra. Compared with these alteration zones, the identified skarn zones were more reliable for mineral exploration of the study area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Satellite image is an important resource for weather forecast. It can indicate the evolution of weather systems and is beneficial in terms of guiding people to make accurate weather forecasting. However, the use of satellite images is encountered with the dilemma of such as small data volume and of poor real-time performance. Hence it is important to make accurate prediction for satellite images. The goal of satellite image prediction is to predict the next few images of the image sequence. Essentially, it is a a spatiotemporal sequence prediction problem, where the prediction of satellite images is difficult due to its large-scale observation area. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial networks-long short-term memory (GAN-LSTM) model for the satellite image prediction by combining the generating ability of the GAN with the forecasting ability of the LSTM network. For evaluation, we conduct our experiments on the FY-2E satellite cloud maps. In addition, we use a score correct rate (CR) to measure the degree of similarity between predictions and ground truth. Experiment results show that the proposed GAN-LSTM network is capable of efficiently capturing the evolution rules of weather systems, which outperforms the traditional autoencoder-LSTM.

AB  - Crop classification is an important part of national agricultural management, and accurate crop classification is conducive to crop growth monitoring and yield assessment. However, due to the different growing years and regions, even the same crop has different growth processes and different phenological characteristics. Therefore, improving the spatial and temporal adaptability of the classification model is an important research content for large-scale crop classification. In this paper, several adjacent agricultural production areas are studied. Based on the stable time-series remote sensing image dataset, the adaptive changes of several machine learning classification methods with higher classification accuracy in spatial and temporal are studied. The paper selected Sentinel 1 satellite data with good anti-cloud interference and a short return visit cycle for experiments. Firstly, the training of each classification model in the same area is completed, and then the spatial adaptability of the model is studied in different adjacent ranges. Finally, the adaptability of different classification models to the change of the growth cycle of the same type of crop is also compared. The paper finds that the models such as CNN-LSTM and BinConvLSTM perform better in temporal and spatial.

AB  - With the acquisition of remote sensing data, the improvement of image resolution, and the further development of remote sensing application and computer technology, remote sensing has become an important means of land avalanche investigation. Using GIS and spatial database technology, this paper designs and develops the land use dynamic remote sensing monitoring database system. At the same time, the author studies the key technology of the system, and constructs a massive spatial database of land geography. The construction of the platform is mainly divided into two aspects, one is the audit and distribution system on the web side and the other is the mobile side to investigate APP. Web-side system mainly realizes image viewing and verification of investigation results. Through this platform, image data can be efficiently distributed to users in different areas through the network, providing users with the functions of spatial data browsing, query and analysis, and fully sharing data. The effect of data mining and remote sensing technology in land resource management is obvious, which promotes the development of land resource management in the direction of intellectualization and refinement. The data of the research results in this paper will be the basis of land management. By mastering the precise utilization of land resources, we can further improve the precision level of land management and promote the sustainable development of economy and society.

TI  - Optical Classification of the Remote Sensing Reflectance and Its Application in Deriving the Specific Phytoplankton Absorption in Optically Complex Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical water types (OWTs) were identified from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) values in a field-measured dataset of several large lakes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River (LYHR) Basin. Four OWTs were determined from normalized remote sensing reflectance spectra (NRrs(lambda)) using the k-means clustering approach, and were identified in the Sentinel 3A OLCI (Ocean Land Color Instrument) image data over lakes in the LYHR Basin. The results showed that 1) Each OWT is associated with different bio-optical properties, such as the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla), suspended particulate matter (SPM), proportion of suspended particulate inorganic matter (SPIM), and absorption coefficient of each component. One optical water type showed an obvious characteristic with a high contribution of mineral particles, while one type was mostly determined by a high content of phytoplankton. The other types belonged to the optically mixed water types. 2) Class-specific Chla inversion algorithms performed better for all water types, except type 4, compared to the overall dataset. In addition, class-specific inversion algorithms for estimating the Chla-specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 nm (a*(ph)(443)) were developed based on the relationship between a*(ph)(443) and Chla of each OWT. The spatial variations in the class-specific model-derived a*(ph)(443) values were illustrated for 2 March 2017, and 24 October 2017. 3) The dominant water type and the Shannon index (H) were used to characterize the optical variability or similarity of the lakes in the LYHR Basin using cloud-free OLCI images in 2017. A high optical variation was located in the western and southern parts of Lake Taihu, the southern part of Lake Hongze, Lake Chaohu, and several small lakes near the Yangtze River, while the northern part of Lake Hongze had a low optical diversity. This work demonstrates the potential and necessity of optical classification in estimating bio-optical parameters using class-specific inversion algorithms and monitoring of the optical variations in optically complex and dynamic lake waters.

TI  - A parallel fusion method of remote sensing image based on NSCT
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image fusion is very important for playing the advantages of a variety of remote sensing data. However, remote sensing image fusion is large in computing capacity and time consuming. In this paper, in order to fuse remote sensing images accurately and quickly, a parallel fusion algorithm of remote sensing image based on NSCT (nonsubsampled contourlet transform) is proposed. In the method, two important kinds of remote sensing image, multispectral image and panchromatic image are used, and the advantages of parallel computing in high performance computing and the advantages of NSCT in information processing are combined. In the method, based on parallel computing, some processes with large amount of calculation including IHS (Intensity, Hue, Saturation) transform, NSCT, inverse NSCT, inverse IHS transform, etc., are done. To realize the method, multispectral image is processed with IHS transform, and the three components, I, H, and S are gotten. The component I and the panchromatic image are decomposed with NSCT. The obtained low frequency components of NSCT are fused with the fusion rule based on the neighborhood energy feature matching, and the obtained high frequency components are fused with the fusion rule based on the subregion variance. Then the low frequency components and the high frequency components after fusion are processed with the inverse NSCT, and the fused component is gotten. Finally, the fused component, the component H and the component S are processed with the inverse IHS transform, and the fusion image is obtained. The experiment results show that the proposed method can get better fusion results and faster computing speed for multispectral image and panchromatic image.

TI  - Crop Area Identification Based on Time Series EVI2 and Sparse Representation Approach: A Case Study in Shandong Province, China
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely spatial distribution information of various crop types is vital for food security. In this study, the 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were combined with sparse representation approach to identify the distribution of various crop types in Shandong Province, China. Three groups of input variables derived from EVI2 including annual time series EVI2 (TS), harmonic features (HF), and combined vector formed by harmonic features and texture features (HFT) were used. The online dictionary learning and orthogonal matching pursuit algorithms were applied to generate the dictionary and solve the sparse coefficients of the identified samples, respectively. Then, the label of the identified samples can be obtained according to the minimum residuals between the dictionary and the sparse coefficients of the identified samples. At the provincial level, the validation based on the statistical data showed that three groups of input variables presented lower than +/- 25% at relative errors, and input variables of HFT performed better than the other two. At the municipal level, the results achieved by using input variables of HFT also agreed well with the statistics with the coefficient of determination R-2 > 0.85 for wheat and maize, as well as R-2 > 0.71 for peanut and cotton during 2014-2016. These results demonstrate that the combination of the input variables of HFT derived from time series MODIS EVI2 data and sparse representation approach can be used for crop identification in the study area.

TI  - Identifying crop planting areas using Fourier-transformed feature of time series MODIS leaf area index and sparse-representation-based classification in the North China Plain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information of crop distribution is vital for agricultural industry and food security, which gives rise to a strong demand for timely crop mapping. This study applies a method that combines sparse representation and harmonic characteristics derived from time series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) to identify crop planting areas to the north of the Yellow River in the North China Plain, where winter wheat and maize are widely cultivated. The upper envelope Savitzky-Golay filter was applied on the yearly time series MODIS LAI pixel by pixel to minimize the effects of anomalous values caused by atmospheric variability and cloud contamination. The Fourier transform method was then employed to extract the key parameters from the Savitzky-Golay filtered LAI. Totally about 11 parameters were extracted, including the amplitudes of the terms 0-5 and the phases of the terms 1-5 of the Savitzky-Golay filtered LAI, and were taken as the features for the crop identification. Based on the training samples of the identified crops, which were obtained through field campaigns and Google Earth images, the online dictionary learning algorithm was applied to construct the dictionary for identifying the crops. With the dictionary, orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm was applied to obtain sparse representation coefficients of the identified samples. Then crops were identified using the minimum reconstruction errors which were calculated by the dictionary and the sparse representation coefficients of each category. Winter wheat, spring maize, summer maize, cotton, and orchard planting areas from 2003 to 2016 in the study area were identified. The accuracy of the identification was evaluated by the confusion matrix. Average overall identification accuracy in the 14years was 78.67%, with a kappa coefficient () of 0.75. Annual overall accuracy from 2003 to 2016 was from 70.57% to 83.71%, and were from 0.66 to 0.81. These results indicate that the accuracy of crop identification is high. Compared with traditional classification methods, such as supervised classification, the approach developed in this study is feasible and efficient for identifying crop distribution in the study area. Repeated and expensive ground sampling year after year is not needed, which effectively reduces computation cost. The findings of this study can provide valuable implications for crop condition monitoring and yield estimation in the region.

AB  - Lacustrine wetlands are wetlands always associated with lakes and play a major role in functioning of landscape, water and nutrients cycle, water purification, rich biodiversity and provide a wide array of useful and appreciated ecosystem services. Variation in quantity of water in lake is one of the most important criteria to understand its utilization and pressure it might be facing due to over exploitation by various sources. Among various Ramsar lakes, the lakes existing in the lesser Himalayan region are more prone to degradation as they occur in one of the most fragile zone. This creates a need to study such lakes to know the present scenario and also to identify the factors leading to its deterioration. This study aimed to analyses the variation in the water quantity and extent of Ramsar lakes in lesser Himalayan region and also, understanding utilization and application of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). In this study, two Ramsar lakes (Renuka lake and Pong Dam lake) in the lesser Himalayan region were identified. To study the variation, LANDSAT images were analyzed and NDWI for each was calculated on ArcGIS interface. Study suggests that remote sensing proves to be the best tool in detecting and monitoring of the lakes in the Himalayan region which are located at high altitude and rugged terrain conditions. Results also outlined that adapting remote sensing techniques will be helpful in studying and efficiently suggesting best management practices for the wetlands which are in need of conservation or already are being conserved.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a is an optically active compound (OAC) commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass in an aquatic environment. Retrieving the concentration of chlorophyll-a remains a challenge due to the presence of several OAC particularly in water bodies which are in proximity to the land-based activities. In this study, an effort has been made to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration of both the freshwater Lake Biwa and the coastal water of Wakasa Bay in Japan. A spectral decomposition algorithm was used to determine the chlorophyll-a using the satellite images. The algorithm was applied to the satellite images from two different sensors namely Landsat-8 /OLI and Sentinel-2A/MSI. The satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration for the lake and coastal water from two different sensors were compared to assess the performance of both the sensors. The accuracy of the chlorophyll-a results derived from the images was evaluated with the in-situ measurement data of the chlorophyll-a for the Lake Biwa and the coastal water of Wakasa Bay. Both satellite sensors appear to give the best results for the coastal water (R-2 > 0.80) with an RMSE < 0.3 mu g/L. However, slight underestimation of chlorophyll-a noted for the Landsat-8 image with an increase in chlorophyll-a concentration. For the lake water, Sentinel-2A results were relatively better (R-2 > 0.70) than Landsat-8, with an RMSE of < 1.0 mu g/L. The obtained results will be useful to evaluate the primary productivity of both freshwater and coastal water body.

AB  - Soil moisture(SM) is a key parameter to study the land - atmosphere interfaces in term of agriculture, meteorology and hydrology to understand the cycle of evaporation and drought mechanism. In this study, a semi-empirical model i.e. water cloud model (WCM) was used to estimate the SM in the area of Varanasi district, India using C- band Sentinel -1A SAR data. In this regards three type of vegetation descriptors (LWAI, LAI and) were chosen in WCM to check the potential of inversion scheme. WCM parameterization was done using non-linear least square optimization algorithm. The statistical analysis in the case of V-1 = V-2 = f(veg) indicated high correlation between the estimated SM with the in-situ observation (R-2 = 0.847, RMSE = 3.23). Therefore, the vegetation descriptor i.e. computed from Landsat-8 satellite data was found better in WCM for the estimation of SM more accurately.

AB  - Unlike other natural disasters, drought is a reoccurring and region-wide phenomenon after being triggered by a prolonged precipitation deficiency. Considering that remote sensing products provide consistent temporal and spatial measurements of precipitation, this study developed a remote sensing data-based drought outlook model. The meteorological drought was defined by the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) achieved from PERSIANN_CDR, TRMM 3B42 and GPM IMERG images. Bayesian networks were employed in this study to combine the historical drought information and dynamical prediction products in advance of drought outlook. Drought outlook was determined through a decision-making model considering the current drought condition and forecasted condition from the Bayesian networks. Drought outlook condition was classified by four states such as no drought, drought occurrence, drought persistence, and drought removal. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis were employed to measure the relative outlook performance with the dynamical prediction production, Multi-Model Ensemble (MME). The ROC analysis indicated that the proposed outlook model showed better performance than the MME, especially for drought occurrence and persistence of 2- and 3-month outlook.

TI  - The Feasibility of Using Vegetation Indices and Soil Texture to Predict Rice Yield
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying plant-environment interactions along with remote sensing provides grounds for designing management methods as well as predicting rice yield in different conditions; accordingly, it is very helpful to use vegetation indices for identifying the vegetation and greenness of farms. The regression between the local and high-yield varieties of rice in 2012 and the NDVI, SAVI, LAI, DVI, and RVI indices derived from Landsat 7 in northern Iran indicate the superiority of the NDVI index in the flowering stage of rice. Results show that the coefficient of determination of the fitted model for local and high-yielding varieties is 0.71 and 0.70, respectively, which indicates the good consistency of the results with the regional data. We evaluated the models for the local and high-yielding varieties in crop year 2013 with RMSE of 406 and 272 kg ha(-1) and NRMSE of 12% and 6%, respectively. Moreover, the simulation results show that the yield of the models is well fitted with the observed values; besides, there is high correlation (R>0.80) between the real and predicted yield values. As shown by the investigation of the region's soil texture, the fine-texture paddy fields have better yield.

AB  - This contribution will present the investigations carried out with stacked time-series of TOPS acquisitions to retrieve azimuth displacements. The exploitation of the burst overlapping areas allows to retrieve highly accurate ground displacement estimates in that direction, mitigating the limited performance of classical correlation techniques, due to the low resolution of the mode. The focus of this contribution is the application to time-series of Sentinel-1 data, where slow azimuthal motion is expected. Results with Sentinel-1 data on the proposed methodology are provided for the region of Balochistan, in Pakistan.

AB  - The basic problems and trends in the development of modern systems for the reception, storage and real-time processing of satellite data are considered. Abrupt increase in the capability of satellite systems, significant increase in the amount of satellite information and its availability, the development of data processing and presentation technologies, and the use of web technologies are discussed. Data sources of modern remote sensing systems of the Earth and the features of their practical use are considered. It is concluded that the most effective way to obtain real-time information from meteorological satellites are satellite stations that receive data in the X-band at a frequency of 8 GHz. The performance characteristics and capabilities of the equipment of the new satellite receiving complex at Krasnoyarsk Science Center are given. Use of up-to-date computer equipment (high-performance servers and storage systems, local area network with a bandwidth of 10 Gbit/s) and logical separation into the stages of data conversion (data reception, primary and thematic processing) provide the construction of a modern scalable data-processing system for remote sensing data. The paper presents the results of the work on creation of specialized software for information and analytical systems for real-time satellite monitoring.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to contribute to Turkish tuna fishing fleet management. In this context; The Turkish Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus Linnaeus, 1785) fishing fleet in our territorial waters and international waters in the Eastern Mediterranean were monitored on a spatio-temporal basis and a continuous monitoring model for BFT stock was established. Archival data sets of Bluefin Tuna (BFT) 2010-2016 spatial-temporal migration and remote sensing data sets of traces of fishing vessels and environmental factors (SST and Chl-a) were included in the model. Statistical analysis of the model was performed using Geographical Information System (GIS) based-approach and the results were presented on thematic maps. On the other hand, the importance of the announcement of The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for BFT fishing in Eastern Mediterranean was addressed in the study. Accordingly, the possibility of 'Turkey's Exclusive Economic Zone' announcement in Mediterranean Sea and its borders were discussed.

AB  - This paper reports prompt space-borne ALOS-2 SAR observation results of Hokkaido-Ibuii-Tobu earthquake on 2018/09/06. Emphasis is placed on quick survey for disaster monitoring using fully polarimetric data. On 2018/09/08, ALOS-2 has acquired data over the disaster area. By comparison of the previous data (2017/08/26) before the earthquake, damaged areas by landslides are clearly detected. The analysis is based on the scattering power decomposition, which retrieves scattering mechanism change from bare soil surface caused by landslide and serves to identify the landslide location. The decomposition and anisotropy images are presented to show the effectiveness of fully polarimetric SAR sensing from space.

AB  - Spaceborne remotely sensed data can provide the spatial, spectral, and temporal coverage for earth monitoring. Radiometric calibration is indispensable for the accurate higher level products derived from satellite optical sensors, and the long-term radiometric calibration has a crucial role. Especially, vicarious calibration is currently the most accurate method to conduct the radiometric calibration of satellite optical sensors. Various organization and projects have been conducting the vicarious calibration experiments for satellite optical sensors. Railroad valley playa is the most popular calibration site, and we have been also acquiring the vicarious calibration data for Terra ASTER there from the past. Recently, RadCalNet (Radiometric Calibration Network) is open to the public, which is an initiative of the CEOS WGCV. Railroad valley is also one of the RadCalNet sites, and our calibration site is located at the adjacent area. Understanding the cloud cover characteristics over calibration test sites is very important for vicarious calibration and automated facilities measurement. This research evaluates the clear sky ratio for Railroad valley playa using Terra an Aqua MODIS cloud mask product (MOD35_L2 and MYD35_L2) since 2000.

AB  - This is a commentary on 'The Principle of the New World Order', a geopolitical essay written by Japanese Philosopher, Kitaro Nishida in 1944. This essay has been a source of postwar controversy over the philosophical justification of Japan's involvement in the Second World War and the relationship between Japanese thoughts and Western colonial domination in Asia. As a text of Japanese formal geopolitics, the essay is a historical example to illustrate how Japanese academics geopolitically situated their country and themselves within the imperial rivalry during the War. The essay attracted not only criticisms that problematized Nishida's approach to politics (imperialism and nationalism) and justification of the War, but also positive reviews that appreciated his proposal of a multicultural worldview countering Western modernity (i.e. the world dominated by the West). The translation of the essay is not easy to read but contains important insights into how to see the current world (dis)order under hegemonic powers.

TI  - DEM correction to the TVDI method on drought monitoring in karst areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is one of the key parameters in the study of global climate change, water, and energy exchanges at both the land surface and atmospheric interface and drought and acidification measure. The temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) is an effective index from optical remote sensing imagery to monitor regional surface soil moisture status. Due to the disturbance of multiple factors, the coefficients of determination (R-2) of the dry and wet edge of the surface temperature - normalized difference vegetation index (-NDVI) feature space of the traditional TVDI method are quite low and unstable in karst area. Therefore, this article developed an improved -NDVI feature space by conducting elevation correction to the land surface temperature () to monitor soil moisture in the karst area of Guangxi, China. After digital elevation model (DEM) correction, the coefficients of determination of the wet edge were improved obviously. The drought distribution of Guangxi in spring and autumn of 2009 were analysed using the modified -NDVI space of the TVDI method (MTVDI) and verified by the in situ data. The results showed that the MTVDI can reasonably reflect the distribution of soil moisture in the study area, and the drought expression is in line with the in situ data and the actual situation.

AB  - The dominant scattering mechanism is of great significance for the application of ground objects classification and target detection. It can also verify the quality of the polarimetric data by check the dominant scattering mechanism of known ground objects. In order to improve the application performance, this paper studies the dominant scattering mechanism of GF-3 typical ground objects based on a large number of data slices. The GF-3 fully polarimetric data slices are classified based on the MODIS global classification map, and the GF-3 slice library of typical ground objects is constructed. Based on large amounts of GF-3 samples, we carry out the statistical analysis of dominant scattering mechanism separation results for typical GF-3 ground objects (building, woodland, cultivated land, grassland and waters) of by means of h/alpha/A decomposition. The quantitative results reveal the polarimetric scattering feature of different ground objects, and provide reference for fully polarimetric SAR application.

AB  - Land-surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models are used for the description of surface bidirectional effects and the estimation of surface albedo. The semi-empirical linear kernel-driven BRDF model is one of them which has been adopted by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) operational BRDF/Albedo algorithm, due to its briefness and well-fitting ability. However, this model does not consider the topography factors, and will lead to errors over rugged terrains. However, researches seldom analyze the models' uncertainties caused by rugged terrains quantitatively, as it is difficult to directly validate models over mountain areas at coarse resolution. This letter proposes a forward topographic BRDF simulation method by combining a canopy radiative transfer model (SAILH) and a mountain radiative transfer (MRT) model to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of the kernel-driven model over mountain areas theoretically. Results show that the topographic effects can cause over 20% uncertainties on both red and NIR bands. Topography leads to the asymmetry of BRDF distributions on azimuth, which cannot be captured by kernel-driven model at 1km scale. Both DEM types and observation situations influence the retrieval accuracy significantly. Therefore, this work is meaningful to study the optimal inversion scale and observation requirements depending on the topography.

AB  - Under the interferometric wide swath (IW) mode, the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) incidence angles vary from 29.0 degrees at the near range to 46.0 degrees at the far range. When the side-looking SAR datasets are used in the rugged terrain, the observable areas are functions of the SAR incidence angle and the local slopes and aspects. Thus, the application of the data is influenced. In this study, the 2017 Xinmo landslide event is used to demonstrate the influence. Before the landslide event, the observable areas at the initial landslide zone varied from 200,000 m(2) at the incidence angle of 29.0 degrees to 80,000 m(2) at the incidence angle of 46.0 degrees. The reduction of the observable area should be significant. In the extreme case, the visible area might become too small such that the InSAR-derived result could not be reliable. Caution should be exercised. Finally, knowing the observable area should complement the InSAR analyses of the coherence, interferograms, surface deformation rate, and deformation through time.

AB  - Urban planning starts with the selection of suitable sites. The main factors and components for site selection are the geological-geotechnical parameters that directly affect the natural hazards, such as landslide and flood, construction costs and the location and distribution of existing infrastructure. The presence and accuracy of up-to-date maps in planning are very important. With the increase of high resolution Earth observation satellites, the required data can be obtained with high temporal frequency and spatial availability. From these data, the base parameters for planning can be extracted with semi- or fully-automatic methods. Among the Earth observation satellites, the Sentinel-2 mission of European Space Agency (ESA) provides high resolution optical images and the data are freely available also at different processing levels such as orthorectified images.In this study, the possibility of the landslide susceptibility map production which should be one of the base maps in urban planning by using Sentinel-2 satellite images was investigated in Mamak District of Ankara City, Turkey. The land cover and land use data were produced from Sentinel-2 images by using a supervised classification method in SNAP Tool provided by ESA. The lithological definitions were received from the General Directorate of Mineral Research and Explorations. The topographical parameters such as slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, etc. were extracted from a high resolution digital terrain model (DTM) of the area. Manually extracted landslide inventory data were employed in the logistic regression method and the produced landslide susceptibility map of the study area is presented here.

AB  - A suspended 400nm thin mono-crystalline ZY cut Lithium Niobate (LN) membrane with narrow interdigital electrodes (IDEs) on top having a pitch of the order of few microns excites standing shear bulk acoustic wave resonance (XBAR) within the membrane through lateral field excitation. Recently the first XBAR was simulated and demonstrated experimentally with a resonance frequency of 4800MHz having high electromechanical coupling of about 25% and loaded quality factor at resonance close to 500.This device lays the path to production of RF filters for 5G applications close to 5GHz with low losses and large bandwidth. This work aims to study behavior of the A1 XBAR mode and its higher order lateral harmonics (A1-3, A1-5...) as a function of thickness, pitch and material properties. They are studied with respect to design parameters in order to eliminate spurious modes close to the intended filter band, increase electromechanical coupling and establish guidelines for resonator design.

AB  - Using remote sensing technology to extract winter wheat planting area can provide an effective way and reliable data for macroeconomic decision-making of agricultural economy. The cooperation of Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B can achieve a five-day visit cycle, and more phenology information can be obtained when monitoring winter wheat. However, at present, Chinese users can only download Sentinel Level-1C data, Level-2 data need to be produced and processed by users themselves. The data downloading and processing is more troublesome. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud platform provided by Google for online visual calculation and analysis of a large number of global-scale geoscientific data. The platform can not only access the data from satellite images and other earth observation databases, including the level-2 products of Sentinel data, but also provide enough computing power to process these data, which greatly simplifies the time of data downloading and processing, and improves the efficiency of winter wheat area monitoring. Based on GEE platform and Sentinel 2 data, the time series of winter wheat in growing season was constructed. The winter wheat planting area in Shandong Province from 2018 to 2019 was monitored through the characteristics of the actual phenology period in the time series. The monitoring results were verified by more than 6000 ground sample zones collected in 2018 distributed throughout the province. The results showed that the extraction technology of winter wheat planting area in this paper could be achieved to 92.45%.

AB  - The dielectric constant reflects the radiation, scattering, absorption and transmission characteristics of electromagnetic waves. In this paper, the Xingcheng area of Liaoning Province was selected as the research area, and the ALOS PALSAR fully polarized synthetic aperture radar data was used to carry out the dielectric constant inversion of surface media in the study area. Since different microwave scattering models are suitable for different degrees of surface roughness scale range, the perturbation model is suitable for relatively smooth surface, and the Oh model is applicable to a wide range of roughness, so it was proved through inversion that the selected model was applicable to the corresponding research area in terms of roughness degree. The existing perturbation model involves many parameters, which is inconvenient to calculate. During the research, it was found that the inversion process could be simplified by the ratio calculation of the horizontal polarization backscattering coefficient equation and the vertical polarization backscattering coefficient equation. After taking the permeability as constant 1, the model only showed the relationship between the polarizability, wave number, incident angle and relative dielectric constant. Finally, comparing the regional lithologic geological map, it was found that the dielectric constant inversion result of the Oh model was better for the red granite. It was also proved that the Oh model could be used for relative dielectric constant inversion in shallow overburden area.

TI  - Simulating and forecasting spatio-temporal characteristic of land-use/cover change with numerical model and remote sensing: a case study in Fuxian Lake Basin, China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-use/cover (LUC) change (LUCC) in small-scale basins can strongly impact regional environments and developments, and understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of LUCC is important for sustainable development planning. This study explored the spatio-temporal characteristics of China's Fuxian Lake Basin in 2017-2067, which may provide decision-making support for ecological and environmental protection measures. Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI images combined with a cellular automata-Markov model were used to simulate and forecast LUCC, and expand analysis and reduce analysis methods were applied to explore the spatio-temporal patterns of LUCC in this basin. The results showed that in 2017-2067: (1) arable land, forestland and water would be expected to expand; (2) garden, grassland, building region, road, structure, artificial piling and digging land, and desert and bare surface would contract; (3) the rate of arable land expansion in 2032-2037 and the rate of grassland loss in 2057-2062 would be the largest changes, reaching 1.670 and 0.856km(2)/year, respectively and (4) the expansion and contraction of different LUCC classes were closely related to the Four Retire Three Return policy implemented by the local government. Therefore, the protection measures for environment should be set in advance according to the forecasting results of this study.

TI  - Ground deformation and fissure activity in Datong basin, China 2007-2010 revealed by multi-track InSAR
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The Datong basin is one of the complex geologic environments in China. Several faults are distributed in the basin, and a number of hidden faults have been discovered within the basin. Ground fissures (GFs) and land subsidence occur in this region. In the past, ground subsidence at Datong basin has been studied using groundwater level records, intermittent small-scale levelling measurements and field investigations. However, due to the low spatial resolution and temporal sampling of these records, detailed ground deformation within the basin remains poorly understood. In this study, we exploited Envisat ASAR and ALOS PALSAR images to map the ground deformation between 2007 and 2010. Most of the deformation within the basin occurred at rates of <20 mm/year. In addition to the subsidence due to coal mining in the western mountainous areas, at least four large subsidence zones could be detected. Our analysis indicates that the ground subsidence is affected by groundwater extraction and the distribution of faults. Additionally, the vertical deformation is much larger than the deformation in the east-west direction. Obvious deformation gradients occurred on individual GFs and the activity of the GFs varied spatially. Finally, Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations related to groundwater exploitation and GFs were modelled and discussed.

AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, the impact of human activities on the ecological landscape pattern has become more and more serious. The contradiction between population, resources and ecological environment become more noticeable. The monitoring and evaluation of urban ecological pattern is of great significance for sustainable development, and provides decision-making basis for urban construction department on ecological construction and urban and rural planning.The ecological corridor between the ecological control lines is a region with relatively severe changes. The establishment of an ecological corridor is important for landscape ecological planning, and it is an important measure to solve the landscape fragmentation caused by the current human activities and the numerous environmental problems.In this paper, we use high-resolution remote sensing satellite data, combined with the ecological community classification method of projection pursuit, taking Shenzhen as an example, effectively construct the ecological corridor landscape index, analyze the corridor function, and evaluate the importance of various ecological corridors. The research results provide a scientific guide for urban planning and ecological protection.

AB  - Remote sensing images are often affected by severe stripe noise, which degrades image quality. In this paper, a destriping method is proposed with the multi-scale variation model on the basis of stripe noise analysis. First, the stripe noise model is established. Then, the multi-scale energy function is constructed with the unidirectional characteristics of stripe noise. Last, the function is optimized with the split Bregman approach, and the destriped image is obtained by the accumulation of the component in each scale. Experimental results on MODIS level 1B data show that the image quality and quantitative evaluation index can be improved. Compared with the typical destriping method, the proposed method is proved to remove stripe noise effectively while preserve detail information.

TI  - Mapping Regional Forest Management Units: A Road-based Framework in Southeastern Coastal Plain and Piedmont
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Software
AB  - Management practices are one of the most important factors affecting forest structure and function. Landowners in the Southeastern US Coastal Plain and Piedmont (SEUS) manage forests using appropriately sized areas, to meet management objectives that include economic return, sustainability, and esthetic enjoyment. Road networks spatially designate the socio-environmental elements for SEUS forests, which represented and aggregated as forest management units. Road networks are widely used for managing forests by setting logging roads and firebreaks. We propose that common types of forest management are practiced in road-delineated units that can be determined by remote sensing satellite imagery coupled with crowd-sourced road network datasets. Satellite sensors do not always capture road-caused canopy openings, so it is difficult to delineate ecologically relevant units based only on satellite data. By integrating citizen-based road networks with the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), we mapped road-delineated management units across the regional landscape and analyzed the size frequency distribution of management units. We found the road-delineated units smaller than 0.5 Ha comprised 64% of the number of units, but only 0.98% of the total forest area. We also applied a statistical similarity test (Warrens I) to access the equivalency of road-delineated units with forest disturbances. The outputs showed that the whole SEUS has the probability of road-delineated unit of 0.44 and production forests overlapped significantly with disturbance areas with an average probability of 0.50.

AB  - This paper aims to compare the performance of GaoFen-1 (GF-1), GaoFen-5 (GF-5), Landsat-8 data in fine classification. An optimized sample selection method (OSSM) is developed to ensure the high quality of samples. This method adopts different band combination strategies to realize optimal selection of training samples under the aid of normalized vegetation index (NDVI), normalized water index (NDWI) and the components of Kauth-Thomas (KT) Transformation. After that, support vector machine (SVM) is implemented on these three types of data. Experimental results on China Dunhuang calibration field, Gansu Ying-mao-tuo exploration area and Gan River lower reaches datasets show that GF-5 data performs best in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of fine classification thanks to its hyperspectral properties.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Currently, effective detection and treatment of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) still face severe challenges. Ultrasound molecular imaging as a noninvasive and easy-to-operate method is expected to bring improvements for tumor detection.Purpose: The aim of this research is to prepare novel phase-change ultrasound contrast agents, Nds-IR780, which can perform not only dual-mode molecule-targeted imaging but also targeted photothermal therapy for CMM.Methods: A double emulsion process was used to prepare the Nds-IR780. Then, the entrapment rate and drug loading of IR-780 iodide in Nds-IR780 were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. The biocompatibility of Nds-IR780 was evaluated by a CCK-8 assay and the characteristics and stability of that were verified through the particle size analyzer, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The abilities of dual-mode molecule-targeted imaging and targeted photothermal therapy for Nds-18780 were confirmed via the in vitro and in vivo experiments.Results: Nds-IR780 had good size distribution, polydispersity index, stability and biosafety. The in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that Nds-IR780 were capable of targeting CMM cells with high affinity (22.4 +/- 3.2%) and facilitating dual-mode imaging to detect the primary lesion and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) of CMM. Furthermore, the photothermal ablation of CMM mediated by Nds-IR780 was very effective in vivo.Conclusion: The newly prepared Nds-IR780 were observed to be effective targeted theranostic probe for the precise detection and targeted treatment of CMM.

TI  - Fractional vegetation cover change based on vegetation seasonal variation correction : A case in Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing change detection based on fractional vegetation cover (FVC) has become an important way in the research of vegetation and related ecosystems. It is difficult to meet the requirement for optical remote sensing in subtropical areas because of cloudy/rainy weather conditions. Using images from different seasons in the vegetation change detection will inevitably lead to errors in the change detection results due to the seasonal difference. To overcome this problem, we proposed a method 14 correcting vegetation seasonal variations by taking advantage of high temporal resolution advantage of MODIS remote sensing data and the high spatial resolution of remote sensing data. Based on the relationship between MODIS vegetation data in different seasons via regression analysis, we transformed the vegetation information of the high resolution images of corresponding years to the required season of the years. The method was applied in the Aojiang basin area of Lianjiang County in Fujian Province, China, with good results of vegetation information transformation. The results showed that after transforming vegetation information of the 2007 winter scene and 2013 spring scene of high resolution images to those of summer season, the FVC was enhanced from 66.5% to 79.7% for 2007, and from 58.6% to 77.9% for 2013. Our method effectively removed the seasonal difference of FVC and improved the accuracy of the FVC-based change detection results.

TI  - Temporal-spatial variations and influencing factors of Lakes in inland arid areas from 2000 to 2017: a case study in Xinjiang
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are the most important water resource in arid and semi-arid regions and are good indicators of climate change. The study of lake expansion and contraction can reveal important information about climate change and regional responses. In this study, MOD09A1 global surface reflectance data of MODIS are used to extract the water areas of 12 main lakes in Xinjiang using a support vector machine method to investigate the temporal-spatial dynamics and driving factors of lake area variations between 2000 and 2017. The results indicate that (1) In general, the Xinjiang lakes exhibited large fluctuations between 2000 and 2017; the area of the lakes shrunk by 16.98 km(2)/year during 2007-2009 but expanded by 80.67 km(2)/year after 2010. (2) The changes in the Xinjiang lakes exhibited obvious spatial differences. There were strong fluctuations in the areas of the Tail-end lakes and the K value describing the degree of fluctuation in the lake area was 0.2%. The fluctuations in the areas of the Mountain lakes were more stable with a K value of 0.09% and the area of the Plateau lakes increased every year, with an annual increase of 19.90 km(2). (3) The lakes with the larger fluctuations in the area were Ebinur Lake, Manasi Lake, and Barkol Lake, and the range of the areas was 370.85, 276.55, and 61.5 km(2), respectively. Because of the regional diversity of Xinjiang, the driving forces that affect the area of the lakes differ in different areas. The main factors affecting the lake area change in the Tail-end lakes are the amount of inflowing water and the water use by agriculture and animal husbandry. The main reason for the stability of the Mountain lakes is the balance between water inflow and outflow. The main factor contributing to the expansion of the Plateau lakes area is the abundant supply of glacier/snow melt water. Overall, the main factor contributing to the expansion of Plateau lakes area is abundant glacier snow melt water supply. On the whole, the main factors affecting the temporal and spatial variation of the lake areas in Xinjiang are precipitation (r = .67, p = .003 < .01), temperature (r = .611, p = .007 < .01), and the increase in cultivated land area (r = -.021, p = .004 < .01).

TI  - Potential of soil moisture estimation using C-band polarimetric SAR data in arid regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays an important role in various applications such as hydrology, agronomy, climatology and ecology. Over the past few decades, images acquired by PolSAR (Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar) systems have raised much interest in the remote sensing community. However, only a few studies have analysed the potential use of polarimetric parameters for the estimation of soil moisture. Taking Juyanze as the study area, two feature extraction methods, the simple polarimetric intensity and phase processing, and the polarimetric decomposition were used to extract different polarimetric parameters. The response of single, multiple, and combined polarimetric parameters to bare surface soil moisture was investigated based on linear and non-linear regression strategies in using fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery and field measurements. The results indicate that each individual polarimetric parameter at C-band is not very sensitive to surface soil moisture under this investigation. However, with the increasing number of polarimetric parameters, the correlation between soil moisture and polarimetric parameters improves steadily and the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) decreased gradually. Combined polarimetric parameters have little improvement on the correlation between soil moisture and polarimetric parameters. The non-linear regression method can improve the correlation to some extent. However, the preliminary results so far still do not satisfy the accuracy of using the polarimetric parameters to inverse soil moisture. Further investigations are required in the direction of a better characterization and exploitation of polarimetric SAR data for the retrieval of soil moisture in arid regions.

AB  - The availability of high-resolution remote sensing data has created opportunities to gain new information about urban infrastructure. Here, high resolution ortho-imagery with three bands and maximum likelihood classification of images is used to obtain information about roads and pavement (i.e. transportation related) infrastructure. The cities of Phoenix, Arizona (for the years 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012) and Seattle, Washington (for 2002, 2005, 2009) were analyzed. We discuss the implications and utility of this (and other infrastructure) data for constructing metrics for urban growth and environmental sustainability.

TI  - Near Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Trioctahedral Chlorites and Its Remote Sensing Application
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The mineral chemistry of twenty chlorite samples from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) spectral library and two other regions, having a wide range of Fe and Mg contents and relatively constant Al and Si contents, was studied via infrared (IR) spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. Five absorption features of the twenty samples near 4525, 4440, 4361, 4270, and 4182 cm(-1) were observed, and two diagnostic features at 4440 and 4280 cm(-1) were recognized. Assignments of the two diagnostic features were made for two combination bands ((nu+delta)((AIAI)O-OH) and (nu+delta)((SiAI)O-OH) ) by regression with IR fundamental absorptions. Furthermore, the determinant factors of the NIR band position were found by comparing the band positions with relative components. The results showed that Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg) values are negatively correlated with the two NIR combination bands. The findings provide an interpretation of the NIR band formation and demonstrate a simple way to use NIR spectroscopy to discriminate between chlorites with different components. More importantly, spectroscopic detection of mineral chemical variations in chlorites provides geologists with a tool with which to collect information on hydrothermal alteration zones from hyperspectral-resolution remote sensing data.

AB  - The satellite communication network has the advantage of wide coverage and is one of the important development directions of fifth generation network. The traditional satellite data processing method is to transmit data to the ground data center for processing. There are problems such as large bandwidth pressure for the satellite link and poor real-time performance. Facing the increasing demand for on-board computing in satellite networks, building a flexible space-based edge system is an effective means to solve this problem. In this paper, SoC FPGA (System on Chip Field Programmable Gate Array) is proposed as a computing resource of the space-based edge network, and a unified service interface is provided for users. To maximize FPGA resource utilization, we studied the elastic scaling mechanism of FPGA resources. Finally, the computational performance and power consumption efficiency of the SoC FPGA computing platform are verified by experiments.

AB  - With the development of space satellite technology, a large number of high resolution remote sensing images have emerged. Deep learning has become an effective way to handle big data. Crop classification can estimate crop planting area and structure, and classification result is an important input parameter for crop yield model. Crop classification based on deep learning can further improve the estimation accuracy of production. In this paper, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and GF-2 data are used as data sources. Sentinel-2 data is used as training data, and GF-2 data is used as validation data. Jilin Province in Northeast of China is selected as the experimental area. The experimental area is classified as rice, towns, corn and soy. Firstly, the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and GF-2 data is preprocessed. Then, the Sentinel-2 data is used to classify crops based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and visual geometry group (VGG). The red edge band, multiple indexes including normalization difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and difference vegetation index (DVI) are added respectively to compare with the classification results of original multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. The final classification results using CNN and VGG are compared with the other two machine learning algorithms including support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The experimental results show that the VGG performs best in crop classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy of the crop can reach 94.8878%, and the Kappa coefficient can reach 0.9253, which is superior to the two traditional machine learning algorithms.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - A novel method for dense matching for DSM generation is presented in this paper. First, a global energy function that contains matching cost and smoothness constraint is constructed, and then multiple candidates for disparity of each pixel are obtained by solving the global energy function, where multipath dynamic programming (MDP) is employed. Subsequently, a reliability measure is proposed, which evaluates the reliability of a given candidate and is calculated by Par-zen estimation. The candidate with the highest reliability is selected as the final disparity for a given pixel. Moreover, postprocessing steps for removing outliers and the interpolation of gaps are presented to refine the disparity result. Consequently, forward intersection is employed to generate DSM with the disparity result. The complexity of this method is linear to the number of pixels and independent of the disparityrange, which is the reason for generating disparity result in a short time. The experiment conducted on ZY-3 imagery demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

TI  - Finer Scale Mapping with Super Resolved GF-4 Satellite Images
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - High-resolution (HR) remote sensing images are characterized by rich and detailed ground object information with more complex structures of the ground object which make the interference information is more difficult to process. It has always been the focus of domestic and foreign researchers that how to obtain more accurate and higher quality ground object information from these images. The GF-4, the world's first geostationary orbit with high spatial resolution remote sensing satellite, can provide high temporal resolution, large width and 50m pixel resolution of remote sensing data by using area array imaging technology. However, the GF-4 image is a medium resolution and low resolution (LR) image data with relatively vague details of ground objects and not obvious relationships between objects which limit the acquisition of the ground object information to some extent. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the influence of various factors in the imaging process and construct an image degradation model according to the characteristics of GF-4 satellite images. We adopted the super resolved (SR) method based on Mixed sparse representations (MSR) to increase the spatial resolution of the GF-4 image by twice as much, which not only enriched the detailed information of the image, but also improved the image quality. For the results of SR of GF-4 imagery, we adopted the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) method to perform image classification test and result verification. The experimental area selected in this paper is Yantai City, Shandong Province, China, the LANDSAT 8 OLI data is used as a training sample to calculate the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient after classification. The results show that the overall accuracy of the super-reconstructed result data is 40% higher than that of the source image data from GF-4, especially when the spectral characteristics of the ground objects are obviously different, the accuracy is more obvious. The Kappa coefficient increased 0.4, the extracted outline is more complete and the classification details are more refined.

TI  - Fractional Woody Cover Mapping of Texas Savanna at Landsat Scale
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Texas savanna experienced substantial woody plant encroachment during the past several decades, resulting in habitat fragmentation and species loss. A detailed map of woody plant abundance and distribution in this area is critically needed for management purpose. This study endeavors to map the fractional woody cover of Texas savanna at Landsat scale (30 m) in an affordable way. The top of atmosphere reflectance, thermal bands, and NDVI layer of Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) of 2012 were used as predictors, together with mean annual precipitation. Classification and Regression Trees (CART) were calibrated against training data of a whole range of fractional woody cover, which were derived from 1-m resolution digital orthophotos of 2012. Validation indicates a reasonable pixel level accuracy of the result fractional woody cover map, with a R-squared value of 0.45. Moreover, the result map clearly depicts the distribution of woody plants across the study area, as reflected by the orthophotos. Furthermore, this new map proves an improvement over the existing Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover product. The method developed here, combining remote sensing and statistical techniques, can contribute to savanna management through revealing the abundance and distribution of woody plants.

AB  - Forests provide many important service functions, including habitat for wildlife, timber production and watershed water regulation. Short-term drought can make forests more susceptible to wildfire and insect attack, while long-term drought can directly increase forest mortality. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key parameter that links the hydrological and ecological processes. Studying the impact of drought on ET, especially at stand-scale, can provide useful information for forest management. In this study, we applied a multi-scale data fusion ET modeling method using remotely sensed data to estimate daily 30 m ET over a natural forest in central US from 2010 to 2012, with 2012 as an extreme drought year. The estimated ET agrees well with the observed ET. Drought impact on ET is further analyzed and demonstrates the value of remotely sensed ET in studying drought impact on forest water use.

TI  - Improved multi-scale image matching approach for monitoring Amery ice shelf velocity using Landsat 8
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The velocity of an ice shelf is an important characteristic to understand its dynamics and interaction with the internal ice sheet. Therefore, we develop an improved multi-scale image matching method for producing a complete and accurate Amery ice shelf velocity field from Landsat 8 images. First, we investigate the relationship between the template size and the image entropy and propose an image entropy-based preliminary operation for distinguishing the high-contrast regions from the low-contrast regions prior to iteratively determining the optimum template size. Second, a Gaussian pyramid image-based hierarchical data structure is designed to support a coarse-to-fine image matching strategy.The image entropy-based matching method is applied on the top layer of the image pyramid to guarantee the matching results have optimal completeness and high accuracy. Finally, a postprocess procedure is performed to derive a complete and accurate Amery ice shelf velocity field. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve computational efficiency. Moreover, the proposed method provides more accurate and robust matching results than other existing methods, particularly over the low-contrast surfaces. Additionally, the derived velocity field also shows good consistency with the one acquired from MEaSUREs Annual Antarctic Ice Velocity Maps 2016-2017.

TI  - Classification of Vegetation to Estimate Forest Fire Danger Using Landsat 8 Images: Case Study
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation cover of the Earth plays an important role in the life of mankind, whether it is natural forest or agricultural crop. The study of the variability of the vegetation cover, as well as observation of its condition, allows timely actions to make a forecast and monitor and estimate the forest fire condition. The objectives of the research were (i) to process the satellite image of the Gilbirinskiy forestry located in the basin of Lake Baikal; (ii) to select homogeneous areas of forest vegetation on the basis of their spectral characteristics; (iii) to estimate the level of forest fire danger of the area by vegetation types. The paper presents an approach for estimation of forest fire danger depending on vegetation type and radiant heat flux influence using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing data. The Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) and the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) software were used to process satellite images. The area's forest fire danger estimation and visual presentation of the results were carried out in ArcGIS Desktop software. Information on the vegetation was obtained using the analysis of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images for a typical forestry of the Lake Baikal natural area. The maps (schemes) of the Gilbirinskiy forestry were also used in the present article. The unsupervised k-means classification was used. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to increase the accuracy of decoding. The classification of forest areas according to the level of fire danger caused by the typical ignition source was carried out using the developed method. The final information product was the map displaying vector polygonal feature class, containing the type of vegetation and the level of fire danger for each forest quarter in the attribute table. The fire danger estimation method developed by the authors was applied to each separate quarter and showed realistic results. The method used may be applicable for other areas with prevailing forest vegetation.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a visualization tool to enhance the understanding of up to big data sets. Compared to classic data models which rely on the computing of the features (color, texture, etc.), this tool is fully feature free, as it processes directly on the data file. The Fast Compression Distance (FCD) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) have been applied to visualize a large TerraSAR-X dataset which are annotated with up to three layers of hierarchical semantic labels, and a Sentinel-1 dataset with 10 annotated classes, in VV and VH polarization modes. We analyze the visualization results in manifold space, and try to understand and interpret them with the available semantic labels. The visualization interpretation is based on a vega-style interactive tool, which allows user zoom in, zoom out for processing large amount of data points.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Both climate change and anthropogenic activities contribute to the deterioration of terrestrial water resources and ecosystems worldwide, with Central Asia and its endorheic lakes being among the most severely affected. We used a digital elevation model, bathymetry maps and Landsat images to estimate the areal water cover extent and volumetric storage changes for eleven small terminal lakes in Burabay National Nature Park (BNNP) in Northern Kazakhstan from 1986 to 2016. Based on the analysis of hydrometeorological observations, lake water balance, lake evaporation and Budyko equations, driven by gridded climate and global atmospheric reanalysis datasets, we evaluate the impact of historical climatic conditions on the water balance of the BNNP lake catchments. The total surface water area of the BNNP lakes decreased by around 7% for that period, mainly due to a reduction in the extent of three main lakes. In contrast, for some smaller lakes, the surface area increased. Overall, we attribute the decline of the BNNP lakes' areal extent and volume to the prolonged periods of water balance deficit when lake evaporation exceeded precipitation. However, during the most recent years (2013-2016) precipitation increased and the BNNP lake levels stabilized.

TI  - Kalmyks and Tuvans in Russian discourse: 20th to early 21st centuries
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the functioning of the ethnonyms 'Kalmyks' (Rus. (sic)) and 'Tuvans' (Rus. (sic)) in Russian-language discourse, seeking to delineate certain characteristics of ethnic fragments within the linguistic worldview that would mirror the interactions between representatives of different nations and cultures.The work deals with the Russian National Corpus. Qualitative data attest to that there prevail contexts related to the ethnonym 'Kalmyk', namely, 1917 word tokens across 481 documents, the earliest one dated to 1688-1709 and the latest one - to 2013. The ethnonym 'Tuvan' has been traced in documents dated to the 20th century and further: between 1930 and 2015, there have been identified 25 respective documents containing 38 word tokens. The difference results from differing periods of interaction between the Russians and Kalmyks / Tuvans, since the earliest active Russian-Kalmyk contacts date back to the 17th century, while the Russian-Tuvan relations began to develop two centuries later.The analysis of co-occurrence of the ethnonyms with attributive elements and other ethnonyms in enumeration sequences makes it possible to reveal national and cultural elements of respective ethnonymic clusters, obtain ethnographic information about Tuvans and Kalmyks available from Russian-language discourse.The ethnonym 'Kalmyk' illustrates the gradual evaluativity change of the word in terms of religion - from pejorative accounts to neutral ones. It is noteworthy that the mid-20th-century Russian discourse contains no mentions of confessional peculiarities inherent to Tuvans and Kalmyks, while the early-21st-century narratives characterize Kalmyks and Tuvans as adherents of Buddhism.

TI  - ESTIMATING SURFACE SOIL LOSSES IN THE MOUNTAINOUS SEMI-ARID WATERSHED USING RUSLE AND GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and geospatial technologies to estimate surface soil erosion losses has gained popularity among the researchers across the world. Yet, assessing the soil erosion risk for arid and semi-arid continental mountainous watersheds requires more challenges to cope with. The purpose of this study is to assess potential surface soil erosion risk areas for Uzundere sub-watershed in Erzurum, Turkey using RUSLE model and 50 cm pan-sharpened WorldView-2 imagery within GIS and remote sensing framework. The sub-factors of RUSLE were estimated using meteorological data for rainfall erosivity (R-factor), 5-m DEM for slope length and steepness (LS-factor), NDVI for land cover and crop management (C-factor), and soil samples collected in 35 sampling plots (20x20 m) for soil erodibility (K-factor). It was found that 25.38 tons of soil per hectare was washed away from the Uzundere sub watershed each year. It was also categorized that of the total study area 44.5% was under very low (0-5 t ha' yr'), 10.3% low (5-10), 13.6% moderate (1020), 17.2% high (20-50), and 14.5% very high (> 50) risk category. It can be concluded that despite the low average annual rainfall (585 mm yr1), a very steep topography and high slope length with a few vegetation cover were the main contributors of the high surface soil losses from the study area.

TI  - Mixed Model Estimation of Rice Yield based on NDVI and GNDVI using a Satellite Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XXI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - In Japan, a sustainable supply of rice should be guaranteed since it is the staple food. Therefore it is important to stabilize rice farmers' incomes by giving them appropriate compensation even at the time of adverse weather, e.g. cold summer. In the case of compensating farmers' incomes based on a comparison between the usual yield and estimated yield, an accurate and quick estimation of rice yield is significant to help farmers at the time of disaster. However, a manual survey requires a huge amount of effort and time to investigate all the fields where damage has been declared, especially when a large-scale cool summer occurs; therefore, we propose a yield estimation system using satellite images and part of the yield data. Our system provides an accurate and quick yield estimation for the vast extent of the fields at a reasonable cost.Many rice yield estimation methodologies utilizing satellite images have been studied over the years. For example, a crop growth model-based method and deep learning based method that utilize many satellite images taken multiple times at different times have been proposed. Although we can get much information about fields from many satellite images, systems using plural images cost much and need exhaustive calibration before the estimation. Therefore, in this study we propose a yield estimation method using a single image that is taken just before the harvest time. First, we extracted the spectral values from the satellite image using field GIS data and then used a mixed model to perform rice yield estimation. Mixed model is expanded linear regression model and able to take the difference between rice varieties, such as Yumepirika and Nanatsuboshi, into accounts. In addition, we introduced two vegetation indexes, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), into our model as feature values. Generally, NDVI and GNDVI have a positive correlation with the volume of the plant on the field and are used for yield estimation. Of course, we could use machine learning methods, for example random forest and support vector regression. However, we adopted a mixed model considering the explainability of the results and tha fact that the number of input feature values is small.The area of interest is Asahikawa-City, Hokkaido Province, Japan. We demonstrated our method on two datasets and evaluated the performance of our model based on mean absolute error (MAE) using 10- fold cross-validation. One dataset was damaged field data acquired in 2018 ( 2170 fields). The other was undamaged field data acquired in 2017 (1358 fields). We used RapidEye and SPOT-6 satellite images in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Our experimental results show that our model reduces the MAE of the estimated yield by over 2.5% percent compared to conventional regression methods in each damaged field and undamaged field case.

TI  - Examining the Impact of Tropical Cyclones on Air-Sea CO<sub>2</sub> Exchanges in the Bay of Bengal Based on Satellite Data and In Situ Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of tropical cyclones (TCs) on the CO2 partial pressure at the sea surface (pCO(2sea)) and air-sea CO2 flux (F-CO2) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) was quantified based on satellite data and in situ observations between November 2013 and January 2017. The in situ observations were made at the BoB Ocean Acidification mooring buoy. A weak time-mean net source of 55.78 +/- 11.16 mmol CO2 m(-2) year(-1) at the BoB Ocean Acidification site was estimated during this period. A wide range in increases of pCO(2sea) (1.0-14.8 mu atm) induced by TCs occurred in postmonsoon (October-December), and large decreases of pCO(2sea) (-14.0 mu atm) occurred in premonsoon (March-May). Large vertical differences in the ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to total alkalinity (TA) in the upper layer (Delta DIC/TA) were responsible for increasing pCO(2sea) in postmonsoon. Relatively small values of Delta DIC/TA were responsible for decreasing pCO(2sea) in premonsoon. Five TCs (Hudhud, Five, Kyant, Vardah, and Roanu) were considered. Hudhud significantly enhanced CO2 efflux (18.49 +/- 3.70 mmol CO2/m(2)) in oversaturated areas due to the wind effect during the storm and wind-pump effects after the storm. Vardah insignificantly changed F-CO2 (1.22 +/- 0.24 mmol CO2/m(2)) in undersaturated areas because of the counteraction of these two effects. Roanu significantly enhanced CO2 efflux (19.08 +/- 3.82 mmol CO2/m(2)) in highly oversaturated conditions (Delta pCO(2) > 20 mu atm) since the wind effect greatly exceeded the wind-pump effects. These five TCs were estimated to account for 55 +/- 23% of the annual-mean CO2 annual efflux, suggesting that TCs have significant impacts on the carbon cycle in the BoB.

TI  - CRIMEAN IDENTITY IN THE MEDIA PRESENTATION OF THE REGION
T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The author proposes a new approach to studying regionology, an actively emerging area of research that examines laws of functioning of a region in terms of geographical, geopolitical, geo-economic, information and historical-cultural factors. This approach lies in coordinating the theory of regionality with real facts of a certain territory media history in its dynamic characteristics displayed in media texts. The author points out that active forming of the Crimean identity is a result of the ideas of the Russian world as a uniting factor. The identity features of those who live in the peninsula manifest themselves by the formula "We are Crimean" regardless of a person's nationality. The identity features of the Crimean people are also determined by the role of the Russian language as an integrative field of communication for the living together representatives of different cultures. Regional mass media have a significant impact on shaping a regional worldview. Applying discourse analysis to the Crimean printed texts the author demonstrates peculiarities of media constructing of the Crimean identity involving geographical, historical, cultural and personal themes. The analysis carried out allows one to conclude that the Crimean (regional) identity corresponds to the professional identity of the journalists who work in the region. This is confirmed by the main regional themes being broadcast by the most popular regional mass media. The Crimean society is a specific regional polyethnic environment formed as the result of long-term and complex cultural and historical development. Characteristics of the key events representation in public space determine their collective comprehension. The regional mass media of the Republic of Crimea through the media texts draw the audience's attention primarily to the attributes of the unified mentality. It is important that now when several years have passed after the Crimea joined Russia it is the time to interpret this historical event to build a complex hierarchically ordered system of the peninsula citizens' self-identity.

TI  - History, Nature, and Taoism in Asian Ecology: With Special Emphasis on Li Rui’s Silver City and Su Tong’s Raise the Red Lantern
T2  - Literature and Environment
T2  - 문학과환경
M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper results from an effort to examine the possible ways to look at human history from an Asian environmental perspective. In so doing, two  literary works written by contemporary Chinese authors and recently translated into English are brought to close attention: Li Rui(1950-present)’s Silver City and Su Tong(1963-present)’s Raise the Red Lantern. These two commonly deal with turbulent and often painstaking events in modern Chinse history. Interestingly enough, those historical events are frequently presented with a Taoist view about the frailty of human life as well as peaceful descriptions of nature. The juxtaposition of historicity and Taoism may appear rather ironic from time to time to the readers of western culture. Yet it turns out to be significant that such a Taoist worldview brings about therapeutic effects on the characters.

AB  - I examined the features of the female character anecdote in a book written by Miam(眉巖) Yu Hui-chun(柳希春) during his exile, and revealed its significance and limitations. Compared with 『Sok-Monggu(續蒙求)』 and 『Monggu(蒙求)』, some differences are found in the way it chooses woman characters and embodies the theme.As a result, in the choice of female character anecdotes, only exemplary words and deeds of the upper-class women in China history are found in 『Sok-Monggu(續蒙求)』. And in 『Sok-Monggu(續蒙求)』, its theme was intended to present an ideal female image that conformed to the Confucian worldview. This is the difference from the point that『Monggu(蒙求)』 chooses anecdotes of women of various status, not just women of the upper class in China, and also at a point that 『Monggu(蒙求)』 describes a woman who has committed an evil deed in the anecdote.

AB  - Posidonia Oceanica meadows are important marine ecosystems that offer habitat to fish, organisms, and shelter for threatened species as well. This study compares classification algorithms for the validity of Posidoniaoceanica mapping through optical satellite imagery in the region of Limassol - Akrotiri bay. More specifically, side-scan sonar mapped data derived from the portal of the Department of Lands and Surveys and imported to the ArcGIS WMS service, as well as a Landsat 8 satellite image for the region of Cyprus were used. Training data and regions of interest (ROI) were created, followed by supervised classification using Spectral Angle Mapper, Mahalanobis Distance, Maximum Likelihood and Minimum Distance algorithms in ENVI 5.4 software. A sample of 1,000 random points was added to the study area before conducting a relative comparison to test the performance of the algorithms used. Since, there weren't any raw data to automate the comparison of the algorithms, a random manual selection of 30 points was considered.

AB  - This study aims to create Land Cover Land Use (LCLU) map of a part of the Izmir metropolitan city in Turkey, based on an enhanced Urban Atlas nomenclature and object based classification approach. Multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images from different seasons are used and rule-based object oriented classification techniques are applied on the images. Totally 20 LCLU classes are identified in the study area with different accuracy values. Thematic open source data were also integrated into classification to better identify some land use classes and to increase the total classification accuracy. Our results show that 10-m bands of Sentinel-2 images are capable to produce thematically detailed LCLU map with an overall accuracy of 86% and 0.852 Kappa values.

AB  - In this study, the burn severity of several wildfires ignited at northern Australian tropical savannas area were estimated using the Forest Reflectance and Transmittance (FRT) radiative transfer model (RTM) and Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) satellite data. To alleviate the spectral confusion between severe (SV) and not-severe (NSV) burnt levels caused by sparse tree distribution, the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover percentage data was used to constrain the inversion. The results showed that the accuracy of burn severity estimation significantly improves when considering the tree coverage, with overall accuracy for two study sites increasing from 65% to 81% and kappa coefficient from 0.35 to 0.55. Future work will focus on extending the methodology to other ecosystems.

AB  - Clumping index (CI) is an important vegetation structure parameter in the estimation of leaf area index (LAI) and the modeling of ecological and meteorological process. With the development of surface process modeling and remote sensing technology, high resolution CI product is urgently needed but no appropriate high resolution multi-angle reflectance satellite data is currently available to produce such product. In recent years, random forest algorithm has been widely used in the derivation of high resolution products from remote sensing data. In this study, the random forest algorithm was used to estimate Landsat CI basing on MODIS and field data. The developed predictive model was validated using 26 field measurements and the predicted CI shown a good consistency with the field CI (R-2=0.63, bias=0.005, RMSE=0.10).

AB  - Net Surface Shortwave Radiation (NSSR) is a key component of the surface radiation budget, which controls the energy, water exchanges, and many physical processes. The primary purpose of this study is to build a concise and feasible model of estimating NSSR with data of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite. Random Forest (RF) machine learning method was applied to building the model with the FULXNET in situ observations because of its powerful ability in nonlinear fitting. Total 17 variables are considered in RF model for retrieving NSSR, and thousands of parameters combinations were carried to obtained optimal parameters of the proposed model. The Bias, RMSE, and R-2 of estimated instantaneous NSSR in 95 selected sites during 2014 whole year are -0.085 W m(-2), 28.274 W m(-2) and 0.989, respectively. Consequently, retrieval of instantaneous NSSR with RF method would be believed to be an efficient method in the future by considering its concise process and great accuracy.

AB  - ALOS-4 succeeds the concepts of ALOS-2 and hence system design of ALOS-4 satellite basically follows that of ALOS-2, except for improvements in mission performance. In order to use data sets of both ALOS-2 and ALOS-4 for monitoring long term (more than 10 years) changes, the orbit of ALOS-4 is identical to that of ALOS-2. Even though ALOS-4 and ALOS-2 share the same orbit, revisit time of ALOS-4 can be shortened by increasing the swath width. Therefore ALOS-4 utilizes digital beam forming on receive to improve observation swath width. PALSAR-3, the successor of PALSAR-2 onboard ALOS-2, is now designed as an active phased array antenna with on-board digital beam forming processor in order to increase the swath width of the 3m resolution Stripmap mode to 200 km. Transmit signal with a broad beam-width in the elevation direction is generated in order to cover the wider swath. The reflected signal from the ground is received by several independent receive channels and processed to form several antenna patterns. To achieve approximately equivalent NESZ as ALOS-2, the size of PALSAR-3 antenna is designed to be 1.2 times larger than that of PALSAR-2/ALOS-2.ALOS-4 has successfully passed its Preliminary Design Review and engineering model is currently under development. This paper describes the radar instrument design of ALOS-4.

AB  - Wild boars are a reservoir for many zoonotic pathogens and a good sentinel for surveillance of zoonotic viral infections, but collection of serum samples from wild boars in the field is sometimes difficult and requires special equipment and techniques. In this study, ELISA using meat juices extracted from the heart and diaphragm of wild boars, instead of serum samples, was performed to detect antibodies against zoonotic pathogens, Japanese encephalitis virus and hepatitis E virus. The results of ELISA using meat juice samples were significantly correlated with those using serum samples and meat juice contained one-fifth the antibodies of serum samples. As meat juice is easily collected from wild animals in the field without special equipment and techniques, ELISA using meat juice is a simple and superior method for serological survey of zoonosis among wild animals.

AB  - Paddy rice field extraction is one of the applications of satellite remote sensing. Full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar is capable of distinguishing between crop types based on the differences in their scattering characteristics. ALOS2 PALSAR-2 data acquired in early August over a Japanese agricultural area were analyzed to distinguish paddy rice fields from other crops, such as soybean, corn, and vegetables. The scattering characteristics of these crop types were clearly different. The threshold analysis method using polarimetric decomposition parameters examined by a previous study was employed. The results exhibited misclassification of vegetable open culture fields as paddy rice fields. The effect of the variability in the structure of vegetable fields on the scattering mechanism should be considered for improvement of the crop classification method using polarimetric decomposition parameters.

AB  - The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) have been processed using the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL). Because of a relatively large data size, it would be preferable to build and install the data analysis tool with greater computing performance, which would differ by operating system and the form of distribution, e.g., source code or binary package. The objective of this study was to examine the performance of the GDAL for processing the HDF files, which would guide construction of a computer system for remote sensing data analysis. The differences in execution time were compared between environments under which the GDAL was installed. The wall clock time was measured after extracting data for each variable in the MODIS data file using a tool built lining against GDAL under a combination of operating systems (Ubuntu and openSUSE), compilers (GNU and Intel), and distribution forms. The MOD07 product, which contains atmosphere data, were processed for eight 2-D variables and two 3-D variables. The GDAL compiled with Intel compiler under Ubuntu had the shortest computation time. For openSUSE, the GDAL compiled using GNU and intel compilers had greater performance for 2-D and 3-D variables, respectively. It was found that the wall clock time was considerably long for the GDAL complied with “--with-hdf4=no” configuration option or RPM package manager under openSUSE. These results indicated that the choice of the environments under which the GDAL is installed, e.g., operation system or compiler, would have a considerable impact on the performance of a system for processing remote sensing data. Application of parallel computing approaches would improve the performance of the data processing for the HDF files, which merits further evaluation of these computational methods.
