TI  - <i>Swarm</i> Satellite Magnetic Field Data Analysis Prior to 2019 Mw = 7.1 Ridgecrest (California, USA) Earthquake
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents an analysis of the ESA Swarm satellite magnetic data preceding the Mw = 7.1 California Ridgecrest earthquake that occurred on 6 July 2019. In detail, we show the main results of a procedure that investigates the track-by-track residual of the magnetic field data acquired by the Swarm constellation from 1000 days before the event and inside the Dobrovolsky's area. To exclude global geomagnetic perturbations, we select the data considering only quiet geomagnetic field time, defined by thresholds on Dst and a(p) geomagnetic indices, and we repeat the same analysis in two comparison areas at the same geomagnetic latitude of the Ridgecrest earthquake epicentre not affected by significant seismicity and in the same period here investigated. As the main result, we find some increases of the anomalies in the Y (East) component of the magnetic field starting from about 500 days before the earthquake. Comparing such anomalies with those in the validation areas, it seems that the geomagnetic activity over California from 222 to 168 days before the mainshock could be produced by the preparation phase of the seismic event. This anticipation time is compatible with the Rikitake empirical law, recently confirmed from Swarm satellite data. Furthermore, the Swarm Bravo satellite, i.e., that one at highest orbit, passed above the epicentral area 15 min before the earthquake and detected an anomaly mainly in the Y component. These analyses applied to the Ridgecrest earthquake not only intend to better understand the physical processes behind the preparation phase of the medium-large earthquakes in the world, but also demonstrate the usefulness of a satellite constellation to monitor the ionospheric activity and, in the future, to possibly make reliable earthquake forecasting.

TI  - Not the Absolute, but the Ultimate: William James before the Mystery of God
T2  - REVISTA DE HISTORIA DE LA PSICOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - After a long inquiry into the fields of psychology, psychopathology, religious experience, mysticism and philosophy, William James arrived at a pantheistic worldview in which God was no longer the Absolute knower of the idealistic philosophy, but an immanent closely linked to human beings and the end of the process of world unification. This article follows William James's evolution from his beginnings as a psychologist and founder of American psychology to his final solution to the philosophical problem of the One and the Many through a pluralistic pantheism. I examine his notions of 'stream of consciousness', feelings of relation and emotions, as well as the super-human consciousness he found in religious mystical states; I then review his doctrine of indeterminism and his overcoming of the logic of identity by a vision of the world as a federal Republic in which Deity is construed as finite, much greater than human beings but nonetheless in need of their cooperation. In the conclusions, I analyze this view of the Divinity in its intellectual and social context as well as the result of William James's personal experience as a psychologist in search of a vision of the world in which God had a more intimate relationship with humans and a leading role in promoting universal good.

TI  - PICTURE AND STORY: ON THE USE OF VISUAL IMAGERY IN THE WRITING OF RABBI NAHMAN OF BRATSLAV
T2  - IMAGES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rabbi Nahman's philosophical and literary work has generated great interest among artists in various fields over the course of the last few decades, an interest of such degree and power that it has no equal in the traditional Jewish world. In this article, I will discuss one element of Rabbi Nahman's spiritual world that may explain to some degree the attraction of his work to painters and other artists who deal with visual arts, which is the important role of visions in his spiritual world and in his writings. I will also demonstrate how Rabbi Nahman uses the tools of visual imagery not only in his literary work but also in his philosophical work, as compiled in his two-volume book of sermons, Likutei Moharan (Collected Teachings of the Master), published in 1806 and 1811. I will then discuss the connection between the narrative and visual layers of Rabbi Nahman's work and worldview.

TI  - Sentinel Coronavirus environmental monitoring can contribute to detecting asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus spreaders and can verify effectiveness of workplace COVID-19 controls
T2  - MICROBIAL RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting all asymptomatic or presymptomatic COVID-19 virus spreaders at a workplace requires daily testing of employees by RT-PCR, which is not practical. Over a two week period, 9 Europe and USA workplace locations were chosen to test employees for SARS-CoV-2 infection (841 tests) and high-frequency-touch point environ mental surfaces (5,500 tests) for Coronavirus by RT-PCR. Of the 9 locations, 3 had one or more employees infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the two week study period. None of the employees who tested positive had symptoms at the time of testing and none developed symptoms during subsequent 14 day quarantine. Locations with significant prevalence of Coronavirus contaminated environmental surfaces were 10 times more likely to have a positive employees than locations with no or very few environmental surfaces positive for Coronavirus. Break room chairs, workbenches, and break room door handles were the most frequently contaminated environmental surfaces. Surface Coronavirus RNA was detected at very low concentrations (RT-PCR 34 to 38 Cq). These results suggest that Coronavirus environmental monitoring may have potential to predict presence of asymptotic spreaders and to validate and verify COVID-19 control strategies on a regular basis.

TI  - Ultrasound staging in breast cancer: A decision-making oriented approach to axillary metastatic burden prediction
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The possibility of avoiding axillary lymphadenectomy (AL) in patients with breast cancer (BC) after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and low metastatic burden (< o = 2 positive lymph nodes) has put into question the role of axillary ultrasound due to the risk of overtreatment after positive axillary lymph node biopsy with low metastatic burden. Our aim was to identify clinical and ultrasound features to detect low and high metastatic burden.Methods: A retrospective study of 405 BC patients with primary surgical treatment with axillary ultrasound examination and subsequent AL after positive fine needle aspiration (FNA) or SLNB. The low and high tumor burdens after AL were correlated with clinical and ultrasound variables: lymph node morphology (UN1 to UN5), number of suspicious lymph nodes, and Berg level.Results: Positive FNA, lymph node morphology UN4 (focal thickening with displacement of the fatty hilum) or UN5 (complete replacement of the fatty hilum) and >2 suspicious lymph nodes were significantly associated with "high metastatic burden". Lymph node morphology UN2 and UN3, even after FNA+, lymph node morphology UN4 after FNA-, and suspicious lymph nodes at Berg level I were low metastatic burden criteria. Lymph node morphology UN5, lymph node morphology UN4 after FNA+, two nodes or more with UN4/UN5 morphology, and suspicious lymph nodes at Berg levels II and III with FNA+ were associated with high metastatic burden.Conclusions: Axillary lymph node ultrasound data for patients with early BC allows predicting the axillary metastatic burden, guiding the optimal clinical management of the axilla.

TI  - Deep neural network for complex open-water wetland mapping using high-resolution WorldView-3 and airborne LiDAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland inventory maps are essential information for the conservation and management of natural wetland areas. The classification framework is crucial for successful mapping of complex wetlands, including the model selection, input variables and training procedures. In this context, deep neural network (DNN) is a powerful technique for remote sensing image classification, but this model application for wetland mapping has not been discussed in the previous literature, especially using commercial WorldView-3 data. This study developed a new framework for wetland mapping using DNN algorithm and WorldView-3 image in the Millrace Flats Wildlife Management Area, Iowa, USA. The study area has several wetlands with a variety of shapes and sizes, and the minimum mapping unit was defined as 20 m(2) (0.002 ha). A set of potential variables was derived from WorldView-3 and auxiliary LiDAR data, and a feature selection procedure using principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify the most important variables for wetland classification. Furthermore, traditional machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest and k-nearest neighbor) were also implemented for the comparison of results. In general, the results show that DNN achieved satisfactory results in the study area (overall accuracy = 93.33 %), and we observed a high spatial overlap between reference and classified wetland polygons (Jaccard index similar to 0.8). Our results confirm that PCA-based feature selection was effective in the optimization of DNN performance, and vegetation and textural indices were the most informative variables. In addition, the comparison of results indicated that DNN classification achieved relatively similar accuracies to other methods. The total classification errors vary from 0.104 to 0.111 among the methods, and the overlapped areas between reference and classified polygons range between 87.93 and 93.33 %. Finally, the findings of this study have three main implications. First, the integration of DNN model and WorldView-3 image is useful for wetland mapping at 1.2-m, but DNN results did not outperform other methods in this study area. Second, the feature selection was important for model performance, and the combination of most relevant input parameters contributes to the success of all tested models. Third, the spatial resolution of WorldView-3 is appropriate to preserve the shape and extent of small wetlands, while the application of medium resolution image (30-m) has a negative impact on the accurate delineation of these areas. Since commercial satellite data are becoming more affordable for remote sensing users, this study provides a framework that can be utilized to integrate very high-resolution imagery and deep learning in the classification of complex wetland areas.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure and Emission Throughout the Scandinavian Stream Network
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Stream networks transport and emit substantial volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. We gathered open monitoring data from streams in three Scandinavian countries and estimated CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) at 2,298 sites. Most of the sites (87%) were supersaturated when averaged across the year with an overall mean pCO(2) of 1,464 mu atm (range: 17-15,646). Using remote sensing data, we modeled a realistic stream network including streams above similar to 2.5 m wide and calculated catchment averages of multiple variables associated with geomorphometry, stream network proximity, and land cover. We compared the ability of eight machine learning models to predict pCO(2) and found that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, with a root-mean-square error of 0.22 (log(10)(pCO(2))) and R-2 of 0.66. Mean catchment elevation, slope, and permanent water cover were the most important predictor variables. We used the predictive model to create a high-resolution (25-m resolution) map with predicted stream pCO(2) throughout the 268.807 km stream network in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. Predicted pCO(2) averaged 1,134 mu atm (range: 154-8,174). We used surface runoff, air temperature, and stream channel slope to estimate gas transfer velocity and CO2 flux throughout the network. Mean stream CO2 fluxes ranged from 1.0 and 1.2 in Sweden and Finland, respectively, 3 to 3.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) in Denmark. Better-performing models improve our ability to predict pCO(2) in stream networks and reduce the uncertainty of upscaling estimates of carbon emissions from inland waters to countries and continents.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-2 MSI data to monitor crop irrigation in Mediterranean areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of accurate information on the water consumed for crop irrigation is of vital importance to support compatible and sustainable environmental policies in arid and semi-arid regions. This has promoted several studies about the use of remote sensing data to monitor irrigated croplands, which are mostly based on statistical classification and/or regression techniques. The current paper proposes a new semi-empirical approach that relies on a water balance logic and does not require local tuning. The method stems from recent investigations which demonstrated the possibility of combining standard meteorological data and Sentinel-2 (S2) Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) NDVI images to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of irrigated Mediterranean croplands. This ETa estimation method is adapted to drive a simplified site water balance which, for each 10-m S-2 MSI pixel, predicts the irrigation water (IW), i.e. the water which is consumed in addition to that naturally supplied by rainfall. The new method, fed with ground and satellite data from two years (2018-2019), is tested in a Mediterranean area around the town of Grosseto (Central Italy), that is covered by a particularly complex mosaic of rainfed and irrigated crops. The results obtained are first assessed qualitatively for some fields grown with known winter, spring and summer crops. Next, the IW estimates are evaluated quantitatively versus ground measurements taken over two irrigated fields, the first grown with processing tomato in 2018 and the second with early corn in 2019. Finally, the IW estimates are statistically analyzed against various datasets informative on local agricultural practices in the two years. All these analyses indicate that the proposed method is capable of predicting both the intensity and timing of the IW supply in the study area. The method, in fact, correctly identifies rainfed and irrigated crops and, in the latter case, accurately predicts the IW actually supplied. The results of the quantitative tests performed on tomato and corn show that over 50 % and 70 % of the measured IW variance is explained on daily and weekly bases, respectively, with corresponding mean bias errors below 0.3 mm/day and 2.0 mm/week. Similar indications are produced by the qualitative tests; reasonable IW estimates are obtained for all winter, springs and summer crops grown in the study area during 2018 and 2019.

TI  - Sentinel-2 time series based optimal features and time window for mapping invasive Australian native <i>Acacia</i> species in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of invasive Australia native Acacia tree species threatens biodiversity and adversely affecting on vegetative structure and function, including plant community composition, quantity and quality worldwide. It is essential to provide researchers and land managers for biological invasion science and management with accurate information of the distribution of invasive alien species and their dynamics. Remotely sensed data that reveal spatial distribution of the earth's surface features/objects provide great potential for this purpose. Consistent satellite monitoring of alien invasive plants is often difficult because of lack of sufficient spectral contrast between them and co-occurring plants species. Time series analysis of spectral properties of the species can reveal timing of their variations among adjacent species. This information can improve accuracy of invasive species discrimination and mapping using remote sensing data at large scale. We sought to identify and better understand the optimal time window and key spectral features sufficient to detect invasive Acacia trees in heterogeneous forested landscape in South Africa. We explored one-year (January to December 2018) time series spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from optical Copernicus Sentinel-2 data. The attributes correspond to geographical information of invasive Acacia and native species recorded during a field survey undertaken from 21 February to 25 February 2018 over Kwa-Zulu Natal grasslands landscape, in South Africa. The results showed comparable separability prospects between times series of spectral bands and that of vegetation indices. Substantial differences between Acacia species and native species were observed from spectral indices and spectral bands which are sensitive to Leaf Area Index, canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations. The results further revealed spectral differences between Acacia species and co-occurring native vegetation in April (senescence for deciduous plants), June-July (dry season), September (peak flowering period of Acacia spp) and December (leaf green-up) with vegetation indices (overall accuracy > 80 %). While spectral bands showed the beginning of the growing season (November-January) and peak vegetation productivity (February-March) as the optimal seasons or dates for image acquisition for discriminating Acacias from its co-occurring native species (overall accuracy > 80 %). In general, the use of Sentinel-2 time series spectral bands and vegetation indices has increased our understanding of Australian Acacias spectral dynamics, and proved that the sentinel-2 data is useful for characterization and monitoring Acacias over a large scale. Our results and approach could assist in deriving detailed geographic information of the species and assessment of a spread invasive plant species and severity of invasion.

TI  - Optimization-based automated unsupervised classification method: A novel approach
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsupervised classification algorithms are methods for the analysis of remotely sensed images. Since these methods do not include a training phase, they require less time to apply and are more practical to use. Traditional unsupervised classification methods work with parameters given by the user, such as the number of classes, the stop criterion or the number of iterations of the algorithm. Determining the optimum values of these parameters to obtain successful classification result is a major problem.In this study, we propose two new methods, the weighted density based optimized classification method (DBOC-Weighted) and the automatic density based optimized classification method (DBOCAutomatic). Both work automatically without the need for parameters from the user, but the DBOCWeighted only requires layer weights. These methods consist of data range expansion, useful data selection, segmentation and optimization stages, and perform the classification automatically. Both create new layers of data using remotely sensed images. After creating the initial classes based on density from all the data layers, the results are created by optimizing all classes in terms of quality indices.Four Sentinel 2 images are used to test the performance of the proposed methods. These images are selected from regions that have different geographical, climatic and vegetation properties. The results obtained are compared with the unsupervised classification methods frequently used in the literature. The accuracy analysis results show that the proposed classification algorithms produce satisfactory accuracy compared to the results of other algorithms. The results show that the proposed methods can be used successfully in the creation of expert and intelligent analysis systems, by eliminating user induced error in the analysis of remotely sensed images. Thus, smart analysis tools can be created so that users from various professional disciplines can easily use them without being image processing specialists. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Regime-Oriented Approach to Observationally Constraining Extratropical Shortwave Cloud Feedbacks
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The extratropical shortwave (SW) cloud feedback is primarily due to increases in extratropical liquid cloud extent and optical depth. Here, we examine the response of extratropical (358-758) marine cloud liquid water path (LWP) to a uniform 4-K increase in sea surface temperature (SST) in global climate models (GCMs) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and variants of the HadGEM3-GC3.1 GCM. Compositing is used to partition data into periods inside and out of cyclones. The response of extratropical LWP to a uniform SST increase and associated atmospheric response varies substantially among GCMs, but the sensitivity of LWP to cloud controlling factors (CCFs) is qualitatively similar. When all other predictors are held constant, increasing moisture flux drives an increase in LWP. Increasing SST, holding all other predictors fixed, leads to a decrease in LWP. The combinations of these changes lead to LWP, and by extension reflected SW, increasing with warming in both hemispheres. Observations predict an increase in reflected SW over oceans of 0.8-1.6Wm(-2) per kelvin SST increase (358-758N) and 1.2-1.9Wm(-2) per kelvin SST increase (358-758S). This increase in reflected SW is mainly due to increased moisture convergence into cyclones because of increasing available moisture. The efficiency at which converging moisture is converted into precipitation determines the amount of liquid cloud. Thus, cyclone precipitation processes are critical to constraining extratropical cloud feed-backs.

TI  - Towards a Satellite System for Archaeology? Simulation of an Optical Satellite Mission with Ideal Spatial and Temporal Resolution, Illustrated by a Case Study in Scotland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of remote sensing data for archaeology rely heavily on repurposed data, which carry inherent limitations in their suitability to help address archaeological questions. Through a case study framed around archaeological imperatives in a Scottish context, this work investigates the potential for existing satellite systems to provide remote sensing data that meet defined specifications for archaeological prospection, considering both spatial and temporal resolution, concluding that the availability of commercial data is currently insufficient. Tasking a commercial constellation of 12 spacecraft to collect images of a 150 km(2) region in Scotland through the month of July 2020 provided 26 images with less than 50% cloud cover. Following an analysis of existing systems, this paper presents a high-level mission architecture for a bespoke satellite system designed from an archaeological specification. This study focuses on orbit design and the number of spacecraft needed to meet the spatial and temporal resolution requirements for archaeological site detection and monitoring in a case study of Scotland, using existing imaging technology. By exploring what an ideal scenario might look like from a satellite mission planning perspective, this paper presents a simulation analysis that foregrounds archaeological imperatives and specifies a satellite constellation design on that basis. High-level design suggests that a system of eight 100 kg spacecraft in a 581 km altitude orbit could provide coverage at a desired temporal and spatial resolution of two-weekly revisit and <1 m ground sampling distance, respectively. The potential for such a system to be more widely applied in regions of similar latitude and climate is discussed.

TI  - Exploitation of the red-edge bands of Sentinel 2 to improve the estimation of durum wheat yield in Grombalia region (Northeastern Tunisia)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, cereals are of great interest for national food security. The recently released free Sentinel 2 imagery is promising for cereal production systems management, both at field and regional scale. The present study aims to estimate and map the durum wheat yield in Grombalia region using the Sentinel 2 red-edge bands. First, the spatial distribution of wheat in Grombalia region was mapped applying the maximum likelihood classification of Sentinel 2 images spread out between October, 2017, and June, 2018. Then the wheat yield of eleven sampled fields was estimated based on these images through empirical regressions models. The independent variable of the regressions was the yield measured in-situ by objective method. The dependent variables were different types of vegetation indices derived from Sentinel 2 red, red-edge and near-infrared bands. The vegetation index of the best model was chosen to estimate and map the wheat yield over the entire study area. The maximum likelihood method classifies accurately the wheat in Grombalia region with wheat Kappa index (K) of 0.95, wheat user accuracy of 0.95 and wheat producer accuracy of 0.99. The area of wheat cultivated in Grombalia during the campaign 2017/2018 is about 1200 ha. On the other hand, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the tested empirical regressions models for yield estimation is between 0.55 and 0.73 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) varies from 3.80 to 4.90 Qx ha(-1). The best model is the one that employsB(7)andB(5)bands. According to this model the wheat yield of the entire study area ranges from 0.90 to 53.00 Qx ha(-1)with a mean of 21.00 Qx ha(-1)and a total production of 23,452 Qx. This mean is very close to the official mean recorded during the campaign 2017/2018 in Nabeul governorate, which is 22.10 Qx ha(-1).

TI  - Exploring the Fingerprints of Past Rain-on-Snow Events in a Central Andean Mountain Range Basin Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can alter nival regimes and increase snowmelt, peak river flow, and reduce water storage. However, detection of ROS events is challenging and only the most intense and obvious cases are identified. Rain is known to reduce snow cover and decrease near-infrared reflectance due to increased grain size. This study explored the fingerprints of ROS events on mountain snowpack with a simple typology that classifies changes in snow reflectance using fifteen years of MODIS imagery, reanalysis, and surface hydrometeorological data. The Maipo River Basin, with strong nival regime and a steep topography, in the western Andean mountain range was selected as a case study. Statistical analysis showed two distinct and opposite responses in the near infrared reflectance distribution of snow-covered pixels after precipitation, consistent with the typology for rain or snow events. For the probable ROS events, the daily maximum and minimum temperature increased in the days preceding the event and subsequently decreased, in some cases followed by a less consistent response in river flow. Although much remains to be studied, this approach can be used to expand historical records and improve modelling and detection schemes.

TI  - The relative contribution of vegetation greening to the hydrological cycle in the Three-North region of China: A modelling analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - China has implemented a few large-scale afforestation programs in the arid and semi-arid areas, including the north-eastern, northern, and north-western regions, collectively referred to as the Three-North region (TNR), to combat desertification and control dust storms. Although these programs have alleviated environmental problems in the region to a certain extent, the effects of increasing vegetation greenness on the hydrological cycle remain controversial. In this study, the relative effects of afforestation programs on the hydrologic processes in the TNR were identified based on large-scale hydrological modeling and satellite remote sensing data. The model forcing was featured with long-term vegetation dynamics. The study period ranged from 2000 to 2015, during which the greening of vegetation in the TNR was increased after multiple afforestation programs were carried out around 2000. The results indicated that, despite the spatial heterogeneity, the vegetation leaf area index (LAI) exhibited a significant increase across the TNR. Evapotranspiration (ET) increased over the entire region at the rate of 2.9 mm/year from 2000 to 2015, and its spatial pattern was consistent with changes in the LAI and precipitation. However, this does not imply equal contribution by vegetation growth and precipitation change. The results from the simulation scenarios indicated that precipitation change had a more significant influence on the ET, soil moisture and runoff than vegetation growth at the regional scale. Vegetation greening and precipitation increase in the Loess Plateau indicated their approximately equal impacts on ET and soil moisture. Consequently, the hydrological cycle was sensitive to afforestation practices at small-catchment or sub-regional scales where the magnitude of vegetation greening is relatively high. Therefore, the hydrological effect of vegetation greening at large scale may be overestimated by previous studies. To ensure sustainable water resource management at the TNR scale, special attention should be paid to climate change rather than afforestation efforts under the current level of ecological restoration programs.

TI  - LAND -USE and land-cover change processes in Pampa biome and relation with environmental and socioeconomic data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pampa biome in the last years has gone through a process of change in land use, chiefly due to the conversion of grassland vegetation for agriculture of grains and silviculture. The main objective of this work is to analyze processes of Land-Use and Land-Cover (LUCC) in the Brazilian Pampa Biome, mapped from Multitemporal data of MODIS sensor, including the main processes of landscape transformation. The period studied was 2000 and 2014, and MODIS-EVI images and night DMSP-OLS images were used for generation of land use and cover maps, through decision tree classification. IBGE census sectors' limits were used. To investigate the processes of landscape transformation of Pampa Biome, environmental variables were used including geomorphometric data, landscape metrics and climate data and socioeconomic variables. Local (GWR) and global linear regression models were used in addition to procedures for spatial clustering (SKATER algorithm). Reduction of around 25% of grassland class in 15-year interval was verified, from 10,252,740 ha to 7,676,208 ha. On the other hand, agriculture areas like Soybean class obtained 145.56% increase in their total area, from 855,087 ha in 2000, to 2,099,837 ha in 2014. Silviculture class also presented increase of over 167% of its total area. The main factors in the global regression model that negatively contributed to grassland degradation process are: population density, height against the closest drainage (HAND Model) and degradation patches in the grassland. Factors that positively contributed are: population residing in domiciles, average of number of residents in domiciles, Soybean expansion patches and distance from Soybean expansion process. It was concluded that orbital data along with geoprocessing techniques provided tools for monitoring changes in land use and cover.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery was acquired over the Peace Athabasca Delta and assessed for its open water classification capabilities using an object-oriented deep learning algorithm . The workflow involved segmenting the satellite data into meaningful image objects, building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), training the CNN, and lastly applying the CNN, resulting in probability heat maps of open water (with score values ranging from 0-1). Using the vector segmentation, heat maps were then iteratively assigned final class labels ('open water' or 'other') based on various probability thresholding. The ensuing open water classifications were assessed against a large validation dataset, and a highest overall accuracy of 96.2% (0.912 kappa coefficient) was achieved, with an open water producer's accuracy of 98.1%. These results were then compared against a Random Forest (RF) classification, and results indicated that the CNN algorithm outperforms RF in this study site. Additionally, an important component of this study was the optimization of several CNN configurations, including patch size and learning rate; the latter which plays a critical role in model adaptation. The optimized object-oriented CNN and associated results can be used to provide resource managers with accurate surface water extent maps at 10 m resolution.

TI  - Modern treatment of vulvar cancer
T2  - RADIOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. Vulvar cancer accounts for 3-5% of malignant diseases of the female genital tract. The Slovenian incidence rate is 5.5/100,000, which means 57 new cases per year. The most common histological type (90%) is squamous cell carcinoma. Based on etiology, it can be classified into the first type which correlates with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the second type which is not associated with HPV. The most common and long-lasting symptom of vulvar cancer is pruritus. The preferred diagnostic procedure to confirm the diagnosis is a punch or incision biopsy. Surgery in combination with radiotherapy is the standard treatment for vulvar cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy with lymphoscintigraphy is now a standard part of surgical treatment. Chemotherapy is a palliative treatment option. Conclusions. Vulvar cancer is a rare disease. Because of the pathogenesis, surgery and radiotherapy are the main treatment modalities. The sentinel node biopsy (SNB) represents a contemporary approach to the vulvar cancer treatment and significantly reduces morbidity. Improvements in treatment of vulvar cancer contributed to the decrease of mortality among Slovenian women.

TI  - Mass retrofitting of building envelope at urban level based on digital image processing, La Plata, Argentina
T2  - REVISTA DE URBANISMO
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work is to provide solutions for mass retrofitting of building envelope in residential areas at urban level. An innovative methodology is developed that identify the different construction materials of the urban-building envelope in large-scale to estimate energy saving by recycling them with energy efficiency criteria. It is proposed the digital processing of SPOT 6 satellite and aerial images through semi-automatic classifications. In this case, the roofs are classified, the quality of the results is determined, the most appropriate processing is defined, and with these results envelope improvement strategies are applied for mass treatment at urban level. The work was carried out in the residential area of La Plata department, Argentina. The results showed that the classifications with aerial images achieve good precision for the complexity addressed (70%). This allowed estimating energy savings which can be seen on urban maps easily showing the annual energy saving potentialities for heating between 2000 and 3000 kWh/year per house. In effect, the use of remote sensors applied to the detailed and massive analysis of urban sectors provides a little disseminated knowledge of interest in our region. In turn, this methodology can be applied to cities with similar characteristics.

TI  - The Use of Colorimeters to Support Remote Sensing Techniques on Asphalt Pavements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterization of asphalt pavements, based on ground spectroradiometers, has been studied in the past to determine their spectral response concerning the physical, chemical, and condition properties of the pavement. This paper suggests an alternative technique for characterizing ageing of asphalt pavements using a colorimeter. Colorimeters are considered as affordable equipment in laboratories in contrast to other scientific instruments and turn remote sensing ground techniques more accessible to industry. Therefore, the study proposes a new methodology indicating how colorimeters can be used in combination with satellite data for the age characterization of asphalt pavements. Spectroradiometer data are compared in a two-way methodology to colorimeter data. The final steps of the methodology used in the study show very similar results for both equipment after a comparison of separability indices (Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances). It is a fact that colorimeter data can be used as ground truth data. The application was performed using an in-band analysis of WorldView 3 (WV3) spectral bands situated in the visible electromagnetic spectrum. Based on the findings of this study, we proposed the Normalized Difference Equation/filter for asphalt Pavement Age characterization Index (NDPAI).

TI  - Earth as an Exoplanet. I. Time Variable Thermal Emission Using Spatially Resolved Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer Data
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the more than 4000 exoplanets known today, some terrestrial planets have been detected in the so-called habitable zone of their host stars and their number is expected to increase in the near future, energizing a drive to understand and interpret the eagerly awaited wealth of data to identify signs of life beyond our solar system. So far, Earth remains the best and only example of a habitable (and inhabited) world. Although, it seems extremely unlikely that any other exoplanets will be true Earth twins, it is important to explore and understand the full range of spectral signatures and variability of Earth in order to inform the design of future instruments and missions, and understand their diagnostic power as well as potential limitations. In this work we use Earth observation data collected by the MODIS instrument aboard the Aqua satellite. The complete data set comprises 15 years of thermal emission observations in the 3.66-14.40 mu m range for five different locations on Earth (Amazon Rainforest, Antarctica, Arctic, Indian Ocean, and the Sahara Desert). We then determine flux levels and variations as a function of wavelength and surface type (i.e., climate zone and surface thermal properties) and investigate whether periodic signals indicating Earth's tilted rotation axis can be detected. Our findings suggest that (1) viewing geometry plays an important role when thermal emission data is analyzed as Earth's spectrum varies by a factor of three and more depending on the dominant surface type underneath; (2) typically strong absorption bands from CO2 (15 mu m) and O-3 (9.65 mu m) are significantly less pronounced and partially absent in data from the polar regions implying that estimating correct abundance levels for these molecules might be challenging in these cases; and (3) the time-resolved thermal emission spectrum encodes information about seasons/planetary obliquity, but the significance depends on the viewing geometry and spectral band considered.

TI  - Higher susceptibility of beech to drought in comparison to oak
T2  - DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The expected increase in drought severity and frequency as a result of anthropogenic climate change leads to concerns about the ability of native tree species to cope with these changes. To determine the susceptibility of Fagus sylvatica (European beech) and Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) - the two dominant deciduous tree species in Central Europe - to drought, we quantified the climate sensitivity and drought-response of radial growth for both species using an array of dendroecological methods. Tree-ring data were collected from a site east of Coburg, Bavaria which had shown pronounced stress-symptoms (early leaf coloration) during the record drought of 2018. Climate-growth relationships were used to establish the sensitivity of radial growth to multiple climatic variables. The impact of specific drought events on tree growth was quantified using tolerance indices. In addition, we employed a Principal Component Gradient Analysis (PCGA) and remote sensing data (MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) to delineate the species specific drought responses. Using these methods we were able to show a clear difference in drought susceptibility between beech and oak. Beech dis played a higher sensitivity to temperature and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and showed lower resistance and resilience to drought events than oak. In particular, beech was unable to fully recover from the 2003 drought, after which it expressed a stark growth decline, i.e. drought legacies, which was not observed for oak. The PCGA revealed a clear differentiation in the grouping of drought responses between beech and oak, supporting the findings of the climate-growth analysis and the tolerance indices. Correlations of NDVI and ring-width indices (RWI) indicated that under normal climatic conditions NDVI variability is linked to the start of the growing season. This is in contrast to drought years, such as 2003, where summer NDVI mirrored the drought response of beech and oak. These results reveal beech to have both a higher sensitivity to summer temperature and SPEI and a higher susceptibility to drought events. Although, in the past high plasticity and adaptability to drought have been attributed to both beech and oak, our study assigns beech a higher risk than oak to suffer from anticipated increases in drought frequency and intensity as a consequence of climate change.

TI  - Derivation of Shortwave Radiometric Adjustments for SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS for the NASA MODIS-VIIRS Continuity Cloud Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate studies, including trend detection and other time series analyses, necessarily require stable, well-characterized and long-term data records. For satellite-based geophysical retrieval datasets, such data records often involve merging the observational records of multiple similar, though not identical, instruments. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) cloud mask (CLDMSK) and cloud-top and optical properties (CLDPROP) products are designed to bridge the observational records of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard NASA's Aqua satellite and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the joint NASA/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite and NOAA's new generation of operational polar-orbiting weather platforms (NOAA-20+). Early implementations of the CLDPROP algorithms on Aqua MODIS and SNPP VIIRS suffered from large intersensor biases in cloud optical properties that were traced back to relative radiometric inconsistency in analogous shortwave channels on both imagers, with VIIRS generally observing brighter top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance than MODIS (e.g., up to 5% brighter in the 0.67 mu m channel). Radiometric adjustment factors for the SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS shortwave channels used in the cloud optical property retrievals are derived from an extensive analysis of the overlapping observational records with Aqua MODIS, specifically for homogenous maritime liquid water cloud scenes for which the viewing/solar geometry of MODIS and VIIRS match. Application of these adjustment factors to the VIIRS L1B prior to ingestion into the CLDMSK and CLDPROP algorithms yields improved intersensor agreement, particularly for cloud optical properties.

TI  - The Post-Colonial Turn: Experiences, Trauma and Cross-Border Sensitivities
T2  - REVISTA CRITICA DE CIENCIAS SOCIAIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes the "post-colonial turn" as a movement that is not limited to the epistemological debate or the aesthetic construction of the text. I argue that the post-colonial turn gives centrality to what I call knowledge-testimony, which occurs from the experience of a collective trauma: colonialism-racism. In this perspective, I argue that their categories are formulated from other places of speech, which are, at the same time, places of affections. In dialogue with the "affective turn", I explain the iconic trajectories of Frantz Fanon and Edward Said in order to expose the experiences of exile, diaspora, suffering and hybridity that configure the special structure of feelings in Raymond Williams' terms that imbues such intellectual productions. Therefore, the return to the post-colonial founding authors allows for the extracting of provocations which promote the vitality of the current post-colonial turn.

TI  - Historical and Modern Seismicity of the Semipalatinsk Test Site
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the current maps of general seismic zoning of the Republic of Kazakhstan (2006), the territory of the Semipalatinsk Test Site (STS) is considered an aseismic region. However, recent investigations and an analysis of archived data have shown that the Test Site territory and its vicinity have experienced and still experience tectonic and induced earthquakes. The maximum magnitude of recorded earthquakes is 5-5.9. An analysis of global seismological bulletins and data on historical seismicity from literature sources is performed to solve the problem of seismicity in the STS region. Historic analog seismograms of earthquakes have been collected since 1925; the earthquake parameters are estimated more precisely. Modern instrumental seismic data of the Kazakhstan monitoring network since 1994 are processed, as is the data of temporary networks of seismic stations operating on the territory of the test site in 2005-2010 in the region of the Sary-Uzen, Balapan, and Degelen test sites. These works resulted in the creation of a common earthquake catalogue for the STS territory and its vicinity from 1783 up to the present. Macroseismic data of the felt earthquakes have been collected; strong motion records have been analyzed. Deep faults dividing Earth's crust blocks have been marked out. Tectonic elements are located by decoding the Landsat space images and using materials of geologic and topographic surveys. The calculations show that the STS territory can experience events with intensity 6 based on the MSK-64 scale.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of high-resolution satellite imagery in detecting ephemeral water bodies over West Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pastoralism is a major occupation in Africa's Sahel region, which spans from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east and has a semi-arid climate. Pastoralists from the region are usually nomadic, moving regularly in search of water and pasture, often for hundreds of kilometers. Traditionally, pastoralists have relied on historical knowledge and transhumance pathways to reach the water bodies (WB). Due to climatic conditions, a vast majority of the WBs in this region are small, sporadic, and ephemeral, therefore there is a need to map and frequently monitor water availability. Remote sensing observations can be used to complement current monitoring efforts. High-resolution near-daily imagery from the recently launched PlanetScope (PS) constellation of small satellites has the potential to complement the existing medium-resolution and infrequent but well established and extensively calibrated sensors like Landsat. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance and applicability of high-resolution PS data to detect and monitor WBs in the Ferlo region of West Africa, in comparison to Landsat-8 imagery. The results indicate that for cloud-free days, PS data was comparable (r > 0.88; ubRMSE < 0.01) to Landsat, but due to inadequate cloud masking, the results were poor for cloudy days (r < 0.49 and ubRMSE > 0.058). The PS images were able to detect nearly 95% of the WBs, whereas Landsat was able to identify only 32% at the water fraction threshold > 40%. Initial results from this study show that the high spatial and temporal resolution PS datasets show promise in monitoring WBs in arid regions of West Africa.

AB  - This Commentary asserts that multicultural competence necessarily must be included within the discussion of both the medical model and contextual/constructionist models of psychotherapy. Doing so centers cultural frameworks in understanding how and why psychotherapy is effective and ultimately may further enhance the positive impact that psychotherapy has for diverse communities. We present client worldview and an in-depth discussion of indigenous Latinx healing practices as specific examples of how a focus on multicultural competence can further extend constructionist/contextual understandings of psychotherapy.

TI  - Late Romantic Reflections by Valentin Bibik
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the ways of recreating the stylistic properties of late romanticism in the symphonies of the Ukrainian composer V. Bibik (1940-2003). The master's openness to contacts with various national cultures manifested itself in the circumstances of his life and in the breadth of artistic interests, among which the musical traditions of late romanticism occupied a special place. The affinity of V. Bibik's composing individuality to the romantic worldview is confirmed by the emphasis on the personality beginning, the monologue nature of the utterance, the sharpness of the reaction to the dissonances of life. Neo-romantic tendencies in the art of music of the last third of the last century stimulated the "meeting" of the modern Ukrainian author with the spiritual and aesthetic heritage of the 19th century. The path traversed by V. Bibik in this direction reflects the gradual maturation of the composer's creative dialogue with the heritage of the previous culture: from the first obvious responses to late romanticism in the Fifth Symphony, through the testing of its recognizable features on the national-Ukrainian material in the vocal Sixth Symphony to the poems by T. Shevchenko to a kind of "triptych" of symphonic concepts of the Seventh - the Eighth - the Ninth. In them, stylistic signs of late romanticism cover all levels of artistic structure (spiritual, meaningful, dramaturgic, compositional, form-building, and thematic). At the same time, the composer is not engaged in modelling certain genre, stylistic parameters, but transforms the borrowed musical realities into signs, including them into his own ideological imaginative concept. As a result, they turn from "strangers" into "friends", organically entering the individual stylistic context of the author. The constancy of V. Bibik's artistic and aesthetic reference points can be judged by the author's subsequent unnumbered Symphonies to the texts by M. Tsvetaeva and J. Brodsky, respectively. Their performing group - a vocal solo and a symphony orchestra - refers to the late romantic experiments of creating a special genre variety: the orchestral vocal cycle.

TI  - Caspian Sea is eutrophying: the alarming message of satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The competition over extracting the energy resources of the Caspian Sea together with the major anthropogenic changes in the coastal zones have resulted in increased pollution and environmental degradation of the sea. We provide the first evaluation of the spatiotemporal variation of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) across the Caspian Sea. Using remotely sensed data from 2003 to 2017, we found that the Caspian Sea has suffered from a growing increase in Chl-a, especially in warmer months. The shallow parts of the sea, near Russia and Kazakhstan, especially where the Volga and Terek rivers discharge large nutrient loads (nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich compounds) into the sea, have experienced the highest variations in Chl-a. The Carlson's trophic state index showed that during the study period, on average, about 12%, 26%, and 62% of the Caspian Sea's area was eutrophic, mesotrophic, and oligotrophic, respectively. The identified trends reflect an increasing rate of environmental degradation in the Caspian Sea, which has been the subject of conflict among its littoral states that since the collapse of the Soviet Union have remained unable to agree on a legal regime for governing the sea and its resources.

TI  - Comparison of multi-source satellite data for quantifying water quality parameters in a mining environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth and associated anthropogenic activities such as mining are posing a major threat to water resources. Remote sensing provides valuable information for assessing and monitoring water quality and quantity, and thus supports sustainable water management. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of various remote sensing techniques for quantifying water quality parameters, however, more needs to be done to exploit the growing number of satellite sensors available to the public. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performances of individual and combined bands of Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, ASTER and SPOT 6 data as predictors of water quality parameters of open water bodies in a mining area. We applied the all-subsets regression approach to explore all possible candidate models from which selection was made based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), coefficient of determination (adjR2) and Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE). Two secondary objectives that make use of the products of the all-subsets regression approach were added in the study. This included comparison of a parsimonious model containing few predictors with the model that was ranked the best but containing more predictors; and comparison of models consisting of similar bands across sensors per water quality parameter. In general, all sensors yielded promising estimation accuracies, particularly for SAR, permanent hardness and cations (RMSE < 50% of observed means). Sentinel-2 bands produced the best estimations followed by Landsat 8 bands for most water quality parameters, chiefly due to the greater number of bands these sensors possess compared to ASTER and SPOT 6 sensors. All sensors provided alternative models that used fewer predicting bands than the best-ranked models (lowest AIC) and still showed comparable accuracies with the lowest AIC models for most variables (Pearson's correlation, r up to 0.9). Sentinel-2, in particular, had the most accurate, parsimonious models compared to the other sensors. Pairwise cross-sensor comparison of estimation models using similar bands revealed the best matches when a model consisted of blue band only (r > 0.95) for most parameters while the similarity decreased as the number of predicting bands increased. Furthermore, the best similarities were obtained between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 sensors compared to the other pairs, indicating the potential of replacing one in the absence of the other. The findings of this study showed the advantage of commonly used remotely-sensed data for estimating, and by extension monitoring, water quality parameters in open water bodies. In addition, the results revealed that few, specific bands carry information relevant to characterise most of the water quality parameters considered in the study. We recommend similar studies for different seasons, considering the need to monitor water quality throughout the year.

TI  - Mapping soil moisture and their correlation with crop pattern using remotely sensed data in arid region
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is an important aspect of precision irrigation water management. Soil moisture content affects several factors such as vegetation cover, evapotranspiration (ET) and crop growth. This study aims to predict soil moisture content using optical remote sensing data and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data and the correlation with crop pattern. The study was carried out in the east of Nile Delta of Egypt (30 & DEG; 31 to 30 & DEG; 33 N, 31 & DEG; 55 to 31 & DEG; 05 E). A number of 100 surface soil samples (0-10) were collected to represent different soil types in the study area. Soil moisture index (SMI) is assessed based on thermal remote sensing data as Land Surface Temperature (LST) besides, Sentinel-1 data. The results showed a high correlation between SMC and SMI, coefficient of determination (R2) reached 0.81 between actual soil moisture and SMI. Furthermore, a significant correlation was also shown by Sentinel-1 data, with R2 0.83 between actual soil moisture content and backscattering coefficient (dB). The thermal data gives significant results to predict soil moisture content. The Accurate discrimination of crop varieties is considered as effective factor in explaining the distribution of soil moisture where moisture is associated with the crop type. These results can be useful as a good indicator for irrigation control at large scale.& COPY; 2019 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Semiautomated Mapping of Benthic Habitats and Seagrass Species Using a Convolutional Neural Network Framework in Shallow Water Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Benthic habitats are structurally complex and ecologically diverse ecosystems that are severely vulnerable to human stressors. Consequently, marine habitats must be mapped and monitored to provide the information necessary to understand ecological processes and lead management actions. In this study, we propose a semiautomated framework for the detection and mapping of benthic habitats and seagrass species using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Benthic habitat field data from a geo-located towed camera and high-resolution satellite images were integrated to evaluate the proposed framework. Features extracted from pre-trained CNNs and a "bagging of features" (BOF) algorithm was used for benthic habitat and seagrass species detection. Furthermore, the resultant correctly detected images were used as ground truth samples for training and validating CNNs with simple architectures. These CNNs were evaluated for their accuracy in benthic habitat and seagrass species mapping using high-resolution satellite images. Two study areas, Shiraho and Fukido (located on Ishigaki Island, Japan), were used to evaluate the proposed model because seven benthic habitats were classified in the Shiraho area and four seagrass species were mapped in Fukido cove. Analysis showed that the overall accuracy of benthic habitat detection in Shiraho and seagrass species detection in Fukido was 91.5% (7 classes) and 90.4% (4 species), respectively, while the overall accuracy of benthic habitat and seagrass mapping in Shiraho and Fukido was 89.9% and 91.2%, respectively.

TI  - A Multi-Sensor Comparative Analysis on the Suitability of Generated DEM from Sentinel-1 SAR Interferometry Using Statistical and Hydrological Models
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation model (DEM) plays a vital role in hydrological modelling and environmental studies. Many essential layers can be extracted from this land surface information, including slope, aspect, rivers, and curvature. Therefore, DEM quality and accuracy will affect the extracted features and the whole process of modeling. Despite freely available DEMs from various sources, many researchers generate this information for their areas from various observations. Sentinal-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are among the best Earth observations for DEM generation thanks to their availabilities, high-resolution, and C-band sensitivity to surface structure. This paper presents a comparative study, from a hydrological point of view, on the quality and reliability of the DEMs generated from Sentinel-1 data and DEMs from other sources such as AIRSAR, ALOS-PALSAR, TanDEM-X, and SRTM. To this end, pair of Sentinel-1 data were acquired and processed using the SAR interferometry technique to produce a DEM for two different study areas of a part of the Cameron Highlands, Pahang, Malaysia, a part of Sanandaj, Iran. Based on the estimated linear regression and standard errors, generating DEM from Sentinel-1 did not yield promising results. The river streams for all DEMs were extracted using geospatial analysis tool in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. The results indicated that because of the higher spatial resolution (compared to SRTM and TanDEM-X), more stream orders were delineated from AIRSAR and Sentinel-1 DEMs. Due to the shorter perpendicular baseline, the phase decorrelation in the created DEM resulted in a lot of noise. At the same time, results from ground control points (GCPs) showed that the created DEM from Sentinel-1 is not promising. Therefore, other DEMs' performance, such as 90-meters' TanDEM-X and 30-meters' SRTM, are better than Sentinel-1 DEM (with a better spatial resolution).

TI  - Extraction of Land Information, Future Landscape Changes and Seismic Hazard Assessment: A Case Study of Tabriz, Iran
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exact land cover inventory data should be extracted for future landscape prediction and seismic hazard assessment. This paper presents a comprehensive study towards the sustainable development of Tabriz City (NW Iran) including land cover change detection, future potential landscape, seismic hazard assessment and municipal performance evaluation. Landsat data using maximum likelihood (ML) and Markov chain algorithms were used to evaluate changes in land cover in the study area. The urbanization pattern taking place in the city was also studied via synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) and single look complex (SLC). The age of buildings was extracted by using built-up areas of all classified maps. The logistic regression (LR) model was used for creating a seismic hazard assessment map. From the results, it can be concluded that the land cover (especially built-up areas) has seen considerable changes from 1989 to 2020. The overall accuracy (OA) values of the produced maps for the years 1989, 2005, 2011 and 2020 are 96%, 96%, 93% and 94%, respectively. The future potential landscape of the city showed that the land cover prediction by using the Markov chain model provided a promising finding. Four images of 1989, 2005, 2011 and 2020, were employed for built-up areas' land information trends, from which it was indicated that most of the built-up areas had been constructed before 2011. The seismic hazard assessment map indicated that municipal zones of 1 and 9 were the least susceptible areas to an earthquake; conversely, municipal zones of 4, 6, 7 and 8 were located in the most susceptible regions to an earthquake in the future. More findings showed that municipal zones 1 and 4 demonstrated the best and worst performance among all zones, respectively.

TI  - A Comparative Study of SVM and RF Methods for Classification of Alteration Zones Using Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and mapping of the significant alterations are the main objectives of the exploration geochemical surveys. The field study is time-consuming and costly to produce the classified maps. Therefore, the processing of remotely sensed data, which provide timely and multi-band (multi-layer) data, can be substituted for the field study. In this study, the ASTER imagery is used for alteration classification by applying two new methods of machine learning, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The 14 band ASTER and 19 derivative data layers extracted from ASTER including band ratio and PC imagery, are used as training datasets for improving the results. Comparison of analytical results achieved from the two mentioned methods confirmed that the SVM model has sufficient accuracy and more powerful performance than RF model for alteration classification in the study area.

TI  - A remote sensing study of spatiotemporal variations in drought conditions in northern Asir, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in vegetation land cover are influenced by, and therefore an indicator of, climatic conditions. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between vegetation cover changes and drought events in a small-scale area. Six Landsat images during 1987-2019 were used to extract information about the vegetation land cover changes using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in Balqarn Governorate in the northern mountains of Asir, Saudi Arabia. Two climatic parameters, temperature and precipitation, were used as time series for the same period and were decomposed to investigate the seasonal and trend changes for each parameter. The two parameters were also used to calculate the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) to conduct an in-depth analysis of the drought events influencing vegetation cover. The results showed that the state of the vegetation coverage of the study area remained at a medium level with an average NDVI value, but the FVC values showed evidence of dynamic variability associated with drought and moisture events. The SPEI showed that the study area has been undergoing a long-duration drought event since 2004, ranging from light to severe drought, which was consistent with the time series decomposition results. This investigation has revealed that drought drives changes in vegetation cover and is expressed on small geographic scales as changes in the vegetation cover structure. The framework described here is simple and can be used to evaluate and manage drought risks.

TI  - Detection of Ebola Virus Antibodies in Fecal Samples of Great Apes in Gabon
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a large study conducted on wild great ape fecal samples collected in regions of Gabon where previous human outbreaks of Ebola virus disease have occurred between 1994 and 2002, we provide evidence for prevalence of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV)-specific antibodies of 3.9% (immunoglobulin G (IgG)) and 3.5% (immunoglobulin M (IgM)) in chimpanzees and 8.8% (IgG) and 2.4% (IgM) in gorillas. Importantly, we observed a high local prevalence (31.2%) of anti-EBOV IgG antibodies in gorilla samples. This high local rate of positivity among wild great apes raises the question of a spatially and temporally localized increase in EBOV exposure risk and the role that can be played by these animals as sentinels of the virus's spread or reemergence in a given area.

AB  - High Andean ecosystems, such as grasslands and peatlands, are fragile and, due to the effects of climate change, their sustainability is being jeopardized. A key factor hampering sustainable management efforts from the government and communities, is the lack or scarcity of in-situ eco-hydrological and climate data. In that sense, remote sensing techniques offers a powerful alternative for the assessment of the evolution of these ecosystems, by providing a holistic view of the territory. The objective of this work is to determine both the spatial and temporal evolution of the local atmospheric temperature of the Apacheta micro-basin in Ayacucho over the past 34 years, using the soil surface temperature (SST) as a proxy. For this, thermal data of Landsat series (TM, ETM+ and TIRS sensors), covering the period from 1985 to 2018, were used. The TSS estimates were made from the emissivity correction of the brightness temperatures at the top of the atmosphere, considering the negligible atmospheric effect due to the conditions of high atmospheric transmissivity in the study area. The results show a positive trend of the SST with an increase of 4.9 degrees C, equivalent to 27.5% of the SST. Trends are higher (5.8 degrees C) in the snowy areas (equivalent to 35.3% of the TSS in the whole micro-basin). The SST in the snow area explains the 83.6% of the behavior of the snow cover derived by the NDSI, with a decreasing surface as SST increase.

TI  - Axillary management after neoadjuvant treatment
T2  - MINERVA CHIRURGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Since its introduction nearly 30 years ago, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard technique to stage the axilla for the great majority of patients with early breast cancer. While the accuracy of SLNB in clinically nodenegative patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is similar to the upfront surgery setting, modifications of the technique to improve the false negative rate are necessary in node-positive patients at presentation. Currently, patients who present with matted nodes, cN1 patients who fail to downstage to cN0 with NAC and those with pathological residual disease have an indication to undergo axillary lymph node dissection. Ongoing trials will confirm if extensive nodal irradiation can replace surgery in patients with residual nodal disease after NAC and if nodal radiotherapy can be omitted in patients who achieve nodal pathological complete response. The aim of this review was to focus on the open questions on the management of the axilla after NAC.

TI  - Correlation between concentrations of chlorophyll-α and satellite derived climatic factors in the Persian Gulf
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Monthly mean satellite derived Chl-alpha, aerosols, wind, SST, PAR, and turbidity datasets were used to investigate the possible factors regulating phytoplankton variability in the Persian Gulf. The spatial correlation analysis revealed two distinct regions of SST and PAR, and a relatively uniform spatial correlation pattern of the other parameters. The cross correlation between aeolian dusts and Chl-alpha was significantly positive with 1-3 months offset. The pattern of spatial correlation between Chl-alpha and SST was positive in the shallow regions without time lag, and was negative with time offset of 3-5 months in deeper regions. The cross correlation between Chl-alpha and north-ward winds were positive with time lags of 1-3 months. Vertical mixing under the influence of north-ward winds in the deeper region, availability of light and nutrients in the shallow regions, and dust fertilizations over the whole area were suggested to be the major controlling factors regulating phytoplankton growth.

TI  - Comparison of housing construction systems in the huasteca zone: Vernacular, industrialized and hybrid. Study cases
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, in the rural communities of northeastern Mexico, where the Huasteca Zone is located, there is a great diversity of materials and construction systems with which users have built their homes due to improvisation caused by the lack of resources to have adequate housing and lack of planning of it. It is common to find houses based on materials from each region as houses whose main inputs are already completely industrialized, in addition to a large number of houses in which the user made substitutions of materials by mixing elements of each system previously described. This document deals with an analysis of construction costs of three construction systems present in Huasteca: a house built on vernacular materials in the state of Veracruz, a house with industrialized inputs existing in the state of Tamaulipas, selected for their construction system and surface area among 120 sampled homes, and finally a housing prototype, developed by the author, whose construction system takes elements of the two systems listed previously, getting a sustainable project, to subsequently make comparisons of the unit construction cost of the three systems. It is alos calculated its depreciation due to their energy consumption, through a proposed energy consumption factor. After analyzing the budgets of each house, including the material, labor and tools necessary for its elaboration, it was determined that housing based on local materials is the most economical of the three, the unit cost of industrialized input housing is more than three times higher than the local materials housing, and the unit cost of the housing prototype described in this document represents less than twice of the local materials housing. Regarding their energy consumption, the best case is the vernacular house with the lower value. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Microorganisms and spatial distribution of the sinkholes of the Yucatan Peninsula, underestimated biotechnological potential?
T2  - WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To detect the spatial distribution of the sinkholes of the Peninsula of Yucatan (SPY) and identify those cenotes where microorganisms have been registered. Methods: The geographic coordinates of the SPYs were obtained from various databases, as well as from scientific publications relating to the terminology 'sinkholes', 'karst systems' and 'cenotes'. All coordinates were transformed into the Universal Transverse Mercator reference system (UTM) with datum WGS84. An infrared composite image was created with 432 RGB bands from the Landsat 8 satellite. The points with the location of the cenotes were imported into the Software TerrSet. Results: Total 1026 coordinates of sinkholes were recorded in the Yucatan Peninsula. In 18 sinkholes (<2%), microorganisms have been recovered and identified in various taxonomic levels, and only 6 sinkholes (<0.6%) has their biotechnological potential been evaluated. Conclusions: The microorganisms that inhabit the sinkholes of the Yucatan Peninsula are a reservoir with practically unexplored biotechnological potential.

TI  - Landscape fragmentation in coffee agroecological subzones in central Kenya: a multiscale remote sensing approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smallholder agroecological subzones (AEsZs) produce an array of crops occupying large areas throughout Africa but remain largely unmapped. We explored multisource satellite datasets to produce a seamless land-use and land-cover (LULC) and fragmentation dataset for upper midland (UM1 to UM4) AEsZs in central Kenya. Specifically, the utility of PlanetScope, Sentinel 2, and Landsat 8 images for mapping coffee-based landscape were tested using a random forest (RF) classifier. Vegetation indices, texture variables, and wavelength bands from all satellite data were used as inputs in generating four RF models. A LULC baseline map was produced that was further analyzed using FRAGSTAT to generate landscape metrics for each AEsZs. Wavelength bands model from Sentinel 2 had the highest overall accuracy with shortwave near-infrared and green bands as the most important variables. In UM1 and UM2, coffee was the dominant cover type, whereas annual and other perennial crops dominated the landscape in UM3 and UM4. The patch density for coffee was five times higher in UM4 than in UM1. Since Sentinel 2 is freely available, the approach used in our study can be adopted to support land-use planning in smallholder agroecosystems.

TI  - MONITORING OF PASTURE DEGRADATION AND INCORPORATION OF AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE MEDIO ARAGUAIA/MT MICROREGIONS
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of pasture degradation evolution and the incorporation of agricultural activities in the Medio Araguaia/MT microregion was do through land use and land cover mapping with the thematic classes pasture, exposed soil, agriculture, water bodies and remaining vegetation at 1998 and 2018, using Quantum-gis and Spring Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The images are from the satellite Landsat 5 sensor Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Sensor Operational Land Imager (OLI), available from Imaging Division (DGI) of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). It was observed that the spatial dynamics of pasture and crop areas showed little change for the municipalities of Cocalinho and Novo Santo Antonio, with predominance of pasture areas in the analyzed years (1998 and 2018). The municipalities of Barra do Garcas and Araguaiana showed the greatest change in this dynamic, with the incorporation of large areas of crops, especially in Barra do Garcas in areas previously occupied by exposed soil and pasture areas. The general dynamics of the microregion present replacement of pastures by agricultural activities in all analyzed municipalities, but with different intensities.

TI  - Effect of propofol-based procedural sedation on risk of adverse events in a French emergency department: a retrospective analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives:Propofol is widely used today outside the operating room to facilitate painful procedures. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the frequency and type of complications related to a propofol-based procedural sedation protocol used in a French emergency department.Methods:This retrospective study reviewed the records over a 6-year period of all patients-adults and children-who received propofol for procedural sedation according to a pre-established protocol. The frequency and type of adverse events related to this sedation were recorded. Adverse events were classified according to the World Society of Intra-Veinous Anaesthesia International Sedation Task Force as sentinel, moderate, minor, or minimal.Results:During the study period, 602 patients-395 adults (66%) and 207 (34%) children-received propofol. The main indications for procedural sedation were fracture (n = 327) and dislocation (n = 222) reduction, pleural drain placement (n = 34), and abscess incision (n = 12). Among the 602 consecutive cases, we identified 90 adverse events (14.9%; 95% confidence interval: 12-17.7%). These 90 events were classified as 1 sentinel (hypotension episode), 5 moderate (2 airway obstruction and 3 apnea episodes), 83 minor, and 1 minimal risk-averse events. There were no adverse outcomes.Conclusion:Nearly all of the adverse events in our series were minor. In the French medical system, the use of propofol outside the operating room by non-anesthesiologist physicians for procedural sedation appears safe.

M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - An 86-year-old woman underwent mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy for cStage ⅡA breast cancer. The subtype of tumor was triple negative breast cancer. Pulmonary metastasis was found 1 month after surgery. Chemotherapy was done because of her good performance status(PS)and her hope. Administration of S-1 produced SD status of tumor for 8 months. However, NCC-ST-439 was increased and tumor size was enlarged. Therefore, the second line of chemotherapy by low-dose- biweekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab was planned because of her high age and good PS. Thereafter, tumor maker levels dramatically decreased and lung metastasis turned to be small. This therapy had been continued without any severe adverse events for 9 months. Unfortunately, this therapy was failed because of proteinuria, but pulmonary metastasis kept favorable efficacy during administration. Biweekly low-dose paclitaxel and bevacizumab therapy can be safe and effective therapy even for elderly patient with recurrent and metastatic breast cancer.

TI  - Snow and Ice Thickness Retrievals Using GNSS-R: Preliminary Results of the MOSAiC Experiment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The FSSCat mission was the 2017 ESA Sentinel Small Satellite (S3) Challenge winner and the Copernicus Masters competition overall winner. It was successfully launched on 3 September 2020 onboard the VEGA SSMS PoC (VV16). FSSCat aims to provide coarse and downscaled soil moisture data and over polar regions, sea ice cover, and coarse resolution ice thickness using a combined L-band microwave radiometer and GNSS-Reflectometry payload. As part of the calibration and validation activities of FSSCat, a GNSS-R instrument was deployed as part of the MOSAiC polar expedition. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate expedition was an international one-year-long field experiment led by the Alfred Wegener Institute to study the climate system and the impact of climate change in the Arctic Ocean. This paper presents the first results of the PYCARO-2 instrument, focused on the GNSS-R techniques used to measure snow and ice thickness of an ice floe. The Interference Pattern produced by the combination of the GNSS direct and reflected signals over the sea-ice has been modeled using a four-layer model. The different thicknesses of the substrate layers (i.e., snow and ice) are linked to the position of the fringes of the interference pattern. Data collected by MOSAiC GNSS-R instrument between December 2019 and January 2020 for different GNSS constellations and frequencies are presented and analyzed, showing that under general conditions, sea ice and snow thickness can be retrieved using multiangular and multifrequency data.

TI  - Ecological footprint and total material requirement as environmental indicators of mining activities: Case studies of copper mines
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of mineral resources negatively affects the natural environment, which is a topic of urgent discussion in sustainable natural resource use/management. In this study, we explored appropriate environmental indicators of mining activities that might be easy to account for and deemed suitable as a first-order estimation of overall environmental impacts. We distinguish the differential impact between operations rather than providing a strictly estimated integrated single indicator value. Considering the increasing interests in land use change and associated impacts, ecological footprint (EF) was chosen as first indicator, and Total Material Requirement (TMR) was also chosen to complement EF. Both the operational and remote-sensing based satellite data were used in this study by using three copper mines as case studies. The results propose that EF for built-up land works well by showing above the ground impacts for mining activities and TMR complements EF with its ability to reflect the underground activities.

TI  - HUMANITARIAN RESISTANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF DIGITALISATION OF EDUCATION
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. In the context of a pandemic, significant transformations in education have occurred: the urgent shift to new forms of learning and digitalisation of the learning process have become a challenge to the traditional understanding of education as a public good, based on humanistic grounds. In the media and social networks, there was a public debate over the prospects of the education for several months. The disparity in opinions and not always accurate determination of the positions of the authors of numerous publications highlight the need for analysing the situation in modern education from the standpoint of axiology and cultural studies.Aim. The present publication is aimed to consider the current changes in education in the conditions of digitalisation and to identify the potential of humanistic pedagogy.Methodology and research methods. The study is based on an interdisciplinary methodology, which integrates the achievements of the humanities and social sciences. The method of cluster analysis, content analysis in the mass media and social media, supplemented by group identification analysis, were employed.Research results. According to the findings of the present study, it was concluded that the contemporary processes in Russian education can be described from the point of view of trauma theory. The author introduces the concept of "humanitarian resistance", which is referred to the forms of symbolic protest, based on the values of humanism, national and cultural traditions, and non-violence. Furthermore, the author proposes a primary classification of the forms of humanitarian resistance in Russian education, including worldview, axiological, socio-psychological and pedagogical aspects. In the current article, the essence of each aspect is disclosed on specific examples.Scientific novelty of the conducted research lies in the theoretical justification of the analysis of current educational practices from a philosophical and cultural point of view. The introduction of new categories into scientific circulation allows for an adequate description of the current processes in education. The article is debatable, involving the discussion on the problems of education as a public good and the teacher as a bearer of the humanistic tradition in terms of digitalisation.Practical significance of the research consists in the possibility of using its results to determine the prospects of educational policy in the digital society, as well as to develop the strategies and to select teacher training routes in new conditions.

TI  - Use of local and global maps of forest canopy height and aboveground biomass to enhance local estimates of biomass in miombo woodlands in Tanzania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Field surveys are often a primary source of aboveground biomass (AGB) data, but plot-based estimates of parameters related to AGB are often not sufficiently precise, particularly not in tropical countries. Remotely sensed data may complement field data and thus help to increase the precision of estimates and circumvent some of the problems with missing sample observations in inaccessible areas. Here, we report the results of a study conducted in a 15,867 km2 area in the dry miombo woodlands of Tanzania, to quantify the contribution of existing canopy height and biomass maps to improving the precision of canopy height and AGB estimates locally. A local and a global height map and three global biomass maps, and a probability sample of 513 inventory plots were subject to analysis. Model-assisted sampling estimators were used to estimate mean height and AGB across the study area using the original maps and then with the maps calibrated with local inventory plots. Large systematic map errors - positive or negative - were found for all the maps, with systematic errors as great as 60-70 %. After being calibrated locally, the maps contributed substantially to increasing the precision of both mean height and mean AGB estimates, with relative efficiencies (variance of the field-based estimates relative to the variance of the map-assisted estimates) of 1.3-2.7 for the overall estimates. The study, although focused on a relatively small area of dry tropical forests, illustrates the potential strengths and weaknesses of existing global forest height and biomass maps based on remotely sensed data and universal prediction models. Our results suggest that the use of regional or local inventory data for calibration can substantially increase the precision of map-based estimates and their applications in assessing forest carbon stocks for emission reduction programs and policy and financial decisions.

TI  - The collective enunciation of the dead as a rewriting of Mexican history in Pedro Paramo by Juan Rulfo
T2  - QUESTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work tries to glimpse the inscription vehicles of Mexican history in Pedro Paramo by Juan Rulfo, contemplating the European conquest, the caciquismo and the Zapatista revolution. It will be argued that the novel allows us to conceive the historical event from the constant return of the symbolic and effective violence exerted on the subaltern indian and peasant subjects, analyzing the way in which the enunciation of the dead reveals events hidden by the dominant discursive formations. In this sense, the oral accounts of the dead reveal what the written archive silences, calling into examination the exercise of colonial, ecclesiastical and cacical power, through formal transcultural strategies. In this way, the figuration of violence, carried out, among other resources, through the review of narrative parameters of the Western worldview and the inarticulate way of enunciation of the dead, is contrasted with the exotic and idyllic image of Latin America propelled by the writings of the Latin American boom, putting in question the precursor character on this that literary criticism usually grants to the novel.

TI  - Investigating the effect of land use changes on soil erosion using RS-GIS and AHP-Fuzzy based techniques (Case Study: Qaresu Watershed, Ardabil, Iran)
T2  - NEXO REVISTA CIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of soil erosion to occur in a region depends on multiple factors including climatic conditions, elevation, terrain, soil type, and land use. Among these factors, land use is one of the particular importance as it reflects the outsized role of humans in the exacerbation of erosion condition. This study aimed to investigate the effects of land use changes on soil erosion in Qaresu watershed, using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques, a watershed with an area of 4370.8 km2 located in the center of Ardabil province, northwest of Iran. For this purpose, the 1985 and 2015 Landsat images captured by TM and OLI-TIRS sensors were used to develop the land use maps of the watershed area using the maximum likelihood method. The erosion zoning maps were then developed by integrating the maps of land use, slope, lithology, distance from roads, distance from streams, precipitation, and soil using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method after an AHP-based weighting stage. The results showed that in the 30-year period from 1985 to 2015, the region has experienced a decrease in the area of forest, dry farming, and rangeland land uses and an increase in the area of land uses defined as urban, barren, irrigated farming, and water cover. In total, dry farming and rangeland were the largest land-uses in the studied area. According to the developed erosion zoning maps, in 1985, 14.4% and 36.84%, and in 2015, 15.64% and 32.3% of the studied area belonged to high and very high risk zones in terms of erosion potential, respectively. In defined two periods, high risk and very high risk zones were mostly positioned over dry and irrigated farmlands.

TI  - Patterns of use and outcomes of sentinel lymph node mapping for patients with high-grade endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. ObjectiveInvestigate patterns of use and outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx) among patients with apparent early stage high-grade endometrial carcinoma.MethodsPatients diagnosed between 2012 and 2015 with grade 3 endometrioid, serous, clear cell carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma, apparently confined to the uterus who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy were identified in the National Cancer Database. Performance of SLNBx or systematic lymphadenectomy (LND) was assessed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare overall survival (OS) between the two groups. OS was evaluated following generation of Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with the log-rank test. A Cox model was constructed to evaluate survival after controlling for confounders.ResultsA total of 2882 patients were identified. The overall rate of SLN use was 16.1% with an increase in its use per year of diagnosis from 7.5% in 2012 and 12.1% 2013 to 17.1% in 2014 and 25.2% in 2015, p < 0.001. Higher rates of SLNBx use were noted among academic facilities compared to non-academic (18.8% vs 13.1%, p < 0.001). The rate of positive lymph nodes in the LND and SLNBx groups were comparable (13.3% vs 10.5%, p = 0.10). There was no difference in OS between patients who had SLNBx (n = 460) and LND (n = 920), p = 0.86; 3-year OS rates were 84.3% and 86.8%, respectively. After controlling for lymph node status, depth of myometrial invasion, administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, there was no difference in survival between the LND and SLNBx groups (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.85, 1.64).ConclusionsA rapid increase in the use of SLNBx among patients with apparent early stage high-grade endometrial carcinoma was noted during the study period. SLNBx was not associated with worse survival.

TI  - Role of an Altitudinal Zonal Basis and Remote Sensing Data in the Sustainable Management of Mountain Forests
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper substantiates the necessity of improving the principles of using natural basis for ecosystem-focused forest management in mountain conditions using all the collected knowledge, regional databases, and new remote sensing facilities. The results of applying the spectral features of vegetation using the thermal range for studying the altitudinal differentiation of forest cover are given based on the example of the mountains of the Altai-Sayan region. Thus, forest-steppe, subtaiga light-coniferous small-leaved deciduous, mountain dark coniferous chern, mountain dark coniferous taiga, and subalpine classes of altitudinal belt complexes (ABC) can be defined in the Yenisei part of the Sayans. Particular forest-management systems should be used for each of them, taking into account the natural features of forests and their management purpose. One important task for mountain forestry and whole multipurpose forest use is to improve the ecological and geographical basis and present it in the form of medium-scale maps, which reflect not only the formational composition of forest cover, but also the altitudinal classes of ecosystems. Modern satellite remote sensing systems coupled with GIS technologies open up new possibilities for forest cover inventory, monitoring, and study methods. This makes it possible to introduce a high-quality natural basis into forest management, which is currently highly relevant at all levels of forest planning: from exploitation projects for separate forest plots to forest plans of federal subjects of the Russian Federation.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates various combinations of data fusion techniques at Pixel, Feature, and Decision level for crop classification using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Resourcesat-2 LISS (Linear Imaging Self Scanning) III, optical data for Yadgir District of Karnataka, India. For Pixel level data fusion, techniques such as brovey transformation (BT), principal component analysis (PCA), multiplicative transformation (MLT), and wavelet with IHS (intensity-hue-saturation) were used. Results were compared between different fusion techniques visually, statistically (using universal image quality index), and through image classification (Rule-based and Maximum likelihood) for major crops (Rice, Cotton, and Pigeon pea) in the area. The estimated crop area for all three major crops was compared with the Government statistics. Among the four pixel-level fusion techniques used, the wavelet method performed best in retaining the image quality. However, the study showed that using the feature-level fusion technique, maximum accuracy was obtained for Rice crop. In contrast, the decision-level fusion improved the efficiency for other crops (Cotton and Pigeon pea).

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTHROPOD-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Southeastern Iran has been established as an area with the potential to harbor Asian tiger mosquito populations. In 2013, a few numbers of Aedes albopictus were detected in three sampling sites of this region. This field study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of various traps on monitoring mosquitoes and status of this dengue vector, in five urban and 15 suburban/rural areas.Methods: For this purpose, four adult mosquito traps (BG-sentinel 2, bednet, Malaise, and resting box trap) were used and their efficacy compared. In addition, large numbers of CDC ovitraps were employed, within 12 months.Results: A total of 4878 adult samples including 22 species covering five genera were collected and identified from traps. It was not revealed any collection of Ae. albopictus. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in meteorological variables between the two periods, the previous report and the current study. There were significant differences in the total number of mosquitoes collected by various traps in the region across different months.Conclusion: The resulting data collected here on the efficiency of the various trap types can be useful for monitoring the densities of mosquito populations, which is an important component of a vector surveillance system. While the presence of Ae. albopictus was determined in this potential risk area, there is no evidence for its establishment and further monitoring needs to be carried out.

TI  - New mapping metrics to test functional response of food webs to coastal restoration
T2  - FOOD WEBS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recovery of natural energy flow in food webs is an important indication that a restoration project has been a success, yet is typically considered a challenging component of post-restoration monitoring protocols. Advancements in remote sensing and SIA offer unique opportunities to build and test new metrics that more easily measure food web recovery following restoration. Here, we combine fine-scale remotely sensed data with SIA mixing model outputs to demonstrate a method for creating energetic landscape maps, or E-scapes, that assess the energetic quality of a multi-year marsh restoration effort for white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus). These maps explicitly link spatial features with the resources used by a consumer to allow managers to visualize and quantify how a restored landscape is producing energy for a target species. Our results support many known restoration paradigms concerning the relationship between habitat cover and use, highlighting its potential usefulness for monitoring purposes. With further testing and development, these products could also be used in the design of restoration projects and increase their potential for success. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Clinical course of von Szily reaction: Case report and comprehensive review of the literature.
T2  - American journal of ophthalmology case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a rare case of von Szily reaction (VSR) accompanied by a comprehensive review of the literature.OBSERVATIONS: A 57-year-old woman with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) associated with ipsilateral sectoral scleritis and anterior uveitis (sclerouveitis) subsequently developed contralateral necrotizing retinitis, leading to a diagnosis of VSR. A literature review revealed 10 additional cases of VSR. The full VSR cohort of 11 subjects included six women and five men, had a median age of 39 years (range 21-78 years), and most presented with HZO (n=7, 63.6%), often associated with either ipsilateral anterior uveitis (n=5; 45.5%) or keratitis (n=4; 36.4%). All 11 cases developed necrotizing retinitis in the fellow eye, at a median of six weeks following onset in the sentinel eye. The most frequently implicated agent was varicella zoster virus (VZV; n=8, 72.7%). A high proportion of the eight patients with VZV-associated VSR were identified as having increased risk of VZV reactivation, including age of 50 years or greater (n=5, 62.5%), an underlying malignancy (n=3, 37.5%), and/or use of immunosuppressive medication (n=2, 25.0%).CONCLUSION: This was the first reported case of VSR presenting as HZO-associated with sclerouveitis. A comprehensive literature review revealed that most previously reported cases presented with HZO associated with isolated anterior uveitis and/or keratitis, and that all reported cases of VSR developed necrotizing retinitis in the fellow eye, typically within two months of initial presentation. Patients with VZV-associated VSR often had known risk factors for VZV reactivation.

TI  - Mapping Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining in Senegal Using Sentinel 2 Data
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) represents a significant economic activity for communities in developing countries. In southeastern Senegal, this activity has increased in recent years and has become the main source of income for the local population. However, it is also associated with negative environmental, social, and health impacts. Considering the recent development of ASGM in Senegal and the difficulties of the government in monitoring and regulating this activity, this article proposes a method for detecting and mapping ASGM sites in Senegal using Sentinel 2 data and the Google Earth Engine. Two artisanal mining sites in Senegal are selected to test this approach. Detection and mapping are achieved following a processing pipeline. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to determine the optimal period of the year for mapping. Separability and threshold (SEaTH) is used to determine the optimal bands or spectral indices to discriminate ASGM from other land use. Finally, automatic classification and mapping of the scenes are achieved with support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The results are then validated based on field observations. The PCA and examination of spectral signatures as a function of time indicate that the best period for discriminate ASGM sites against other types of land use is the end of dry season, when vegetation is minimal. The classification results are presented as a map with different categories of land use. This method could be applied to future Sentinel scenes to monitor the evolution of mining sites and may also be extrapolated to other relevant areas in the Sahel.

TI  - Sensitivity of Fecal Immunochemical Test for Colorectal Cancer Detection Differs According to Stage and Location
T2  - CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are widely used for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. FITs detect most CRCs. Although detection of CRC at early stages is most relevant for reducing CRC mortality, there is limited evidence for the stage-specific sensitivity of the FIT in CRC detection. We estimated stage- and location-specific sensitivities of a quantitative FIT in a large cohort of patients with CRC.METHODS: Fecal samples were collected before treatment from 435 patients with newly diagnosed CRC. Sensitivities of a quantitative FIT (FOB Gold, Sentinel Diagnostics; Milano, Italy) for tumors of different T stages and overall TNM stages (according to Union for International Cancer Control) were calculated at the cutoff recommended by the manufacturer (17 mu g/g feces) and at alternative cutoffs, ranging from 10 to 40 mu g/g feces, overall and stratified by tumor location.RESULTS: At the cutoff recommended by the manufacturer, the FIT detected T1 tumors with 52% sensitivity (95% CI, 37%-67%), T2 tumors with 79% sensitivity (95% CI, 68%-88%), T3 tumors with 93% sensitivity (95% CI, 89%-95%), and T4 tumors with 84% sensitivity (95% CI, 72%-92%) (P-trend < .0001). The FIT detected stage I cancers with 68% sensitivity (95% CI, 57%-78%), stage II cancers with 92% sensitivity (95% CI, 87%-96%), stage III cancers with 82% sensitivity (95% CI, 73%-89%), and stage IV cancers with 89% sensitivity (95% CI, 80%-95%) (P-trend 0.01). The FIT detected T1 colorectal tumors with sensitivity values that were 22%-52% lower than for tumors of other T stages and stage I CRC with sensitivity values that were 11%-33% lower than for later-stage CRCs, at any of the evaluated cutoff values. The FIT detected T1 and stage I CRCs in the distal colon with sensitivity values of 32% and 52%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Although the FIT identifies patients with CRC with overall high sensitivity, it can miss approximately one-third of stage I CRCs. Studies are needed to increase noninvasive detection of early-stage CRC.

TI  - Quality indicators for the diagnosis and surgical management of breast cancer in South Africa
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Quality indicators (QIs) for breast cancer care have been developed and applied in high-income countries and contributed to improved quality of care and patient outcomes over time.Materials and methods: A modified Delphi process was used to derive expert consensus. Potential QIs were rated by a panel of 17 breast cancer experts from various subspecialties and across South African provinces. Each QI was rated according to importance to measure, scientific acceptability and feasibility. Scoring ranged from 1 (no agreement) to 5 (strong agreement). Inclusion thresholds were set a priori at mean ratings >= 4 with a coefficient variation of >= 25%. Levels of evidence were determined for each indicator.Results: The literature review identified 790 potential QIs. After categorisation and removal of duplicates, 52 remained for panel review. There was strong consensus for 47 which were merged to 30 QIs by exclusion of similar indicators and indicator grouping. The final set included eight QIs with level I or II evidence and two QIs with level III evidence which were deemed "mandatory" due to clinical priority and impact on care. The remaining QIs with lower-level evidence were grouped as eight "recommended" QIs (regarded as standard of care) and twelve "optional" QIs (not regarded as standard of care).Conclusion: A regional set of QIs was developed to facilitate standardised treatment and auditing of surgical care for breast cancer patients in South Africa. Routine monitoring of the ten mandatory QIs, which were selected to have the most substantial impact on patient outcome, is proposed. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Water Quality Retrieval from PRISMA Hyperspectral Images: First Experience in a Turbid Lake and Comparison with Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new era of spaceborne hyperspectral imaging has just begun with the recent availability of data from PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) launched by the Italian space agency (ASI). There has been pre-launch optimism that the wealth of spectral information offered by PRISMA can contribute to a variety of aquatic science and management applications. Here, we examine the potential of PRISMA level 2D images in retrieving standard water quality parameters, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in a turbid lake (Lake Trasimeno, Italy). We perform consistency analyses among the aquatic products (remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and constituents) derived from PRISMA and those from Sentinel-2. The consistency analyses are expanded to synthesized Sentinel-2 data as well. By spectral downsampling of the PRISMA images, we better isolate the impact of spectral resolution in retrieving the constituents. The retrieval of constituents from both PRISMA and Sentinel-2 images is built upon inverting the radiative transfer model implemented in the Water Color Simulator (WASI) processor. The inversion involves a parameter (g(dd)) to compensate for atmospheric and sun-glint artifacts. A strong agreement is indicated for the cross-sensor comparison of R-rs products at different wavelengths (average R approximate to 0.87). However, the R-rs of PRISMA at shorter wavelengths (<500 nm) is slightly overestimated with respect to Sentinel-2. This is in line with the estimates of g(dd) through the inversion that suggests an underestimated atmospheric path radiance of PRISMA level 2D products compared to the atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate the high potential of PRISMA level 2D imagery in mapping water quality parameters in Lake Trasimeno. The PRISMA-based retrievals agree well with those of Sentinel-2, particularly for TSM.

TI  - The catastrophic thermokarst lake drainage events of 2018 in northwestern Alaska: fast-forward into the future
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Northwestern Alaska has been highly affected by changing climatic patterns with new temperature and precipitation maxima over the recent years. In particular, the Baldwin and northern Seward peninsulas are characterized by an abundance of thermokarst lakes that are highly dynamic and prone to lake drainage like many other regions at the southern margins of continuous permafrost. We used Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Planet Cube-Sat optical remote sensing data to analyze recently observed widespread lake drainage. We then used synoptic weather data, climate model outputs and lake ice growth simulations to analyze potential drivers and future pathways of lake drainage in this region. Following the warmest and wettest winter on record in 2017/2018, 192 lakes were identified as having completely or partially drained by early summer 2018, which exceeded the average drainage rate by a factor of similar to 10 and doubled the rates of the previous extreme lake drainage years of 2005 and 2006. The combination of abundant rain- and snowfall and extremely warm mean annual air temperatures (MAATs), close to 0 degrees C, may have led to the destabilization of permafrost around the lake margins. Rapid snow melt and high amounts of excess meltwater further promoted rapid lateral breaching at lake shores and consequently sudden drainage of some of the largest lakes of the study region that have likely persisted for millennia. We hypothesize that permafrost destabilization and lake drainage will accelerate and become the dominant drivers of landscape change in this region. Recent MAATs are already within the range of the predictions by the University of Alaska Fairbanks' Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (UAF SNAP) ensemble climate predictions in scenario RCP6.0 for 2100. With MAAT in 2019 just below 0 degrees C at the nearby Kotzebue, Alaska, climate station, permafrost aggradation in drained lake basins will become less likely after drainage, strongly decreasing the potential for freeze-locking carbon sequestered in lake sediments, signifying a prominent regime shift in ice-rich permafrost lowland regions.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Climatology of Indiana Using In Situ and Remotely Sensed Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An intercomparison of multiresolution evapotranspiration (ET) datasets with reference to ground-based measurements for the development of regional reference (ETref) and actual (ETa) evapotranspiration maps over Indiana is presented. A representative ETref equation for the state is identified by evaluating 10 years of in situ measurements (200919). A statewide ETref climatology is developed using the ETref equation and high-resolution surface meteorological data from the gridded surface meteorological dataset (gridMET). For ETa analyses, MODIS, Simplified Surface Energy Balance Operational dataset (SSEBop), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) (versions 3.3a and 3.3b), and NLDAS (Noah and VIC) datasets are evaluated using AmeriFlux data. Thirty years of rainfall data from Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station Data Rainfall (CHIRPS) are used with the ET datasets to develop effective precipitation fields. Results show that the standardized Penman-Monteith equation performs as the best ETref equation with median symmetric accuracy (MSA) of 0.37, Taylor's skill score (TSC) of 0.89, and r(2) = 0.83. The analysis shows that the gridMET dataset overestimates wind speed and requires adjustment before a series of statewide ETref climatology maps are generated (1990-2020). For ETa, the MODIS and GLEAM(3.3b) datasets outperform the rest, with MSA=0.5, TSC=0.8, and r(2) = 0.8. The state ETa dataset is generated using all MODIS data from 2003 and blending the MODIS data with GLEAM (3.3b) to cover data unavailability. Using the top-performing datasets, annual ETref for Indiana is computed as 1110 mm, ETa as 708 mm, and precipitation as 1091 mm. A marginal increasing climatological trend is found for Indiana's ETref (0.013mmyr(-1)) while ETa is found to be relatively stable. The state's water availability, defined as rainfall minus ETa, has remained positive and stable at 0.99mmday(-1) (annual magnitude of 13820 mm).

TI  - Axillary reverse mapping in patients undergoing axillary dissection -a short review of the literature
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided not only in patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) but also in those with one or two positive SLNs receiving breast or axillary radiation. However, ALND has remained the standard treatment for patients with clinically positive nodes (cN+). Although axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was developed to map and preserve arm lymphatic drainage during ALND, it could not be indicated for cN + patients because metastatic rate of ARM nodes is high. However, a new type of conservative ALND with ARM attempts to preserve ARM lymphatics and nodes except SLNs and other suspicious palpable nodes, including suspicious ARM nodes. This procedure allowed reduction of the rate of arm lymphedema without increasing axillary recurrence, although patients received postoperative chemotherapy and high-risk patients underwent axillary radiation. Thus, a traditional full ALND may not be necessary for cN + patients in the era of effective multimodality therapy.

TI  - Observing Snow Cover and Water Resource Changes in the High Mountain Asia Region in Comparison with Global Mountain Trends over 2000-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of snow cover changes and of the related water resources in mountain areas has a key role for understanding the impact on several sectors such as ecosystem services, tourism and energy production. By using NASA-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2000 to 2018, this study analyzes changes in snow cover in the High Mountain Asia region and compares them with global mountain areas. Globally, snow cover extent and duration are declining with significant trends in around 78% of mountain areas, and the High Mountain Asia region follows similar trends in around 86% of the areas. As an example, Shaluli Shan area in China shows significant negative trends for both snow cover extent and duration, with -11.4% (confidence interval: -17.7%, -5.5%) and -47.3 days (confidence interval: -70.4 days, -24.4 days) at elevations >5500 m a.s.l. respectively. In spring, an earlier snowmelt of -13.5 days (confidence interval: -24.3 days, -2.0 days) in 4000-5500 m a.s.l. is detected. On the other side, Tien Shan area shows an earlier snow onset of -28.8 days (confidence interval: -44.3 days, -8.2 days) between 2500 and 4000 m a.s.l., governed by decreasing temperature and increasing snowfall. In the current analysis, the Tibetan Plateau shows no significant changes. Regarding water resources, by using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data it was found that around 50% of areas in the High Mountain Asia region and 30% at global level are suffering from significant negative temporal trends of total water storage (including groundwater, soil moisture, surface water, snow, and ice) in the period 2002-2015. In the High Mountain Asia region, this negative trend involves around 54% of the areas during spring period, while at a global level this percentage lies between 25% and 30% for all seasons. Positive trends for water storage are detected in a maximum 10% of the areas in High Mountain Asia region and in around 20% of the areas at global level. Overall snow mass changes determine a significant contribution to the total water storage changes up to 30% of the areas in winter and spring time over 2002-2015.

TI  - Optical clearing for photoacoustic lympho- and angiography beyond conventional depth limit <i>in vivo</i>
T2  - PHOTOACOUSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic (PA) imaging (PAI) is an emerging powerful tool for noninvasive real-time mapping of blood and lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes in vivo to diagnose cancer, lymphedema and other diseases. Among different PAI instruments, commercially available raster-scanning optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM) (iThera Medical GmbH., Germany) is useful for high-resolution imaging of different tissues with high potential of clinical translation. However, skin light scattering prevents mapping vessels and nodes deeper than 1-2 mm, that limits diagnostic values of PAI including RSOM. Here we demonstrate that glycerol-based tissue optical clearing (TOC) overcomes this challenge by reducing light scattering that improves RSOM depth penetration. In preclinical model of mouse limb in vivo, the replacement of conventional acoustic coupling agents such as water on the mixture of 70 % glycerol and 30 % ultrasound (US) gel resulted in the increase of tissue imaging depth in 1.5-2 times with 3D visualization of vessels with diameter down to 20 mu m. To distinguish blood and lymphatic networks, we integrated label-free PA angiography (i.e., imaging of blood vessels), which uses hemoglobin as endogenous contrast agent, with PA lymphography based on labeling of lymphatic vessels with exogenous PA contrast agents. Similar to well-established clinical lymphography, contrast agents were injected in tissue and taken up by lymphatic vessels within a few minutes that provided quick RSOM lymphography. Furthermore, co-injection of PA contrast dye and multilayer nanocomposites as potential low-toxic drug-cargo showed selective prolonged accumulation of nanocomposites in sentinel lymph nodes. Overall, our findings open perspectives for deep and high resolution 3D PA angioand lymphography, and for PA-guided lymphatic drug delivery using new RSOM & TOC approach.

TI  - Does Sentinel-1A Backscatter Capture the Spatial Variability in Canopy Gaps of Tropical Agroforests? A Proof-of-Concept in Cocoa Landscapes in Cameroon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A reliable estimation and monitoring of tree canopy cover or shade distribution is essential for a sustainable cocoa production via agroforestry systems. Remote sensing (RS) data offer great potential in retrieving and monitoring vegetation status at landscape scales. However, parallel advancements in image processing and analysis are required to appropriately use such data for different targeted applications. This study assessed the potential of Sentinel-1A (S-1A) C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter in estimating canopy cover variability in cocoa agroforestry landscapes. We investigated two landscapes, in Center and South Cameroon, which differ in predominant vegetation: forest-savannah transition and forest landscape, respectively. We estimated canopy cover using in-situ digital hemispherical photographs (DHPs) measures of gap fraction, verified the relationship with SAR backscatter intensity and assessed predictions based on three machine learning approaches: multivariate bootstrap regression, neural networks regression, and random forest regression. Our results showed that about 30% of the variance in canopy gap fraction in the cocoa production landscapes was shared by the used SAR backscatter parameters: a combination of S-1A backscatter intensity, backscatter coefficients, difference, cross ratios, and normalized ratios. Based on the model predictions, the VV (co-polarization) backscatter showed high importance in estimating canopy gap fraction; the VH (cross-polarized) backscatter was less sensitive to the estimated canopy gap. We observed that a combination of different backscatter variables was more reliable at predicting the canopy gap variability in the considered type of vegetation in this study-agroforests. Semi-variogram analysis of canopy gap fraction at the landscape scale revealed higher spatial clustering of canopy gap, based on spatial correlation, at a distance range of 18.95 m in the vegetation transition landscape, compared to a 51.12 m spatial correlation range in the forest landscape. We provide new insight on the spatial variability of canopy gaps in the cocoa landscapes which may be essential for predicting impacts of changing and extreme (drought) weather conditions on farm management and productivity. Our results contribute a proof-of-concept in using current and future SAR images to support management tools or strategies on tree inventorying and decisions regarding incentives for shade tree retention and planting in cocoa landscapes.

TI  - Mapping of Post-Wildfire Burned Area Using KOMPSAT-3A and Sentinel-2 Imagery: The Case of Sokcho Wildfire, Korea
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On April 4, 2019, a forest fire started in Goseong County and lasted for three days, burning the neighboring areas of Sokcho. The strong winds moved the blaze from one region to another region and declared the worst wildfire in South Korea in years. More than 1,880 facilities, including 400 homes, were burnt down. The fire burned a total area of 529 hectares (1,307 acres), which involved 13,000 rescuers and 16,500 military troops to control the fire occurrence. Thousands of people were evacuated, and two people are dead. This study generated post-wildfire maps to provide necessary data for evacuation and mitigation planning to respond to this destructive wildfire, also prevent further damage and restore the area affected by the wildfire. This study used KOMPSAT-3A and Sentinel-2 imagery to map the post-wildfire condition. The SVM showed higher accuracy (overall accuracy 95.29%) compared with ANN (overall accuracy of 94.61%) for the KOMPSAT-3A. Moreover, for Sentinel-2, the SVM attained a higher accuracy (overall accuracy of 91.52%) than the ANN algorithm (overall accuracy 90.11%). In total, four post-wildfire burned area maps were generated; these results can be used to assess the area affected by the Sokcho wildfire and wildfire mitigation planning in the future.

TI  - Assessing urban growth in Ghana using machine learning and intensity analysis: A case study of the New Juaben Municipality
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth coupled with economic, housing and environmental factors have significantly contributed into accelerated land use change in the New Juaben Municipality of Ghana. These factors have caused destruction of natural habitat and increased natural hazards such as flooding in the Municipality. Monitoring land use/land cover change is essential in respect to the dynamics of both human and natural factors that affect the biophysical and biochemical properties of the land surface. This research investigates the transitions among the major land use/land cover categories in the Municipality as a highly populated urban region that is facing some environmental challenges such as deforestation and degradation of the environment. Random Forest adopted for the classification of 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 land cover maps while the analysis of the dynamics was conducted using intensity analysis. The unique contribution of this article is the combine usage of machine learning algorithm and intensity analysis to assess the changes in land use/land cover. The results showed 1985-1991 and 2002-2015 periods experience fast change and the land use transformation has been accelerating over the whole period. The major changes were caused by the Built-up and Agricultural activities constituting 21.24 % and 13.19 % respectively in the category level. It is recommended that, authorities should consider several structural transformation measures within Ghana, including inter-sectoral land use harmonization icies (e.g. the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act 2016), land use planning and legal reforms to help address

TI  - Occult breast cancer: Where are we at?
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Review
AB  - Occult breast cancer (OBC) is described as an axillary metastatic carcinoma without detection of a primary breast lesion and is uncommon. Significant advances in breast imaging have occurred since its description, decreasing its incidence. However current management is based upon old studies, with variable clinical, radiological and pathological definitions of OBC. We suggest standardised definitions of OBC to facilitate more homogenous data representation in the literature. This review also discusses the conflicting heterogeneous data and its influence in determining the current management guidelines. We discuss whether the current significant surgical recommendations are necessary and postulate whether they could be safely substituted with less invasive management.

TI  - LEM+ dataset: For agricultural remote sensing applications
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Remote sensing allows obtaining information on agriculture regularly with non-invasive measurement approaches. Field data is crucial for adequate agricultural monitoring by remote sensing. However, public available field data are scarce, mainly in tropical regions, where agriculture is highly dynamic. The present publication aims to support the reduction of this gap. The LEM+ dataset provides information monthly about 16 land use classes for 1854 fields from October 2019 to September 2020 (one Brazilian agricultural year) from Luis Eduardo Magalhaes (LEM) and other municipalities in the west of Bahia state, Brazil. The reference data were collected in two fieldworks (March 2020 - first crop season, and August 2020 - second crop season). The boundaries of the fields visited in situ were delimited using Sentinel-2 false color compositions (near infrared - red - green) at 10 m spatial resolution. The land use classes were labeled monthly based on information collected in situ (agricultural land use and photographs) and by visual interpretation of Sentinel-2 false color composition (near infrared - shortwave infrared - red) and MODIS/Terra (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series. The dataset can be useful for the development of new pattern recognition methods for agricultural land use mapping and monitoring, comparison of different classification methods, and optical and SAR remote sensing time series analysis. This dataset contributes to complement previous initiatives [1,2] to make tropical agriculture field reference data publicly available. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Choosing pasture maps: An assessment of pasture land classification definitions and a case study of Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pasture land occupies extensive areas and is increasingly of interest for sustainable intensification, land use diversification, greenhouse gas emission mitigation, and bioenergy expansion. Accurate maps of pasture and other managed land covers are needed for monitoring, intercomparison, assessing potential uses, and planning. Yet, land maps can be generated from different types of classification datasets - i.e. as a land use or land cover type - as well as different sources. In this study our aim was to assess and compare land use and land cover definitions for pasture, and examine variability in the resulting pasture land classification maps. First, we conducted a review of pasture definitions in commonly used mapping databases. We then performed a case study involving Brazil, a dominant global producer of pasture-based livestock. Six geospatial databases were harmonized and compared to each other and to MODIS land cover for Brazil including the Cerrado and Amazon biomes, which are internationally recognized for their ecological value. Total pasture area estimates for Brazil ranged by a factor greater than four, from about 430,000 km(2) to over 1.7 million km(2). Our analysis showed high variability in pasture land maps depending on the definitions, methods and underlying datasets used to generate them. The results are illustrative of a symptomatic problem for all manage land datasets, demonstrating the need for land categories studies and geospatial data resources that fully define land terms and describe measurable management attributes. Additionally, the suitability of individual geospatial datasets for different types of land mapping must be better described and reported. These recommendations would help bring more consistency in the consideration of managed lands in research, reporting, and policy development, as demonstrated here for pasture land using six case study datasets from multiple sources.

TI  - An indicator based approach for assessing the vulnerability of riparian ecosystem under the influence of urbanization in the Indian Himalayan city, Dehradun
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian ecosystems are critical biological habitat that needs to be preserved. These systems face multiple stresses of altered water regime, increased human interference and biological invasion, climate change, land developments and other site-specific issues that may include eutrophication and urbanisation. In due course of urbanisation, riparian vegetation is replaced by both impervious and less permeable surfaces causing more frequent floods, greater total surface runoff, and decreased time to produce runoff. This may result in flooding of the city when a substantial rain is received. In this study, we evaluated the vulnerability of riparian zones in Dehradun city of India due to urbanisation using a series of indicators extracted from remote sensing data. The changes in the landscape pattern of the riparian zones were examined by analyzing and manipulating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets using Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS 10.1 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 software. Factors influencing the changes within the riparian area were identified using higher resolution image, existing base maps and reconnaissance surveys to qualify them as one of the indicators. Anthropogenic activities such as new residential buildings, infrastructure (such as roads), farming activities and commercial activities (industrial set up) were some of the factors contributing to the vulnerability of riparian zones. The final indicators in the form of riparian zone slope, extent of the riparian area, vegetation cover, human disturbance were mapped as raster layers and were integrated in a GIS environment to obtain final vulnerability map. This was intersected with settlement density map to categorize the vulnerability levels for three settlement density classes of low, medium and high. The findings reveal a significant land cover change within the riparian zones over a period of twenty years (2000 to 2019) with various levels of human encroachment. It was observed that 26.15% of the riparian area falls under low, 47.68% under medium, 12.98% under high, and 13.19% under very high vulnerability classes. Furthermore, the coverage percentage of high vulnerability class was largest in the low and high settlement density areas of riparian zones accounting for 36.96% and 51.48%, respectively. The majority of the area (74.36%) falls under medium vulnerability class under medium settlement density class. The study provides an opportunity to map riparian zone vulnerability considering predominant indicators of vulnerability that could be mapped using remotely sensed data and application of GIS tools.

AB  - A case of 69-year-old man underwent resection for the plantar surface of left foot malignant melanoma and received a sentinel biopsy of left inguinal lymph node. Two years and 10 months later, a mass of 30 mm in diameter in the ileum was detected by contrast-enhanced computed tomography, which showed abnormal uptake using FDG positron emission tomography. The partial intestinal resection was performed, and then, the mass was diagnosed as metastasis of malignant melanoma by pathological examination. Malignant melanoma is highly malignant disease that frequently shows distant metastasis. Although the malignant melanoma with distant metastasis shows poor prognosis, previous studies reported the prognosis could be improved when the patient could receive curative resection for single intraabdominal metastasis. Therefore, surgical resection should be considered for the single metastasis of malignant melanoma. We report a case of malignant melanoma with ileum metastasis resected curatively with literature review.

TI  - Urbanisation-induced displacements in peri-urban areas: Clashes between customary tenure and statutory practices in <i>Ugbo</i>-<i>Okonkwo</i> Community in Enugu, Nigeria
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation is precipitating wide-ranging and often irreversible changes in cities and at the shifting periurban areas around the world. As a significant factor of change in the 21st Century, urbanisation is irreversibly transforming everything on its path-air, land, water, and ecology, including institutions, customs, and lifestyles. The subject scope of urbanisation research is therefore quite wide and diverse. Yet, urbanisation-induced attritions and substitutions of customary tenure practices, coupled with the associated politics and resistances, remain utterly overlooked. Using a mixed method approach (involving desktop research, remote sensing data and stakeholder interviews), this paper examines the clashes between customary tenure regime and statutory practices dictated by urban laws, and how different stakeholders are appropriating them both to promote and resist displacement or eviction. Amidst growing encroachment pressures on peri-urban communities in Nigerian cities, a new imperative for enhanced tenure security and integrated planning approach are proposed.

TI  - Dengue, chikungunya and Zika in GeoSentinel surveillance of international travellers: a literature review from 1995 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: GeoSentinel is a global surveillance network of travel medicine providers seeing ill-returned travellers. Much of our knowledge on health problems and infectious encountered by international travellers has evolved as a result of GeoSentinel surveillance, providing geographic and temporal trends in morbidity among travellers while contributing to improved pre-travel advice. We set out to synthesize epidemiological information, clinical manifestations and time trends for dengue, chikungunya and Zika in travellers as captured by GeoSentinel.Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed on international travellers who presented with dengue, chikungunya or Zika virus infections to GeoSentinel sites around the world from 1995 until 2020.Results: Of 107 GeoSentinel publications, 42 articles were related to dengue, chikungunya and/or Zika. The final analyses and synthesis of and results presented here are based on the findings from 27 original articles covering the three arboviral diseases.Conclusions: Dengue is the most frequent arboviral disease encountered in travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites, with increasing trends over the past two decades. In Southeast Asia, annual proportionate morbidity increased from 50 dengue cases per 1000 ill returned travellers in non-epidemic years to an average of 159 cases per 1000 travellers during epidemic years. The highest number of travellers with chikungunya virus infections was reported during the chikungunya outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean in the years 2013-16. Zika was first reported by GeoSentinel already in 2012, but notifications peaked in the years 2016-17 reflecting the public health emergency in the Americas at the time.

TI  - <i>Trichinella nativa</i> and <i>Trichinella</i> T6 in arctic foxes (<i>Vulpes lagopus</i>) from northern Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasitic zoonotic nematodes of the genus Trichinella circulate in wildlife and domestic hosts worldwide through the ingestion of infected meat. Due to their role as scavengers and predators in terrestrial and marine arctic ecosystems, Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are ideal sentinels for the detection of Trichinella spp. In this study, we determined the prevalence, larval intensity, and species of Trichinella from 91 trapped Arctic foxes collected around the northern Canadian communities of Sachs Harbour (Ikaahuk) on Banks Island (n = 23), and Ulukhaktok and Cambridge Bay (Ikaluktutiak) on Victoria Island (n = 68). Using pepsin-HCl digestion, larvae of Trichinella spp. were recovered from the left forelimb muscle (flexor carpi ulnaris) in 19 of the 91 foxes (21% prevalence, 95% CI: 14-30%). For the first time in Arctic foxes in Canada, Trichinella species were identified using multiplex PCR that was followed up with PCR-RFLP to distinguish between T. nativa and T. chanchalensis. All infected foxes harbored T. nativa, and one fox was co-infected with Trichinella T6; the latter is a new host record. Age of the fox was significantly associated with Trichinella spp. infection and the odds of being infected were three times higher in foxes >= 2 years of age (p = 0.026), indicating cumulative exposure with age. While Arctic foxes are seldom harvested for human consumption, they serve as sentinel hosts of Trichinella spp., confirming the presence of the parasite in wildlife in the region.

TI  - Application of aerosol classification methods based on AERONET version 3 product over eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols released into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources and natural events affect human health, reduce visibility, and alter Earth's radiation budget. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a quantitative estimate of the amount of aerosol present in the atmosphere, and it can be used as a proxy for surface particulate matters. The AERONET is a network of ground-based sun photometers, providing globally AOD data. Long-term ground-based measurements from all point AERONET V3 Level 2.0 data at 10 sites in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region covering the countries of Turkey, Romania, Greece, Ukraine and Cyprus were used to determine spatial and temporal distribution of the selected aerosol parameters such as AOD at 440, 500, 870 nm (AOD(440), AOD(500), AOD(870)), Angstrom Exponent at 440-870 nm (AE(440-870)) and fine mode fraction at 500 nm (FMF500) for the period of 1999-2018. Since the combination of AOD, AE(440-870) and FMF500 enables categorization of aerosol types, two different classification methods were compared in the region. The first method (M1) divides the aerosols into three categories (marine, desert dust and continental) using the parameters of AOD(500) and FMF500 whereas the second method (M2) has five categorizations (marine, continental, biomass burning, desert dust, and mixed-type) using the parameters of AOD(440) and AE(440-870). The multiyear averaged AOD and AE spatiotemporal variability over the region was also presented at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.625 degrees based on MERRA2 reanalysis data. The results indicate that marine aerosol was the most predominant type in both methods while continental aerosol type was also obtained at a high rate over the region. The highest AOD occurred in summer, while lowest values were observed in winter. A high volume of fine-mode particles was observed during summer with higher AE values caused by carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning mainly observed at north-western part of the region. In contrast with that, coarse-mode particles, mainly dust, dominated with lower AE values during spring over the southern and eastern parts of the region.

TI  - Group membership and radicalization: A cross-national investigation of collective self-esteem underlying extremism
T2  - GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty, perceived threats, and a generally insecure life attachment have been associated with endorsement of extremism. Furthermore, salient identification with a group can influence radicalized ways of addressing insecure life attachment through an established and sometimes extreme worldview and ideology. In the present study, we replicated the finding that an insecure life attachment is associated with a higher degree of extremism endorsement. Furthermore, we found similarities and differences in how this association was influenced by various aspects of group membership across dissimilar contexts and among majority and minority groups (e.g., Muslims and non-Muslims) from Denmark (n = 223), India (n = 147), and the United Kingdom (n = 225). Consequently, our results indicate that general social psychological processes underlie radicalization and that different aspects of collective self-esteem can be central promoting or mitigating factors. Overall, our findings suggest an important interplay among life attachment, collective self-esteem, and extremism across Western and non-Western majority and minority groups.

T2  - SELCUK UNIVERSITESI TURKIYAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-SELCUK UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF STUDIES IN TURCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - "Structures of feeling", is one of the key concepts in the cultural theory of the literary and cultural critic Raymond Williams. He does not only try to explain structures of feeling in some of his works, but he also uses them in his literary critics. According to Williams, one of the key features of this concept is that it is mostly seen in the literature of the period and though it looks very similar to "ideology" or "worldview", structures of feeling includes specific qualities that those two concepts remain incapable. The concept of structures of feeling is found complicated and intangible by many critics including Terry Eagleton. Therefore, instead of trying to give its lexical meaning, following the course of the concept in Williams' texts will yield more useful results. One of these results is the fact that despite the lack of a clear definition, the structures of feeling have opportunities for Turkish literature historiography and criticism, but these opportunities are only possible with a criticism style similar to Williams' and a holistic view. In this context, it has been observed that Ahmet Hamdi Tanptnar's literary historiography has similar qualities to Williams' views in terms of his view of the concepts of culture (civilization) and his view of literary work as the product of certain social processes. Tanptnar's detections and Williams' concept of "feeling structures" have been found to intersect, especially in three points: the idea of Generation, the emergence of new literary genres, and emotion. In this study, after the history and definitions of Raymond Williams' concept of 'feeling structures" are given, these intersections will be addressed and the points that overlap with "feeling structures" in the XIX. Asir Turk Edebiyatt Tarihi by Tanpinar will be examined.

TI  - The Lore Dimensions of Islamic Art
T2  - CUMHURIYET ILAHIYAT DERGISI-CUMHURIYET THEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, it is often pointed out to a more specific area by using the term Sufi art on the basis of the aforementioned understanding. Thus, an analytic approach is adopted along with the usage of deductive method, and a layer of meaning is tried to be established through criticism and analysis. Firstly, a basic framework was constructed by mentioning the origins of Sufi art. Then the attention was drawn to the sacredness included in Sufi art in terms of its historical frame and ontological structure. It is asserted that Sufi art is based on four basic arguments: beauty, creativity, transcendence, and imagination. Sufis considered art as an activity of beauty and the expressive power of it. Relying on the basic motive that Allah is the Greatest Artist, the Sufis believe that the beauty of their art is a manifestation of Divine Names. They saw art as an expression of manifestation and unveiling. The Sufis, who deemed the world in terms of Divine Beauty (Jamal), witnessed the manifestations of the Divine Attribute of Beauty in all things; as a result of this witnessing, the masterpieces of Islamic art came into existence. It is the sapiental and the gnostic outlook that underlies this success of the Sufi orders (tariqa) in Islamic history. In Sufism, the perfection (kamal) presupposes the beauty (jamal); and each beauty presupposes also the perfection. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish beauty from perfection in the Sufi art. The sense of loving the beauty is so strong for them that they have tried to reflect the perfect beauty they witness in their works of art, to give an external presence to the phenomenon of beauty and to make the spiritual reality visible that is innate within their beings. Sufism is in a sense an effort to seek beauty. It has been an endless longing to seek, search and witness The All Beauty, that is God Himself. The effort to search for Divine Beauty is sometimes revealed by tune, and sometimes by harmonious words or by a single line. Then, they turn into music, poetry, calligraphy and illumination. According to the maxim stating "There is a path from heart to heart", these works were transmitted from one generation to another, ensuring the continuity of this Divine tune. Despite the fact that Sufi works make no pretensions to be art as such, they were widely accepted, influenced the masses and gained appreciation in that they were created by people with a sincere heart, intimate sentiments and a deep world of contemplation. The second stage of the gnostic dimension in Islamic arts has been tried to be expounded through the ultimate goal of Sufi art. In Sufi tradition, the aesthetics and sensitivity of art attract attention at every opportunity, but the Sufis did not consider art as their main aim. For them, art denotes only a means. Sufis, who appeal to the eyes, ears and mind with the artistic forms, endeavoured to permeate to the hearts with the spiritual atmosphere provided. With their performances, exuberance and success in different branches of fine arts, they mobilized the aesthetic sentiments in each person's nature and ensured that the human pleasure become accorded with the divine pleasure. Focusing on the sapiential and gnostic dimension of Islamic arts, the basic principles of Sufi art are emphasized as the third stage.It is also suggested that these principles also have a religious content are marked with religious style, have a strong sense of sacredness, possess generality and the peculiarity, have symbolic and representative aspects, are based on symbolism and have traditional characteristics, their style of expression is based on revelation, and are not intended to provoke carnal desires. As to the fourth remarkable factor within the sapiential and gnostic dimension of Islamic art, the Sufi worldview behind the mentioned artistic works is given. As to the fifth remarkable factor in the gnostic dimension of Islamic arts, the thought behind the world of art sustained in the dervish lodges (tekke) is discussed. These dervish lodges were emphasized as the most important places where the beautiful word, beautiful sound and beautiful line converge and these lodges were evaluated as the kitchen where the fine arts were prepared and as the boiler where the arts are cooked. It is due to these features that each of the dervish lodges in Ottoman Empire became a kind of education and fine arts centre. In these lodges, many musicians, composers, poets, illuminators, bookbinders, carvers, engravers and marbling masters were trained. While the dervishes in the dervish lodges exhibited their own unique works of art, they also carried out the requirements of their spiritual trainings (sayru suluk).

TI  - NO<sub>2</sub> levels after the COVID-19 lockdown in Ecuador: A trade-off between environment and human health
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative effects on human health, along with the fatalities caused by the new coronavirus, have led governments worldwide to take strict measures. However, a reduction in air pollution has been found in many regions on a global scale. This study is focused on how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting on the air quality in Ecuador, one of the most alarming cases of COVID-19 contagion in Latin America, occupying the first place as regards deaths per capita. The spatiotemporal variations in NO2 concentrations in 12 highly populated cities were evaluated by comparing the NO2 tropospheric concentrations before (2019) and after (2020) the COVID-19 lockdown. The atmospheric data was collected from the TROPOMI on the Sentinel-5P satellite of the European Space Agency. A reduction in NO2 concentrations (-13%) was observed as a consequence of the COVID-19 lockdown in Ecuador. However, this reduction occurred to the greatest extent in the cases of Guayaquil (-23.4%) and Quito (-22.4%), the two most highly populated cities. Linking NO2 levels to confirmed cases/deaths of COVID-19, a strong correlation between air NO2 concentrations and the cases/mortality caused by coronavirus (r = 0.91; p < 0.001) was observed. This work highlights the crucial role played by air quality as regards human health.

TI  - Plume Height Time-Series Retrieval Using Shadow in Single Spatial Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic plume height is a key parameter in retrieving plume ascent and dispersal dynamics, as well as eruption intensity; all of which are crucial for assessing hazards to aircraft operations. One way to retrieve cloud height is the shadow technique. This uses shadows cast on the ground and the sun geometry to calculate cloud height. This technique has, however, not been frequently used, especially not with high-spatial resolution (30 m pixel) satellite data. On 26 October 2013, Mt Etna (Sicily, Italy) produced a lava fountain feeding an ash plume that drifted SW and through the approach routes to Catania international airport. We compared the proximal plume height time-series obtained from fixed monitoring cameras with data retrieved from a Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager image, with results being in good agreement. The application of the shadow technique to a single high-spatial resolution image allowed us to fully document the ascent and dispersion history of the plume-cloud system. We managed to do this over a distance of 60 km and a time period of 50 min, with a precision of a few seconds and vertical error on plume altitude of +/- 200 m. We converted height with distance to height with time using the plume dispersion velocity, defining a bent-over plume that settled to a neutral buoyancy level with distance. Potentially, the shadow technique defined here allows downwind plume height profiles and mass discharge rate time series to be built over distances of up to 260 km and periods of 24 h, depending on vent location in the image, wind speed, and direction.

TI  - Epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of respiratory viruses from 2012 to 2015 - A sentinel surveillance report from union territory of Puducherry, India
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common illnesses affecting people of all ages worldwide. Viruses contribute to 30-70% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value.Methods: As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer.Results: During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (<= 13 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 (2012-2, 2015-2) as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period.Conclusion: Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are one type of coastal resources that has benefits in physical, biological, and economic wise. Mangrove ecosystems in Muara Gembong are ecosystems that are included in the category of protected forest. This research aims to estimate the area of mangrove forests and classify its canopy cover. The method used in this study is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and using sentinel imagery (with a spatial resolution of 10 m). The canopy cover classification applied in this study refers to the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry standards. Canopy cover data was validated with a densiometer to estimate the percentage of mangrove canopy cover. The results showed that the area of mangrove forests reached 301.83 ha with a high-density level or a tight cover class reaching 59.31% or 179.02 ha. The area of mangroves in Pantai Bahagia Village, Bekasi Regency, has increased from the last few years due to rehabilitation actions taken by several local communities.

TI  - Empirical relationships for remote sensing reflectance and <i>Noctiluca scintillans</i> cell density in the northeastern Arabian Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - A dinoflagellate under the ambit of Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB), the bioluminescent Noctiluca scintillans (NS), has been infesting the northern Arabian Sea increasingly over the last few decades during late winter. Their occurrence is found to be due to seasonal oscillations in the coastal currents. The physical and biogeochemical parameters associated with the seasonal blooms are reasonably well known. But accurate quantitative estimation capability using remote sensing sensors over the extensive oceanic regime is still lacking. This is especially due to a lack of information on bio-optical properties associated with cell density measurements. We attempted to show that remote sensing reflectance and chl-a show significant relationship e.g., R-rs(531)/R-rs(510) = 0.8261 + 6.06 x 10(-6)NS + 0.02323chl-a (N = 19, R-adj(2) = 0.99, p = 2.5 x 10(-17), RMSE = 0.1083) which is applicable over diverse areas of the northeastern Arabian Sea e.g., coastal, shelf and offshore regions. The model is supported by a second dataset with an RMSE of 0.022893 (N = 8) for the R-rs(531)/R-rs(510) ratio. The NS cell densities were derived from the Rrs(510)/Rrs(531) band ratio within reasonable error and accuracy limits. Including sensor capability at 510 nm is suggested in future satellite launches.

TI  - Estimation of the Grassland Aboveground Biomass of the Inner Mongolia Plateau Using the Simulated Spectra of Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate assessment of the grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is important for analyzing terrestrial ecosystem structures and functions, estimating grassland primary productivity, and monitoring climate change and carbon/nitrogen circulation on a global scale. Multispectral satellites with wide-width advantages, such as Sentinel-2, have become the inevitable choice for the large-scale monitoring of grassland biomass on regional and global scales. However, the spectral resolution of multispectral satellites is generally low, which limits the inversion accuracy of grassland AGB and restricts further application in large-scale grassland monitoring. For this reason, a satellite-scale simulated spectra method was proposed to enhance the spectral information of the Sentinel-2 data, and a simulated spectrum (SS) was constructed using this algorithm. Then, the raw spectrum (RS) of Sentinel-2 and the SS were used as data sources to calculate the vegetation indices (RS-VIs and SS-VIs, which represent vegetation indices calculated using RS and SS data, respectively), and the multi-granularity spectral segmentation algorithm (MGSS) was employed to extract spectral segmentation features (RS-SF and SS-SF, which represent segmentation features extracted by RS and SS data, respectively). Following this, these spectral features (RS-SF, SS-SF, RS-VIs, and SS-VIs) were used to estimate AGB by partial least-squares regression (PLSR) and multiple stepwise regression (MSR) models. Finally, the spatial distribution law and the reasons for the latitude zone of the Inner Mongolia Plateau were analyzed, based on precipitation, the average temperature, topography, etc. The conclusions are as follows. Firstly, the SS has more spectral information and its sensitivity to biomass is higher than the RS of Sentinel-2 in some bands, and the correlation between the SS-VIs and biomass is higher than that of the RS-VIs. Secondly, among the spectral features, the most accurate AGB estimation was obtained by SS-SF, which gave R-2 = 0.95. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 10.86 g/m(2) and the estimate accuracy (EA) was 82.84% in the MSR model. Additionally, RMSE = 10.89 g/m(2) and EA = 82.78% in the PLSR model. Compared with the traditional estimation methods using RS and VI, R-2 was increased by at least 0.2, RMSE was reduced by at least 14.08 g/m(2), and EA was increased by 22.26%. Therefore, the simulated spectra method can help improve the estimation accuracy of AGB, and a new idea about regional and global large-scale biomass acquisition is provided.

TI  - Climate Variability Impacts on Global Extreme Wave Heights: Seasonal Assessment Using Satellite Data and ERA5 Reanalysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the influences of major climate variability modes on global extreme significant wave height (SWH) during 1992-2016 using merged satellite altimeter records and ERA5 reanalysis data set. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), and Southern Annular mode (SAM) are considered during December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), June-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). A nonstationary generalized extreme value analysis is applied to seasonal maxima of SWH (Hmax) to identify the regions with significant impacts of climate variability. In addition to major impacts over the northeastern North Pacific (NP) and Maritime Continent during DJF, signature of ENSO in Hmax is observed over the southeast South Pacific during all seasons associated with the Pacific South America pattern and over the western NP during JJA and SON through the El Nino-East Asian teleconnection mechanism. Notable contribution of NAO to North Atlantic Hmax, resulting from north-south movement of storm track, is observed during DJF and MAM. Increased Hmax is concentrated around the northeast NP during the positive phase of NPO during DJF, which accompanies Aleutian low strengthening and suggests possible combined influence with ENSO. SAM influences on Hmax are characterized by a zonal pattern in the Southern mid- and high latitudes around the year, with seasonally distinct zonal extent and meridional shifts. Overall, the satellite and reanalysis data exhibit consistent results. Hmax responses are generally in accord with extreme wind and sea-level pressure gradient amplitude, supporting the wind-driven extreme wave mechanisms.Plain Language Summary Extreme ocean wave heights exert a profound effect on coastal livelihoods and infrastructure and understanding their variabilities is fundamental to making reliable risk analysis. Large-scale climate variability modes like El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), and Southern Annular mode (SAM) generate interannual variations in extreme ocean waves over different areas during different seasons. However, a comprehensive seasonal-specific assessment at global scale has not been conducted. Using satellite observations and reanalysis data, this study examines influences of these climate variability modes on seasonal extreme waves. In addition to its wintertime impact on northeast North Pacific, El Nino induces larger wave extremes over western North Pacific during boreal summer and autumn and lower wave extremes around southeast South Pacific all year round. The NAO drives the north-south dipole response over North Atlantic during winter and spring whereas the NPO makes a strong impact over the northeast North Pacific during winter with possible combined influences with ENSO. The seasonal variations in SAM affect extreme waves along different latitudes with different zonal extent. The response patterns of extreme waves instigated by these climate variability modes generally follow those of atmospheric teleconnection patterns.

TI  - PROBE Study: A Sentinel Surveillance System to Monitor Exposure of Belgian Employees to Hazardous Chemicals A Feasibility Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To test the feasibility of collecting reliable and representative data on exposure of Belgian employees to a selection of hazardous chemicals by using a sentinel surveillance method. Method: In PROBE (Hazardous chemical Products Register for Occupational use in Belgium), 47 occupational physicians were recruited as a sentinel network. Employees answered a web-based survey assessing their past week exposure to 22 chemicals. Results: 47% employees were exposed to at least one chemical. The most frequently reported exposures was to diesel exhaust (14%). The exposed employees were mostly older men, with most exposed during production and manufacturing, and working in smaller companies. For diesel exhaust, wood dust, and crystalline silica, 54%, 32%, and 20% of the exposed employees, did not use collective/personal protective equipment. Conclusion: Sentinel surveillance is a feasible method for obtaining high-quality data on the exposure of Belgian employees to hazardous chemicals.

TI  - Applying various satellite image processing methods on Aster and Landsat ETM+ data to identify and separate the alteration zones around gold mine of Akhtarchi, Khomein, Iran
T2  - NEXO REVISTA CIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area is located 100 km southeast of Arak and in two structural zones of Central Iran in the north and Sanandaj-Sirjan in the southern part. Regarding its geological structures, the area has become the source of important mines including the Akhtarchi gold mine, Aliabad iron mine, Ochestan feldspar mine, and Dali gold and copper mines. Therefore, promising areas for exploration activities are identified using the analysis of satellite images of ASTER and Landsat ETM + in the region to identify alteration areas. For this purpose, the necessary corrections were applied to the satellite images. Then, to identify the alteration parts related to the gold deposits, different satellite image processing methods of ETM + and ASTER were used. These methods include making a false-color composite, band ratio, Selective Principal Components Analysis (SPCA), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method, Spectral Information Divergence Classification (SID), Endmember Collection Dialog Components (ECDC), and innovative methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Angle Mapper, as well as unsupervised classification methods. In the end, the major alterations in the region were observed. In the obtained images, the prophylitic zone and the phyllic and argillic zones in the region were observed. To introduce the optimal method, the results of the various methods mentioned were compared with each other and with the current situation of the mines. The alteration zones were identified through band ratio and SAM methods and the combined methods with more power. Finally, SAM, 2:1 ratio, and the combined methods were identified as successful methods for more accurate separation of the alteration zones.

TI  - Mind the gaps: challenges in the clinical management of invasive candidiasis in critically ill patients
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review Strict adherence to clinical practice guidelines is recognized to improve outcomes but the inconvenient truth is that only a small subset of what is done in medicine has been tested in appropriate, well designed studies. In this article, we aim to review controversial aspects of the clinical management of invasive candidiasis recommended by guidelines. Recent findings Despite still being recommended by guidelines, we fail to identify a single randomized clinical trial documenting that the use of antifungal drugs in high-risk critically ill patients without microbiologic documentation of Candida infection decreases mortality. Regarding deep-seated Candida infections, most cohort studies of patients with candidemia found less than 5% of patients developed endophthalmitis and endocarditis. In this scenario, it is reasonable to reconsider routine universal screening of both complications in candidemic patients. Finally, a large number of studies have shown that critically ill patients usually have lower echinocandin exposure when compared with other populations. We need more data on the clinical relevance of this finding. We need robust studies to validate new strategies for the clinical management of candidemia in ICU, including: the use of fungal biomarkers in the early initiation or interruption of antifungal therapy in high-risk patients to replace the conventional empirical antifungal therapy driven by predictive rules; validation of targeted screening of eye infection and endocarditis with the aid of fungal biomarkers only in high-risk patients; we should clarify if higher doses of candins are necessary to treat invasive candidiasis in critically ill patients, especially in the case of intra-abdominal infections where drug penetration is suboptimal.

TI  - Update on new imaging technologies in sentinel node detection
T2  - MINERVA GINECOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - In most cancers, lymph node status is the most critical factor impacting the evolution of the disease and the overall survival. Identifying potential nodal metastasis allows the oncologist to adjust the stage and, consequently, the patient's treatment. For this reason, a precise evaluation of the regional nodes is mandatory. In gynecological cancers, pelvic, paraaortic, and inguinal nodes are the region most frequently interested by metastasis. In the past years, comprehensive lymphadenectomy was the standard of care for endometrial, cervical, ovarian, and vulvar cancers. However, after introducing the sentinel lymph node (SNL) biopsy in breast cancers, this technique has gained much more interest in gynecology oncology. Several studies have shown that SLN allows an evaluation of the node status without the complications related to the lymphadenectomy that impacts the patient's quality of life. In this review, we discuss the role of SNL biopsy in gynecological cancers and the technique's evolution over the years. Moreover, we debate the OSNA method for SLN analysis that is recently introduced for uterine cancer.

TI  - A Fast Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion Method (STF3DCNN) Using a Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growing development of remote sensors, huge volumes of remote sensing data are being utilized in related applications, bringing new challenges to the efficiency and capability of processing huge datasets. Spatiotemporal remote sensing data fusion can restore high spatial and high temporal resolution remote sensing data from multiple remote sensing datasets. However, the current methods require long computing times and are of low efficiency, especially the newly proposed deep learning-based methods. Here, we propose a fast three-dimensional convolutional neural network-based spatiotemporal fusion method (STF3DCNN) using a spatial-temporal-spectral dataset. This method is able to fuse low-spatial high-temporal resolution data (HTLS) and high-spatial low-temporal resolution data (HSLT) in a four-dimensional spatial-temporal-spectral dataset with increasing efficiency, while simultaneously ensuring accuracy. The method was tested using three datasets, and discussions of the network parameters were conducted. In addition, this method was compared with commonly used spatiotemporal fusion methods to verify our conclusion.

TI  - Multisensor Thermal Infrared and Microwave Land Surface Temperature Algorithm Intercomparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To ensure optimal and consistent algorithm usage within climate studies utilizing satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) datasets, an algorithm intercomparison exercise was undertaken to assess the various operational and scientific LST retrieval algorithms in use. This study was focused on several LST products including single-sensor products for AATSR, Terra-MODIS, SEVIRI, SSM/I and SSMIS; a Climate Date Record (CDR), which is a combined dataset drawing from AATSR, SLSTR and MODIS; and finally a merged low Earth orbit/geostationary product using data from AATSR, MODIS and SEVIRI. Therefore, the analysis included 14 algorithms: seven thermal infrared algorithms and seven microwave algorithms. The thermal infrared algorithms include five split-window coefficient-based algorithms, one optimal estimation algorithm and one single-channel inversion algorithm, with the microwave focusing on linear regression and neural network methods. The algorithm intercomparison assessed the performance of the retrieval algorithms for all sensors using a benchmark database. This approach was chosen due to the lack of sufficient in situ validation sites globally and the bias this limited set engendered on the training of particular algorithms. A simulated approach has the ability to test all parameters in a consistent, fair manner at a global scale. The benchmark database was constructed from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-analysis 5 (ERA5) atmospheric data, Combined ASTER and MODIS Emissivity for Land (CAMEL) infrared emissivity data, and Tool to Estimate Land Surface Emissivities at Microwave frequencies (TELSEM) emissivity data for the period of 2013-2015. The best-performing algorithms had biases of under 0.2 K and standard deviations of approximately 0.7 K. These results were consistent across multiple sensors. Areas of improvement, such as coefficient banding, were found for all algorithms as well as lines for further inquiry that could improve the global and regional performance.

TI  - What is new in the diagnosis and therapy of malignant melanoma?
T2  - DEUTSCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma incidence and mortality rates are increasing. The sentinel lymph node biopsy plays an important prognostic role and is pivotal for the decision to undergo an adjuvant therapy making it an important diagnostic tool. The lack of survival benefit in patients with sentinel lymph node-positive (SLN+) melanoma upon immediate complete lymphadenectomy (CLND) suggest a parallel and not stepwise development of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis thus questioning the role of immediate CLND. These findings also suggest adjuvant therapy may play a more important role for SLN+ melanoma patients than CLND. Recently, the PD-1 inhibitor Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab as well as the BRAF/MEK inhibitor Dabrafenib and Trametinib were approved for the adjuvant therapy of stage III malignant melanoma. Another novelty in the therapy of malignant melanoma is the approval of the first oncolytic virus, Talimogene laherparepvec, for the treatment of unresectable stage III and IV (M1a) melanoma. Significant progress has also been made in the treatment of patients with cerebral melanoma metastasis since studies indicate that both BRAF/MEK inhibitors and the immunotherapy with CTLA4 and PD-1 inhibitors are efficient in this group of patients. With this wide range of possible systemic therapies for advanced melanoma further studies regarding therapy sequence, combinations between targeted therapies and immunotherapy as well as biomarkers for treatment response are needed to help guide physicians find the optimal therapy for patients with advanced malignant melanoma.

TI  - Intercomparison of Burned Area Products and Its Implication for Carbon Emission Estimations in the Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon (C) emissions from forest fires in the Amazon during extreme droughts may correspond to more than half of the global emissions resulting from land cover changes. Despite their relevant contribution, forest fire-related C emissions are not directly accounted for within national-level inventories or carbon budgets. A fundamental condition for quantifying these emissions is to have a reliable estimation of the extent and location of land cover types affected by fires. Here, we evaluated the relative performance of four burned area products (TREES, MCD64A1 c6, GABAM, and Fire_cci v5.0), contrasting their estimates of total burned area, and their influence on the fire-related C emissions in the Amazon biome for the year 2015. In addition, we distinguished the burned areas occurring in forests from non-forest areas. The four products presented great divergence in the total burned area and, consequently, total related C emissions. Globally, the TREES product detected the largest amount of burned area (35,559 km(2)), and consequently it presented the largest estimate of committed carbon emission (45 Tg), followed by MCD64A1, with only 3% less burned area detected, GABAM (28,193 km(2)) and Fire_cci (14,924 km(2)). The use of Fire_cci may result in an underestimation of 29.54 +/- 3.36 Tg of C emissions in relation to the TREES product. The same pattern was found for non-forest areas. Considering only forest burned areas, GABAM was the product that detected the largest area (8994 km(2)), followed by TREES (7985 km(2)), MCD64A1 (7181 km(2)) and Fire_cci (1745 km(2)). Regionally, Fire_cci detected 98% less burned area in Acre state in southwest Amazonia than TREES, and approximately 160 times less burned area in forests than GABAM. Thus, we show that global products used interchangeably on a regional scale could significantly underestimate the impacts caused by fire and, consequently, their related carbon emissions.

TI  - Inclusion of GPS clock estimates for satellites Sentinel-3A/3B in DORIS geodetic solutions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - A unique architecture of Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites includes the shared ultra-stable oscillator (USO) by the DORIS and GPS receivers. This concept enables to apply onboard GPS clock estimates in the DORIS processing substituting the DORIS polynomial clock model by the GPS epoch-wise model, together with a DORIS-specific clock offset. Such an approach is particularly profitable for the mitigation of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) effect affecting the short-term frequency stability of the USO oscillator in the South America and South Atlantic region. The GPS clock behavior precisely maps the SAA effect and enables us to demonstrate a difference of the USO sensitivity to the SAA for Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B. We present world grid maps of clock time derivatives for both Sentinels, displaying a different sign of the direct effect and other differences in the USO memory/recovery effect. Moreover, we present the impact of SAA on 3D positioning where the largest SAA-related bias reaches several centimeters. We also determine an effect of the precise clock modeling on the Earth rotation parameter estimates. In addition to these improvements, the elimination of the SAA effect gives us an opportunity to get an almost SAA-free DORIS solution from Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites. Using the combined solution of both Sentinels as a reference, we estimate the SAA effect on the DORIS beacon positions also for satellites Jason-2, Jason-3, Saral, Cryosat-2 and Hy-2A and find significant positioning biases for all the recent satellites except Saral.

TI  - Infection prevention and control measures in practices of the Swiss sentinel network during seasonal influenza epidemics
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are limited data on the transmission of influenza in the context of primary care practices, despite the fact that a significant proportion of the population consult their primary care physician for an influenza-like illness every year.Aim: To describe the use of influenza prevention and control methods in private practices of the Swiss sentinel network.Methods: This online cross-sectional survey collected data about infection prevention and control measures in the 166 private practices of the Swiss sentinel surveillance network during the 2018-2019 influenza season. Questions pertained to the practice setting, infection prevention and control recommendations, influenza vaccination status of the physicians and their staff, adhesion to hand hygiene, and mask wearing.Findings: Among the 122 practices that answered (response rate 73.5%), 90.2% of the responding physicians had been vaccinated themselves, and 46.7% (56/120) estimated that their staff vaccination coverage was >60%, although it was offered to employees in all practices. Most practices (N=68, 55.7%) had no specific recommendations for their staff concerning mask wearing. Most physicians reported washing or disinfecting their hands before examining a patient (N=91, 74.6%), after examination (N=110, 90.2%) and before a medical procedure (N=112, 91.8%). However, this rate was lower for arrival at the practice (N=78, 63.9%) and leaving the practice (N=83, 68.0%).Conclusion: Most physicians in the Swiss sentinel surveillance network have been vaccinated themselves. However, the vaccination rates among their staff are low, despite vaccine availability. Hand hygiene measures were also suboptimal. These results warrant further efforts to implement infection prevention and control measures in the ambulatory setting. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Does ASCAT observe the spring reactivation in temperate deciduous broadleaf forests?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Scatterometer observations over land are sensitive to the water content in soil and vegetation, but have been rarely used to study seasonal changes in the plant water status and seasonal development of deciduous trees. Here we use Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) observations to investigate the sensitivity of C-band backscatter to spring phenology of temperate deciduous broadleaf forests in Austria. ASCAT's multi-angle looking capability enables the observation of backscatter over a large range of incidence angles. The vegetation status affects the slope of the backscatter-incidence angle relationship. We discovered a maximum in the slope around the month April, hereafter referred to as spring peak, predominantly in regions covered by deciduous broadleaf forest. We hypothesized that the spring peak indicates the average timing of leaf emergence in the deciduous trees in the sensor footprint. The hypothesis was tested by comparing the timing of the spring peak to leaf unfolding ob-servations from the PEP725 phenology database, to the increase of leaf area index (LAI) during spring, and to temperature. Our results demonstrate a good agreement between the ASCAT spring peaks, phenology ob-servations and temperature conditions. The steepest increase in LAI however lags behind the ASCAT peak by several days to a few weeks, suggesting that the spring peak in fact marks the timing of maximum woody water content, which occurs right before leaf emergence. Based on these observations, we conclude that the ASCAT signal has a high sensitivity to spring reactivation and in particular water uptake of bare deciduous broadleaf trees. Our findings might provide the basis for novel developments to estimate eco-physiological changes of forests during spring at large scales.

TI  - Water clarity changes in 64 large alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and the potential responses to lake expansion
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are essential components of the water cycle and ecosystems. Therefore, the ecology and water security of lakes is of great concern. However, on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is known as the Asian water tower, knowledge of lake water quality is in its infancy. In this study, we developed a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) retrieval model and used the proposed model to study the temporal and spatial dynamics of water clarity in 64 lakes (>50 km(2)) located on the TP during the 2003-2018 period. The results show that the 64 lakes have an average long-term mean Z(sd) of 4.4 +/- 3.0 m, where lakes in the northern TP generally exhibited lower Z(sd) levels than those located in the southern and northeastern parts of the TP. Among all selected lakes, the number of lakes showing (significantly) decreasing Z(sd) change trends was approximate to those showing (significantly) increasing change trends. Nevertheless, the two trends exhibited different spatial patterns. An analysis of the potential links between lake Z(sd) and environmental factors suggests that lake expansion is an essential factor affecting the increase in lake Z(sd), while such an impact may be offset by the increase in phytoplankton induced by climate change in lakes showing a significant Z(sd) decreasing trend. In addition, land use types are partially responsible for the Z(sd) disparities between different lakes since lakes with high Z(sd) commonly occurred with high vegetation cover in their surrounding areas, while glacial melting and hydrological networks showed minor influences. This study is expected to enhance our understanding of lacustrine environments in TP and other global alpine lakes under the scenario of climate change.

TI  - Relevance of sentinel lymph node biopsy for thick melanoma in the era of immunotherapy
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy provides prognostic information in patients with thick melanoma but is often underutilized. We examine regional lymph node evaluation (RLNE) in patients with thick melanoma and the effect on treatment and overall survival (OS). Methods: Patients with clinical T4N0M0 melanoma were selected from the National Cancer Database (2004-2015). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with RLNE and treatment. Overall survival analysis was performed. Results: A total of 14 286 patients with clinical T4N0M0 melanoma were identified; RLNE was performed in 70.2% of patients, and positive LNs were identified in 27.1%. RLNE was more likely in males (OR:1.44, 95%CI: 1.32-1.56, p < .001), and patients treated at academic centers (OR:1.58, 95%CI:1.46-1.71, p < .001). Immunotherapy was more commonly used in patients with RLNE (13.9% vs 3.4%, p < .001) and was associated with positive LNs (OR:2.50, 95%CI:2.19-2.86, p < .001). The 5-year OS for RLNE was 56.9% and for no RLNE was 32.7%. Independent factors associated with better OS were treatment at an academic center (HR:0.88, 95% CI:0.84-0.93, p < .001), and immunotherapy use (HR:0.86, 95%CI:0.76-0.96, p < .001). Conclusion: The use of RLNE in patients with thick melanoma is important for prognosis and to risk stratify patients for selection of adjuvant therapies and clinical trials.

TI  - Ultrasound-Guided Hook-Wire Localization for Surgical Excision of Non-Palpable Superficial Inguinal Lymph Nodes in Dogs: A Pilot Study
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryThe evaluation of regional/sentinel lymph nodes (LN) plays an important prognostic role and assists the clinical decision making in canine cancer patients; thus, surgeons are frequently asked to perform regional/sentinel lymphadenectomies together with management of the primary tumor sites, even when these are non-palpable and/or normal size LN. Several techniques have been described to localized regional/sentinel LN in a pre-surgical setting. The wire-guided localization is commonly used to localize non-palpable breast masses in women, with the aim to reduce surgical dissection and excision of unnecessary tissue and to reduce surgical time. This study describes the use of an ultrasound-guided hook-wire localization method to facilitate intraoperative localization of non-palpable superficial inguinal LN. The results of the present study suggest that this method is safe and effective and may allow a high rate of successful superficial inguinal LN excisions in dogs.The evaluation of loco-regional lymph nodes (LN) plays an important prognostic role and assists the clinical decision making in canine cancer patients. Excision of non-palpable LN can be challenging. The aim of the study was to evaluate surgical time, successful excision rate and surgical complications associated with the use of an ultrasound-guided hook-wire (UGHW) LN localization method for non-palpable superficial inguinal LN (SILN) in dogs. Dogs that presented for excision of non-palpable SILN, performed with the aid of an UGHW placement, were enrolled. Information including signalment, SILN width, UGHW placement and surgical procedure time, hook-wire position, successful excision and intra- and post-operative complications were reviewed. Seventeen dogs were enrolled. Median LN width was 3 mm (range 2-11). Median time of preoperative UGHW placement and surgical LN excision was 8 min and 15 min, respectively. Successful SILN excision was achieved in all cases. Two minor intra-operative (hook migration and wire fragmentation) and one minor post-operative complications (seroma) were observed. No major intraoperative or post-operative complications occurred. The UGHW LN localization method is safe and effective and may allow a high rate of successful SILN excisions in dogs. This method has the potential to facilitate LN excision for other superficial LN locations.

TI  - Mapping of the Canopy Openings in Mixed Beech-Fir Forest at Sentinel-2 Subpixel Level Using UAV and Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presented study demonstrates a bi-sensor approach suitable for rapid and precise up-to-date mapping of forest canopy gaps for the larger spatial extent. The approach makes use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) red, green and blue (RGB) images on smaller areas for highly precise forest canopy mask creation. Sentinel-2 was used as a scaling platform for transferring information from the UAV to a wider spatial extent. Various approaches to an improvement in the predictive performance were examined: (I) the highest R-2 of the single satellite index was 0.57, (II) the highest R-2 using multiple features obtained from the single-date, S-2 image was 0.624, and (III) the highest R-2 on the multitemporal set of S-2 images was 0.697. Satellite indices such as Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index (IPVI), Normalized Difference Index (NDI45), Pigment-Specific Simple Ratio Index (PSSRa), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI), Color Index (CI), Redness Index (RI), and Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) were the dominant predictors in most of the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The more complex ML algorithms such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Catboost that provided the best performance on the training set exhibited weaker generalization capabilities. Therefore, a simpler and more robust Elastic Net (ENET) algorithm was chosen for the final map creation.

TI  - Lymph node evaluation in endometrial cancer: how did it change over the last two decades?
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological malignancy in developed countries, and surgery represents the pivotal part of treatment. Hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy allow removing the primary tumor and defining patients at higher risk, who might benefit from adjuvant therapies. Minimally invasive surgery is associated with superior postoperative outcomes and represents a safe and effective approach for surgical staging of EC. The lymph node status evaluation in EC is still a matter of debate. Over the last twenty years much has changed, moving from a full systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy for staging purpose to the removal of the pelvic (with or without paraaortic) lymph nodes only in selected EC classes of risk. Two randomized trials failed to demonstrate survival benefits of lymphadenectomy in case of apparent early stage EC; however, its prognostic role has never been questioned. At present, with the aim of reducing the surgical-related morbidity, sentinel node mapping is emerging as a safe and valid alternative to lymphadenectomy for EC staging, demonstrating high accuracy and an increased detection of lymph nodes metastasis. Here, we performed a review of the most significant studies, which supported the changes in the lymph node status evaluation for EC over the last two decades.

TI  - Sensitivity of Multispectral Imager Liquid Water Cloud Microphysical Retrievals to the Index of Refraction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A cloud property retrieved from multispectral imagers having spectral channels in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and/or midwave infrared (MWIR) is the cloud effective particle radius (CER), a radiatively relevant weighting of the cloud particle size distribution. The physical basis of the CER retrieval is the dependence of SWIR/MWIR cloud reflectance on the cloud particle single scattering albedo, which in turn depends on the complex index of refraction of bulk liquid water (or ice) in addition to the cloud particle size. There is a general consistency in the choice of the liquid water index of refraction by the cloud remote sensing community, largely due to the few available independent datasets and compilations. Here we examine the sensitivity of CER retrievals to the available laboratory index of refraction datasets in the SWIR and MWIR using the retrieval software package that produces NASA's standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer suite (VIIRS) continuity cloud products. The sensitivity study incorporates two laboratory index of refraction datasets that include measurements at supercooled water temperatures, one in the SWIR and one in the MWIR. Neither has been broadly utilized in the cloud remote sensing community. It is shown that these two new datasets can significantly change CER retrievals (e.g., 1-2 mu m) relative to common datasets used by the community. Further, index of refraction data for a 265 K water temperature gives more consistent retrievals between the two spectrally distinct 2.2 mu m atmospheric window channels on MODIS and VIIRS. As a result, 265 K values from the SWIR and MWIR index of refraction datasets were adopted for use in the production version of the continuity cloud product. The results indicate the need to better understand temperature-dependent bulk water absorption and uncertainties in these spectral regions.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node in cervical cancer: a literature review on the use of conservative surgery techniques
T2  - MINERVA GINECOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sentinel lymph node detection is a surgical procedure that allow to avoid systematic lymphadenectomy in those tumors in early stage where lymph node spread is not sure. If the sentinel lymph node is not involved by tumor in 98-99% of case other lymph nodes are clean. The reason why less radical surgery is chosen is linked to the lower postoperative morbidity rate, the risk of lower limb lymphedema decreases. The aim of this review was to summarize what is the state of art of using the sentinel lymph node dissection (SLD) technique and what arc the future goals to improve the safety and the reliability.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We have conducted a review of the literature of the past 10 years to understand the attitudes of oncologist gynecologists in the world to the conservative treatment of cervical cancer. We only selected articles from 2010 onwards, which meet the inclusion criteria.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The detection rate varies from 83% to 100%. The bilateral detection rate, on the other hand, varies from 42% to 100%. The false negative rate ranges from 4% to 12%. Sensitivity varies from 20.7% (considering the frozen section) to 100%.CONCLUSIONS: Indocyanine green is the most reliable and performing tracer for the search of the sentinel lymph node; that the false intraoperative negative rate is too high to be sure not to subject the patient to an incorrect therapeutic procedure; data concerning the safety and survival of conservative lymphadenectomy (SLND) compared to systematic lymphadenectomy are still lacking in the literature and therefore we are awaiting the results of the two ongoing randomized clinical trials that will allow us to have more significant scientific data.

TI  - AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF DOMINANT CROP TYPES IN POLAND BASED ON SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - ARTIFICIAL SATELLITES-JOURNAL OF PLANETARY GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The assumption of the European Union Common Agricultural Policy is to maintain good agricultural practices for sustainability in the environment. A number of requirements are imposed on farmers, including the maintenance of permanent grassland, fallow land or crop diversification. To meet these requirements, the European Union guarantees subsidies, but at the same time fields must be monitored focusing on crop identification. The limitation of field inspection and substituting it with crop recognition using satellite images could increase the effectiveness of this procedure. The application of satellite imagery in automatic detection and identification of dominant crops over a large area seems to be technically and economically sound. The paper discusses the concept and the results of automatic classification based on a Random Forests classifier performed on multitemporal images of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. A test site was established in a complex agricultural structure with long and narrow parcels in the south-eastern part of Poland. Time-series images acquired during the growing season 2016 were used for multispectral classification in different configurations: for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 separately and for both sensors integrated. Different Random Forests approaches and post-processing methods were examined based on independent data from farmers' declarations records, reaching the best accuracy of over 90% for crops like winter or spring cereals. Overall accuracy of the classification ranged from 72% to 91% depending on the classification variant. The elaborated scheme is novel in the context of Polish complex agricultural structure and smallholders.

TI  - On the Change in the Sea Surface Temperature in the Benguela Upwelling Region: Part II. Long-Term Tendencies
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The issue of long-term tendencies in the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Benguela upwelling region and their causes is examined using the daily satellite data of the SST for 1985-2017 and the near-surface wind for 1988-2017. It is shown that in the Benguela upwelling region there has been a significant intensification of offshore winds in the last 20 years. This is accompanied by a decrease in the thermal upwelling index (taking into account the sign of the index or an increase in its absolute values) in the southern part of the Benguela upwelling, but it practically does not influence this indicator in its northern part. The probable cause for this difference is the change in the wind-field structure, which results in opposite trends in the magnitude of the wind stress curl in different parts of the Benguela upwelling. In the southern part of the Benguela upwelling, both the coastal upwelling and the vertical velocities due to the vorticity of the near-water wind intensify, while in its northern part the corresponding trends have opposite signs. This leads to a partial compensation of these two effects in the northern part of the Benguela upwelling. The cause for the change in the wind-field structure is the displacement of the center of the Subtropical High to the southeast and the concomitant reversal of the near-surface wind vectors in the coastal zone.

TI  - Regional and global contributions of air pollution to risk of death from COVID-19
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims The risk of mortality from the coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) is increased by comorbidity from cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Air pollution also causes excess mortality from these conditions. Analysis of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) outcomes in 2003, and preliminary investigations of those for SARS-CoV-2 since 2019, provide evidence that the incidence and severity are related to ambient air pollution. We estimated the fraction of COVID-19 mortality that is attributable to the long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate air pollution.Methods and result We characterized global exposure to fine particulates based on satellite data, and calculated the anthropogenic fraction with an atmospheric chemistry model. The degree to which air pollution influences COVID-19 mortality was derived from epidemiological data in the USA and China. We estimate that particulate air pollution contributed similar to 15% (95% confidence interval 7-33%) to COVID-19 mortality worldwide, 27% (13 - 46%) in East Asia, 19% (841%) in Europe, and 17% (6-39%) in North America. Globally, similar to 50-60% of the attributable, anthropogenic fraction is related to fossil fuel use, up to 70-80% in Europe, West Asia, and North America.Conclusion Our results suggest that air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19. This provides extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of COVID-19.

TI  - Relationship between Saury Fishing Grounds and Large-Scale Coherent Structures in the Ocean, According to Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - AVISO satellite data on the speeds of geostrophic currents from 2004 to 2018 are used to associate a substantial reduction in the saury catch in recent years with a change in the oceanographic situation in the Russian fishing grounds off the coast of the southern and middle Kuril Islands and Hokkaido Island. Lagrangian maps of the origin of water masses, calculated for this period of time on the basis of the AVISO field, and with overlaid positions of fishing vessels of Russia, Japan and Korea, show that this catastrophic reduction is due to a change in the pathways of the nutrient-rich subarctic waters of the Oyashio current in recent years. The greatest changes in the hydrological regime since 2015 were caused by intensification of the third branch of the Oyashio, which transports the waters of this current to the open ocean. At the same time, traditional fishing grounds off the eastern coasts of Hokkaido and southern Kurils have been reduced, while good fishing grounds have appeared in the open ocean.

TI  - The Ethnomental Components of F.M. Dostoevsky's Works
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the study: The purpose of the study is to identify the originality and ideological functional status of the ethnomental component in the works of F. Dostoevsky.Methods: The work integrates a complex of modern approaches and methods, mainly focusing on the ideas and principles of the traditional, cultural and historical method, which demonstrates the general cultural, sociological, and psychological aspects of the study of Dostoevsky's literary heritage. The typological method has contributed to the literary clarification of the ethnomental components in fiction and journalism of the writer. The narratological approach is used to analyze the narrative structure of Dostoevsky's works, the correlation of the writer's and other people's speech, to identify various points of views on the problem, and to establish the ambiguity of the writer's position. The contextual analysis allowed analyzing the images of characters, first, within the local context and, second, within the macrocontext, which includes other literary sources, appropriate comparisons and build a verification model of the study.Main results: The analysis of the writer's life, his philosophy of life, sacrifices, social ambivalence, predisposition to reflection, etc. suggests the presence of certain mental foundations. The main ideas, attitudes, spiritual discoveries of the artistic worlds created by the writer are determined by the ethnomental basis of his worldview. This makes it possible to determine and understand the originality and uniqueness of Dostoevsky in the context of Russian literature.Application of the study: The conclusions of the study can serve as the basis for an accurate idea of the correlation of the writer's worldview and his work. The materials and conclusions of the study can be used in university courses on the history of Russian literature, in special courses and special seminars on the works of Dostoevsky, for term papers, graduation papers, and dissertations.The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that the ethnic component in the ideological and artistic system of Dostoevsky who was a Pochvennik writer (i. e. belonged to the Pochvennichestvo movement) was first considered in the context and through the prism of both the life experience of the writer himself and the general anthropological orientation of the writer as well as his understanding of human nature. This study provides not only the opportunity to analyze the ethnic identity of Russian literature but also to trace the influence of the ethnic mentality of Dostoevsky on his worldview embodied in his fiction.

TI  - Modification of the Land Surface Temperature - Vegetation Index Triangle Method for soil moisture condition estimation by using SYNOP reports
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of soil moisture condition on a local or regional scale is one of the most important problems in vegetation conditions monitoring. One of the most suitable approach to do this over vegetated areas is the Land Surface Temperature - Vegetation Index (LST-VI) Triangle Method. This method estimates water content in soil which is available for plants in contrast to methods using satellite observations in the microwave band, and it is superior to pixel by pixel soil moisture methods using observations in the optical band which neglect statistical relationship between VI and LST controlling evapotranspiration on vegetated area. This study tested a methodological modification of the method based on assumption that evapotranspiration depends on the difference between the air temperature and the terrain surface temperature. The spatial distribution of Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Indices, which reflect soil moisture in the root zone was calculated for vast areas of Central Europe using the classic Triangle Method and its modified version. Both NDVI and EVI indices were used as input data in these calculations. The air temperature at 2 m height was taken from SYNOP reports, and the terrain surface temperature from MODIS data. In addition, Matlab scripts were written by the authors to allow convenient access to free SYNOP data. Our results indicate that proposed modification increases the accuracy of soil moisture estimation. This was confirmed by comparing classic and modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Indices values with rainfall data.

TI  - Combining SAR and Optical Earth Observation with Hydraulic Simulation for Flood Mapping and Impact Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely mapping, measuring and impact assessment of flood events are crucial for the coordination of flood relief efforts and the elaboration of flood management and risk mitigation plans. However, this task is often challenging and time consuming with traditional land-based techniques. In this study, Sentinel-1 radar and Landsat images were utilized in collaboration with hydraulic modelling to obtain flood characteristics and land use/cover (LULC), and to assess flood impact in agricultural areas. Furthermore, indirect estimation of the recurrence interval of a flood event in a poorly gauged catchment was attempted by combining remote sensing (RS) and hydraulic modelling. To this end, a major flood event that occurred in Sperchios river catchment, in Central Greece, which is characterized by extensive farming activity was used as a case study. The synergistic usage of multitemporal RS products and hydraulic modelling has allowed the estimation of flood characteristics, such as extent, inundation depth, peak discharge, recurrence interval and inundation duration, providing valuable information for flood impact estimation and the future examination of flood hazard in poorly gauged basins. The capabilities of the ESA Sentinel-1 mission, which provides improved spatial and temporal analysis, allowing thus the mapping of the extent and temporal dynamics of flood events more accurately and independently from the weather conditions, were also highlighted. Both radar and optical data processing methods, i.e., thresholding, image differencing and water index calculation, provided similar and satisfactory results. Conclusively, multitemporal RS data and hydraulic modelling, with the selected techniques, can provide timely and useful flood observations during and right after flood disasters, applicable in a large part of the world where instrumental hydrological data are scarce and when an apace survey of the condition and information about temporal dynamics in the influenced region is crucial. However, future missions that will reduce further revisiting times will be valuable in this endeavor.

TI  - Using GRACE Data to Study the Impact of Snow and Rainfall on Terrestrial Water Storage in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are important for agricultural, industrial, and urban development. In this paper, we analyzed the influence of rainfall and snowfall on variations in terrestrial water storage (TWS) in Northeast China from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity satellite data, GlobSnow snow water equivalent product, and ERA5-land monthly total precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth data. This study revealed the main composition and variation characteristics of TWS in Northeast China. We found that GRACE provided an effective method for monitoring large areas of stable seasonal snow cover and variations in TWS in Northeast China at both seasonal and interannual scales. On the seasonal scale, although summer rainfall was 10 times greater than winter snowfall, the terrestrial water storage in Northeast China peaked in winter, and summer rainfall brought about only a sub-peak, 1 month later than the maximum rainfall. On the interannual scale, TWS in Northeast China was controlled by rainfall. The correlation analysis results revealed that the annual fluctuations of TWS and rainfall in Northeast China appear to be influenced by ENSO (EI Nino-Southern Oscillation) events with a lag of 2-3 years. In addition, this study proposed a reconstruction model for the interannual variation in TWS in Northeast China from 2003 to 2016 on the basis of the contemporary terrestrial water storage and rainfall data.

TI  - InSAR 3-D Coseismic Displacement Field of the 2015 Mw 7.8 Nepal Earthquake: Insights into Complex Fault Kinematics dur<sub>ing the Event</sub>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake occurred in the central Himalayan collisional orogenic belt, which demonstrated complex fault kinematics and significant surface deformation. The coseismic deformation has been well documented by previous studies using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. However, due to some limitations of spatially sparse GPS stations and InSAR only-one-dimensional observation in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction, the complete distribution and detailed spatial variation of the three-dimensional surface deformation field are still not fully understood. In this study, we reconstructed the three-dimensional coseismic deformation fields using multi-view InSAR observations and investigated the refined surface deformation characteristics during this event. We firstly obtained four ascending and descending InSAR coseismic deformation maps from both Sentinel-1A/B and ALOS-2 data. Secondly, we obtained the synthetic north-south deformation field from our best-fitting slip distribution inversions. Finally, we calculated three-dimensional deformation fields, which were consistent with coseismic GPS displacements but with higher resolution. We found that the surface deformation is dominated by horizontal southward motion and vertical uplift and subsidence, with minor east-west deformation. In the north-south direction, the whole deformation area reaches at least 150 x 150 km with a maximum displacement of similar to 1.5 m. In the vertical direction, two areas, including uplift in the south and subsidence in the north, are mapped with a peak displacement of 1.5 and -1.0 m, respectively. East-west deformation presented a four-quadrant distribution with a maximum displacement of similar to 0.6 m. Complex thrusting movement occurred on the seismogenic fault; overall, there was southward push motion and wave-shaped fold motion.

TI  - Estimated prevalence of the Duffy null phenotype Fy (a-b-) among black blood-donors in Southwestern Colombia
T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Hemolytic reactions are adverse complications associated with red blood cell transfusion. These reactions are associated with clinically important erythrocyte antigens, such as those of Duffy blood Meny (2010). Individuals with the Duffy null phenotype Fy (a-b-) are more likely to develop an alloimmunization reaction, resulting in an incompatibility with all available red blood cell units, thus increasing the risk of complications from their underlying disease Hoher et al. (2018). Hence, it is important to determine the prevalence of the Fy (a-b-) phenotype in blood donors in our population and to create a database to ensure safe transfusion in patients with this phenotype. Moreover, we intend to establish whether there is any relationship between individuals with this phenotype and the sickle cell trait. We conducted this study to measure the prevalence of the Fy (a-b-) phenotype in our blood donors.Materials and methods: This prospective, descriptive study included black blood donors visiting the blood bank of a tertiary care university hospital between January 2019 and July 2019. We used Fitzpatrick classification phototype VI and self-identification to select donors in the study. The presence of the Duffy antigens Fya and Fyb was determined by the Coombs test using monoclonal antibodies. To establish the presence of hemoglobin S (HbS) and sickle cell traits, a hemoglobin electrophoresis test was performed.Results: We included 166 patients in the study. Seventy-nine donors were identified as having Fy (a-b-). The prevalence of the Fy (a-b-) phenotype was 48 %. Sickle cell trait hemoglobinopathy was found in 6 blood donors (8%).Conclusion: This information is relevant for the implementation of a database of blood donors to guarantee the safety of transfusion in patients with a Fitzpatrick skin type 6at our institution. Moreover, it may provide information of interest to other blood banks in case donors with this phenotype are needed. No significant association was found between the donor Fy (a-b-) phenotype and the sickle cell trait.

TI  - Calibrating fluvial erosion laws and quantifying river response to faulting in Sardinia, Italy
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is now widely accepted that rivers modify their erosion rates in response to variable rock uplift rates, resulting in changes in channel slope that propagate upstream through time. Therefore, present-day river morphology may contain a record of tectonic history. The simple stream power incision model can, in principle, be used to quantify past uplift rates over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Nonetheless, the erosional model's exponents of area and slope (m and n respectively) and 'bedrock erodibility' (k) remain poorly constrained. In this paper, we will use a geologically and geomorphically well constrained Plio-Pleistocene volcanic landscape in central Sardinia, Italy, to calibrate the stream power erosion equation and to investigate the slip rate of faults that have been seismically quiescent in the historic past. By analysing digital elevation models, geological maps and Landsat imagery, we have identified the geomorphic expression of several volcanic features (eruption centres and basaltic lava flows) and three normal faults with 6 to 8 km fault traces within the outcrop. Downstream, river longitudinal profiles show a similar transient response to relative base level fall, probably as a result of relief inversion at the edge of the volcanic outcrop. From measurements of incision, local slope and upstream catchment area across eight different rivers, we calculate n approximate to 1, m = 0.50 +/- 0.02 and, using a landscape age from literature of 2.7 Ma, bedrock erodibility k = 0.10 +/- 0.04 m((1-2m)) Myr(-1). There are also knickpoints on rivers upstream of two normal faults, and we used numerical inverse modelling of the longitudinal profiles to predict the slip rate of these faults since 2.7 Ma. The results from the inverse model show that the erosional parameter values derived in this study can produce theoretical longitudinal profiles that closely resemble observed river profiles upstream of the faults. The lowest misfit theoretical longitudinal profiles were generated by a model of temporally discontinuous footwall uplift with consistently low throw rates (< 0.1 mm yr(-1)). The predicted footwall uplift history is similar for the two faults, both showing periods of fault slip and no fault movement since 2.7 Ma. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Data for Underground Processes Recognition in Bucharest City, Romania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are strongly influenced by the different processes affecting the underground and implicitly the terrestrial surface. Land subsidence can be one of the effects of the urban processes. The identification of the vulnerable areas of the city, prone to subsidence, can be of great help for a sustainable urban planning. Using Sentinel-1 data, by the PSI (persistent scatterer interferometry) technique, a vertical displacements map of Bucharest city has been prepared. It covers the time interval 2014-2018. Based on this map, several subsidence areas have been identified. One of them, holding a thick layer of debris from urban constructions, was analyzed in detail, on the basis of an accurate local geological model and by correlating the local displacements with the urban groundwater system hydraulic heads. The properties of the anthropogenic layer have been characterized by complementary geotechnical and hydrogeological studies. A dynamic instability pattern, highlighted by PSI results, has been put into evidence when related to this type of anthropogenic layer. This thick anthropogenic layer and its connections to the urban aquifer system have to be further analyzed, when the procedures of urban planning and design invoke constructive operations modifying the aquifer dynamics.

TI  - A synthetic experiment to investigate the potential of assimilating LAI through direct insertion in a land surface model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the potential of assimilating phenology observations using a direct insertion (DI) method by constraining the modeled terrestrial carbon dynamics with synthetic observations of vegetation condition. Specifically, observations of leaf area index (LAI) are assimilated in the Noah-Multi Parameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model across the continental United States during a 5-year period. An observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) was developed to understand and quantify the model response to assimilating LAI information through DI when the input precipitation is strongly biased. This is particularly significant in data poor regions, like Africa and South Asia, where satellite and re-analysis products, known to be affected by significant biases, are the only available precipitation data to drive a land surface model. Results show a degradation in surface and rootzone soil moisture after assimilating LAI within Noah-MP, but an improvement in intercepted liquid water and evapotranspiration with respect to the open-loop simulation (a free run with no LAI assimilation). In terms of carbon and energy variables, net ecosystem exchange, amount of carbon in shallow soil, and surface soil temperature are improved by the LAI DI, although canopy sensible heat is degraded. Overall, the assimilation of LAI has larger impact in terms of reduced systematic and random errors over the Great Plains (cropland, shrubland, and grassland). Moreover, LAI DA shows a greater improvement when the input precipitation is affected by a positive (wet) bias than the opposite case, in which precipitation shows a dry bias.

M3  - Article
AB  - Alteration zones are developed in a wide range of geological milieus such as volcano-plutonic rocks. Hydrothermal alteration zones are considered an important guide for mineral exploration and can act as a potential zone of mineralization. The minerals in alteration zones have very diagnostic absorption features in visible-near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data have the potential to identify mineral assemblages in different hydrothermal alteration zones because of its 14 spectral bands which cover a wide spectral range. In the present article, FCC, band ratio, and SPCA techniques were applied to map the hydrothermal alteration zones in Gadag Schist Belt (GSB) of Western Dharwar Craton (WDC) of Karnataka. FCC has highlighted lithology, alteration zones, and given a fair idea about the lithological control and alteration occurrences in the area. Band ratio technique for muscovite, kaolinite, chlorite, iron oxide gossan, and silica alteration have yielded promising results. SPCA analysis successfully mapped hydrothermal alteration and delineated phyllic, argillic, and propylitic zones in the area. These results were verified through the existing geological map and by geological fieldwork in the area and these results are satisfactory. The total area, altered by different alteration process, was also calculated. In the GSB, iron alteration zone, phyllic, argillic, propylitic, and silica alteration zones were effectively mapped with the help of ASTER data.

TI  - SAR analysis of wetland ecosystems: Effects of band frequency, polarization mode and acquisition dates
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of high spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors with a wide range of acquisition modes has increased greatly over the past decade and contributed significantly to the study of wetland ecosystems. However, the relative influence of acquisition configurations (i.e. band frequency, polarization mode, number of acquisition dates) in wetland analysis remains poorly explored. This article investigated the relative influence of X-/C-band frequency, dual-/quad-polarization and single-/multi-acquisition features on discrimination of vegetation types in 632 ha Ramsar-protected temperate riverine marshes (Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, France). Three SAR datasets (i.e. quad-pol/C-band, dual-pol/C-band and dual-pol/X-band) were generated from five pairs of TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 images. First, a set of 25 SAR features, including backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters, was extracted from the SAR datasets. Second, correlation between each pair of images was calculated using the polarimetric parameter Shannon entropy to select the most similar pairs in the time series. Third, the importance of each SAR feature and modeling accuracy were calculated using a conditional random forest model for each of the three datasets. Finally, analysis of variance was performed to assess the impact of band frequency, polarization mode and number of acquisition dates on the classification of vegetation types. The results highlighted that although the time-shift of each pair of TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 images was short (3-11 days), only three pairs were sufficiently similar, highlighting the high variability in wetland ecosystems. The polarimetric parameter Shannon entropy was the most discriminating feature, regardless of the frequency or polarization. Most variance in the model accuracy was explained by the number of acquisition dates (68%), followed by the frequency (23%), while polarization explained little. This article will help select the most suitable SAR sensor acquisition modes for wetland conservation.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, atmospheric dust samples were collected via Partisol 2025 ID device working in EPA mode by using PM10 (Particulate matter less than 10 microns) filter during 2016-2017 from Sanliurfa, Turkey. The arrival direction and source detection of atmospheric dust was determined by the MODIS satellite view and HYSPLIT model. The structure of the samples was characterized by XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) combined with EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray) and FTIR (Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectrum). Results show that the major phases observed in the XRD spectrum of the samples are calcite, dolomite, gibbsite, anorthite, and sodium borate hydroxide. The compositions of dust samples were found to be Ca, Si, Al, Na, and Mg in a higher ratio than other elements via SEM-EDX analysis. Further, this study reveals the variability of PM morphological and elemental composition on different days at locations and highlighted the different probable sources associated with them.

AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide detailed spectral information through hundreds of (narrow) spectral channels (also known as dimensionality or bands), which can be used to accurately classify diverse materials of interest. The increased dimensionality of such data makes it possible to significantly improve data information content but provides a challenge to conventional techniques (the so-called curse of dimensionality) for accurate analysis of HSIs.

TI  - Remote sensing image classification using subspace sensor fusion
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of remote sensing and ancillary datasets captured by diverse airborne and spaceborne sensors has been tremendously increased, which opens up the possibility of utilizing multimodal datasets to improve the performance of processing approaches with respect to the application at hand. However, developing a generic framework with high generalization capability that can effectively fuse diverse datasets is a challenging task since the current approaches are usually only applicable to two specific sensors for data fusion. In this paper, we propose an accurate fusion-based technique called SubFus with capability to integrate diverse remote sensing data for land cover classification. Here, we assume that a high dimensional multisensor dataset can be represented fused features that live in a lower-dimensional space. The proposed classification methodology includes three main stages. First, spatial information is extracted by using spatial filters (i.e., morphology fillers). Then, a novel low-rank minimization problem is proposed to represent the multisensor datasets in subspaces using fused features. The fused features in the lower-dimensional subspace are estimated using a novel iterative algorithm based on the alternative direction method of multipliers. Third, the final classification map is produced by applying a supervised spectral classifier (i.e., random forest) on the fused features. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to a three-sensor (RGB, multispectral LiDAR, and hyperspectral images) dataset captured over the area of the University of Houston, the USA, and a two-sensor (hyperspectral and LiDAR) dataset captured over the city of Trento, Italy. The land-cover maps generated using SubFus are evaluated based on classification accuracies. Experimental results obtained by SubFus confirm considerable improvements in terms of classification accuracies compared with the other methods used in the experiments. The proposed fusion approach obtains 85.32% and 99.25% in terms of overall classification accuracy on the Houston (the training portion of the dataset distributed for the data fusion contest of 2018) and trento datasets, respectively.

TI  - Comparison of Groundwater Storage Changes From GRACE Satellites With Monitoring and Modeling of Major US Aquifers
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - GRACE satellite data are widely used to estimate groundwater storage (GWS) changes in aquifers globally; however, comparisons with GW monitoring and modeling data are limited. Here we compared GWS changes from GRACE over 15 yr (2002-2017) in 14 major U.S. aquifers with groundwater-level (GWL) monitoring data in similar to 23,000 wells and with regional and global hydrologic and land surface models. Results show declining GWS trends from GRACE data in the six southwestern and south-central U.S. aquifers, totaling -90 km(3) over 15 yr, related to long-term (5-15 yr) droughts, and exceeding Lake Mead volume by similar to 2.5x. GWS trends in most remaining aquifers were stable or slightly rising. GRACE-derived GWS changes agree with GWL monitoring data in most aquifers (correlation coefficients, R = 0.52-0.95), showing that GRACE satellites capture groundwater (GW) dynamics. Regional GW models (eight models) generally show similar or greater GWS trends than those from GRACE. Large discrepancies in the Mississippi Embayment aquifer, with modeled GWS decline approximately four times that of GRACE, may reflect uncertainties in model storage parameters, stream capture, pumpage, and/or recharge rates. Global hydrologic models (2003-2014), which include GW pumping, generally overestimate GRACE GWS depletion (total: approximately -172 to -186 km(3)) in heavily exploited aquifers in southwestern and south-central U.S. by similar to 2.4x (GRACE: -74 km(3)), underscoring needed modeling improvements relative to anthropogenic impacts. Global land surface models tend to track GRACE GWS dynamics better than global hydrologic models. Intercomparing remote sensing, monitoring, and modeling data underscores the importance of considering all data sources to constrain GWS uncertainties.Plain Language Summary The major U.S. aquifers provide an ideal system to assess GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite data. We compared GRACE groundwater storage anomalies (GWSAs) with groundwater level anomalies (GWLAs) from similar to 23,000 wells and with groundwater storage (GWS) from regional and global models in 14 major U.S. aquifers. Results show large GWS declines from GRACE in southwestern (Central Valley and Arizona Alluvial Basins) and south-central (Central and Southern High Plains and Texas) aquifers from multiyear droughts (5-15 yr). In contrast, GWS trends in aquifers throughout the rest of the U.S. showed mostly stable or rising values. Time series of GRACE GWSAs compared favorably with GWLAs from most aquifers, suggesting that GRACE data track groundwater (GW) dynamics. Regional GW models show similar or greater declines in GWS compared with GRACE data, with the largest discrepancy of a factor of four times greater modeled depletion in the Mississippi Embayment. Global hydrologic models show minimal storage dynamics but greatly overestimated GWS declines by similar to 2.4x in southwestern and south-central aquifers with intensive irrigation compared with GRACE data. In contrast, global land surface models show similar GW dynamics to GRACE data but underestimated GWS declines in heavily exploited aquifers because these land surface models do not include human intervention.

TI  - Avoiding Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Breast Cancer: Rationale for the Prospective, Multicentric EUBREAST-01 Trial
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryImprovements in systemic treatments for breast cancer have increased the rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients receiving preoperative systemic therapy (PST), offering the opportunity to de-escalate, and perhaps eliminate, surgery in patients who have a pCR. We propose a clinical trial in which only patients with the highest likelihood of having a pCR after PST will be included and type of surgery will be defined according to the response to PST rather than on the classical T (for tumor size in the breast) and N (for axillary lymph node involvement) status at presentation. In the planned trial, axillary surgery will be eliminated completely (no axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy) for initially clinical node-negative patients with radiologic complete remission and a breast pCR as determined in the lumpectomy specimen.Currently, axillary surgery for breast cancer is considered only as staging procedure, since the risk of developing metastasis depends on the biological behavior of the primary. The postsurgical therapy should be considered on the basis of biologic tumor characteristics rather than nodal involvement. Improvements in systemic treatments for breast cancer have increased the rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), offering the opportunity to de-escalate surgery in patients who have a pCR. European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists (EUBREAST)-01 is a clinical trial in which only patients with the highest likelihood of having a pCR after NAST (triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer) will be included and type of surgery will be defined according to the response to NAST rather than on the classical T (for tumor size in the breast) and N (for axillary lymph node involvement) status. In the discussed trial, axillary surgery will be eliminated completely (no axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy) for initially clinical node-negative (cN0) patients with radiologic complete remission and a breast pCR in the lumpectomy specimen. The trial design is a multicenter single-arm study with a limited number of patients (n = 267), which might give practice-changing results in a short period of time, sparing the time and the costs of a randomized comparison.

TI  - Humpback whales (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>) breeding off Mozambique and Ecuador show geographic variation of persistent organic pollutants and isotopic niches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from the Southern Hemisphere carry information on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from their feeding zones in Antarctica to their breeding grounds, making this species a sentinel of contaminants accumulation in the Southern Ocean. This study aimed to evaluate driving factors, namely feeding areas, trophic level, and sex, affecting POP concentrations in the blubber of humpback whales breeding off Mozambique and off Ecuador. Biopsies of free-ranging humpback whales including blubber and skin were collected in 2014 and 2015 from Ecuador (n = 59) and in 2017 from Mozambique (n = 89). In both populations, HCB was the major contaminant followed by DDTs > CHLs > PCBs > HCHs > PBDEs. POP concentrations were significantly higher in males compared to females. HCB, DDTs, HCHs and PBDEs were significantly different between whales from the Mozambique population and the Ecuador population. Sex and feeding habits were important driving factors accounting for POP concentrations in Ecuador whales. The whales from our study had some of the lowest POP concentrations measured for humpback whales in the world. These whales fed predominantly on krill as reflected from the low delta C-13 and delta N-15 values measured in the skin. However, the isotopic niches of whales from Mozambique and Ecuador did not overlap indicating that the two populations are feeding in different areas of the Southern Ocean. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Step-by-step surgical procedures for a correct identification of the sentinel lymph node in endometrial cancer
T2  - FACTS VIEWS AND VISION IN OBGYN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In patients with endometrial cancer, the common method for assessing the status of lymph nodes (LN) is lymphadenectomy. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a revolutionary concept and it will play an increasingly important role in surgical practice. The surgical technique of the sentinel lymph node is less destructive than lymphadenectomy, and it requires less anatomical knowledge.Methods: Step by step technique of cervical injection, the preparation of the anatomical spaces and the identification of the main structures to detect and remove the SLN safely in patients affected by endometrial cancer stage IA.Results: We identify the three different lymphatic pathways drainage from the uterine cervix and show how anatomical retroperitoneal knowledge is essential for the safe dissection of anatomical spaces. In literature it is reported that in about 9% of cases the SLN is located at the lumbo-aortic level, so it is clear how important it is to know the anatomy to follow the highlighted lymph pathway to identify first lymph node absorber of the drainage.Conclusion: Anatomical knowledge and the correct preparation of the anatomical spaces make the identification of the sentinel lymph node safe and feasible.

TI  - In the Realm of Rain Gods: A Contextual Survey of Rock Art across the Northern Maya Lowlands
T2  - HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional rock art studies have provided insight into the role of caves in Maya ideology and worldview. In addition to the content of the imagery itself, the placement or siting of rock art with respect to natural and cultural features within the cave environment can reveal much about the function and meaning of cave use practices. This comparative analysis of rock art emphasizes contextual considerations with a discussion on the spatial and symbolic relationships between images in individual caves. Rock art in the northern Maya lowlands is commonly associated with watery areas and pathways leading to pools in caves. Across the northern Yucatan Peninsula, watery caves witnessed the rites and rituals of religious practitioners who appealed to the rain gods. Rock art scenes throughout this region were often devised and positioned in ways that reveal or are consistent with this unique and pervasive emphasis on rain and agricultural fertility in religious practice.

TI  - Automated detection of rock glaciers using deep learning and object-based image analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers are an important component of the cryosphere and are one of the most visible manifestations of permafrost. While the significance of rock glacier contribution to streamflow remains uncertain, the contribution is likely to be important for certain parts of the world. High-resolution remote sensing data has permitted the creation of rock glacier inventories for large regions. However, due to the spectral similarity between rock glaciers and the surrounding material, the creation of such inventories is typically conducted based on manual interpretation, which is both time consuming and subjective. Here, we present a novel method that combines deep learning (convolutional neural networks or CNNs) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) into one workflow based on freely available Sentinel-2 optical imagery (10 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence data, and a digital elevation model (DEM). CNNs identify recurring patterns and textures and produce a prediction raster, or heatmap where each pixel indicates the probability that it belongs to a certain class (i.e. rock glacier) or not. By using OBIA we can segment the datasets and classify objects based on their heatmap value as well as morphological and spatial characteristics. We analysed two distinct catchments, the La Laguna catchment in the Chilean semi-arid Andes and the Poiqu catchment in the central Himalaya. In total, our method mapped 108 of the 120 rock glaciers across both catchments with a mean overestimation of 28%. Individual rock glacier polygons howevercontained false positives that are texturally similar, such as debris-flows, avalanche deposits, or fluvial material causing the user's accuracy to be moderate (63.9-68.9%) even if the producer's accuracy was higher (75.0-75.4%). We repeated our method on very-high-resolution Pleiades satellite imagery and a corresponding DEM (at 2 m resolution) for a subset of the Poiqu catchment to ascertain what difference image resolution makes. We found that working at a higher spatial resolution has little influence on the producer's accuracy (an increase of 1.0%), however the rock glaciers delineated were mapped with a greater user's accuracy (increase by 9.1% to 72.0%). By running all the processing within an object-based environment it was possible to both generate the deep learning heatmap and perform post-processing through image segmentation and object reshaping. Given the difficulties in differentiating rock glaciers using image spectra, deep learning combined with OBIA offers a promising method for automating the process of mapping rock glaciers over regional scales and lead to a reduction in the workload required in creating inventories.

TI  - Characterization of Cu/Zn-SODs in sympatric species: A comparison of zebra and quagga mussels
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are commonly used as sentinel organisms in freshwater biomonitoring. The displacement of this species by quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) has raised the issue of their discrimination after field sampling. Even if those two species exhibit specific morphological characteristics, confusion can occur. However, behind the visible phenotypes lie important physiological and metabolic differences that may affect the interpretation of biomarkers in risk assessment. In this study, we present a characterization of Cu/Zn-SODs (superoxide dismutases) in Dreissena spp. with a comparison of activity profiles from individuals originating from North America and Europe. A phylogenetic tree was constructed and dreissenid SOD sequences appear to be closely related to clam species sequences. A specific isoform at an isoelectric point value of 4.95 was observed only for quagga mussels independently of their origin, while zebra mussels exhibited several polymorphic profiles, even for a single sampling site. A comparison of transcript sequences was conducted and the observed differences were highlighted. Alignment of amino acid sequences shows a high level of identity between the two species associated with minor changes in the predicted secondary structures.

AB  - Results are presented from an analysis of multitemporal data obtained via satellite monitoring of the state of vegetation on the territory of Ivano-Arakhley Nature Park (Zabaikal'sky krai) after a 2015 natural fire. Radar and optical data are acquired from the Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 spacecraft, respectively. Spectral indices NDVI, NBR, MIRBI, and NDRE are used in combination with radar vegetation index RVI to determine the dynamics of the restoration of the vegetation cover affected by the fire. The positive dynamics in the state of the vegetation in postfire period 2016-2019 is shown by an increase in the values of the NDVI, NBR, NDRE, and RVI indices. The effect the atmosphere on the values of the vegetation index is shown.

TI  - Multiple insecticide resistance in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) from Boyeros municipality, Cuba and associated mechanisms
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, insecticide resistance and the mechanisms responsible were characterized in Ae. aegypti of Boyeros municipality from Havana, Cuba. Boyeros represents a high epidemiological risk because it is located near the Havana International Airport, it is highly urbanized, and it has a large influx of people from endemic countries so that it qualifies as a sentinel site for surveillance. The larvae collected from five areas of this municipality showed resistance to temephos associated with metabolic enzymes. The adult mosquitoes displayed a deltamethrin resistance and less distinctly to other pyrethroids associated with a high frequency of sodium channel gene mutations (F1534C and V1016I), detected for the first time in a field population from Cuba. The presence in the field populations of two insecticide resistance mechanisms represents a limiting factor in the success of the control operations of this vector, so other strategies should be considered to preserve the effectiveness of the insecticides available in public health for vector control in Cuba.

TI  - Using Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data to monitor harmful algal blooms in Southern Chile during the COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - During the southern summer of 2020, large phytoplankton blooms were detected using satellite technology in Chile (western Patagonia), where intensive salmonid aquaculture is carried out. Some harvesting sites recorded massive fish mortalities, which were associated with the presence of the dinoflagellate species Cochlodinium sp. The bloom included other phytoplankton species, as Lepidodinium chlorophorum, which persistently changed the colour of the ocean to green. These blooms coincided with the government-managed emergency lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Local in situ sampling was slowed down. However, imagery from the Copernicus programme allowed operational monitoring. This study shows the benefits of both Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 satellites in terms of their spectral, spatial and temporal capabilities for improved algal bloom monitoring. These novel tools, which can foster optimal decision-making, are available for delivering early alerts in situations of natural catastrophes and blockages, such as those occurred during the global COVID-19 lockdown.

TI  - Integration of social, economic and environmental factors in GIS for land degradation vulnerability assessment in the Pir Panjal Himalaya, Kashmir, India
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation assessment is imperative for developing a mitigation plan to minimize the adverse impacts associated with land degradation. The study involves the integration of various social, economic and environmental indices for identifying the land degradation vulnerable areas in the Pir Panjal Himalaya, Kashmir, India. Analysis of the land use and land cover from the satellite data revealed that-47% of the area is devoid of any vegetal cover. Slope index revealed that-40% of the study area is precipitous with slope >30%. The land utilization index indicated that-51% of the area is over-utilized. Integration of all the environmental indices in GIS environment yielded the Natural Resource Prioritization Index which revealed that-41% of the area needs attention for land degradation mitigation on top priority. Integration of all the socioeconomic indices yielded the Socio-Economic Priority Zones which revealed that-35% of the area needs attention for the socio-economic upliftment on priority for combating the land degradation in the study area. Land Degradation Vulnerability Index (LDVI) model was developed in GIS environment based on the unique combination of various natural resource and socioeconomic priority zones using the weighted index approach to assess the cumulative impact of social, economic and environmental factors on land degradation. The model analyses revealed that-48% of the study area (-603 Km(2)) shows high to very high LDVI values alluding to its high vulnerability to different forms of land degradation. The approach developed in this research for the integration of various causal factors to identify the lands vulnerable to varying degree and intensity of degradation will go a long way in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for combating land degradation at village level in the Himalaya.

TI  - UAV-Derived Multispectral Bathymetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry is considered an important component in marine applications as several coastal erosion monitoring and engineering projects are carried out in this field. It is traditionally acquired via shipboard echo sounding, but nowadays, multispectral satellite imagery is also commonly applied using different remote sensing-based algorithms. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) relates the surface reflectance of shallow coastal waters to the depth of the water column. The present study shows the results of the application of Stumpf and Lyzenga algorithms to derive the bathymetry for a small area using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), also known as a drone, equipped with a multispectral camera acquiring images in the same WorldView-2 satellite sensor spectral bands. A hydrographic Multibeam Echosounder survey was performed in the same period in order to validate the method's results and accuracy. The study area was approximately 0.5 km(2) and located in Tuscany (Italy). Because of the high percentage of water in the images, a new methodology was also implemented for producing a georeferenced orthophoto mosaic. UAV multispectral images were processed to retrieve bathymetric data for testing different band combinations and evaluating the accuracy as a function of the density and quantity of sea bottom control points. Our results indicate that UAV-Derived Bathymetry (UDB) permits an accuracy of about 20 cm to be obtained in bathymetric mapping in shallow waters, minimizing operative expenses and giving the possibility to program a coastal monitoring surveying activity. The full sea bottom coverage obtained using this methodology permits detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) comparable to a Multibeam Echosounder survey, and can also be applied in very shallow waters, where the traditional hydrographic approach requires hard fieldwork and presents operational limits.

T2  - OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is an important issue in ocean ecosystem management and research. This study investigates seasonal and annual variability in Chl-a and its relationship with sea surface temperature (SST) and river discharge in the shelf region of the Northern Bay of Bengal (BoB), as well as validates satellite data against insitu data. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite data on Chl-a concentration and SST from 2002-2018 were used in this study. River discharge data were obtained from the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). The annual Chl-a concentration ranged from 2.08 to 2.94 mg m(-3), with an average of 2.43 +/- 0.24 mg m(-3). The Chl-a concentration was found higher (2.21 +/- 0.56 mg m(-3)) during the northeast monsoon (October-February) and lower (1.81 +/- 1.14 mg m(-3)) during the pre-monsoon season (March-May). The study revealed a declining trend in Chl-a concentration from 2002 to 2018, and the rate of change was -0.0183 mg m(-3) year(-1). Chl-a concentration showed a weak inverse relationship with SST, both annually and seasonally, especially in the pre-monsoon season. River discharge masked the effect of SST on Chl-a variability during the southwest and northeast monsoon. A reasonable correlation (r = 0.78) was found between the MODIS-Aqua data and insitu Chl-a observations.

TI  - Qualitative evaluation and within-field mapping of winter wheat crop condition using multispectral remote sensing data
T2  - BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a method for evaluation and mapping of winter wheat crop condition using a set of crop variables, e.g. leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), fraction of vegetation cover (fCover), fresh above ground biomass (AGBO, and Nitrogen uptake derived from multispectral imagery. First, the crop condition is assessed with respect to each variable using a qualitative, three-grade scale. In a second step, these individual assessments are combined to produce assessment map of the crop's general condition, discriminating between three possible conditions - Good, Fair, or Poor. The method was tested on winter wheat fields in Bulgaria in two agricultural years - 2016/2017 at phenological growth stage (FGS) Z31 to Z34 and 2017/2018 at FGS Z30. The results presented were based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (at 20 m spatial resolution) and imagery from Specialized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) sense FlyeBee Ag, equipped with Parrot Sequoia camera (resampled to 10 m spatial resolution). The remotely sensed crop condition was validated against independent ground-based assessments in a number of elementary sampling units (ESUs). The proposed approach proved to be effective and the crop condition was accurately determined in 87% - 94% of the ESUs depending on the FGS/agricultural year and the imagery type. We observed only minor differences in the areas of the three crop conditions when mapped with Sentinel-2 and Parrot Sequoia data.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Delta from 1983 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mississippi Delta in coastal Louisiana has some of the highest rates of land loss in the world. This land-loss crisis might become a global problem because most major deltas are expected to be vulnerable to land loss during the remainder of the 21st century and beyond. Despite this predicament, we do not understand how land loss in a deltaic environment proceeds in time and space. Here, we evaluate the spatial and temporal trends of land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Delta (LMRD) region using spatial statistics and landscape metrics. We used nearly 4800 Landsat images to construct a series of three-year cloud-free composites from 1983 to 2016. From these data, we created a stability index (SI), which is a dimensionless measure of the number of land-to -water transitions that a land pixel makes before being considered lost. Our results indicate that on the LMRD, 75% of land loss is a single transition from land to water, while about 25% of land pixels have two or more transitions before being considered lost. Using a local indicator of spatial association, we show that pixels with similar SI tend to cluster together. Single transition clusters (low SI) form elongated shapes, they are densely packed, and they are predominantly, but not always, found on marsh edges. On the other hand, multi-transition clusters (high SI) form square-like shapes, they are more fragmented, and they are usually found in marsh interiors. Our analysis further shows that the land-loss area within the spatial patches with both high and low stability is strongly related to the density of land patches and their shape (R2 of 0.717 and 0.545 respectively). Our analysis suggests that land-loss pixels on the marsh edges undergo different temporal patterns of land loss compared to those in the marsh interior. We hypothesize that this arises because wave edge-erosion drives land loss on marsh edges, whereas subsidence-related flooding drives land loss in marsh interiors. The stability index provides a useful way to characterize the processes causing land loss.

TI  - MaxEnt Modeling for Predicting Suitable Habitats in the North Caucasus (Russian Part) for Persian Leopard (<i>P. p. ciscaucasica</i>) Based on GPS Data from Collared and Released Animals
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first leopards were released into the wild in the Russian Caucasus in 2016 and 2018 as the first step of the Federal leopard restoration program. Leopards were tagged with GPS-Iridium collars. The obtained GPS-coordinates were used to create and verify a mathematical model of the potential habitats of this species and evaluate the possibility of the way choice made by leopards on the move. The modeling was performed by the maximum entropy method using the MaxEnt program based on the data from six leopards (four males and two females). A variety of basic habitat factors and characteristics are reflected in WorldClim bioclimatic indicators, including the data on surface radar imagery, and indices calculated on the basis of Landsat8 satellite image mosaic. To describe and verify biotopes, the field data collected in the Republics of North Ossetia-Alania, South Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria were used. The obtained results confirmed a high) accuracy in determining the predicted points. The largest contribution to the common model of potential leopard habitats is made by 10 main factors from the whole set. That list includes the slope steepness, altitude, several climatic characteristics, bioclimatic indices, and the vegetation index. According to the modeling results, the most preferred habitats for the leopard in the Caucasus are not very steep (up to 30 degrees) slopes with grassy vegetation at altitudes of about 800-1500 m above sea level, independent of exposure, but with the average value of snow indices.

TI  - Unintended effects of illegal economic activities: Illegal gold mining and malaria
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal economic activities are not only associated with higher levels of violent crime, they may also increase unforeseen risks and cause other negative unintended consequences for populations. This paper investigates the causal effects of illegal gold mining on malaria incidence. For this purpose, I employ unique Colombian satellite data with the location of illegal gold mines matched to municipal governmental health reports on the number of malaria cases. To identify causal effects, I use preexisting geochemical gold anomalies as an instrumental variable for illegal gold production. I find positive and large effects of illegal gold mining on malaria incidence. My estimates suggest that when an area containing illegal gold mines increases by 1 hectare, the annual parasite index for malaria increases by 1.04 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

TI  - A sentinel for monitoring climate change and its impact on biodiversity at the southern summit of the Americas: the new Cape Horn Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research Network
T2  - Anales del Instituto de la Patagonia
M3  - Article
AB  - Biosphere reserves have among their functions to support scientific research, education, training and monitoring. In the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve ( RBCH), created in 2005, this function has been fulfilled with the creation of the Omora Ethnobotanical Park in 2000, and its implementation in 2008 as a co-founder site of the Chilean Network of Studies Long-Term Socio-Ecological (LTSER-Chile). In 2016, this network has been strengthened with the addition of the new Cape Horn Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research Network (LTER-Cape Horn). The latter includes the Omora Ethnobotanical Park, and three new sites added to the monitoring of the sub-Antarctic Magellanic ecoregion. From south to north, the four sites are: (1) Gonzalo Island (56 degrees 31'S; 68 degrees 43'O), at the southern end of the Diego Ramirez Archipelago, with subAntarctic vegetation dominated by grasses and cryptogams, devoid of woody species; (2) Horn Island (55 degrees 58'S; 67 degrees 13'O), at the southern end of the Cape Horn Archipelago, hosting the southernmost forest ecosystems on the planet, which are dominated by the evergreen beech (Nothofagus betuloides); (3) Omora Ethnobotanical Park (54 degrees 57'S; 67 degrees 40'O), Navarino Island, an ideal site for studies on climate change and its impact on biota and sub-Antarctic ecosystems, since it protects a watershed that includes a representative mosaic of characteristic habitats of the RBCH in an altitudinal gradient with a thermal decrease analogous to that which occurs with increases in latitude; and (4) Caleta 2 de Mayo Site (54 degrees 52'S; 68 degrees 41'O), Yendegaia Bay, in an ecotonal zone between evergreen and deciduous forests (product of the local climate gradient), at a site that will be central to future connectivity between Continental Chile, Tierra del Fuego, Navarino Island, and the RBCH. In 2015, UNESCO approved the Report of the First Periodic Review of the RBCH that proposed the protection of the Diego Ramirez Archipelago and the creation of the Diego Ramirez Islands-Drake Passage Marine Park. This goal was achieved with the promulgation of this new park on February 2, 2018, and its entry into force on January 21, 2019 with the publication of the creation decree in the Diario Oficial of Chile. In this context, the new LTER-Cape Horn network acquires great local, national and global relevance. At the local scale, it covers a representative environmental heterogeneity of the great diversity of landscapes and terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems of the RBCH and the sub-Antarctic Magellanic ecoregion. At the national scale, it incorporates sub-Antarctic sites, located at the southern end of South America, to LTSER-Chile and to the Monitoring Network of the Ministry of the Environment. On a global scale, the terrestrial ecosystems of the LTER-Cape Horn network stands out for two main reasons: (1) these sub-Antarctic ecosystems lack a geographical replicate in other continents of the southern hemisphere, and (2) high latitude ecosystems are especially sensitive to global climate change. Thus, the LTER-Cape Horn network helps to overcome critical geographical gaps in the implementation of the International Network for Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER).In order to articulate these four sites and strengthen the training of technical capacities and knowledge transfer to decision makers in the area of special interest tourism and other sustainable economic activities, the LTER-Cape Horn network will be managed locally from the new Cape Horn Sub-Antarctic Center (Cape Horn Center) that will be inaugurated in Puerto Williams in 2021. The implementation of the LTER-Cape Horn network is based on a close collaboration with various public institutions: Ministry of National Assets, Ministry of the Environment, Subsecretary of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Ministry of Economy Development and Tourism, National Forestry Service, General Water Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works, Navy of Chile, Chilean Police (Carabineros), Municipality of Cape Horn, Provincial Government of Chilean Antarctica, and the Regional Government of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica. In the following phases, the LTER-Cape Horn network and the Cape Horn Center aim to strengthen the participation of the local community, especially the Yahgan Indigenous Community of Bahia Mejillones, artisanal fisheries, tour operators, and the educational community, including private actors. Located at the "southern summit" of the Americas, Puerto Williams, capital of the Chilean Antarctic Province emerges as a global hub for transdisciplinary sub-Antarctic research, equipped with a new center and the network of long- term socio-ecological studies. Collaboration with regional, national and international actors will allow the LTER-Cape Horn network and the Cape Horn Center to: (i) provide critical data, which will open up new opportunities for monitoring climate change and its impact on biodiversity and ecosystems in sub-Antarctic latitudes; (ii) consolidate long-term monitoring, which is an essential component to effectively design mitigation and adaptation actions; (iii) strengthen a local sustainable development model that, associated with the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, contributes from the south of the world, to a biocultural conservation model that meets the needs of socio-economic well-being and environmental sustainability at multiple regional and planetary scales.

TI  - Detecting Vegetation Change in the Pearl River Delta Region Based on Time Series Segmentation and Residual Trend Analysis (TSS-RESTREND) and MODIS NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time Series Segmentation and Residual Trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND) can detect an abrupt change that was undetected by Residual Trend analysis (RESTREND), but it is usually combined with the Global Inventory for Mapping and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which cannot detect detailed vegetation changes in small areas. Hence, we used Time Series Segmentation and Residual Trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI (MOD-TR) to analyze the vegetation dynamic of the Pearl River Delta region (PRD) in this study. To choose the most suitable MODIS NDVI from MOD13Q1 (250 m), MOD13A1 (500 m), and MOD13A2 (1 km), whole and local comparison of results of the break year and MOD-TR were used. Meanwhile, a comparison of vegetation change at the city-scale was also implemented. Moreover, to reduce insignificant trend pixels in TSS-RESTREND, a combination method of TSS-RESTREND and RESTREND (CTSS-RESTREND) was proposed. We found that: (1) MOD13Q1 and MOD13A1 two NDVI were suitable for combination with TSS-RESTREND to detect vegetation change in PRD, but MOD13Q1 was a better choice when considering the accuracy of local detailed vegetation change; (2) CTSS-RESTREND could detect more pixels with a significant change (i.e., significant increase and significant decrease) than those of TSS-RESTREND and RESTREND. Also, its effectiveness could be verified by Landsat data; (3) at the city-scale, the CTSS-RESTREND detected that only vegetation decreases in Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, and Zhongshan were higher than vegetation increases, but, significant vegetation changes (i.e., decreases and increases) were mainly concentrated in Huizhou, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Guangzhou.

TI  - Space Weathering Affects the Remote Near-IR Identification of Phyllosilicates
T2  - PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers on board current sample return missions Hayabusa2 and the Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) from primitive bodies detected the presence of hydrated silicates on the surface of asteroids Ryugu and Bennu, respectively. These detections relied upon the study of the 2.7 mu m OH-stretching spectral feature, whose peak position is related to the composition and structure of minerals. However, space weathering might alter the band profile, depth and position, thus complicating the interpretation of remote sensing data. In order to better understand these processes and provide support to space missions, we performed ion bombardment experiments on serpentine and saponite analogs. These two phyllosilicates are among the dominant mineral phases found in hydrated carbonaceous chondrites, which are possible analogs to surface materials observed on these primitive asteroids. We studied the behavior of the 2.7 mu m band as a function of ion fluence and found that the evolution of the phyllosilicate depends on its nature. For the saponite sample, the band is only slightly affected by ion bombardment, while for both serpentine samples it shifts toward longer wavelengths. For both samples, peak intensity and width is not strongly affected. The band shift for serpentine indicates that space weathering introduces a bias in the interpretation of NIR remote sensing observations of phyllosilicates. The shift observed in our experiments can be detected by instruments on board Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx, depending on the geometry of observation. Our findings provide support to the interpretation of such data.

TI  - A randomized study comparing different doses of superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer: The SUNRISE study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The non-radioactive method that uses the magnetic tracer (SPIO/Sienna) has shown to be a feasible technique for the SLN detection in breast cancer patients. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of different doses of a new magnetic tracer Sienna XP (Magtrace) compared to Tc-99 m and to evaluate its non-inferiority.Methods: Patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer cT1-3 N0, from October 2016 to August 2018 were eligible and consecutively randomized to three different doses of new SPIO used: group 1 (1 mL), group 2 (1.5 mL) and group 3 (2 mL).Results: A total of 135 patients were included in the study, 45 in each group. Detection of SLNs with the three doses of Sienna XP (1 mL, 1.5 mL and 2 mL) showed non-inferior rates compared to the conventional technique with radiotracer (p = 0.654). Concordance by patients with SLN positive was 100% for all groups.83 (70.3%) patients reported skin staining at one month postoperatively, significantly lower in group 1 (p = 0.042). At 6 months follow up, group 1 remains with significantly lower skin discoloration (p = 0,01). In multivariate analysis, dose of 2 mL showed statistically significant for the skin staining. The majority of patients (70%) felt that skin discoloration does not represent a problem.Conclusion: The use of the Sienna XP magnetic tracer at 1 mL is not inferior to higher doses of magnetic tracer neither is inferior to radiotracer. 1 mL of magnetic tracer resulted in significantly less skin discoloration compared to higher doses.

TI  - OVERWINTERING OF <i>CULEXMODESTUS</i> AND OTHER MOSQUITO SPECIES IN A REEDBED ECOSYSTEM, INCLUDING ARBOVIRUS FINDINGS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The overwintering strategy of the mosquito Culex modestus, an important West Nile virus (WNV) vector in Europe, was explored under field conditions in reedbed (Phragmites australis) ecosystems in early 2019. A total of 30 Cx. modestus females were found in a BG-Sentinel trap placed in a plastic greenhouse as well as in a reference BG-Sentinel trap placed under the open sky, both set up within the reedbeds and inspected every 2-3 days from February 27 to April 10, 2019. Moreover, 186 females of Cx. pipiens, 3 females of Anopheles hyrcanus, and 3 females of Culiseta annulata were trapped in the monitored time span. While all Cx. modestus females tested negative for the presence of WNV and other arboviruses circulating in Central Europe, we confirmed WNV lineage 2 and Tahyna virus infection in several pools of the collected Cx. pipiens, demonstrating arbovirus overwintering. This pilot study highlights the need for large-scale monitoring activities covering different regions to identify the overwintering strategy of both mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors in Central Europe.

TI  - Could lymph node evaluation be eliminated in nearly 50% of women with early stage ER/PR positive breast cancer?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Society of Surgical Oncology introduced guidance discouraging routine axillary staging in women 70 years or older with invasive, clinically node negative, hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Due to concerns this could result in patients missing necessary treatment, researchers from the Mayo Clinic developed a rule to distinguish between those at low/high-risk of having positive nodes. The purpose of this study was to validate the Mayo Clinic rule in women of all ages.Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on patients seen in one breast surgeon's practice from January 1, 2006 through March 1, 2018. The Mayo Clinic rule was applied, and accuracy was evaluated.Results: Utilizing the Mayo Clinic rule, 46.8% (n = 289) of women met low-risk criteria. Unexpected positive lymph nodes in low-risk women was 10.0% (n = 29), which was similar to the Mayo Clinic study finding (7.8%, P = 0.167).Conclusions: These data suggest the Mayo Clinic rule is reproducible. Nearly 50% of women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer could avoid axillary staging, but about 10% will have unexpected positive lymph nodes. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Properties of the Variability of the Solar Constant as an Index of Solar Activity
T2  - GEOMAGNETISM AND AERONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The properties of the solar constant variability are considered according to the results of satellite observations (http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/data/tsi-data/). The obtainment of satellite data with an accuracy of 0.01% that is devoid of atmospheric influence allows a detailed analysis of variations in this index of solar activity and space weather for solar-activity cycles 21-24. The use of wavelet analysis demonstrates the properties of the 11-year cycle in the variation of the solar constant. With the exclusion of variations of the 11-year cycle, it is possible to study short-period processes in each solar cycle. The variations in the solar constant demonstrate their own local spectrum of power periods, which differs from the activity periods according to sunspot observations. The most significant decrease in the solar constant occurs during the passage in the center of the solar disk of large groups of spots and activity complexes that block the solar constant. Thus, the basic properties of the intrinsic variability of the solar constant differ from the properties of the magnetic cycle.

AB  - The soil moisture is an important component in the plant's growth that decreases with time. Soil moisture content relies on climate change, urban heat island (UHI), and population. The purpose of the investigation is based on the soil moisture changes that are with different prospective in which soil moisture index (SMI) with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), SMI with land surface temperature (LST), and SMI with LST and NDVI involved. Similarly, the satellite images of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor) and Landsat 4-5 TM (Thematic Mapper) were based on examination and co-operate the RS/GIS techniques. All satellite data images were downloaded from the website of earthexplorer. The ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2, Microsoft Excel, and ArcGIS 10.3.1 software from diverse techniques were adopted like LST, SMI with LST, SMI with LST and NDVI, NDVI, SMI with NDVI, and LST with NDVI and all of the graphs were developed except LST and LST with NDVI. The study concludes that the SMI with LST decreased reasons of LST increased plus SMI with NDVI and SMI with LST and NDVI both increased in the review area, and all changes were examined from the images (1992 and 2019) comparisons. Furthermore, all of the changes graphically observed the high values of the no-change classes.

TI  - Quantifying environmental and social vulnerability: Role of urban Heat Island and air quality, a case study of Camden, NJ
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) effects depend on several factors, including air quality, temperature changes, and land cover. We used a holistic approach to quantify the UHI factors affecting air quality by developing three index-models (i.e., an environmental risk impact index (ERII), a social vulnerability index (SVI), and a health impact index (HII)) via multiple linear regression analysis for the city of Camden, NJ. Landsat 8 images were used to create surface-temperature and proportional vegetation (P-v) gradient, which were sampled along with environmental, social, and health variables in the study area. The results conclude that Pv is a better regressor than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The highest contributors in the models were Pv, water fraction, % imperviousness and digital elevation model (DEM) with the relative importance of 20.5%, 33.5%, 32.5%, 9% in ERII, 19.6%, 32.4%, 32%, 8% in SVI, and 20.1%, 32.6%, 31.8%, 8.9% in HII model, respectively. The neighborhoods at risk identified by the models are Lanning Square, Bergen Square, Central waterfront, Cooper grant, Gateway, Liberty Park, Whitman park and Parkside, which fall within the index range of 7.3-10 and mostly associate with > 32 degrees C. The indices will provide guidance in identifying neighborhood-risks of UHI-air-pollution.

TI  - Assessing the degree of soil salinity in the Indian Sundarban Biosphere Reserve using measured soil electrical conductivity and remote sensing data-derived salinity indices
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in India is vulnerable to soil salinity issues arising out of the occurrence of regular floods and storm surges. While much research has investigated various geo-hazards in this Reserve, the soil salinity aspect has remained underemphasized. This study assesses the degree of soil salinity and its spatial distribution in the SBR, using remote sensing and field measured datasets. Eight soil salinity indices extracted from satellite images were statistically correlated with measured electrical conductivity values using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Through this, the Salinity Index (SI-3) and the Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) were determined as the most suitable indices to map the SBR's soil salinity. The spatial analysis of these indices revealed that the administrative Blocks of Patharpratima, Basanti, Kultali, Sagar, Sandeshkhali-I, Gosaba, and Haroa experienced extremely high level of soil salinity and salt intrusion. The high drainage density and close proximity of these blocks to rivers fosters such high soil salinity. The study calls for efficacious policy measures to lessen the effects of soil salinity on the subsistence prospects of the coastal communities. The methodology adopted in this study can be utilized for similar analysis in other saline-affected areas at various spatial scales.

TI  - Evaluation of ultrasonic axillary dissection in preservation of intercostobrachial nerve and lymphatic sealing in breast cancer patients: Randomized controlled trial
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Electrocautery has been shown to be associated with excessive serous drainage which may lead to many complications in patients with breast cancer needing dissection of the axillary lymph nodes. The Harmonic Focus could outperform electrocautery in dissection of axillary lymph nodes, resulting in shortening of the operative times and minimize postoperative complications. This study aims to compare the mean axillary drain production and the axillary numbness frequency in axillary lymph node dissection (ANLD) during Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM) and breast conservative surgery (BCS) between the use of harmonics scalpel and electrocautery.Methods: This study includes 40 patients presented with early breast cancer (T1 and T2) underwent BCS or MRM in general surgery department, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University Hospital during the period from January 2017 to September 2019. The patients randomly assigned into 2 groups; group A: subjected to ANLD using Harmonic Focus tool and group B: subjected to ANLD using electrocautery. Operative time, total drainage volume, blood loss, duration of the drain and frequency of axillary numbness were recorded.Results: This study shows that using Harmonic in axillary dissection considerably reduced operating time, total drainage volume, blood loss, days of hospital stays and reduced axillary numbness level in comparison to conventional electrocautery.Conclusion: Compared to the normal electrocautery, the harmonic focus dissection has major advantages in lowering postoperative drainage, blood loss intra-operative and lower incidence of axillary numbness in breast cancer axillary dissection, without affecting operating time.

TI  - First record of the occurrence of sea ice in the Cordillera Darwin fjords (54°S), Chile
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides the first evidence for sea-ice formation in the Cordillera Darwin (CD) fjords in southern Chile, which is farther north than sea ice has previously been reported for the Southern Hemisphere. Initially observed from a passenger plane in September 2015, the presence of sea ice was then confirmed by aerial reconnaissance and subsequently identified in satellite imagery. A time series of Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 images during austral winter 2015 was used to examine the chronology of sea-ice formation in the Cuevas fjord. A longer time series of imagery across the CD was analyzed from 2000 to 2017 and revealed that sea ice had formed in each of the 13 fjords during at least one winter and was present in some fjords during a majority of the years. Sea ice is more common in the northern end of the CD, compared to the south where sea ice is not typically present. Is suggested that surface freshening from melting glaciers and high precipitation reduces surface salinity and promotes sea-ice formation within the semi-enclosed fjord system during prolonged periods of cold air temperatures. This is a unique set of initial observations that identify questions for future research in this remote area.

TI  - An Artificial Neural Network to Infer the Mediterranean 3D Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and Temperature Fields from Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data provide a huge number of sea surface observations, but cannot give direct information on deeper ocean layers, which can only be provided by sparse in situ data. The combination of measurements collected by satellite and in situ sensors represents one of the most effective strategies to improve our knowledge of the interior structure of the ocean ecosystems. In this work, we describe a Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) network designed to reconstruct the 3D fields of ocean temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration, two variables of primary importance for many upper-ocean bio-physical processes. Artificial neural networks can efficiently model eventual non-linear relationships among input variables, and the choice of the predictors is thus crucial to build an accurate model. Here, concurrent temperature and chlorophyll-a in situ profiles and several different combinations of satellite-derived surface predictors are used to identify the optimal model configuration, focusing on the Mediterranean Sea. The lowest errors are obtained when taking in input surface chlorophyll-a, temperature, and altimeter-derived absolute dynamic topography and surface geostrophic velocity components. Network training and test validations give comparable results, significantly improving with respect to Mediterranean climatological data (MEDATLAS). 3D fields are then also reconstructed from full basin 2D satellite monthly climatologies (1998-2015) and resulting 3D seasonal patterns are analyzed. The method accurately infers the vertical shape of temperature and chlorophyll-a profiles and their spatial and temporal variability. It thus represents an effective tool to overcome the in-situ data sparseness and the limits of satellite observations, also potentially suitable for the initialization and validation of bio-geophysical models.

TI  - Exploring Herbal Medicine Use during Palliative Cancer Care: The Integrative Physician as a Facilitator of Pharmacist-Patient-Oncologist Communication
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Oncology patients frequently use herbal and other forms of complementary medicine, often without the knowledge of oncologists, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals responsible for their care. Oncology healthcare professionals may lack the knowledge needed to guide their patients on the safe and effective use of herbal medicinal products, a number of which have potentially harmful effects, which include direct toxicity and negative herb-drug interactions. The current review addresses the prevalence and expectations of oncology patients from herbal medicine, as well as evidence for the beneficial or harmful effects of this practice (potential and actual), especially when the herbal products are used in conjunction with anticancer agents. Models of integrative oncology care are described, in which open and effective communication among oncologists, pharmacists, and integrative physicians on the use of herbal medicine by their patients occurs. This collaboration provides patients with a nonjudgmental and multidisciplinary approach to integrative medicine, echoing their own health-belief models of care during conventional cancer treatments. The role of the integrative physician is to facilitate this process, working with oncologists and pharmacists in the fostering of patient-centered palliative care, while ensuring a safe and effective treatment environment. Case scenario: W. is a 56 year old female artist who was recently diagnosed with localized hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Following lumpectomy and sentinel node dissection, she is scheduled to begin adjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen which will include adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (AC-T protocol). She is worried about developing peripheral neuropathy and its impact on her ability to paint, and she asks about a number of dietary supplements which she heard could prevent this from happening: omega-3, vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, and acetyl-l-carnithine. She is concerned, however, that the supplements may negatively interact with her chemotherapy regimen.

TI  - A New Method for Positional Accuracy Analysis in Georeferenced Satellite Images without Independent Ground Control Points
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a new method to analyze the positional accuracy of georeferenced satellite images without the use of ground control points. Compared to the traditional method used to carry out this kind of analysis, our approach provides a semiautomatic way to obtain a larger number of control points that satisfy the requirements of current standards regarding the size of the set of sample points, the positional accuracy of such points, the distance between points, and the distribution of points in the sample. Our methodology exploits high quality orthoimages, such as those provided by the Aerial Orthography National Plan (PNOA)-developed by the Spanish National Geographic Institute-and has been tested on spatial data from Landsat 8. Our method works under the current international standard (ASPRS 2014) and exhibits similar performance than other well-known methods to analyze the positional accuracy of georeferenced images based on the use of independent ground control points. More specifically, the positional accuracy achieved for a Landsat 8 dataset evaluated by the traditional method is 5.22 +/- 1.95 m, and when evaluated with the proposed method, it exhibits a typical accuracy of 5.76 +/- 0.50 m. Our experimental results confirm that the method is equally effective and less expensive than other available methods to analyze the positional accuracy of satellite images.

TI  - Assessment of DUACS Sentinel-3A Altimetry Data in the Coastal Band of the European Seas: Comparison with Tide Gauge Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of the Data Unification and Altimeter Combination System (DUACS) Sentinel-3A altimeter data in the coastal area of the European seas is investigated through a comparison with in situ tide gauge measurements. The comparison was also conducted using altimetry data from Jason-3 for inter-comparison purposes. We found that Sentinel-3A improved the root mean square differences (RMSD) by 13% with respect to the Jason-3 mission. In addition, the variance in the differences between the two datasets was reduced by 25%. To explain the improved capture of Sea Level Anomaly by Sentinel-3A in the coastal band, the impact of the measurement noise on the synthetic aperture radar altimeter, the distance to the coast, and Long Wave Error correction applied on altimetry data were checked. The results confirmed that the synthetic aperture radar altimeter instrument onboard the Sentinel-3A mission better solves the signal in the coastal band. Moreover, the Long Wave Error processing contributes to reduce the errors in altimetry, enhancing the consistency between the altimeter and in situ datasets.

TI  - Confined vulnerability of HIV infection among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Karnataka, India: Analysis of data from the HIV sentinel surveillance 2017
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: HIV Sentinel Surveillance among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics, ANC-HSS, is used to estimate HIV prevalence among the general population. Despite the declining trend, HIV prevalence among the general population in Karnataka is still higher than the national average (0.22%), with a recent, noticeable stabilization. Demographic analysis on concentrated HIV infection among pregnant women could be potential indicators for targeted HIV interventions among general population as well as and prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT).Objectives: To analyse the demographics of HIV-positive pregnant mothers in Karnataka, thereby identifying the most-at-risk populations (MARP) within the general population.Methods: In total, 24800 eligible pregnant women aged 15-49 attending the ANC clinic for the first time during the surveillance period (Jan-Mar, 2017) were enrolled. Demographic data and blood samples were collected, recorded and tested for HIV. Age-specific factors associated with HIV prevalence, besides the demographics of the HIV positive pregnant women, were analysed to identify the MARP for targeted HIV interventions.Results: Comprehensively, none of the demographic factors was significantly associated with HIV prevalence. Nevertheless, analysis of demographics, HIV test history and ART status of HIV-positive pregnant women reveals prominent prevalence patterns. The epidemic was majorly confined within young, less educated, primigravida and rural mothers of low economic status.Conclusion: ANC-HSS is designed to estimate the HIV prevalence among general population at national, state and district levels and is not reflective of the concentrated epidemic confined to MARP. Identifying the disease pattern specific to MARP is essential for effective targeted interventions and disease management.

TI  - Standard ultrastaging compared to one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) for the detection of sentinel lymph node metastases in early stage cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveWe compared ultrastaging and one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) examination of sentinel lymph nodes in two homogeneous patient populations diagnosed with early stage cervical cancer. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the rate and type of sentinel lymph node metastases detected by ultrastaging and OSNA assay. Secondary aims were to define the sensitivity and the negative predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy assessed with OSNA and ultrastaging and to define the role of sentinel lymph node assessment in predicting non-sentinel lymph node status.MethodsConsecutive patients who underwent surgery (radical hysterectomy or trachelectomy or cervical conization) at our institution, between January 2018 and March 2020, were enrolled. All patients had a preoperative diagnosis of early-stage cervical carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 stages IA-IIB) and underwent sentinel lymph node assessment with ultrastaging or OSNA. Patients with advanced FIGO stages and special histology subtypes (other than squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma) or patients with sentinel lymph nodes analyzed only with hematoxylin and eosin were excluded. Clinical data were compared using the chi(2) test and Fisher's exact test. A kappa coefficient was determined with respect to lymph node assessment. A p value ResultsA total of 116 patients were included in this retrospective analysis (53 ultrastaging, 63 OSNA). Overall, 531 and 605 lymph nodes were removed in the ultrastaging and OSNA groups, respectively, and 140 and 129 sentinel lymph nodes were analyzed in the ultrastaging and OSNA groups, respectively. 22 patients had metastatic sentinel lymph nodes: 6 (11.3%) of 53 patients in the ultrastaging group and 16 (25.4%) of 63 patients in the OSNA group. The total amount of positive SLNs was 7 (5%) of 140 in the ultrastaging group and 21 (16.3%) of 129 in the OSNA group, respectively (p=0.0047). Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 26 (49.1%) of 53 patients in the ultrastaging group and in 34 (54%) of 63 patients in the OSNA group due to comorbidities. Metastatic non-sentinel lymph nodes were found in 4 patients: 2 (7.7%) of 26 patients in the ultrastaging group and 2 (5.9%) of 34 patients in the OSNA group, respectively. The total amount of positive pelvic lymph nodes was 3 (0.6%) of 531 in the ultrastaging group and 4 (0.7%) of 605 in the OSNA group (p=0.61). In the OSNA group, only 2 patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes had metastatic disease in the pelvic lymph nodes. By contrast, no patients with OSNA-positive sentinel lymph nodes had metastases in the pelvic lymph nodes. In the ultrastaging group, all patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes did not have metastatic disease in other pelvic lymph nodes.ConclusionsOSNA assessment of sentinel lymph nodes was associated with a negative predictive value of 91% but poor reliability in detecting node metastases in non-sentinel pelvic lymph nodes. Of note, the ultrastaging protocol revealed higher sensitivity and more reliability in predicting pelvic non-sentinel lymph node status.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach for Remote Sensing Data Gap-Filling with Open-Source Implementation: An Example Regarding Land Surface Temperature, Surface Albedo and NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has now become a unique tool for continuous and predictable monitoring of geosystems at various scales, observing the dynamics of different geophysical parameters of the environment. One of the essential problems with most satellite environmental monitoring methods is their sensitivity to atmospheric conditions, in particular cloud cover, which leads to the loss of a significant part of data, especially at high latitudes, potentially reducing the quality of observation time series until it is useless. In this paper, we present a toolbox for filling gaps in remote sensing time-series data based on machine learning algorithms and spatio-temporal statistics. The first implemented procedure allows us to fill gaps based on spatial relationships between pixels, obtained from historical time-series. Then, the second procedure is dedicated to filling the remaining gaps based on the temporal dynamics of each pixel value. The algorithm was tested and verified on Sentinel-3 SLSTR and Terra MODIS land surface temperature data and under different geographical and seasonal conditions. As a result of validation, it was found that in most cases the error did not exceed 1 degrees C. The algorithm was also verified for gaps restoration in Terra MODIS derived normalized difference vegetation index and land surface broadband albedo datasets. The software implementation is Python-based and distributed under conditions of GNU GPL 3 license via public repository.

AB  - The data obtained with remote sensing sensors are processed to fuel studies related to the Earth's resources and environment. Sensor technologies being developed are increasing the diversity and capabilities of remote sensing data. However, these advancements are also multiplying the volume of information enormously, straining resources for processing the data. Meanwhile, the analysis and interpretation of most satellite data have not yet been fully automated, and human intervention is still necessary at certain stages. In addition, recent deep-learning methods that offer solutions to many remote sensing problems require a large amount of labeled data.

TI  - Assessment of Changes in Land Use/Land Cover and Land Surface Temperatures and Their Impact on Surface Urban Heat Island Phenomena in the Kathmandu Valley (1988-2018)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - More than half of the world's populations now live in rapidly expanding urban and its surrounding areas. The consequences for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) dynamics and Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) phenomena are poorly understood for many new cities. We explore this issue and their inter-relationship in the Kathmandu Valley, an area of roughly 694 km(2), at decadal intervals using April (summer) Landsat images of 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018. LULC assessment was made using the Support Vector Machine algorithm. In the Kathmandu Valley, most land is either natural vegetation or agricultural land but in the study period there was a rapid expansion of impervious surfaces in urban areas. Impervious surfaces (IL) grew by 113.44 km(2) (16.34% of total area), natural vegetation (VL) by 6.07 km(2) (0.87% of total area), resulting in the loss of 118.29 km(2) area from agricultural land (17.03% of total area) during 1988-2018. At the same time, the average land surface temperature (LST) increased by nearly 5-7 degrees C in the city and nearly 3-5 degrees C at the city boundary. For different LULC classes, the highest mean LST increase during 1988-2018 was 7.11 degrees C for IL with the lowest being 3.18 degrees C for VL although there were some fluctuations during this time period. While open land only occupies a small proportion of the landscape, it usually had higher mean LST than all other LULC classes. There was a negative relationship both between LST and Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST and Normal Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), respectively, and a positive relationship between LST and Normal Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The result of an urban-rural gradient analysis showed there was sharp decrease of mean LST from the city center outwards to about 15 kms because the NDVI also sharply increased, especially in 2008 and 2018, which clearly shows a surface urban heat island effect. Further from the city center, around 20-25 kms, mean LST increased due to increased agriculture activity. The population of Kathmandu Valley was 2.88 million in 2016 and if the growth trend continues then it is predicted to reach 3.85 million by 2035. Consequently, to avoid the critical effects of increasing SUHI in Kathmandu it is essential to improve urban planning including the implementation of green city technologies.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A 39-year-old woman underwent partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy for right triple negative breast cancer(T2N0M0, Stage ⅡA). Six months later, ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence(IBTR)was observed and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab therapy was started, but anaphylactoid symptoms appeared and the patient was discontinued. Subsequently, eribulin was started, but the IBTR was increased ineffectively. At that point, IBTR had progressed, apparently unresectable, with no distant metastases. We predicted from the patient's background that the patient may be associated with BRCA1 gene mutation and was sensitive to the platinum salts. Carboplatin plus gemcitabine was selected and 6 courses were performed. After the 6 courses, the IBTR were remarkably reduced and resectable, and mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection were performed. One year after the operation, contralateral breast cancer develop and found to be hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) by Genetic test. About 6 years have passed since local recurrence, but no distant metastases have been observed.

TI  - Air Quality Changes in Ukraine during the April 2020 Wildfire Event
T2  - GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper analyzes air quality changes in Ukraine during a wildfire event in April 2020 and a dust storm episode during the 16th of April 2020. The wildfire event contained two episodes of active fires and huge pollutants' emission: 4-14 April and 16-21 April, respectively. Using the Sentinel-5P data of CO and NO2 column number density and ground-based measurements, there was estimated air quality deterioration. Advection of polluted air masses and analysis of affected territories were made in combination with a web-based HYSPLIT model. Satellite data described air quality changes better than in -situ measurements. Data intercomparison showed better coincidence in regions that were not affected by wildfire emissions. The paper described the dust storm event based on absorbing aerosol index (AAI) data that occurred between two wildfire episodes.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach for Calamity Assessment Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of severe storm events has increased in recent decades due to climate change. These storms are one of the main causes for timber loss in European forests and damaged areas are prone to further degradation by, for example, bark beetle infestations. Usually, manual mapping of damaged areas based on aerial photographs is conducted by forest departments. This is very time-consuming and therefore automatic detection of windthrows based on active and passive remote sensing data is an ongoing research topic. In this study we evaluated state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for calamity assessment. The study area is in in the northern part of Hesse (Germany) and was covered by twelve Sentinel-2 scenes from 2018. Labels of damaged areas from the Friedericke storm (18 January 2018) were provided by HessenForst. We conducted several experiments based on a custom U-Net setup to derive the optimal architecture and input data as well as to assess the transferability of the model. Results highlight the possibility to detect damaged forest areas using Sentinel-2 data. Using a binary classification, accuracies of more than 92% were achieved with an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 46.6%. The proposed workflow was integrated into ArcGIS and is suitable for fast detection of damaged areas directly after a storm and for disaster management but is limited by the deca-meter spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Analysis of a Weak and Long-Lasting Volcanic Plume Emission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic emissions are a well-known hazard that can have serious impacts on local populations and aviation operations. Whereas several remote sensing observations detect high-intensity explosive eruptions, few studies focus on low intensity and long-lasting volcanic emissions. In this work, we have managed to fully characterize those events by analyzing the volcanic plume produced on the last day of the 2018 Christmas eruption at Mt. Etna, in Italy. We combined data from a visible calibrated camera, a multi-wavelength elastic/Raman Lidar system, from SEVIRI (EUMETSAT-MSG) and MODIS (NASA-Terra/Aqua) satellites and, for the first time, data from an automatic sun-photometer of the aerosol robotic network (AERONET). Results show that the volcanic plume height, ranging between 4.5 and 6 km at the source, decreased by about 0.5 km after 25 km. Moreover, the volcanic plume was detectable by the satellites up to a distance of about 400 km and contained very fine particles with a mean effective radius of about 7 mu m. In some time intervals, volcanic ash mass concentration values were around the aviation safety thresholds of 2 x 10(-3) g m(-3). Of note, Lidar observations show two main stratifications of about 0.25 km, which were not observed at the volcanic source. The presence of the double stratification could have important implications on satellite retrievals, which usually consider only one plume layer. This work gives new details on the main features of volcanic plumes produced during low intensity and long-lasting volcanic plume emissions.

TI  - Characterizing winter landfast sea-ice surface roughness in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two satellite datasets are used to characterize winter landfast first-year sea-ice (FYI), deformed FYI (DFYI) and multiyear sea-ice (MYI) roughness in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA): (1) optical Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and (2) synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1. The Normalized Difference Angular Index (NDAI) roughness proxy derived from MISR, and backscatter from Sentinel-1 are intercompared. NDAI and backscatter are also compared to surface roughness derived from an airborne LiDAR track covering a subset of FYI and MYI (no DFYI). Overall, NDAI and backscatter are significantly positively correlated when all ice type samples are considered. When individual ice types are evaluated, NDAI and backscatter are only significantly correlated for DFYI. Both NDAI and backscatter are correlated with LiDAR-derived roughness (r = 0.71 and r = 0.74, respectively). The relationship between NDAI and roughness is greater for MYI than FYI, whereas for backscatter and ice roughness, the relationship is greater for FYI than MYI. Linear regression models are created for the estimation of FYI and MYI roughness from NDAI, and FYI roughness from backscatter. Results suggest that using a combination of Sentinel-1 backscatter for FYI and MISR NDAI for MYI may be optimal for mapping winter sea-ice roughness in the CAA.

TI  - Characteristics of KOMPSAT-3A Key Image Quality Parameters During Normal Operation Phase
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The LEOP Cal/Val (Launch and Early Operation Phase Calibration/Validation) was carried out during 6 months after KOMPSAT-3A (KOMPSAT-3A Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3A) was launched in March 2015. After LEOP Cal/Val was successfully completed, high resolution KOMPSAT-3A has been successfully distributing to users over the past 8 years. The sub-meter high-resolution satellite image data obtained from KOMPSAT-3A is used as basic data for qualitative and quantitative information extraction in various fields such as mapping, GIS (Geographic Information System), and national land management, etc. The KARI (Korea Aerospace Research Institute) periodically checks and manages the quality of KOMPSAT-3A's product and the characteristics of satellite hardware to ensure the accuracy and reliability of information extracted from satellite data of KOMPSAT-3A. To minimize the deterioration of image quality due to aging of satellite hardware, payload and attitude sensors of KOMPSAT-3A, continuous improvement of image quality has been carried out. In this paper, the Cal/Val work-flow defined in the KOMPSAT-3A development phase was illustrated for the period of before and after the launch. The MTF, SNR, and location accuracy are the key parameters to estimate image quality and the methods of the measurements of each parameter are also described in this work. On the basis of defined quality parameters, the performance was evaluated and measured during the period of after LEOP Cal/Val. The current status and characteristics of MTF, SNR, and location accuracy of KOMPSAT-3A from 2016 to May 2020 were described as well.

TI  - Lack of distinct molecular profile of Primary Dermal Melanoma
T2  - HUMAN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary dermal melanoma (PDM) is a rare variant of melanoma which simulates metastatic melanoma to the skin. Diagnosis of PDM cannot be established on histologic grounds alone but requires absence of evidence of melanoma elsewhere by clinical history and/or imaging studies. Despite this entity being clinically well documented, limited data on molecular characterization are available. We performed comprehensive mutation and copy number variation analysis in a series of PDMs in search for distinctive molecular features. Studies were approved by respective institutional review boards. Six cases fulfilling strict histologic criteria of PDM were identified in patients with absent history of melanoma elsewhere, negative sentinel lymph node biopsies and imaging studies. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, and five cases passed quality control measures and were subjected to targeted exon sequencing using the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets 410 panel.Two of five PDM carried NRAS hotspot mutations characteristic of cutaneous melanoma (CM) genomic subtypes. One case showed a probable low-activating NRAS mutation in combination with additional aberrations in other mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway effectors. Hotspot mutations were also identified in the TERT promoter region, and one tumor showed a mutation in the SWI/SNF remodeling complex. No oncogenic mutations were identified in one case. Furthermore, none of the tumors analyzed showed activating mutations in G alpha subunits, including GNAQ and GNA11. Copy number alterations included deletions of Chr 9p, characteristic of CM. Despite PDM showing mutational heterogeneity, our findings suggest predominance of MAPK pathway aberrations in agreement with the mutational profile of CMs in general. Given the absence of genetic overlap with other distinct primary dermal melanocytic proliferations, mutational profiling will unlikely aid in the difficult differential diagnosis of PDM versus melanoma metastasis. Thorough metastatic workup remains crucial in establishing this rare diagnosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Conversion of Landsat 8 multispectral data through modified private content-based image retrieval technique for secure transmission and privacy
T2  - ENGINEERING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research work, we have developed a new image encryption-based algorithm for Landsat 8 satellite images. Image statistical parameters related to first-order image statistics, that is, mean (mu), SD are used to obtain the feature values for both original images and their encrypted versions. Multispectral satellite images generally contain a wide range of bands, which is 9 to 11 specifically for the Landsat 8 satellite. Hence, the information content of these images is richer than typical images. Through this algorithm, we aim to reduce the image content by randomly selecting only 10% of the total image pixels. These pixels are used to create new images, the so-called encrypted images. The visual presentation of the encrypted image resembles a noisy picture. First-order image statistics are calculated for both original images and their encrypted counterparts. These parameters show a similarity in their numerical values for both original and encrypted images. Thus, noisy pictures can be used for transmission in place of the original image when an outcome is decided through statistical image features. The visual similarity in the original images and encrypted images is obtained from the histogram signature plot for both original and encrypted images. The proposed algorithm can hence be used to convert image data for secure transmission and privacy.

TI  - A Pilot Study Evaluating the Effects of Magtrace® for Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients Regarding Care Process Optimization, Reimbursement, Surgical Time, and Patient Comfort Compared With Standard Technetium<SUP>99</SUP>
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy after technetium-99 (Tc-99) localization is a mainstay of oncologic breast surgery. The timing of Tc-99 injection can complicate operating room schedules, which can cause increasing overall costs of care and patient discomfort. Methods This study compared 59 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery including sentinel lymph node biopsy. Based on the surgeon's choice, 29 patients were treated with Tc-99, and 30 patients received the iron-based tracer, Magtrace. The primary outcomes were time spent on the care pathway and operating time from commissioning of the probe to removal of the sentinel node. The secondary outcomes were patient pain levels and reimbursement. Results The mean time spent on the preoperative breast cancer care pathway was significantly shorter for the Magtrace group (5.4 +/- 1.3 min) than for the Tc-99 group (82 +/- 20 min) (p < 0.0001). The median time from probe usage to sentinel node extirpation was slightly but not significantly shorter in the Magtrace group (5 min; interquartile range [IQR], 3-15 min vs 10 min; IQR, 7-15 min; p = 0.151). Reimbursement and pain levels remained unchanged, and the hospital length of stay was similar in the two groups (Magtrace: 5.1 +/- 2.3 days vs Tc-99: 4.5 +/- 3.2 days). Conclusions Magtrace localization shortened the preoperative care pathway and did not affect surgical time or reimbursement. Once established, it could allow for cost reduction and improve patient comfort.

TI  - Assessing the Potential Replacement of Laurel Forest by a Novel Ecosystem in the Steep Terrain of an Oceanic Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasions are a major global threat to biodiversity and often affect ecosystem services negatively. They are particularly problematic on oceanic islands where there are many narrow-ranged endemic species, and the biota may be very susceptible to invasion. Quantifying and mapping invasion processes are important steps for management and control but are challenging with the limited resources typically available and particularly difficult to implement on oceanic islands with very steep terrain. Remote sensing may provide an excellent solution in circumstances where the invading species can be reliably detected from imagery. We here develop a method to map the distribution of the alien chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) on the island of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain), using freely available satellite images. On La Palma, the chestnut invasion threatens the iconic laurel forest, which has survived since the Tertiary period in the favourable climatic conditions of mountainous islands in the trade wind zone. We detect chestnut presence by taking advantage of the distinctive phenology of this alien tree, which retains its deciduousness while the native vegetation is evergreen. Using both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (parallel analyses), we obtained images in two seasons (chestnuts leafless and in-leaf, respectively) and performed image regression to detect pixels changing from leafless to in-leaf chestnuts. We then applied supervised classification using Random Forest to map the present-day occurrence of the chestnut. Finally, we performed species distribution modelling to map the habitat suitability for chestnut on La Palma, to estimate which areas are prone to further invasion. Our results indicate that chestnuts occupy 1.2% of the total area of natural ecosystems on La Palma, with a further 12-17% representing suitable habitat that is not yet occupied. This enables targeted control measures with potential to successfully manage the invasion, given the relatively long generation time of the chestnut. Our method also enables research on the spread of the species since the earliest Landsat images.

TI  - The Key Features and Periodization of Socialist Realism in the Literary Context
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the research on various aspects of socialist realism from the perspective of belleslettres. It analyzes the essence and key features of this phenomenon, makes a generalization of approaches to the periodization of socialist realism. In the research, we used historical-typological and sociological methods for the analysis of historical documents and criticism in order to clarify the party policy in the field of literature. The psychoanalytic method was used to study the means of the writer adaptation to the Soviet dictatorship. Anthropological and intertextual methods were used to clarify the peculiarities of the national culture and the literary codes of socialist realism. The method of reconstruction allowed us to depict the picture of the past with the help of archival documents, epistolary, memoirs, etc. It is found out that the formation of socialist realism resulted from the mixture of culture and state party dictatorship in literature and art. Socialist realism provided political manipulation of the mass consciousness and performed the regulatory function for social communication. It is proved that the theory of socialist realism was based on such categories as ideiinist (ideology), klasovist (class content), and partiinist (party-mindedness). At the same time, such categories as creative imagination, fantasy, and fiction were denied. When creating literary texts, writers used ready-made templates, cliches, and stereotypes affecting our perception. The authors of the article analyzed the influence of socialist realism on the cultural preferences of that time's citizens. The article graphically accumulates the main approaches to the periodization of socialist realism. We analyze the research of H. Gunter, Yu. Boriev, V. Klymchuk, V. Tiupa, and characterize each period. It is revealed that the literature of socialist realism was interpreted on the behavioral (attitude to the state policy) and creative (themes, style, images) levels. In the article, the authors characterize the key features of socialist realism in the context of the structural-stylistic, worldview-universal, figurative (characterological) directions.

TI  - Himawari-8 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) Retrieval Using a Deep Neural Network Trained Using AERONET Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimation from satellite-measured top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectances is challenging because of the complicated TOA-AOD relationship and a nexus of land surface and atmospheric state variations. This task is usually undertaken using a physical model to provide a first estimate of the TOA reflectances which are then optimized by comparison with the satellite data. Recently developed deep neural network (DNN) models provide a powerful tool to represent the complicated relationship statistically. This study presents a methodology based on DNN to estimate AOD using Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) TOA observations. A year (2017) of AHI TOA observations over the Himawari-8 full disk collocated in space and time with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD data were used to derive a total of 14,154 training and validation samples. The TOA reflectance in all six AHI solar bands, three TOA reflectance ratios derived based on the dark-target assumptions, sun-sensor geometry, and auxiliary data are used as predictors to estimate AOD at 500 nm. The DNN AOD is validated by separating training and validation samples using random k-fold cross-validation and using AERONET site-specific leave-one-station-out validation, and is compared with a random forest regression estimator and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) AOD. The DNN AOD shows high accuracy: (1) RMSE = 0.094, R-2 = 0.915 for k-fold cross-validation, and (2) RMSE = 0.172, R-2 = 0.730 for leave-one-station-out validation. The k-fold cross-validation overestimates the DNN accuracy as the training and validation samples may come from the same AHI pixel location. The leave-one-station-out validation reflects the accuracy for large-area applications where there are no training samples for the pixel location to be estimated. The DNN AOD has better accuracy than the random forest AOD and JMA AOD. In addition, the contribution of the dark-target derived TOA ratio predictors is examined and confirmed, and the sensitivity to the DNN structure is discussed.

TI  - On the Contribution of Satellite Altimetry-Derived Water Surface Elevation to Hydrodynamic Model Calibration in the Han River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry can fill the spatial gaps of in-situ gauging networks especially in poorly gauged regions. Although at a generally low temporal resolution, satellite altimetry has been successfully used for water surface elevation (WSE) estimation and hydrodynamic modeling. This study aims to investigate the contribution of WSE from both short-repeat and geodetic altimetry to hydrodynamic model calibration, and also explore the contribution of the new Sentinel-3 mission. Two types of data sources (i.e., in-situ and satellite altimetry) are investigated together with two roughness cases (i.e., spatially variable and uniform roughness) for calibration of a hydrodynamic model (DHI MIKE 11) with available bathymetry. A 150 km long reach of Han River in China with rich altimetry and in-situ gauging data is selected as a case study. Results show that the performances of the model calibrated by satellite altimetry-derived datasets are acceptable in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of simulated WSE. Sentinel-3A can support hydrodynamic model calibration even though it has a relatively low temporal resolution (27-day repeat cycle). The CryoSat-2 data with a higher spatial resolution (7.5 km at the Equator) are proved to be more valuable than the Sentinel-3A altimetry data with a low spatial resolution (104 km at the Equator) for hydrodynamic model calibration in terms of RMSE values of 0.16 and 0.18 m, respectively. Moreover, the spatially variable roughness can also improve the model performance compared to the uniform roughness case, with decreasing RMSE values by 2-14%. Our finding shows the value of satellite altimetry-derived datasets for hydrodynamic model calibration and therefore supports flood risk assessment and water resources management.

TI  - Influence of the Economic Efficiency of Built-Up Land (EEBL) on Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, an urban agglomeration is a trend in global urbanization. With the continuous development of urban agglomerations, Chinese urban agglomerations have entered an era of high-quality development. Improving the economic efficiency of built-up land (EEBL) and maintaining a good ecological environment are important for promoting the high-quality development of urban agglomerations. Urban heat islands (UHIs) are one of the major ecological environmental problems affecting urban agglomerations. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the influence of the EEBL on UHIs in urban agglomerations. Based on the land-use data, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data and gross domestic product (GDP) in the secondary and tertiary industries from 2000 to 2018, and electric power consumption data in 2018, this paper analyzed the influence of the EEBL on the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA). The results showed that most of cites in the YRDUA experienced rapid EEBL growth and a significant increase in heat island intensity from 2000 to 2018. There has been a significant positive correlation between the EEBL and the SUHII over the years, among which the EEBL had the strongest correlation (R = 0.76, p < 0.01) with the SUHII in 2000. Moreover, among the 27 cities in the YRDUA, 21 cities showed a significant uptrend of the SUHII with rising EEBL and the uptrend was significantly and negatively correlated with the electric power utilization efficiency (EPUE) of the secondary and tertiary industries (R = -0.6, p < 0.01). These results indicated that the EEBL of the secondary and tertiary industries had a significant influence on UHIs, which also reflected the significant influence of anthropogenic heat on UHIs to a certain extent. The findings of this paper can provide a scientific basis for mitigating the UHIs caused by the rapid economic development and promoting the high-quality development of urban agglomerations.

TI  - Analyzing vegetation change in a sagebrush ecosystem using long-term field observations and Landsat imagery in Wyoming
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of monitoring shrublands to detect and understand changes through time is increasingly recognized as critical to management. This research focuses on ecological change observed over 10 yr of field observation at 126 plots and over 35 yr of the Landsat archive in a shrubland ecosystem. Field data consisting of the fractional cover of shrubs, sagebrush, herbs, litter, and bare ground components were collected to be directly comparable to Landsat time-series predictions at an ecoregion level. We used these data to test three hypotheses. First, that precipitation and temperature govern changes in the proportions of shrubland components on an interannual time scale. Second, that longer-term component change is related to climate change. Finally, that change intensity varies by shrubland communities clustered by biophysical conditions. We found that the field observations and Landsat times-series predictions generally responded similarly to interannual variation in weather, chiefly driven by precipitation. Landsat times-series data provided a reasonable means of scaling up the findings of the field observations to a larger temporal and spatial window. The results of the analysis indicate that shrubland component change intensity significantly varies by biophysical clusters, and indicate a significant increase in the cover of shrubs and sagebrush in long-term monitoring plots between 2008 and 2017 and in the Landsat time-series data across the Wyoming Basin study area from 1985 to 2017 and from 2008 to 2017. Our results indicate that the Landsat time series can be used to answer critical questions regarding the influence of climate change and the suitability of management practices in shrubland ecosystems.

TI  - Land Subsidence Prediction Induced by Multiple Factors Using Machine Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Beijing Plain, land subsidence is one of the most prominent geological problems, which is affected by multiple factors. Groundwater exploitation, thickness of the Quaternary deposit and urban development and construction are important factors affecting the formation and development of land subsidence. Here we choose groundwater level change, thickness of the Quaternary deposit and index-based built-up index (IBI) as influencing factors, and we use the influence factors to predict the subsidence amount in the Beijing Plain. The Sentinel-1 radar images and the persistent scatters interferometry (PSI) were adopted to obtain the information of land subsidence. By using Google Earth Engine platform and Landsat8 optical images, IBI was extracted. Groundwater level change and thickness of the Quaternary deposit were obtained from hydrogeological data. Machine learning algorithms Linear Regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to investigate the relationship between land subsidence and influencing factors. Based on the results obtained by Linear Regression and PCA, a suitable machine learning algorithm was selected to predict the subsidence amount in the Beijing Plain in 2018 through influencing factors. In this study, we found that the maximum subsidence rate in the Beijing Plain had reached 115.96 mm/y from 2016 to 2018. The land subsidence was serious in eastern Chaoyang and northwestern Tongzhou. In addition, the area where thickness of the Quaternary deposit reached 150-200 m was prone to more serious land subsidence in the Beijing Plain. In groundwater exploitation, the second confined aquifer had the greatest impact on land subsidence. Through Linear Regression and PCA, we found that the relationship between land subsidence and influencing factors was nonlinear. XGBoost was feasible to predict subsidence amount. The prediction accuracy of XGBoost on the subsidence amount reached 0.9431, and the mean square error was controlled at 15.97. By using XGBoost to predict the subsidence amount, our research provides a new idea for land subsidence prediction.

TI  - Probing the dynamic characteristics of aerosol originated from South Asia biomass burning using POLDER/GRASP satellite data with relevant accessory technique design
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic characteristics of biomass burning aerosol originated from South Asia are investigated in this research using nearly 9 years of POLDER/GRASP satellite aerosol dataset. The POLDER/GRASP remote sensing data can provide global, repeatable, various, and sufficient real-world aerosol information even in the remote ocean region, which can't be offered by the ground measurement, laboratory observation or model simulation. The MODIS thermal anomalies/fire dataset and HYSPLIT backward trajectory are applied to search the aerosol originated from South Asia biomass burning. The biomass burning aerosol originated from South Asia could transport to and influence the north part of Indian Ocean (including Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea), the north part of Indo-China Peninsula, South China, and even far to the Pacific Ocean (including part of East China Sea and South China Sea). The chemical, physical and optical characteristics of biomass burning aerosol over land and over ocean show different features and evolution patterns. Such difference is caused by the different ambient environment and different mixed aerosol during the transport process (urban/industrial aerosol over land and sea salt over ocean). During the 48-hours aging process, the volume fraction of black carbon, AAOD and Angstrom Exponent decrease. Meanwhile, the aerosol sphere fraction and SSA increase. The biomass burning aerosol over land shows a more obvious evolution trend than that over ocean. The biomass burning aerosol over ocean generally have higher SSA and lower volume fraction of black carbon, aerosol sphere fraction, AAOD and Angstrom Exponent. The aerosol radiative forcing efficiency also varies between land and ocean, due to their different features of aerosol and surface properties. In general, a negative clear-sky aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (cooling effect) at the TOA is observed. The aerosol cooling effect at the TOA over ocean (-82 W/m(2) on average) is much stronger than that over land (-36 W/m(2) on average). During the 48-hours aging process, a significant enhancement of the negative radiative forcing efficiency at the TOA is found over land. Over ocean, the enhancement of the negative radiative forcing efficiency at the TOA is weaker.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We experienced a case of right sided accessory breast cancer complicated by contralateral breast cancer. A 50-year-old woman came to us for an examination because a tumor in her left breast was pointed out at breast cancer screening. A breast MRI confirmed a tumor in her left breast and a tumor continuing from the skin to the subcutis of the right axilla. A skin biopsy for the tumor in the right axilla and a core needle biopsy(CNB)for the tumor in the left breast were performed. The pathological result of the CNB for the left breast indicated an invasive ductal carcinoma of the tubular formative scirrhous type. Although the tumor of the right axilla was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating cord-like arrays, it was examined by skin biopsy and therefore no deep part of the tissue was included. We conducted immunostaining, in consideration of the possibility of metastasis from the left sided breast cancer. ER, PgR, mammaglobin, GATA 3 were positive, strongly suggesting that the tumor in the right axilla was also derived from a mammary gland. We also performed a wide local excision of the right axilla plus axillary dissection(level Ⅰ)in addition to conducting a left mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy, in consideration of the possibility of primary right sided accessory breast cancer. The pathological result following surgery confirmed a difference in the histologic features between both sides, residual normal accessory mammary glands around the tumor on the right side, and the presence of rich DCIS and a lobular replacement image, leading to a definitive diagnosis of primary invasive ductal carcinoma of the accessory breast on the right side.

TI  - <i>Miombo</i> woodland, an ecosystem at risk of disappearance in the Lufira Biosphere Reserve (Upper Katanga, DR Congo)? A 39-years analysis based on Landsat images
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lufira Biosphere Reserve (LBR) is a protected area located in Southeastern DR Congo, created for the conservation of Miombo woodland, an ecosystem threatened by anthropogenic activities developed in the region. However, scientific studies regarding land cover dynamics within the LBR are non-existent to date. This study maps and quantifies the land cover dynamics within and around the LBR, based on diachronic analysis of five Landsat images (1979, 1986, 1998, 2008 and 2018) and field verification missions. Landscape metrics were utilized to understand changes in landscape pattern. The results indicate that Miombo woodland area have been reduced by a factor of three in the LBR, as they covered 11.2 km(2) in 2018 compared to 85.3 km(2) in 1979. The annual deforestation rate between 1979 and 2018 was 1.8%, almost eight-fold higher than the rate registered at the country level. Within the LBR, this deforestation has been offset by an increase in areas occupied by grassy savanna (+16.9 km(2)), as well as fields and fallows (+53.3 km(2)). Further, water and wetland area increased by 17.9 km(2) in 39 years whereas the wooded savanna, the bare soil and built-up decreased by 24.9 km(2) and 4.0 km(2) respectively. In general, analysis of landscape spatial pattern dynamics through landscape metrics, showed a process of creation and aggregation of grassy savanna, water and wetlands, as well as fields and fallows, as opposed to dissection and attrition of Miombo woodland, wooded savanna, bare soil and built-up. Overall, the LBR has undergone a major transformation, mainly due to demographic pressure and the development of subsistence activities in a precarious economic context. The study concludes that in the absence of any land use planning policy, LBR risks losing its status following lost of the rare Miombo woodland patches still existing. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - MetOp/AVHRR Snow Detection Method for Meteorological Applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays a significant role in the weather and climate system by affecting the energy and mass transfer between the surface and the atmosphere. It also has far-reaching effects on ecosystems of snow-covered areas. Therefore, global snow-cover observations in a timely manner are needed. Satellite-based instruments can be utilized to produce snow-cover information that is suitable for these needs. Highly variable surface and snow-cover features suggest that operational snow extent algorithms may benefit from at least a partly empirical approach that is based on carefully analyzed training data. Here, a new two-phase snow-cover algorithm utilizing data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the MetOp satellites of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) is introduced and evaluated. This algorithm is used to produce the MetOp/AVHRR H32 snow extent product for the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H SAF). The algorithm aims at direct detection of snow-covered and snow-free pixels without preceding cloud masking. Pixels that cannot be classified reliably to snow or snow-free, because of clouds or other reasons, are set as unclassified. This reduces the coverage but increases the accuracy of the algorithm. More than four years of snow-depth and state-of-the-ground observations from weather stations were used to validate the product. Validation results show that the algorithm produces high-quality snow coverage data that may be suitable for numerical weather prediction, hydrological modeling, and other applications.

TI  - Drivers of Fire Anomalies in the Brazilian Amazon: Lessons Learned from the 2019 Fire Crisis
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019 fire crisis in Amazonia dominated global news and triggered fundamental questions about the possible causes behind it. Here we performed an in-depth investigation of the drivers of active fire anomalies in the Brazilian Amazon biome. We assessed a 2003-2019 time-series of active fires, deforestation, and water deficit and evaluated potential drivers of active fire occurrence in 2019, at the biome-scale, state level, and local level. Our results revealed abnormally high monthly fire counts in 2019 for the states of Acre, Amazonas, and Roraima. These states also differed from others by exhibiting in this year extreme levels of deforestation. Areas in 2019 with active fire occurrence significantly greater than the average across the biome had, on average, three times more active fires in the three previous years, six times more deforestation in 2019, and five times more deforestation in the five previous years. Approximately one-third of yearly active fires from 2003 to 2019 occurred up to 1 km from deforested areas in the same year, and one-third of deforested areas in a given year were located up to 500 m from deforested areas in the previous year. These findings provide critical information to support strategic decisions for fire prevention policies and fire combat actions.

TI  - Prediction of arsenic vulnerable zones in the groundwater environment of a rapidly urbanizing setup, Guwahati, India
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study, through a multi model assessment approach emphasizes the relevance of prior urban settlement planning with respect to the changing land use pattern. A coupled approach integrating satellite data products of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change along with chemical evaluation of As toxicity were modelled to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability. Change detection analysis was incorporated using the satellite images of 2013 and 2016 which shows 10 % increase in the buildings as compared to the total area of the study in given period. The LULC class that has been most compromised in this expansion and got reduced were the vegetation (similar to 6 %) and the barren areas (similar to 4 %) and the total surface water sources (0.5 %), all contributing in increased urban sprawl. As per the origin of As contamination in the area it seems that high sediment deposition along the braided Brahmaputra River stretch leads to As contamination which was associated with Fe(oxy)-hydroxide dissolution. The vulnerability assessment using Artificial Neural Network technique in this region shows that As is present relatively in lesser concentration in the east direction. The continuous expansion of the urban habitation towards the greater As concentration zone will further make the situation critical for the people dependent on groundwater. The study suggests that prior settlement planning must be carried out in accordance to the presence of any toxic constituent in drinking water source to avoid future crisis for potable water.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Method to Monitor Water, Aquatic Vegetation, and Invasive Water Hyacinth at National Extents
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Diverse freshwater biological communities are threatened by invasive aquatic alien plant (IAAP) invasions and consequently, cost countries millions to manage. The effective management of these IAAP invasions necessitates their frequent and reliable monitoring across a broad extent and over a long-term. Here, we introduce and apply a monitoring approach that meet these criteria and is based on a three-stage hierarchical classification to firstly detect water, then aquatic vegetation and finally water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes, previously Eichhornia crassipes), the most damaging IAAP species within many regions of the world. Our approach circumvents many challenges that restricted previous satellite-based water hyacinth monitoring attempts to smaller study areas. The method is executable on Google Earth Engine (GEE) extemporaneously and utilizes free, medium resolution (10-30 m) multispectral Earth Observation (EO) data from either Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2. The automated workflow employs a novel simple thresholding approach to obtain reliable boundaries for open-water, which are then used to limit the area for aquatic vegetation detection. Subsequently, a random forest modelling approach is used to discriminate water hyacinth from other detected aquatic vegetation using the eight most important variables. This study represents the first national scale EO-derived water hyacinth distribution map. Based on our model, it is estimated that this pervasive IAAP covered 417.74 km(2) across South Africa in 2013. Additionally, we show encouraging results for utilizing the automatically derived aquatic vegetation masks to fit and evaluate a convolutional neural network-based semantic segmentation model, removing the need for detection of surface water extents that may not always be available at the required spatio-temporal resolution or accuracy. The water hyacinth species discrimination has a 0.80, or greater, overall accuracy (0.93), F1-score (0.87) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.80) based on 98 widely distributed field sites across South Africa. The results suggest that the introduced workflow is suitable for monitoring changes in the extent of open water, aquatic vegetation, and water hyacinth for individual waterbodies or across national extents.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Fusion: A Simulation Approach to Pansharpening Aerial and Satellite Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing demand for high-quality imaging data and the current technological limitations of imaging sensors require the development of techniques that combine data from different platforms in order to obtain comprehensive products for detailed studies of the environment. To meet the needs of modern remote sensing, the authors present an innovative methodology of combining multispectral aerial and satellite imagery. The methodology is based on the simulation of a new spectral band with a high spatial resolution which, when used in the pansharpening process, yields an enhanced image with a higher spectral quality compared to the original panchromatic band. This is important because spectral quality determines the further processing of the image, including segmentation and classification. The article presents a methodology of simulating new high-spatial-resolution images taking into account the spectral characteristics of the photographed types of land cover. The article focuses on natural objects such as forests, meadows, or bare soils. Aerial panchromatic and multispectral images acquired with a digital mapping camera (DMC) II 230 and satellite multispectral images acquired with the S2A sensor of the Sentinel-2 satellite were used in the study. Cloudless data with a minimal time shift were obtained. Spectral quality analysis of the generated enhanced images was performed using a method known as "consistency" or "Wald's protocol first property". The resulting spectral quality values clearly indicate less spectral distortion of the images enhanced by the new methodology compared to using a traditional approach to the pansharpening process.

M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow water habitat mapping is important to do because: (1) it can support the planning, management, and decision making of government spatial; (2) it can support and design a Marine Protected Area (MPA); (3) it can conduct a scientific research program to determine a knowledge about benthic ecosystem and seabed geology; (4) it can do seabed resource valuation, both biotic and abiotic, for economic and management goals. Nowadays, the standardization of thematic map details level in coastal ecosystem has not determined, especially in shallow water habitat based on coastal management needs in certain scale. The study aims to compare map accuracy level between SPOT 6, Sentinel 2A, and Landsat 8 classification results using support vector machine algorithm. The study site is in Wakatobi Island, including Kapota Island and Kompoone Island. The in-situ data took on July 2019. The 347 ground truth and transect images in the field analyzed using Coral Point Count with Excel Extension (CPCe). The classification scheme that was gotten is 8 habitat benthic classes, then conducted classification with classify them to be 6 and 5 classes. The result from SPOT 6 for 5 habitat classes has the highest overall accuracy. The differences between pixel (spatial resolution) and the amount of classification scheme influence accuracy results.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed automated landscape mapping using Bely Island, the Kara Sea as an example. The island was selected since the Yamal-Nenets District local administration established a research station for continuous fundamental research of human activity affects the Arctic ecosystems. With a small test site that was field studied in summer, 2016, we considered the relevant approaches to landscape mapping based on object-based image analysis (OBIA) and support vector machine (SVM) classification. A combined method that uses independent processing of initial data with subsequent statistical analysis of the results is proposed. The study shows that this approach gives more detailed differentiation of landscape features in the area of interest. HR images from the Resurs-P satellite and Arctic DTM digital terrain models of the Bely Island were used for the first time. The object-based image analysis makes it possible to further expand the initial dataset by adding UAV survey images, while the SVM classification can be improved by adding dedicated layers intended for morphometric analysis of digital terrain models. The proposed technology applies to large-scale landscape mapping of the entire Bely Island.

AB  - Background: Indications for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in the population with thin melanoma have frequently changed over time. The objective of our study was to evaluate T1 melanoma pathologic features predictive of SLN positivity with a primary focus on identifying a specific mitotic value that is most predictive of lymph node disease. Further detailed predictive features would help physicians select patients with thin melanoma for SLN biopsy.Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for all patients diagnosed with trunk or extremity cutaneous melanoma with <= 1 mm depth who underwent SLN biopsy between the years of 2010 and 2013. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics including depth, mitotic rate (MR), ulceration, and tumor location were evaluated. MR was dichotomized at multiple cut points to identify the ideal number of mitosis for MR as a predictor of SLN status. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors affecting nodal positivity and the impact of MR threshold. Kaplan-Meir curves were used for overall survival (OS) analysis.Results: Factors significantly associated with SLN positivity in the entire cohort included MR (P < 0.001, OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.18-1.31), tumor location (P = 0.017, OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07-2.05), and ulceration (P < 0.001, OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.39-2.93,). An MR >= 4 was significant for SLN positivity (P = 0.049, OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.38). Mean OS was 46.7 mo for MR < 4 compared with 43.2 mo for MR >= 4 (P < 0.001).Conclusions: MR >= 4 was significant and associated with SLN positivity in thin melanomas and asulceration. Thus, MR >= 4 should be considered as an indication for SLN biopsy in thin melanoma. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Muslim Communities and Diasporas as a Factor in the Integration of Migrants (A Tomsk Case)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the formation of Muslim communities and national organizations, strategies for their development in a changing urban community. The aim of the study is to describe the construction of Muslim networks using the concepts "global diaspora" and "Islamicness". Based on the active involvement of religious organizations in the development of urban space, several aspects related to the activities of Muslim actors have been identified. Actors have relationships between different ethnic communities. A hypothesis is proposed, according to which, using the administrative and ideological resources, Muslims adapt and integrate through religious institutions (mosques or NGOs) into the Islamic space of Tomsk. The objective of the study is to identify factors of sociocultural adaptation, such as various religious ones, Muslim clubs, holidays, instructions of religious leaders. Many spheres of a Muslim's life develop through traditional practices - religion, economy, etc. An authoritarian discourse is emerging that constructs social phenomena around religion. Through the factors of "Islamicness", the absence of religious life can be stated in a significant number of migrants and in those considering themselves to be believing Muslims. The networks are constructed in various aspects: the influence of national autonomies acting as conductors and organizers of events; the mosque that forms an integration and adaptation space around itself. In their religious practice, Muslim migrants see the mosque as an integral factor in their lives. Religious worship plays an important role. Linguistic communication between Muslims about the rightness of Islamic practices also plays a role. Different groups of Muslims, dividing themselves along ethnic lines (although this is not allowed in Islamic dogma), when establishing contacts with other Muslims, know how to behave and act, determine the appropriate facial expressions and gestures (e.g. different positions of hands and feet when praying). Based on anthropological methods such as semi-structured interviews and participatory observation, the field study analysis is built around the formation of communities based on ethnicity and the impact of mosque space on them. The object of the research is the personality of a Muslim, their worldview and interpretive activity. Through the concept of identity, the necessary cultural environment, the most acceptable for both personality and family relations, is created around the Muslim.

TI  - Applying the Tropical Peatland Combustion Algorithm to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study establishes a new technique for peatland fire detection in tropical environments using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. The Tropical Peatland Combustion Algorithm (ToPeCAl) without longwave thermal infrared (TIR) (henceforth known as ToPeCAl-2) was tested on Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data and then applied to Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. The research is aimed at establishing peatland fire information at higher spatial resolution and more frequent observation than from Landsat-8 data over Indonesia's peatlands. ToPeCAl-2 applied to Sentinel-2 was assessed by comparing fires detected from the original ToPeCAl applied to Landsat-8 OLI/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) verified through comparison with ground truth data. An adjustment of ToPeCAl-2 was applied to minimise false positive errors by implementing pre-process masking for water and permanent bright objects and filtering ToPeCAl-2's resultant detected fires by implementing contextual testing and cloud masking. Both ToPeCAl-2 with contextual test and ToPeCAl with cloud mask applied to Sentinel-2 provided high detection of unambiguous fire pixels (>95%) at 20 m spatial resolution. Smouldering pixels were less likely to be detected by ToPeCAl-2. The detected smouldering pixels from ToPeCAl-2 applied to Sentinel-2 with contextual testing and with cloud masking were only 35% and 56% correct, respectively; this needs further investigation and validation. These results demonstrate that even in the absence of TIR data, an adjusted ToPeCAl algorithm (ToPeCAl-2) can be applied to detect peatland fires at 20 m resolution with high accuracy especially for flaming. Overall, the implementation of ToPeCAl applied to cost-free and available Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data enables regular peatland fire monitoring in tropical environments at higher spatial resolution than other satellite-derived fire products.

TI  - Is Knowledge of Circular Economy, Pro-Environmental Behavior, Satisfaction with Life, and Beliefs a Predictor of Connectedness to Nature in Rural Children and Adolescents? A Pilot Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable development (SD) is crucial to maintaining and preserving the planet we live on. The new paradigm of circular economy (CE) corresponds to the sustainable development goals and includes environmental, economic, and social dimensions. The United Nations has set quality education and the search for good health and well-being in the long term as tools for achieving SD. This study aims to identify the predictors of connectedness to nature in children and adolescents using knowledge of CE, pro-environmental behavior, beliefs about caring for the environment, and satisfaction with life as possible predictive variables. The exploration of the influence of these predictors on connectedness to nature, taking sex and age as covariates, was performed using a binary logistic regression model. We found that low scores on pro-environmental behavior, satisfaction with life, knowledge of waste management and CE, and beliefs about environmental behavior were related to a low degree of connectedness to nature. Thus, our findings suggest that the educational system must promote not only the assimilation of knowledge and beliefs but also satisfaction with life given its relationship with connectedness to nature.

M3  - Article
AB  - Underground mining is one of the human activities with the highest impact in terms of induced ground motion. The excavation of the mining levels creates pillars, rooms and cavities that can evolve in chimney collapses and sinkholes. This is a major threat where the mining activity is carried out in an urban context. Thus, there is a clear need for tools and instruments able to precisely quantify mining-induced deformation. Topographic measurements certainly offer very high spatial accuracy and temporal repeatability, but they lack in spatial distribution of measurement points. In the past decades, Multi-Temporal Satellite Interferometry (MTInSAR) has become one of the most reliable techniques for monitoring ground motion, including mining-induced deformation. Although with well-known limitations when high deformation rates and frequently changing land surfaces are involved, MTInSAR has been exploited to evaluate the surface motion in several mining area worldwide. In this paper, a detailed scale MTInSAR approach was designed to characterize ground deformation in the salt solution mining area of Saline di Volterra (Tuscany Region, central Italy). This mining activity has a relevant environmental impact, depleting the water resource and inducing ground motion; sinkholes are a common consequence. The MTInSAR processing approach is based on the direct integration of interferograms derived from Sentinel-1 images and on the phase splitting between low (LF) and high (HF) frequency components. Phase unwrapping is performed for the LF and HF components on a set of points selected through a "triplets closure" method. The final deformation map is derived by combining again the components to avoid error accumulation and by applying a classical atmospheric phase filtering to remove the remaining low frequency signal. The results obtained reveal the presence of several subsidence bowls, sometimes corresponding to sinkholes formed in the recent past. Very high deformation rates, up to -250 mm/yr, and time series with clear trend changes are registered. In addition, the spatial and temporal distribution of velocities and time series is analyzed, with a focus on the correlation with sinkhole occurrence.

TI  - Using machine learning algorithm and landsat time series to identify establishment year of para rubber plantations: a case study in Thalang district, Phuket Island, Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated the potential of using decision tree Machine Learning (ML) algorithm and profiles of vegetation and moisture indices extracted from Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat) time series to identify the ages of rubber plantations in Thalang district, Phuket province, southern Thailand. The secondary Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data and historical imagery from Google Earth(TM)were used to distinguish plantation boundary and the establishment year of rubber plantation (T-0). The inter-annual profiles of spectral indices for each rubber plantation were obtained from 129 Landsat images (summer period from October 1991 to April 2018). The predictors were generated from summary distribution values of spectral indices during summer, including their difference and ratio at two years before to six yearsT(0)for Recursive Partitioning (RP) supervised classification algorithm. Modelling dataset from 'knownT(0)' plantations was divided into the training and testing datasets with a 60:40 ratio. The training model was 30 times repeated training while cross-validation assessment was tested to optimize an appropriated hyperparameter based onF(1)score. Then, the best performance training model was applied to both modelling and predicting ('unknownT(0)' plantations) datasets. The predictedT(0)for each plantation was selected based on results aggregation of 100 times repeated prediction. The results show that the RP model with a complexity parameter as 0.01 and the predictors generated only from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profile acceptable achieves an accuracy of 84.4% and 84.7% for lowland and highland modelling datasets, respectively. The root means squared error (RMSE) of predicted establishment year were 0.83 years at plantation scale.

TI  - A Forecasting Method for Harmful Algal Bloom(HAB)-Prone Regions Allowing Preemptive Countermeasures Based only on Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler Measurements in a Large River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been recognized as a serious problem for aquatic ecosystems and a threat to drinking water systems. The proposed method aimed to develop a practical and rapid countermeasure, enabling preemptive responses to massive algal blooms, through which prior to the algal bloom season we can identify HAB-prone regions based on estimations of where harmful algae initiates and develops significantly. The HAB-prone regions were derived from temperature, depth, flow velocity, and sediment concentration data based only on acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) without relying further on supplementary data collection, such as the water quality. For HAB-prone regions, we employed hot-spot analysis using K-means clustering and the Getis-Ord G*, in conjunction with the spatial autocorrelation of Moran's I and the local index of spatial association (LISA). The validation of the derived HAB-prone regions was conducted for ADCP measurements located at the downstream of Nam and Nakdong River confluence, South Korea, which preceded three months of algal bloom season monitored by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The visual inspection demonstrated that the comparison resulted in an acceptable range of agreement and consistency between the predicted HAB-prone regions and actual UAV-based observations of actual algal blooms.

TI  - Evaluation of SCATSAT-1 data for snow cover area mapping over a part of Western Himalayas
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, the potential of Scatterometer Satellite (SCATSAT-1) data (operated at Ku-band 13.515 GHz) is evaluated to estimate the binary Snow Cover Maps (SCMs) over a part of the Western Himalayas, India. Three classifiers namely, K-Means Clustering (KMC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear Spectral Mixing (LSM) has been implemented on time-series backscattered dataset during the period 2017-18. Moreover, Super-Resolution Mapping (SRM) technique has also been tested over SCATSAT-1 data with the help of LSM, termed LSM-SRM. To validate the outcomes, the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) maps were generated from Landsat-8 and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Experimental results have shown that LSM achieved higher accuracy (75.61-91.36%) as compared to SVM (72.07-85.71%) and KMC (71.79-85.47%). On the other hand, LSM-SRM offers better class category estimation (89.30-96.93%) as compared to LSM (75.61-91.36%) or other classifiers (71.79-85.71%). The present study investigates the sensitivity of Ku-band backscatter for snow conditions and performance analysis of geospatial techniques in the interpretation of backscatter data. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

TI  - Monitoring and mapping of snow cover variability using topographically derived NDSI model over north Indian Himalayas during the period 2008-19
T2  - APPLIED COMPUTING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayas is an essential component of the cryosphere due to the large extent of snow or ice cover. The mapping and monitoring of snow cover variability over the Himalayas is the focus of many scientific studies due to the major source of water for Asian countries and equally important for climate change studies. This study describes the analysis of snow cover variability over North Indian Himalayas (NIH) covering Western Himalayas and Karakoram mountain ranges. The snow cover area (SCA) has been analyzed in three different climate zones such as upper Himalayan zone (UHZ) (Ladakh and Karakoram range), middle Himalayan zone (MHZ) (Great Himalaya and Zanskar) and lower Himalayan zone (LHZ) (Pir Panjal and Shamshbari range) at various elevation levels as well as aspect levels during the past decade (2008-2019). The snow cover maps have been generated for NIH and its climate zones from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Experimental outcomes have represented that mean annual SCA over LHZ, MHZ, and UHZ has been observed as similar to 40,000 Km(2), similar to 60,000 Km(2), and similar to 1,00,000 Km(2) and also, shown a shift of one month of snow accumulation and snowmelt since the past decade. This study delivers the essential information regarding the present status of snow cover area estimation over NIH. The study has many applications in climatology, hydrology, cryosphere, and glaciology.

TI  - Evaluation of UAV and satellite-derived NDVI to map maritime Antarctic vegetation
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of Antarctic vegetation in ice-free areas underlines the need for effective remote sensing techniques to properly monitor the changes. Detection and mapping of vegetation remains limited in the Antarctic environment given the complexity of its surface coverage. Some cryptogamic species exhibit low reflectance in the near infrared region and are not easily detected by vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, spectral reflectance of Antarctic vegetation is highly variable according to seasonal conditions, which may influence NDVI results. As ultra-high resolution aerial imagery allows for a detailed analysis of vegetation and enables the validation of satellite imagery, in this study we assess the ability of the NDVI from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to identify vegetated areas in the ice-free environment of Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. NDVI classification with class ranges set by statistical parameters (i.e., mean and standard deviation) is performed. The results show that different sensors provide different NDVI values for the same vegetation class. NDVI classification enabled the identification of areas showing vegetation cover, which are in accordance with the manually mapped areas in the UAV image. Correspondence in vegetation distribution and classes can be observed across all classifications, demonstrating that aerial and satellite imagery may be used for Antarctic vegetation monitoring. A close association between NDVI classes and Antarctic vegetation type is identified, where lichens are generally classified in lower probability classes, and algae and moss in higher probability classes. This article shows the potential of NDVI applied to Antarctic vegetation and the significance of data statistical parameters in the selection of thresholds, reducing the need for ground-truth information in remote areas.

TI  - On-orbit recognition of resident space objects by using star trackers
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on the opportunity to use star sensors to help space situational awareness and space surveillance. Catalogs of orbiting satellites around Earth are usually established on ground-based measurements that rely on optical or radar data provided by instruments on Earth. However, space-based observations offer new opportunities, as they are unrelated to the weather and the circadian rhythm to which the ground system is subjected. Consequently, space-based optical observation systems can provide data without atmospheric distortion from different observer-to-target distances, enhancing the possibility to detect and catalog resident space objects, i.e. satellites and space debris. This work deals with the feasibility study of an innovative strategy, which consists in the use of a star sensor with a dedicated algorithm to run directly on-board. This approach minimizes the impact on the platform so that, from a theoretical point of view, every satellite with a star sensor can be used as a space surveillance observer. The output of the algorithm consists of a database of pre-processed objects, which are then post-processed on ground. Numerical tests on synthetic images provided by a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The study has been conducted within the framework of the Italian Space Agency project SPOT - Star sensor image Processing for orbiting Objects deTection.

TI  - Quasi-Biweekly Mode of the Asian Summer Monsoon Revealed in Bay of Bengal Surface Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Asian summer monsoon has a planetary-scale, westward propagating "quasi-biweekly" mode of variability with a 10-25 day period. Six years of moored observations at 18 degrees N, 89.5 degrees E in the north Bay of Bengal (BoB) reveal distinct quasi-biweekly variability in sea surface salinity (SSS) during summer and autumn, with peak-to-peak amplitude of 3-8 psu. This large-amplitude SSS variability is not due to variations of surface freshwater flux or river runoff. We show from the moored data, satellite SSS, and reanalyses that surface winds associated with the quasi-biweekly monsoon mode and embedded weather-scale systems, drive SSS and coastal sea level variability in 2015 summer monsoon. When winds are calm, geostrophic currents associated with mesoscale ocean eddies transport Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna river water southward to the mooring, salinity falls, and the ocean mixed layer shallows to 1-10 m. During active (cloudy, windy) spells of quasi-biweekly monsoon mode, directly wind-forced surface currents carry river water away to the east and north, leading to increased salinity at the moorings, and rise of sea level by 0.1-0.5 m along the eastern and northern boundary of the bay. During July-August 2015, a shallow pool of low-salinity river water lies in the northeastern bay. The amplitude of a 20-day oscillation of sea surface temperature (SST) is two times larger within the fresh pool than in the saltier ocean to the west, although surface heat flux is nearly identical in the two regions. This is direct evidence that spatial-temporal variations of BoB salinity influences sub-seasonal SST variations, and possibly SST-mediated monsoon air-sea interaction.Plain Language Summary The north Bay of Bengal (BoB) is characterized by 1-10 m deep layer of river water, very stable density stratification, and deep isothermal layer warmed by penetration of sunlight below the thin mixed layer. Thermodynamic structure of the upper ocean influences intraseasonal active-break cycles of the summer monsoon and promotes intensification of postmonsoon tropical cyclones by inhibiting storm-induced cooling of sea surface temperature. Hence, it is important to understand the space-time variability of surface salinity in this basin. The quasi-biweekly (10-25 day) oscillation is a prominent mode of the Asian summer monsoon, seen in winds, cloudiness, rainfall and surface heat flux. Six years of mooring observations at 18 degrees N in the north BoB show large amplitude (2-8 psu) changes in surface salinity on quasi-biweekly timescales in summer and autumn. Using moored observations, satellite data and reanalyses, we show that changes in surface winds associated with quasibiweekly monsoon mode and its embedded low-pressure systems drive large changes in surface salinity and coastal sea level. We show that the response of SST to subseasonal variations of surface heat flux is enhanced in the presence of a thin layer of river water. These observations have important implications for regional air-sea interaction on subseasonal timescales.

TI  - Microbial Control of the Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) Using <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) by the Means of an Autodissemination Device
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The FraxiProtec, an autodissemination device loaded with the fungus Beauveria bassiana isolate CFL-A, was tested in the field to evaluate its potential to infect emerald ash borer adults and reduce their populations. During the 2-yr experimental period, the dispersion of B. bassiana-infected adults was also documented to assess the dissemination capacity of the biocontrol agent beyond the treated areas. The mean percentage of infected emerald ash borer in 2017 and 2018 in 15 treated sites was 43.3 +/- 2.9% and 39.7 +/- 3.9%, respectively, and no significant variation was observed over the tested years. Furthermore, a 40% significant reduction of the mean emerald ash borer population growth per tree in treated sites was recorded when compared to the control sites. Emerald ash borer infected with B. bassiana isolate CFL-A were collected from baited sticky traps in the sentinel stations in the area surrounding the FraxiProtec-treated sites. Even at a distance of 125 m, an average of 9.4 +/- 2.6% infected emerald ash borer were collected. Finally, exploratory analyzes were carried out on parameters such as the area to be treated, ash tree density, and FraxiProtec density to document potential relationships, which could be used in the determination of a prescription.

TI  - Implementation of a Pediatric Early Warning Score to Improve Communication and Nursing Empowerment in a Rural District Hospital in Rwanda
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pediatric early warning (PEW) scores represent a "track-and-trigger system" that identifies clinical deterioration in a patient's condition in the hours preceding a sentinel event. Before implementation, nurses reported feeling unprepared to identify and advocate for acutely ill patients owing to a lack of skills, vocabulary, and agency. We implemented a Pediatric Early Warning Score for Resource-Limited Settings (PEWS-RL) with nurses in a rural district hospital in Rwanda. Although PEW scores can improve clinical outcomes, empowering nurses in resource-limited settings to discuss patient acuity with physicians is a critical first step. Our primary aims were to train nurses to obtain more accurate vital signs and assess their importance as early warning signs of clinical deterioration and use PEW scores to improve communication between nurses and physicians.Implementation: The PEWS-RL tool implementation began with a training program that was created through discussions with nurses, physicians, and the medical director of the hospital. The program included lectures and application of learned skills through direct clinical mentorship of nurses, as well as training of physicians regarding PEWS-RL as a communication tool.Evaluation: The PEWS-RL protocol was evaluated based on preand post-tests to assess improvement in nurses' knowledge and skill, as well as skills assessments of accurate recognition of clinical deterioration. All 6 nurses passed skill testing with --80% accuracy. Nurses' feelings of empowerment to advocate for patients and to escalate care were assessed through pre- and posttraining interviews. Nurses described increased confidence in calling for physician support.Discussion: Implementation of PEW scores increased nurses' technical skills and feelings of confidence and empowerment; however, the low-resource setting presented major challenges. Barriers to sustainable implementation include the rapid ward staff turnover as well as limited physician buy-in. Nevertheless, the PEWS-RL tool has the potential to empower nurses and improve patient outcomes if fully embraced by staff.

TI  - Ultrasonographic Algorithm for the Assessment of Sentinel Lymph Nodes That Drain the Mammary Carcinomas in Female Dogs
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryMammary neoplasms are one of the most common oncological diseases diagnosed in female dogs. Their staging also involves the evaluation of the sentinel lymph nodes that drain these tumors. Since non-invasive diagnosis is an important requirement in both human and veterinary medicine, by using simple and available ultrasound techniques, our study proposes a non-invasive assessment of the status of sentinel lymph nodes of the tumoral mammary glands. The algorithm consists of B-mode ultrasound, Doppler technique, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and real-time elastography. Diagnostic performance was established for each technique. The highest accuracy in identifying metastases in sentinel lymph nodes was given by the elasticity score followed by the short/long-axis ratio and resistivity index. CEUS had the same accuracy as the Doppler examination. By assigning a score to each parameter of the mentioned techniques and summing up these scores, we obtained a high accuracy of metastasis detection in sentinel lymph nodes (92.2%). This algorithm for examining the status of sentinel lymph nodes that uses simple and widely available techniques in the current practice can be extremely useful to practitioners for staging mammary malignant tumors in female dogs, leading to the right treatment decision.The status of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is decisive in staging, prognosis, and therapeutic approach. Using an ultrasonographic examination algorithm composed of B-mode, Doppler technique, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and elastography, this study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of the four techniques compared to histopathological examination. 96 SLNs belonging to 71 female dogs with mammary gland carcinomas were examined. After examinations, mastectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of metastases in 54 SLNs. The elasticity score had the highest accuracy-89.71%, identifying metastases in SLNs with 88.9.9% sensitivity (SE) and 90.5% specificity (SP), ROC analysis providing excellent results. The S/L (short axis/long axis) ratio showed 83.3% SE and 78.6% SP as a predictor of the presence of metastases in SLN having a good accuracy of 81.2%. On Doppler examination, the resistivity index(RI) showed good accuracy of 80% in characterizing lymph nodes with metastases versus unaffected ones; the same results being obtained by CEUS examination. By assigning to each ultrasonographic parameter a score (0 or 1) and summing up the scores of the four techniques, we obtained the best diagnostic performance in identifying lymph node metastases with 92.2% accuracy. In conclusion, the use of the presented algorithm provides the best identification of metastases in SLNs, helping in mammary carcinoma staging and appropriate therapeutic management.

TI  - Counter-heritage: reclaiming a Khoi and San indigenous cultural landscape in Cape Town
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - South Africa's heritage legislation, specifically the National Heritage Resources Act 25 of 1999, is assumed to be progressive on the basis of the democratic ideals of cultural representation and restitution embedded in it. However, often, South Africa's heritage practice is still rooted in an official heritage discourse that derives from a hegemonic Western worldview. This becomes especially apparent when the subject and object of heritage is intangible. The proposed development of the River Club, Observatory, Cape Town, serves as a case study to explore this challenge to heritage ethics and values. Official heritage, in this example, is represented in the heritage approvals process for the development - a process not open to the Khoi and San claims to the place as an indigenous cultural landscape. The Heritage Impact Assessment for the development of the River Club site argues that the Khoi and San's claims to the place cannot impact on the proposal, as no tangible proof exists of their pre-colonial use of the site. Officially, it states, there is no clear time or material evidence to support the claim. This paper will argue that official heritage practice, with an emphasis on documented time and material evidence, is not sufficient to address the constitutional need for redress and recognition of colonial dispossession. It is also not sufficient in considering and acknowledging attachment to pre-colonial place and time as an imperative of decolonisation. The paper explores how Critical Heritage Studies, as a theoretical lens, and counter-heritage, as an alternative heritage approach, can inform a decolonised ethical framework to expand our understanding of democratic heritage practice in South Africa.

TI  - Decrypting Social Engineering: An Analysis of Conceptual Ambiguity
T2  - CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social engineering is widely considered to be one of the most significant contemporary threats to information security. Despite its ubiquitous use among online criminal subcultures and security practitioners, there exists no single agreed upon conceptualization of "social engineering." Responses from 37 qualitative semi-structured interviews with "social engineers" are analyzed using grounded theory methods to generate a subculturally grounded understanding of the term. The results of this analysis indicate that "social engineering" is nearly indistinguishable from other forms of fraud or influence except in the manner in which participants frame the concept. Drawing from the work of Mikhail Bakhtin (1981), we argue that the concept of "social engineering" is part of a linguistic heteroglossia that reveals the subcultural values and ideologies of its practitioners which are underpinned by a computational or mechanistic worldview.

TI  - Sensitivity of Surface Fluxes in the ECMWF Land Surface Model to the Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index and Root Distribution: Evaluation with Tower Flux Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface-atmosphere turbulent exchanges couple the water, energy and carbon budgets in the Earth system. The biosphere plays an important role in the evaporation process, and vegetation related parameters such as the leaf area index (LAI), vertical root distribution and stomatal resistance are poorly constrained due to sparse observations at the spatio-temporal scales at which land surface models (LSMs) operate. In this study, we use the Carbon Hydrology Tiled European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (CHTESSEL) model and investigate the sensitivity of the simulated turbulent fluxes to these vegetation related parameters. Observed data from 17 FLUXNET towers were used to force and evaluate model simulations with different vegetation parameter configurations. The replacement of the current LAI climatology used by CHTESSEL, by a new high-resolution climatology, representative of the station's location, has a small impact on the simulated fluxes. Instead, a revision of the root profile considering a uniform root distribution reduces the underestimation of evaporation during water stress conditions. Despite the limitations of using only one model and a limited number of stations, our results highlight the relevance of root distribution in controlling soil moisture stress, which is likely to be applicable to other LSMs.

TI  - Air quality development during the COVID-19 pandemic over a medium-sized urban area in Thailand
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an industrial and financial slowdown due to unprecedented regulations imposed with the purpose to contain the spread of the virus. Consequently, the positive effect on the environment has been witnessed. One of the most prominent evidences has been the drastic air quality improvement, as a direct consequence of lower emissions from reduced industrial activity. While several studies have demonstrated the validity of this hypothesis in mega-cities worldwide, it is still an unsubstantiated fact whether the same holds true for cities with a smaller urban extent and population. In the present study we investigate the temporal development of atmospheric constituent concentrations as retrieved concurrently from the Sentinel-5P satellite and a ground meteorological station. We focus on the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic over the city of Hat Yai, Thailand and present the effect of the lockdown on the atmospheric quality over this average populated city (156,000 inhabitants). NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations decreased by 33.7%, 21.8% and 22.9% respectively in the first 3 weeks of the lockdown compared to the respective pre-lockdown period; O-3 also decreased by 12.5% and contrary to similar studies. Monthly averages of NO2, CO and PM2.5 for the month April exhibit in 2020 the lowest values in the last decade. Sentinel-5P retrieved NO2 tropospheric concentrations, both locally over the ground station and the spatial average over the urban extent of the city, are in agreement with the reduction observed from the ground station. Numerous studies have already presented evidence of the bettering of the air quality over large metropolitan areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current study we demonstrate that this holds true for Hat Yai, Thailand; we propound that the environmental benefits documented in major urban agglomerations during the lockdown may extend to medium-sized urban areas as well.

TI  - Statistical analyses of eddies in the Western Mediterranean Sea based on Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We analysed 7188 Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired in a 3-year period, between October 2014 and September 2017, in the Western Mediterranean Sea and found imprints of about 14,300 oceanic eddies with diameters ranging from 0.4 km to 160.1 km. Those eddies manifest on the SAR imagery either through the accumulation of surfactants or through wave-current interaction, and considering the fa-vourable wind-speed ranges for both mechanisms we performed statistical analyses to gain insight into the eddies' spatio-temporal distribution, their typical sizes and shapes, and into the predominant mechanisms that are responsible for their formation. The vast majority of the detected eddies is elliptical, with a tendency for only large mesoscale eddies towards a circular shape. We found no general influence of the wind on the eddies' orientation, although mesoscale eddies tend to orient into the main current direction in each subregion. Submesoscale eddies do not show such tendency. Submesoscale eddies in the Western Mediterranean Sea are predominantly cyclonic (> 90%), and with increasing eddy diameter there is a transition from cyclonic to anticyclonic sense of rotation. In general, we found highest densities of submesoscale eddies in autumn, when the biological activity is still high and when mean regional winds are already strong, but variable. In addition, instabilities of thermal fronts during summer and autumn and instabilities of the main and secondary currents influence the formation of submesoscale eddies. Some of our results confirm those previously obtained for other regions.

TI  - A MAPPING OF CHANGES IN CORAL REEFS CONDITION BASED ON DEVELOPMENT THE MARINE ECOTOURISM IN THE SOUTHERN PART COAST OF PADANG CITY - INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to determine changes in the condition of coral reef ecosystems using satellite imagery. The research method used is the Geographic Information System (GIS) approach using Lyzenga algorithm method with data of Landsat +ETM 7 in 1998, 2008 and Landsat OLI 8 in 2018. The results of this study indicate a decrease in the extent of coral reef conditions in 1998-2008 occurs in live coral cover covering 106.60 ha and the addition of area occurred in dead coral cover covering 147.97 ha. While the decrease of coral reefs condition in 2008-2018 occurs in dead coral cover covering 29.66 ha and the addition of area occurred in live coral cover covering 112.29 ha. Coral mortality index in Nirwana beach with an average 62.28 %, meaning very large coral deaths in this region. Coral mortality index in Cindakir estuary with an average 46.60 %, meaning quite large coral deaths in this region so that coral reefs need to be rehabilitated in these waters, which can be done in form of artificial coral transplants. The coral mortality index in Muara Dua bay average 39 %, meaning that coral mortality is quite large in this region, while the coral mortality index in Ujung Siboko bay average 44.65 %, this means quite a large number of coral deaths in this region, but this location has a very good soft coral and it is necessary to rehabilitate corals in these waters with the form of artificial coral transplants.

TI  - Predictive value of sentinel lymph node imaging and biopsy in early cervical cancers: correlation with scintigraphic uptake patterns and histology
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - AimThis study was designed to 1) assess the feasibility, standardization of sentinel lymph node imaging (SLNI) and biopsy in early cervical cancers and also to determine the detection rates. 2) To analyze the SLN uptake pattern and correlate the findings with the histological grades of tumor.Materials and methods52 early cervical cancer patients underwent same-day Tc-99m sulfur colloid (filtered) SLNI and biopsy with gamma probing. Patients underwent radical hysterectomy, para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy irrespective of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) findings. We analyzed the colloid transit times, uptake pattern, lymphatic groups involved and histology.ResultsA total of 203 hot nodes (100% detection rate) were detected and harvested. Study showed 100% sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value. Internal iliac nodes were predominantly involved. Lymphatic uptake patterns were graded and correlated with tumor histology (Ki index). Transit time was relatively prolonged in patients with aggressive tumors.ConclusionSLNI and biopsy in early cervical malignancies are feasible with high detection rate. Scintigraphic patterns of nodal uptake were relevant and found to correlate with the tumor histological grades. We found that nonfocal nodal uptake patterns were mainly encountered in patients with tumors having higher Ki index. Immunohistochemistry further facilitated identification of lymph nodal metastases. The visual grading system, implemented in this study provides a good indication of the degree of impairment of lymphatic drainage. Higher visual scintigraphic grade denotes greater lymphatic tumor burden.

TI  - Assessment of subsidence phenomena for the Thatta, Jamshoro Districts, Southern Pakistan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this study is the monitoring and analysis of the most recent crustal deformation phenomena in Southern Pakistan. For subsidence evaluation, the longer temporal monitoring is recommended; therefore, the time period chosen for this measurement is between two separate 2005 to 2008 and 2014 to 2018 time series analysis. Remote sensing, synthetic aperture radar interferometry techniques (InSAR) technique is employed for the understanding of localized phenomena of crustal deformation in spatio-temporal coverage. Thatta and Jamshoro districts of the Southern Pakistan region are selected as areas of interest (AOI). These districts are notable for the subsidence phenomena in Pakistan. ENVISAT and central sub swath of Sentinal-1A satellites and InSAR datasets are utilized for quantification of subsidence rate of the area of interest because of the accuracy of their sensors up to millimeters. These satellite missions have widespread spatial coverage, continuous temporal sampling, and free data accessibility due to open data policy of European Space Agency. These two different satellite datasets for different periods of acquisitions provided the comparison of the subsidence rate between temporal periods of these two satellite imageries for area of interest. The long-term data monitoring enables to understand temporal-spatial characteristic to the AOI and understanding of the localized trend. Computation of localized subsidence pattern from ENIVSAT and central sub swath IW2 of Sentinel-1A had been carried out from period Jan 2005 to Dec 2009 with 32 acquisitions and from April 2014 to Nov 2018 with 49 imagery acquisitions, respectively, for ascending orbit. For this Line of Sight (LOS) displacement measurement, InSAR time-series analysis is utilized with the application of the small baseline subset (SBAS) interferogram technique. SBAS time series analysis emerged as strong algorithm with capability to reduce temporal decorrelation for deformation investigation within last couple of years. A total of 53 interferograms from ENVISAT and 141 interferograms from Sentinel-1A are formed. Relative temporal baseline positions are of +/- 300 m for ENVISAT and +/- 150 m for Sentinel-1A with respect to master acquisition. Subsidence of average 4 mm per year is measured along the cross section line from ENVISAT in the area of interest with total subsidence of 24 mm over a period of 6 years. During the Sential-1A acquisition period, the subsidence rate is the same but the area of subsidence is smaller in size as compared with the previous period of monitoring with ENVISAT. Maximum subsidence noted for the period from May 2005 to Aug 2006. It was the same period when over pumping of water was carried out in the area of interest. The larger deformation zone is due to the intense extraction of subsurface freshwater, because the subsidence correlated with the data of tube wells provided by the country water management agency. The data showed the increase in numbers of tube wells installed in the locality over the first phase study time period with extraction of water up to 7000 ha per year (Development Statistics of Sindh 2001-2016) with depletion of groundwater table up to 122 m from the surface.

TI  - On the absurdity of rapid urbanization: Spatio-temporal analysis of land-use changes in Morogoro, Tanzania
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study questions the frequent overemphasis on population growth aspects of African urbanization with little consideration of the spatial extent by analyzing the influence of population growth on the spatial expansion of the Morogoro urban municipality (MUM) in Tanzania between 2000 and 2016. Shannon's Entropy, a random forest supervised classifier, and spatial analysis were adopted to analyze Multi-temporal Landsat images obtained through the Google Earth Engine platform to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution and pattern of land-use change. Findings from this research show that Shannon's entropy values for MUM increased from 0.522 in 2000, to 0.761 in 2007, and to 0.901 in 2016 with the urban land cover recording a considerable and consistent increase. Similarly, the municipality's annual rate of change in population decreased from 4.17% in 1967 to 3.81% in 2016, and is estimated to rise to 4.54% by 2030 with a corresponding population of 25,262 in 1967 and 622,000 in 2016. From the results, the rate of population growth is not commensurate with the rate of spatial expansion, as the spatial extent is more than twice the population growth. An important contribution from this research relates to the limited attention to the faster rate of urban expansion compared to population growth in African cities; a situation that is inconsistent with sustainable and resilient urban futures. It is recommended that municipal authorities should consider initiatives (e.g., environmental planning models) to reverse the current trend of urban growth in order to improve the health, density, sustainability and resilience of the urban environment.

TI  - Improving Accuracy of Impervious Surface Extraction Based on a Threshold Hierarchical Method (THM)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) is an important representation of urban area. It is very popular to extract ISA by using linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA). However, there are still some defects in this method: underestimated in areas with a large amount of ISA. Hence, we designed a threshold hierarchical method (THM) to test this underestimation and understand which scale is the best to mixture. The capacity of the THM and the optimal threshold in the impervious surface extraction are the focus in this work. In THM model, the medium-resolution image (Landsat 8 OLI) and the high-resolution image (Gaofen-2, GF-2) were used, the LSMA and the object-oriented method (OOM) were applied for the area with a larger amount of impervious surfaces, which was extracted from the Landsat 8 OLI image after finishing the LSMA procedure by a threshold of the ISA abundance data, the GF-2 image was employed to extract the ISA by OOM. The results show that the THM had the capacity to achieve higher ISA extraction accuracy and ameliorate the ISA underestimate problem.

AB  - To study the impact of irrigation on soil salinization in the Yellow River Delta, changes in soil salinization before and after irrigation were analyzed using Gaofen-1 wide-field-view remote sensing images and the soil salinization remote sensing monitoring index. The results show the following: (1) The correlation coefficient between the salinity index and the measured soil salinity was above 0.6, which met the requirements for soil salinization monitoring. (2) During irrigation, the area of nonsaline soil was more than 97%, and the saline soil was transformed into nonsaline soil. (3) About 1 week after irrigation, the area of nonsaline soil was reduced by 11%, and the nonsaline soil was transformed into light salinized soil and moderate salinized soil. This study provides an accurate, efficient, and widely applicable method for the study of soil salinization before and after irrigation.

TI  - Perfluoroalkyl acids and sulfonamides and dietary, biological and ecological associations in peregrine falcons from the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin, Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large, diverse group of chemicals and several perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are known environmental contaminants. Wildlife exposure to PFAAs and precursors has been shown, but less is known regarding replacements such as shorter-chain PFAS. In the present study, exposure to a suite of PFAAs and associations with dietary, biological and ecological factors were investigated in populations of a sentinel apex species - the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrines). Nestling blood (n = 57) and sibling eggs (n = 9) were sampled in 2016 and 2018 from nests in rural and urban regions across the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin, Canada. PFSAs (perfluorinated sulfonic acids) including PFHxS, PFOS, and PFDS were detected in most egg and plasma samples, whereas 11 PFCAs (perfluorinated carboxylic acids; C-5-C-14, C-16) compared to eight PFCAs (C-8-C-14, C-16) were detected in most eggs and plasma, respectively. Shorter-chain C-8-C-10 PFCAs were more dominant in plasma and longer-chain C-12-C-14 PFCAs in eggs, but profiles were similar for PFOS, PFDS, PFUdA and PFHxDA. The exposure to PFAAs in peregrine falcons is likely mediated by dietary factors such as foraging location (delta C-13 and (delta S-34) and trophic position (delta N-15) given the associations observed in eggs and nestling plasma, respectively. Moreover, significant relationships were observed for circulating Sigma PFCAs and region (rural/urban), and nestling body condition after adjusting for sampling year and dietary tracers, suggesting that compared to rural nestlings, urban nestlings may be more exposed to Sigma PFCAs and prone to their potential physiological impacts. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating dietary, biological and ecological factors when studying PFAS exposure in birds.

TI  - Cold Water in the Lee of the Batanes Islands in the Luzon Strait
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite remote sensing data and hydrological observation data, this study investigated the cold water in the lee of the Batanes Islands in the Luzon Strait. The formation of cold water in climate is mainly due to the geostrophic heat advection on the east and west sides of the Batanes Islands: the Kuroshio separates into two branches on the east and west sides of the Batanes Islands. These two branches cause two warm tongues by transferring heat from low latitudes to mid-latitudes, and then the two warm tongues lead to the formation of the relatively cold water in the lee of the Batanes Islands. Further study shows that the cold water range has obvious seasonal and inter-annual variations. Except for August, the seasonal variation of the cold water range is caused by the interaction of geostrophic heat advection and net surface heat flux, whereas the low temperature in August in the lee of the Batanes Islands is caused by the island wake effect. The inter-annual of the cold water range is related to the difference in the meridional velocity between the east and west sides of the Batanes Islands, and the correlation coefficient can reach -0.68 at the 95% confidence level.

TI  - Mapping Coastal Wetlands of the Bohai Rim at a Spatial Resolution of 10 m Using Multiple Open-Access Satellite Data and Terrain Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands provide essential ecosystem services and are closely related to human welfare. However, they can experience substantial degradation, especially in regions in which there is intense human activity. To control these increasingly severe problems and to develop corresponding management policies in coastal wetlands, it is critical to accurately map coastal wetlands. Although remote sensing is the most efficient way to monitor coastal wetlands at a regional scale, it traditionally involves a large amount of work, high cost, and low spatial resolution when mapping coastal wetlands at a large scale. In this study, we developed a workflow for rapidly mapping coastal wetlands at a 10 m spatial resolution, based on the recently emergent Google Earth Engine platform, using a machine learning algorithm, open-access Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images from the Sentinel satellites, and two terrain indices. We then generated a coastal wetland map of the Bohai Rim (BRCW10) based on the workflow. It has a producer accuracy of 82.7%, according to validation using 150 wetland samples. The BRCW10 data reflected finer information when compared to wetland maps derived from two sets of global high-spatial-resolution land cover data, due to the fusion of multiple data sources. The study highlights the benefits of simultaneously merging SAR and optical remote sensing images when mapping coastal wetlands.

TI  - Automatic registration of a single SAR image and GIS building footprints in a large-scale urban area
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing techniques of 3-D reconstruction of buildings from SAR images are mostly based on multibaseline SAR interferometry, such as PSI and SAR tomography (TomoSAR). However, these techniques require tens of images for a reliable reconstruction, which limits the application in various scenarios, such as emergency response. Therefore, alternatives that use a single SAR image and the building footprints from GIS data show their great potential in 3-D reconstruction. The combination of GIS data and SAR images requires a precise registration, which is challenging due to the unknown terrain height, and the difficulty in finding and extracting the correspondence. In this paper, we propose a framework to automatically register GIS building footprints to a SAR image by exploiting the features representing the intersection of ground and visible building facades, specifically the near-range boundaries in the building polygons, and the double bounce lines in the SAR image. Based on those features, the two data sets are registered progressively in multiple resolutions, allowing the algorithm to cope with variations in the local terrain. The proposed framework was tested in Berlin using one TerraSAR-X High Resolution SpotLight image and GIS building footprints of the area. Comparing to the ground truth, the proposed algorithm reduced the average distance error from 5.91 m before the registration to -0.08 m, and the standard deviation from 2.77 m to 1.12 m. Such accuracy, better than half of the typical urban floor height (3 m), is significant for precise building height reconstruction on a large scale. The proposed registration framework has great potential in assisting SAR image interpretation in typical urban areas and building model reconstruction from SAR images.

TI  - Association between drought and agricultural productivity using remote sensing data: a case study of Gujarat state of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex hazard which directly affects the water balance of any region. It impacts agricultural, ecological and socioeconomical spheres. It is a global concern. The occurrence of drought is triggered by climatic phenomena which cannot be eliminated. However, its effect can be well managed if actual spatio-temporal information related to crop status influenced by drought is available to decision-makers. This study attempted to assess the efficiency of remote sensing products from space sensors for monitoring the spatio-temporal status of meteorological drought in conjunction with impact on vegetation condition and crop yield. Time series (2000-2019) datasets of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) were used to compute Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) was used to compute Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Association between SPI and VCI was explored. YAI was calculated from the statistical data records. Final observations are that the agricultural crop yield changed as per the climate variability specific to location. The study indicates drought indices derived from remote sensing give a synoptic view because of the course resolution of the satellite images. It does not reveal the precise relationship to the small-scale crop yield. Remote sensing can be an effective way to monitor and understand the dynamics of the drought and agriculture pattern over any region.

TI  - Elaborating Hungarian Segment of the Global Map of Salt-Affected Soils (GSSmap): National Contribution to an International Initiative
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the Global Map of Salt-affected Soils (GSSmap) was launched, which pursued a country-driven approach and aimed to update the global and country-level information on salt-affected soils (SAS). The aim of this paper was to present how Hungary contributed to GSSmap by preparing its own SAS maps using advanced digital soil mapping techniques. We used not just a combination of random forest and multivariate geostatistical techniques for predicting the spatial distribution of SAS indicators (i.e., pH, electrical conductivity and exchangeable sodium percentage) for the topsoil (0-30 cm) and subsoil (30-100 cm), but also a number of indices derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images as environmental covariates. The importance plots of random forests showed that in addition to climatic, geomorphometric parameters and legacy soil information, image indices were the most important covariates. The performance of spatial modelling was checked by 10-fold cross validation showing that the accuracy of the SAS maps was acceptable. By this study and by the resulting maps of it, we not just contributed to GSSmap, but also renewed the SAS mapping methodology in Hungary, where we paid special attention to modelling and quantifying the prediction uncertainty that had not been quantified or even taken into consideration earlier.

TI  - Feasibility and Safety of Cerebral Embolic Protection Device Insertion in Bovine Aortic Arch Anatomy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs) have emerged as a mechanical barrier to prevent debris from reaching the cerebral vasculature, potentially reducing stroke incidence. Bovine aortic arch (BAA) is the most common arch variant and represents challenge anatomy for CEPD insertion during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods: Cohort study reporting the Sentinel(TM) Cerebral Protection System insertion's feasibility and safety in 165 adult patients submitted to a transfemoral TAVR procedure from April 2019 to April 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) BAA; (2) non-BAA. Results: Median age, EuroScore II, and STS score were 79 years (74-84), 2.9% (1.7-6.2), and 2.2% (1.6-3.2), respectively. BAA was present in 12% of cases. Successful two-filter insertion was 86.6% (89% non-BAA vs. 65% BAA; p = 0.002), and debris was captured in 95% (94% non-BAA vs. 95% BAA; p = 0.594). No procedural or vascular complications associated with Sentinel insertion and no intraprocedural strokes were reported. There were two postprocedural non-disabling strokes, both in non-BAA. Conclusion: This study demonstrated Sentinel insertion feasibility and safety in BAA. No procedural and access complications related to Sentinel deployment were reported. Being aware of the bovine arch prevalence and having the techniques to navigate through it allows operators to successfully use CEPDs in this anatomy.

TI  - Investigation of mineralization in copper-porphyry molybdenum using hydrothermal alternation in northwest region of Iran
T2  - NEXO REVISTA CIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and determination of areas with mineral potential is one of the major and important applications of remote sensing in the field of mineral exploration. The aim of the present study was Identification of hydrothermal ultrason region using Landsat multispectral satellite imagery and hyperion hyperspectral imagery. To conduct this research, first the Advanced Space Borne thermal reflection radiometric data and the base metal mapping of the harvest were examined. Using principal component analysis using the key spectral change properties of key minerals, PC 2 enhanced the altered regions. Then we studied the MF spectral library and laboratory spectra of samples in the study area. In this study, two different methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and matched filter processing (MF), were compared and combined for mapping. In both methods, the key properties of changing the range of minerals in the study area were used. The results of the present study showed that from the top of the deposit to the bottom, the type of mineralization is gradually increasing. Chalcopyrite spraying gradually decreases from the depth of the deposit to the outer regions and vice versa, the amount of pyrite spraying increases. In Sungun, the main mineralization of copper in the second (main) stage of the activity of mineralized solutions has taken place, during which chalcopyrite has been extensively left in the form of vessels and sprays in rocks. Molybdenite is formed in a wide range of second stage mineralization processes in several successive phases. In the early processes, this mineral is sprayed and less in the form of veins and in later stages more in the form of veins. Thus, the copper-molybdenum porphyry deposit of Sungun Ahar, with a very high reserve of 7.1 billion tons and an average copper grade of 0.75 % And molybdenite by-mineral in the early 80's will certainly be exploited among the largest copper mines in Iran.

TI  - The 'twinkle' artifact - A novel method of clip identification to facilitate targeted axillary surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: A targeted surgical approach which accurately determines axillary status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may allow appropriate de-escalation of surgical treatment. It is postulated that the combined use of a particular marker clip, ULTRACOR (R) TWIRLTM (Bard, Inc.), and specific ultrasound settings for its identification, may overcome the challenges of pre-operative localisation with size diminution of nodes following NAC. Hence, this feasibility study was performed.Methods: Three patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), who had the Twirl marker clip placed in biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes and completed treatment were included in this preliminary study. Preoperative sonographic identification of the clip and associated node was done on the day of surgery, confirmed by eliciting the 'twinkle' artifact, followed by hookwire localisation and resection. The 'twinkle' artifact was demonstrated within each specimen after resection.Results: All three patients who completed treatment for LABC had successful identification and resection of clipped node aided by the 'twinkle artifact'.Conclusion: The 'twinkle' artifact is a novel and useful aid in identifying the TwirlTM clip marking a lymph node in the post-NAC setting, with the potential to be used intraoperatively.

TI  - Sub-Canopy Topography Estimation from TanDEM-X DEM by Fusing ALOS-2 PARSAR-2 InSAR Coherence and GEDI Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops a framework for extracting sub-canopy topography from the TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) by fusing ALOS-2 PARSAR-2 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) data. The main idea of this method is to estimate the forest height signals caused by the limited penetration of the X-band into the canopy from the TanDEM-X DEM. To achieve this goal, a spaceborne repeat-pass InSAR coherent scattering model is first used to estimate the forest height by the ALOS-2 PARSAR-2 InSAR coherence (APIC), taking the GEDI canopy height as the reference. Then, a linear regression model of the TanDEM-X DEM Vegetation Bias (TDVB) depending on the forest height and the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) is established and used to estimate the sub-canopy topography. The proposed method was validated by the data of the Amazon rainforest and a boreal forest in Canada. The results showed that the proposed method extracted the sub-canopy topography at the study sites in the tropical forest and boreal forest with the root mean square error of 4.0 m and 6.33 m, respectively, and improved the TanDEM-X DEM accuracy by 75.7% and 39.7%, respectively.

TI  - Visualizing Near Infrared Hyperspectral Images with Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The visualization of near infrared hyperspectral images is valuable for quick view and information survey, whereas methods using band selection or dimension reduction fail to produce good colors as reasonable as corresponding multispectral images. In this paper, an end-to-end neural network of hyperspectral visualization is proposed, based on the convolutional neural networks, to transform a hyperspectral image of hundreds of near infrared bands to a three-band image. Supervised learning is used to train the network where multispectral images are targeted to reconstruct naturally looking images. Each pair of the training images shares the same geographic location and similar moments. The generative adversarial framework is used with an adversarial network to improve the training of the generating network. In the experimental procedure, the proposed method is tested for the near infrared bands of EO-1 Hyperion images with LandSat-8 images as the benchmark, which is compared with five state-of-the-art visualization algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better in producing naturally looking details and colors for near infrared hyperspectral images.

TI  - Monitoring active open-pit mine stability in the Rhenish coalfields of Germany using a coherence-based SBAS method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent progress in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, especially the new generation of SAR satellites (Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X), our ability to assess slope stability in open-pit mines has significantly improved. The main objective of this work is to map ground displacement and slope instability over three open -pit mines, namely, Hambach, Garzweiler and Inden, in the Rhenish coalfields of Germany to provide long-term monitoring solutions for open-pit mining operations and their surroundings. Three SAR datasets, including Sentinel-1A data in ascending and descending orbits and TerraSAR-X data in a descending orbit, were processed by a modified small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithm, called coherence-based SBAS, to retrieve ground displacement related to the three open-pit mines and their surroundings. Despite the continuously changing topography over these active open-pit mines, the small perpendicular baselines of both Sentinel-1A and TerraSARX data were not affected by DEM errors and hence could yield accurate estimates of surface displacement. Significant land subsidence was observed over reclaimed areas, with rates exceeding 500 mm/yr, 380 mm/yr, and 310 mm/yr for the Hambach, Garzweiler and Inden mine, respectively. The compaction process of waste materials is the main contributor to land subsidence. Land uplift was found over the areas near the active working parts of the mines, which was probably due to excavation activities. Horizontal displacement retrieved from the combination of ascending and descending data was analysed, revealing an eastward movement with a maximum rate of similar to 120 mm/yr on the western flank and a westward movement with a maximum rate of similar to 60 mm/yr on the eastern flank of the pit. Former open-pit mines Fortuna-Garsdorf and Berghein in the eastern part of Rhenish coalfields, already reclaimed for agriculture, also show subsidence, at locations reaching 150 mm/yr. The interferometric results were compared, whenever possible, with groundwater information to analyse the possible reasons for ground deformation over the mines and their surroundings.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of snowline altitude at the end of melting season across High Mountain Asia, using MODIS snow cover product
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The snowline altitude at the end of melting season (SLA-EMS) provides a possibility to rapidly obtain a proxy for their equilibrium line altitude (ELA) which in turn is an indicator for the glacier mass balance. SLA-EMS is also an important parameter for the study of the relationships between climate and cryosphere. High Mountain Asia (HMA) hosts the largest glacier and perennial snow cover concentration outside the polar regions, but the spatial and temporal patterns of SLA-EMS are poorly understood. Here we investigate the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of SLA-EMS over the HMA on a grid-by-grid (30 km) basis, by using the cloud-removed MODIS fractional snow cover datasets from 2001 to 2016. The possible linkages between the SLA-EMS, temperature, precipitation and solar radiation changes over the HMA are also investigated. The results are as follows: (1) the proposed MODIS-based grids (30 km) SLA-EMS extracting method is efficient in monitoring the spatiotemporal patterns of the SLA-EMS for a large-scale area. (2) In the HMA, the spatial change of the SLA-EMS (from 3114 to 6907 m) exhibits a large spatial heterogeneity. The SLA-EMS decreases from the high altitude region of Himalayas and inner Tibet to surrounding low mountainous area. (3) The SLA-EMS of HMA generally shows a rising trend in the recent years (2001-2016). In total, 82.35% (26.32% with a significant increase) and 17.65% (0.74% with a significant decrease) of the study area show increasing and decreasing trends in SLA-EMS, respectively. The SLA-EMS significantly increases in east Tien Shan (5.16 m yr(-1)), west Tien Shan (4.64 m yr(-1)), Inner Tibet (3.64 m yr(-1)), south and east Tibet (9.18 m yr(-1), east Himalaya (8.52 m yr(-1)) and Hengduan Shan (7.48 m yr(-1)). (4) The summer temperature trends to be the dominant climatic factor affecting the variations of SLA-EMS over the HMA. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE FORAGE COMMUNITIES IN A LIVESTOCK SYSTEM IN THE HYPER-ARID DESERT OF SAN JUAN (ARGENTINA)
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ARGENTINA DE BOTANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims: The natural grasslands of arid zones cover 40% of the earth's surface and are a valuable source of forage for livestock. Inappropriate management and high livestock loads are among the factors responsible for their degradation. In this sense, a fast evaluation is essential to correct its use and promote conservation. The objective of the study was to identify and characterize, through satellite image processing and fieldwork, forage plant communities in a rainfed livestock system of San Juan.M&M: Indicator variables of soil and vegetation were generated from a Landsat 8 OLI image. Subsequently, unsupervised kmeans classification was performed. On field, plant cover, mulch and percentage of bare soil were registered from linear transects. Finally, the livestock receptivity of the plant communities was estimated.Results: 3 types of coverage were identified: coverage higher than 50%; higher than 20% and less than 50% and less than 20%. Also, two forage communities were identified, Lamaral and Zampal. In Lamaral, Prosopis alpataco var. lamaro obtained a coverage of 48%, a receptivity of 2.21 hectare/goat equivalent. In Zampal, a 35% coverage of Atriplex undulata was registered and the receptivity was 1.80 hectare/goat equivalent.Conclusions: The digital processing carried out was adequate for the purpose of the study and allowed recognizing, characterizing and mapping two forage communities. The richness of the species was low, with a predominance of shrubs and woody plants, limiting livestock in the area.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) data of 2006-2014 have been used to analyze the variations in aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm and Angstrom exponent (440/870) (AE). In order to have an in-depth knowledge of aerosol variability, we have analyzed the association of aerosol properties with the meteorological parameters such as temperature, mean sea level pressure, rainfall, dew point, and dust storm frequency. Long-term observations of MODIS-AOD are also validated with AERONET-AOD over Lahore. The peak monthly mean value of AOD is found in July (1.00 +/- 0.34) with the corresponding AE value of 0.85 +/- 0.29 pointing toward the fact that desert/soil dust aerosols dominated the atmosphere of Lahore. The lowest value of AOD is found in February (0.47 +/- 0.26) with the corresponding AE value of 1.22 +/- 0.29 representing the presence of urban/industrial aerosols in the atmosphere over Lahore. The monthly mean AE value is found to be maximum in January (1.36 +/- 0.15), whereas lowest value of AE is found in June (0.55 +/- 0.25). AOD shows positive correlations with temperature, dew point, relative humidity, visibility, rain and dust storm frequency, and negative with mean sea level pressure and wind speed. AE exhibits positive correlations with relative humidity and mean sea level pressure, while with temperature, dew point, visibility, rain and dust storm frequency, it shows negative correlations.

TI  - River Flow Monitoring by Sentinel-3 OLCI and MODIS: Comparison and Combination
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of rivers by satellite is an up-to-date subject in hydrological studies as confirmed by the interest of space agencies to finance specific missions that respond to the quantification of surface water flows. We address the problem by using multi-spectral sensors, in the near-infrared (NIR) band, correlating the reflectance ratio between a dry and a wet pixel extracted from a time series of images, the C/M ratio, with five river flow-related variables: water level, river discharge, flow area, mean flow velocity and surface width. The innovative aspect of this study is the use of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board Sentinel-3 satellites, compared to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) used in previous studies. Our results show that the C/M ratio from OLCI and MODIS is more correlated with the mean flow velocity than with other variables. To improve the number of observations, OLCI and MODIS products are combined into multi-mission time series. The integration provides good quality data at around daily resolution, appropriate for the analysis of the Po River investigated in this study. Finally, the combination of only MODIS products outperforms the other configurations with a frequency slightly lower (similar to 1.8 days).

AB  - Accurate, automated cloud and cloud shadow detection is a key component of the processing needed to prepare optical satellite imagery for scientific analysis. Many existing cloud detection algorithms rely on temperature information to identify clouds, making detection difficult for imagers that lack a thermal band, like Sentinel-2. To get maximum benefit from Sentinel-2 products it is critical to understand which algorithms best identify clouds and their shadows in images. We examined the relative performance of five different cloud-masking algorithms (Sen2Cor, MAJA, LaSRC, Fmask and Tmask) in 6 Sentinel-2 scenes (28 total images) distributed across the Eastern Hemisphere. Expanding on these comparisons, we tested ensemble approaches to improve results. We tested three ensemble approaches to cloud and shadow classification based on the outputs of the five initial algorithms using the cloud masks in: (1) a majority prediction model; (2) a random forests model; and (3) a conditional logic model. Accuracy assessments show a trade-off between omission and commission errors in cloud detection for individual algorithms across all sites, and some algorithms are better at detecting either clouds or cloud shadows. No single algorithm outperforms the others for both clouds and shadows. Aggregating the results from multiple algorithms produces fewer undetected clouds and higher overall accuracy than any single algorithm, with as high as 2.7% improvement over the top-performing algorithm, suggesting an ensemble approach may be the most useful for processing of Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Effects of agricultural pesticides on the reproductive system of aquatic wildlife species, with crocodilians as sentinel species
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Agricultural pesticides represent a significant class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to which non-target organisms around the world are constantly exposed. Laboratory studies have found strong evidence showing the endocrine-disruptive potential of these pesticides at environmentally relevant exposure levels. Since the field of endocrine disruption continues to grow in richness and complexity, this review aims to provide an update on the effects of two agricultural pesticides that act as EDCs: atrazine and endosulfan. We will focus mainly on the effects on crocodilians due to their worldwide occurrence in tropical and sub-tropical wetland ecosystems and their ecological and physiological features, which render them vulnerable to exposure to pesticides with endocrine-disrupting action at all life stages. The results here reviewed provide important insights into the effects of hormonally active agricultural pesticides at cellular, tissue, and organ levels in the reproductive system of crocodiles. A better understanding of the effects of exposure to environmentally relevant doses of EDCs on the reproductive system of crocodilians will contribute to protect and improve the health of both wildlife species and humans.

TI  - Prevalence of drink-driving in Thimphu, Bhutan: Targeted surveillance at sentinel sites
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and Aims Bhutan has a high incidence of alcohol-related disease. With economic development, motorised transport is proliferating, increasing the potential for traffic injury. We investigated drink-driving in the country's largest urban environment.Methods Working with police, we set up checkpoints at major thoroughfares in Thimphu, on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights, from May to July 2017. Police directed cars to testing bays where drivers were breathalysed and interviewed.Results All 1596 drivers stopped by police were breathalysed, and 212 (13%) tested positive. Blood alcohol of >0.02 g/dL (which we defined as 'probable impairment') was detected in 178 drivers (11%), while 67 (4.2%) exceeded the legal limit of 0.08 g/dL. Probable impairment was more common in men, older drivers, on Tuesdays (versus Fridays or Saturdays) and later at night.Conclusion Drink-driving is very common at night-time in Bhutan. Routine roadside random breath-testing, and media campaigns emphasising the risk of apprehension and consequent serious financial and social penalties, should be considered to deter drink-driving.

TI  - Changes in Forest Ecosystem Disturbances in the Forest-Steppe Zone of Russia's Central Chernozem Region in the Late 20th and Early 21st Century
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Results are presented from assessing forest ecosystem disturbances in the forest-steppe zone of Russia's Central Chernozem region in the periods 1985-2000 and 2000-2018. Geoinformation mapping of disturbed forests areas that appeared during the corresponding time periods is done using an automated approach. The share of disturbed forest ecosystems in the forest-steppe zone of the Central Chernozem region grows from 2.5% at the end of the 20th century to 6% at the beginning of the 21st. The share of disturbed forest ecosystems in coniferous forests grows by 9 times. In deciduous forests, the proportion of disturbed plots is slightly increased. The increased share of disturbed forests is due mainly to a rise in the disturbances of coniferous forest ecosystems. In contrast, the share of deciduous forests in the structure of disturbed forests is almost halved. A map of categories of forest ecosystems disturbances is prepared that characterizes forests according to the time elapsed since the last exposure to disturbing factors.

TI  - Land use land cover change detection through geospatial analysis in an Indian Biosphere Reserve
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study examines the land use land cover (LULC) and change detection impacts on forest ecosystem in Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR - area 626.76 km(2)) of Central India. Results revealed that there has been a change in AABR land use pattern from 2008 to 2018. The major changes include loss of 19.72 km(2) of vegetation cover in various forest types due to increasing biotic interference and over grazing, conversion of 14.77 km(2) of Dense Sal mixed forest to open mixed forest and cultivable land, and 5.0 km(2) teak plantation and Bamboo brakes to agricultural land. Despite losing many plant species due to anthropogenic pressure, the present study found that the AABR as a unique repository of plant species rich in biodiversity. Many spots of this area are invaded or replaced by exotic species which is causing the loss of ecology and diversity of this region. Based on our study Sal mixed forest reduced by 2.88% (5.23 km(2)), Dense mixed forest 4.02% (9.54 km(2)), Teak plantation 6.77% (2.61 km(2)) and Bamboo brakes reduced by 7.66% (2.34 km(2)). The study concludes that the Landsat 7 TM and Resourcesat 2A satellite images are the most suitable for studying the LULC change on forest ecosystem of AABR. We advocate that by adopting the rigorous conservation measures, especially in open & dense forest and young under-stocked teak forests can restore the vegetation density and diversity in the area. Moreover, Sal natural regeneration of vegetation would remain crucial, and invasion of exotic species over native species needs to be restored in the forest area. Such findings on major changes occurring in forest ecosystem hold tremendous implications in relation to the welfare of the resource-poor tribal communities who are greatly dependent on the natural resources available in AABR for their livelihood.

TI  - HCV and HIV co-infection among people who inject drugs in Vietnam.
T2  - Journal of health and social sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: HIV/HCV co-infection in people who inject drugs (PWID) continues to be a major challenge for health care systems and the PWID themselves. PWID have driven the HIV epidemic in Vietnam but information on HIV/HCV co-infection is limited.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 509 PWID recruited in Hanoi from February 2016 to April 2017. Four mutually exclusive groups were defined based on the presence of detectable HCV RNA and positive HIV confirmation. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to explore life-time risk behaviors of HCV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection.RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HIV and HCV infection was 51.08% and 61.69%, respectively. The prevalence of HCV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection was 22.59% and 39.1%, respectively. We found that engaging in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) was positively associated with HCV mono-infection (aOR = 2.38, 95% Confidential Interval [CI] 1.07 to 5.28) and with at least either HIV or HCV infection (aOR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.56). Ever being incarcerated was significantly associated with HCV mono-infection (aOR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.90) and HIV/HCV co-infection (aOR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.46). Those who had ever shared with and reused syringes/needles were more likely to have HIV/HCV co-infection (aORs = 5.17 and 2.86, P < 0001, respectively) and have either HIV or HCV infection (aORs = 3.42 and 2.37, P < 0001, respectively).CONCLUSION: Correlates for HCV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection highlight the need to address risk behaviors, expand MMT programs, and establish HCV sentinel surveillance. The high prevalence of HCV and/or HIV co-infection shows a need for access to HCV treatment.
AB  - INTRODUZIONE: La coinfezione da HIV/HCV nei tossicodipendenti continua ad essere una sfida importante per i servizi sanitari e gli stessi tossicodipendenti. Questi ultimi hanno diffuso linfezione da HIV nel Vietnam, ma linformazione sulla co-infezione da HIV/HCV e limitata.METODI: Uno studio trasversale e stato condotto con 509 tossicodipendenti reclutati ad Hanoi dal febbraio 2016 ad aprile 2017. Quattro gruppi mutualmente esclusivi sono stati definiti sulla base della presenza di riscontro di HCV RNA e di conferma di sieropositivita per HIV. E stata effettuata lanalisi di regressione logistica per esplorare i comportamenti a rischi nel corso della vita per monoinfezione da HCV e coinfezione da HIV-HCV.RISULTATI: La prevalenza complessiva dellinfezione da HIV ed HCV e stata del 51.08% e del 61.69%, rispettivamente, mentre quella della monoinfezione da HCV e della coinfezione da HIV/HCV del 22.59% e del 39.1%. Abbiamo scoperto che essere sottoposti a trattamento di mantenimento con metadone (MMT) e risultato positivamente associato con la monoinfezione da HCV (aOR = 2.38, 95% IC 1.07-5.28) e con almeno o linfezione da HIV o con quella da HCV (aOR = 2.22, 95% IC 1.08-4.56). Una storia di prigionia e stata associata in modo significativo allinfezione da HCV (aOR = 2.56, 95% IC 1.33-4.90) ed alla co-infezione da HIV/HCV (aOR = 1.90, 95% IC 1.04-3.46). Quelli che avevano sempre condiviso o riutilizzato aghi/siringhe avevano una maggiore probabilita di avere una coinfezione da HIV/HCV (aORs = 5.17 e 2.86, P < 0001, rispettivamente) ed una infezione da HIV o HCV (aORs = 3.42 e 2.37, P < 0001, rispettivamente).CONCLUSIONE: I correlati di monoinfezione da HCV e di co-infezione da HIV/HCV evidenziano la necessita di affrontare i comportamenti a rischio, espandere i programmi terapeutici di mantenimento con il metadone ed instaurare una sorveglianza sentinella per lHCV. Lalta prevalenza di HCV e/o di co-infezione da HIV mostra la necessita di accedere al trattamento per lHCV.

TI  - Bi-Temporal Analysis of Spatial Changes of Boreal Forest Cover and Species in Siberia for the Years 1985 and 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal forest is a sensitive indicator of the influence of climate change. It can quantify the level and spatial divergence of forest change for forest resources and carbon cycle research. This study selected a typical boreal forest affected by few human activities as a research area, in Siberia, with a latitude span of 51 degrees N-69 degrees N. A total of 150 Landsat images of this area acquired in 1985 and 2015 were collected. A hierarchical classification approach was first established to retrieve the information of forest cover and species. The forested and nonforested lands were discriminated by the decision tree method and, furthermore, the forested land was classified to broad-leaved and coniferous forests by a random forest algorithm. The overall accuracy was 90.37%, which indicates the validity of the approach. Finally, the quantitative information of the forest cover and species changes in each latitude zone of every 2 degrees was analyzed. The results show that the overall boreal forest cover increased by 5.11% over the past three decades, with broad-leaved forest increasing by 3.54% and coniferous forest increasing by 1.57%. In addition, boreal forest increased in every latitude zone, and the spatial divergence of the changes of the boreal forest cover and species in different latitude zones were significant. Finally, broad-leaved forest increased more rapidly than coniferous forest, and the greatest increase, of up to 5.77%, occurred in the zone of 55 degrees N-57 degrees N.

TI  - Reliability of Extreme Significant Wave Height Estimation from Satellite Altimetry and In Situ Measurements in the Coastal Zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of significant wave height from satellite altimeter missions are finding increasing application in investigations of wave climate, sea state variability and trends, in particular as the means to mitigate the general sparsity of in situ measurements. However, many questions remain over the suitability of altimeter data for the representation of extreme sea states and applications in the coastal zone. In this paper, the limitations of altimeter data to estimate coastal Hs extremes (<10 km from shore) are investigated using the European Space Agency Sea State Climate Change Initiative L2P altimeter data v1.1 product recently released. This Sea State CCI product provides near complete global coverage and a continuous record of 28 years. It is used here together with in situ data from moored wave buoys at six sites around the coast of the United States. The limitations of estimating extreme values based on satellite data are quantified and linked to several factors including the impact of data corruption nearshore, the influence of coastline morphology and local wave climate dynamics, and the spatio-temporal sampling achieved by altimeters. The factors combine to lead to considerable underestimation of estimated Hs 10-yr return levels. Sensitivity to these factors is evaluated at specific sites, leading to recommendations about the use of satellite data to estimate extremes and their temporal evolution in coastal environments.

TI  - STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES IN MODERN CONDITIONS: A CASE STUDY
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the subject matter is conditioned by the fact that human resources are an invaluable asset of any organisation, institution, or industrial enterprise. The purpose of the paper is to develop recommendations for managing human resources. The leading methods of researching the problems of the paper include the analysis of theoretical sources, the analysis of statistical indicators, and comparison. Analysis of statistical indicators plays a crucial role in the study, since data on human resource management can be directly obtained from statistical databases. The paper investigates the concept of human resources, the essence of human resource management, the functions of the HR service, analyses the management of human resources at Russian enterprises (in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug), identifies management problems, and develops solutions to them. An effective system of performance appraisal, remuneration, and wage structure will increase the effectiveness of the approach to managing human resources, and will lead to fundamental changes in the worldview of the company's management in relation to its human resources. The materials of the paper are of practical value for improving the management of human resources at Russian enterprises.

TI  - <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i> infection in horses in Poland
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A cross-sectional survey was performed to obtain first information on the prevalence of Echinococcus multilocularis infection in slaughter horses from central, eastern and southern Poland, a country with a highly endemic occurrence of this tapeworm in red foxes. White tough nodular lesions being 3-10 mm in size, sharply demarcated and spherically or irregularly shaped were found in 54 of 365 livers examined. Histologically, focal granulomatous necrotizing inflammations and sometimes PAS-positive acellular lamellar structures being characteristic of the E. multilocularis metacestode stage were visible; protoscoleces were not found. E. multilocularis DNA was detected in six of 19 hepatic lesions examined by nested PCR. Our results from molecular and morphological diagnostics suggest an overall prevalence of alveolar echinococcosis between 4.7% and 14.8% in the horse population studied. Horses as dead-end hosts do not play any role in the life cycle of E. multilocularis but may serve as additional sentinel animals in monitoring the environmental contamination with tapeworm eggs.

TI  - Spectral Unmixing for Mapping a Hydrothermal Field in a Volcanic Environment Applied on ASTER, Landsat-8/OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI Satellite Multispectral Data: The Nisyros (Greece) Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to propose a methodology that provides a detailed description of the argillic zone of a hydrothermal field, based on satellite multispectral data. More specifically, we developed a method based on spectral unmixing where hydroxyl-bearing alteration is represented by a single endmember (representing clays) and the three (nearly) non-altered primary volcanic lithologies, namely, two types of lava flows (basic and acidic compositions) and the loose materials (alluvial/beach deposits, scree, pyroclastic deposits, etc.), are represented by three endmembers. We also used one endmember representing elemental sulfur that is present in fumarolic vents hosted by active hydrothermal craters. The methodology was applied in the south part of Lakki plain inside the Nisyros volcano caldera (Greece), using Sentinel-2, Landsat-8/OLI, and ASTER satellite multispectral datasets. Specifically, it was applied separately to each one of the three datasets. The spectral unmixing results, combined with the relative geological map, provide quantitative estimations of the primary volcanic and loose material areas affected by alteration. In addition, pixels with high abundance values of hydroxyl-bearing alteration corresponded to mapped areas with strong hydrothermal alteration. The developed methodology is superior to conventional approaches (e.g., alteration spectral index) in terms of its ability to describe the overall pattern of the hydrothermal field. The most accurate results were taken when applied to ASTER or Sentinel-2 MSI data.

TI  - How Do Natura 2000 Areas Intersect with Peoples' Livelihood Strategies in High Nature Value Farmlands in Southern Transylvania?
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The establishment of the Natura 2000 network in Romania constitutes a turning point for the policy on biodiversity conservation in this country. The presence of human communities in certain Natura 2000 areas determines complex interactions between social and ecological systems, particularly in the case of High Nature Value farmlands that are assigned to this network of protected natural areas. A large part of Romania's biodiversity depends on traditional farming systems that are under pressure from either agricultural intensification or land abandonment, which reflects socio-economic changes that have pushed rural households into developing new livelihood strategies. This paper explores the particular context of traditional rural communities from Southern Transylvania which is a High Nature Value farmland area largely included in the Natura 2000 network. We conducted an empirical analysis that focused on two main issues. The first was applying quantitative methods aimed at identifying the linkages between livelihood capitals and livelihood strategies of people living in Natura 2000 areas. The second was analyzing differences in local development levels which correlate with the share of territorial administrative units belonging to Natura 2000 areas. Our results are based on questionnaire and interview data collected from 40 rural administrative-territorial units within Southern Transylvania as well as on mapping land use changes using Landsat satellite images of 1985, 2003 and 2015. The results indicate that rural communities living in Natura 2000 areas turn to migration as an additional household strategy besides usual on-farm and off-farm activities, leading to rural shrinkage and farmland abandonment.

TI  - Identification of egg parasitoids of rice leafhoppers and planthoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae and Delphacidae) of economic importance in Taiwan, part 2: Trichogrammatidae (Hymenoptera)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trichogrammatid egg parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) of rice leafhoppers and planthoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae and Delphacidae) known from Taiwan are identified taxonomically and illustrated, and their host associations are determined by rearings using sentinel eggs of the key pest species. The previously published records of such egg parasitoids in Taiwan are critically analyzed in the unfortunate absence of almost any voucher specimens. Pseudoligosita nephotetticum (Mani) is shown to be the most common egg parasitoid of the two leafhopper and three planthopper pests of rice in Taiwan: the zig-zag leafhopper Maiestas dorsalis (Motschulsky) (a new host record), the green rice leafhopper Nephotettbc cincticeps (Uhler), and the delphacids Laodelphax striatella (Fallen) (small brown planthopper), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) (brown planthopper), and Sogatella furcifera (Horvath) (whitebacked planthopper). Paracentrobia (Brachistella) andoi (Ishii) syn. nov., originally described from Japan as Japania andoi Ishii, and Paracentrobia (Brachistella) garuda Subba Rao syn. nov. from Thailand are synonymized under Paracentrobia (Brachistella) bicolor (Girault) from northern Queensland, Australia; Pseudoligosita tachikawai (Yashiro) syn. nov., originally described as Oligosita tachikawai Yashiro from Japan, is synonymized under Pseudoligosita nephotetticum. Lectotypes are designated for Japania andoi and Oligosita shibuyae Ishii.

TI  - Mapping the Distribution of Coffee Plantations from Multi-Resolution, Multi-Temporal, and Multi-Sensor Data Using a Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is the world's fourth largest coffee producer. Coffee plantations cover 1.2 million ha of the country with a production of 500 kg/ha. However, information regarding the distribution of coffee plantations in Indonesia is limited. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of classification model and determine its important variables for mapping coffee plantations. The model obtained 29 variables which derived from the integration of multi-resolution, multi-temporal, and multi-sensor remote sensing data, namely, pan-sharpened GeoEye-1, multi-temporal Sentinel 2, and DEMNAS. Applying a random forest algorithm (tree = 1000, mtry = all variables, minimum node size: 6), this model achieved overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer accuracy, and user accuracy of 79.333%, 0.774, 92.000%, and 90.790%, respectively. In addition, 12 most important variables achieved overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer accuracy, and user accuracy 79.333%, 0.774, 91.333%, and 84.570%, respectively. Our results indicate that random forest algorithm is efficient in mapping coffee plantations in an agroforestry system.

TI  - Monitoring Large-Scale Inland Water Dynamics by Fusing Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-3 Altimetry Data and by Analyzing Causal Effects of Snowmelt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The warming climate is threatening to alter inland water resources on a global scale. Within all waterbody types, lake and river systems are vital not only for natural ecosystems but, also, for human society. Snowmelt phenology is also altered by global warming, and snowmelt is the primary water supply source for many river and lake systems around the globe. Hence, (1) monitoring snowmelt conditions, (2) tracking the dynamics of snowmelt-influenced river and lake systems, and (3) quantifying the causal effect of snowmelt conditions on these waterbodies are critical to understand the cryo-hydrosphere interactions under climate change. Previous studies utilized in-situ or multispectral sensors to track either the surface areas or water levels of waterbodies, which are constrained to small-scale regions and limited by cloud cover, respectively. On the contrary, in the present study, we employed the latest Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-3 altimetry data to grant a high-resolution, cloud-free, and illumination-independent comprehensive inland water dynamics monitoring strategy. Moreover, in contrast to previous studies utilizing in-house algorithms, we employed freely available cloud-based services to ensure a broad applicability with high efficiency. Based on altimetry and SAR data, the water level and the water-covered extent (WCE) (surface area of lakes and the flooded area of rivers) can be successfully measured. Furthermore, by fusing the water level and surface area information, for Lake Urmia, we can estimate the hypsometry and derive the water volume change. Additionally, for the Brahmaputra River, the variations of both the water level and the flooded area can be tracked. Last, but not least, together with the wet snow cover extent (WSCE) mapped with SAR imagery, we can analyze the influence of snowmelt conditions on water resource variations. The distributed lag model (DLM) initially developed in the econometrics discipline was employed, and the lagged causal effect of snowmelt conditions on inland water resources was eventually assessed.

TI  - Application of High-Resolution Radar Rain Data to the Predictive Analysis of Landslide Susceptibility under Climate Change in the Laonong Watershed, Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme rainfall has caused severe road damage and landslide disasters in mountainous areas. Rainfall forecasting derived from remote sensing data has been widely adopted for disaster prevention and early warning as a trend in recent years. By integrating high-resolution radar rain data, for example, the QPESUMS (quantitative precipitation estimation and segregation using multiple sensors) system provides a great opportunity to establish the extreme climate-based landslide susceptibility model, which would be helpful in the prevention of hillslope disasters under climate change. QPESUMS was adopted to obtain spatio-temporal rainfall patterns, and further, multi-temporal landslide inventories (2003-2018) would integrate with other explanatory factors and therefore, we can establish the logistic regression method for prediction of landslide susceptibility sites in the Laonong River watershed, which was devastated by Typhoon Morakot in 2009. Simulations of landslide susceptibility under the critical rainfall (300, 600, and 900 mm) were designed to verify the model's sensitivity. Due to the orographic effect, rainfall was concentrated at the low mountainous and middle elevation areas in the southern Laonong River watershed. Landslide change analysis indicates that the landslide ratio increased from 1.5% to 7.0% after Typhoon Morakot in 2009. Subsequently, the landslide ratio fluctuated between 3.5% and 4.5% after 2012, which indicates that the recovery of landslide areas is still in progress. The validation results showed that the calibrated model of 2005 is preferred in the general period, with an accuracy of 78%. For extreme rainfall typhoons, the calibrated model of 2009 would perform better (72%). This study presented that the integration of multi-temporal landslide inventories in a logistic regression model is capable of predicting rainfall-triggered landslide risk under climate change.

TI  - Soil erosion: An important indicator for the assessment of land degradation neutrality in Russia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Global Symposium on Soil Erosion (GSER)
CL  - Food & Agr Org United Nat, Rome, ITALY
AB  - This review of soil erosion (SE) studies in Russia focuses on two main tasks: (i) ensuring the completeness and reliability of SE data in Russia, a large country (17.1 million km(2)) with a variety of natural and socio-economic causes of land degradation, (ii) assessing the possibility of including a SE indicator among the indicators of land degradation neutrality (LDN). A wide range of statistical, remote sensing, mathematical modeling data, the results of scientific and field studies obtained at different levels were analyzed. It is asserted that in Russia the total area of eroded lands and those under erosion risk occupy more than 50% of all agricultural lands, whereas soil fertility of croplands decreased in Soviet time (from 1950s to 1980s) by 30-60% only due to water erosion. However, recent scientific studies indicate a decrease in erosion rate and in the area of eroded land during the last 30-40 years as a result of abandonment of arable land and subsequent overgrown with natural vegetation. The climate change resulting in decrease of the depth of soil freezing, flow of spring runoff also adds to the decrease of soil erosion. The SE indicator was suggested as an important complement to three global LDN indicators. At national and subnational level, it can be interpreted through such indices as "Rate of soil loss" (ton ha-1 yr-1) and "Total soil loss" (1000 tons, in certain area during selected time period). At local level the set of indices can be wider and site-specific, including those obtained through remote sensing data by using the classifier of thematic applications of remote sensing technologies; the example was tested at the local site.

TI  - Trends and drivers of land cover changes in a tropical urban forest in Ghana
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study employed a mixed-methods approach to investigate the trends and drivers of land use and land cover changes from 1991 to 2015 in an urban forest reserve in Ghana. The specific objectives were to: i) determine the extent of land cover changes in the urban forest, and ii) ascertain the factors driving land cover changes in the urban forest. The study employed Landsat satellite images using ENVI to detect trends of land cover changes from 1991 to 2015. A questionnaire survey was used to solicit information on the socio-economic drivers of land cover changes from households in four fringe communities of the urban forest. The results showed that built up and bare areas recorded an increase between 1991 and 2015, with a decline in forests as well as shrubs and grasslands. The study showed that, forest decreased from 387.83 ha in 1991 to 341.28 ha in 2015, indicating a class change of 12.0%. Shrubs and grassland also decreased from 24.56 ha in 1991 to 11.77 ha in 2015, representing a class change of 52.1%. Built-up and bare areas changed from 36.278 ha in 1991 to 95.618 ha in 2015, representing class change of 163.57%. Overall, the study established that 59.34 ha of the Achimota Forest Reserve has been lost or converted to built-up and bare areas between 1991 and 2015. Study respondents identified urbanisation as the most important cause of land cover change. Other factors driving land cover changes reported included fuel wood harvesting and logging, agriculture, lack of forest guards, a lack of enforcement of laws on forest and annual fires. Based on these findings, the study concluded that human activities were driving considerable land cover changes in the urban forest. These changes could have significant implications for the long-term sustainability of the urban forest. Therefore, the study recommended that government takes steps to protect the urban forest from further land cover changes, as built up and bare areas have increased by more than double its size since 1991.

TI  - Long-term temporal analysis of the columnar and surface aerosol relationship with planetary boundary layer height at a southern coastal site of Turkey
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mersin is industrialized city with 1.8 million people, a dense port, and different industries. The region is under the influence of mineral dust transport originated from the arid and semi-arid regions, mainly in spring and autumn. Planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is one of major parameters influencing surface air quality. In this study, the relationship between particulate matters having diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) and PBLH was investigated in an urban coastal site of Turkey. Relationships between PBLH and the ratios of PM10 to Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from MODIS and AERONET were also analyzed to account for transported aerosol that is not concentrated in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). PBL is known as the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) that is the lowest part of the atmosphere and its behavior is directly influenced by its contact with a planetary surface. The PM10, AOD and PBLH showed a seasonal variability with increasing multiyear seasonal mean values of AOD and PBLH from winter to summer while decreasing trend was found for PM10 over the analyzed site. Paired dataset for MODIS overpass and AERONET observational times shared the same seasonal patterns; however, the magnitude of the seasonal variations differed. The relationship of PBLH-PM10 was weak over the site. Positive correlations observed in spring and summer could be characterized by lower PM10 concentrations and transported aerosols over the region. Compared to PBLH-PM10 correlations, the PM10/AOD ratio increased correlations significantly from -0.18 to -0.43 for MODIS overpass time and -0.18 to -0.30 for AERONET observational time. Improvements were also showed seasonal differences.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS C6 and C6.1 Dark Target AOD products over Turkey based on NDVI and aerosol type
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the MODIS C6 and C6.1 Aerosol Optical Depths (AOD) from Terra and Aqua satellites over the two sites located in the urban and coastal regions of Turkey. This is the first study in Turkey focusing on comparison of MODIS Dark Target (DT) C6 and C6.1 AOD against AERONET AOD to provide a better understanding of applicability and suitability of MODIS products under different surfaces and aerosol loadings. Analysis was performed with direct comparisons between MODIS DT AOD retrievals with 3 km and 10 km resolutions and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 Level 2 ground-based observations at site scale. Meanwhile, the spatial and temporal variations were also compared and discussed. Accuracy of the spatially and temporally collocated AOD retrievals was analyzed with the correlation coefficient (R), normalized mean bias (NMB), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the expected error (EE) (0.05% + 20%) and (0.05% + 15%) of the DT 3 km and 10 km algorithm over land, respectively. The C6.1 showed better accuracy than the C6 with the higher number of the retrievals falling within the expected error (EE). The C6.1 DT exhibited more significant improvements over the urban site than the coastal site, but both the DT 3 km and 10 km products did not show satisfactory performance with the lower percentages of the retrievals falling within EE (ranging from 36.7% to 50.6%), that was less than one standard deviation confidence interval over the urban site. Moreover, C6.1 DT had a little effect on improvements over the coastal site. Higher percentages of the retrievals falling within EE (ranging from 80.2% to 90.7%) were found at the coastal site. The effects of the surface reflectance based on NDVI and SSA parameter for understanding the aerosol type effect on aerosol retrievals were also discussed. Underestimation of the AOD over the coastal site indicated an inaccurate assumption in the aerosol model. Highly absorbing aerosols also caused overestimation over the urban site. This study suggests that further improvements are required to provide better estimates of satellite-based AOD over urban areas of Turkey.

TI  - Detection of magnetite in the Roossenekal area of the Eastern Bushveld Complex, South Africa, using multispectral remote sensing data
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral sensors, along with common and advanced algorithms, have become efficient tools for routine lithological discrimination and mineral potential mapping. It is with this paradigm in mind that this paper sought to evaluate and discuss the detection and mapping of magnetite on the Eastern Limb of the Bushveld Complex, using high spectral resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery and GIS techniques. Despite the wide distribution of magnetite, its economic importance, and its potential as an indicator of many important geological processes, not many studies had looked at the detection and exploration of magnetite using remote sensing in this region. The Maximum Likelihood and Support Vector Machine classification algorithms were assessed for their respective ability to detect and map magnetite using the PlanetScope Analytic data. A K-fold cross-validation analysis was used to measure the performance of the training as well as the test data. For each classification algorithm, a thematic landcover map was created and an error matrix, depicting the user's and producer's accuracies as well as kappa statistics, was derived. A pairwise comparison test of the image classification algorithms was conducted to determine whether the two classification algorithms were significantly different from each other. The Maximum Likelihood Classifier significantly outperformed the Support Vector Machine algorithm, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 84.58% and an overall kappa value of 0.79. Magnetite was accurately discriminated from the other thematic landcover classes with a user's accuracy of 76.41% and a producer's accuracy of 88.66%. The overall results of this study illustrated that remote sensing techniques are effective instruments for geological mapping and mineral investigation, especially iron oxide mineralization in the Eastern Limb of the Bushveld Complex.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be unnecessary for ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> of the breast that is small and diagnosed by preoperative biopsy
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Current guidelines do not recommend that sentinel lymph node biopsy is routinely performed for ductal carcinoma in situ; thus, indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ remain controversial. In this study, we investigated whether sentinel lymph node biopsy can be safely omitted when ductal carcinoma in situ has been diagnosed by preoperative biopsy.Methods: We retrospectively analysed sentinel lymph node metastasis rates and upstaging to invasive cancer in surgical specimens, performed receiver operating characteristic analysis for ductal carcinoma in situ lesion size and assessed correlations with preoperative clinicopathological factors of 277 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed by preoperative biopsy at our institution.Results: Among 277 patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy, six (2.2%) had sentinel lymph node metastasis. All six were upstaged to invasive cancer by pathological examination of surgical specimens. In total, 69 patients (24.9%) were upstaged to invasive cancer. The mean size of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions on preoperative imaging was significantly larger for the 69 upstaged patients (50.0 mm) than for the non-upstaged patients (34.4 mm; P < 0.0001). Of the 277 patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy, 117 (42.2%) had preoperative ductal carcinoma in situ lesions <31.8 mm, which was identified as the optimal cut-off size by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Of these 117 patients, 96 (82.1%, 95% confidence interval: 73.9-88.5%) could be safely omitted from sentinel lymph node biopsy because all of them remained as ductal carcinoma in situ and had negative sentinel lymph nodes at surgery.Conclusions: Size of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions on preoperative diagnostic imaging is a predictor of diagnosis of invasive cancer on pathological examination of surgical specimens. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be unnecessary in ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed by preoperative biopsy in patients with small lesions.

TI  - Over 150 Years of Change: Object-Oriented Analysis of Historical Land Cover in the Main River Catchment, Bavaria/Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of land cover and land use change is critical for assessing the provision of ecosystem services. One of the sources for long-term land cover change quantification is through the classification of historical and/or current maps. Little research has been done on historical maps using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA). This study applied an object-based classification using eCognition tool for analyzing the land cover based on historical maps in the Main river catchment, Upper Franconia, Germany. This allowed land use change analysis between the 1850s and 2015, a time span which covers the phase of industrialization of landscapes in central Europe. The results show a strong increase in urban area by 2600%, a severe loss of cropland (-24%), a moderate reduction in meadows (-4%), and a small gain in forests (+4%). The method proved useful for the application on historical maps due to the ability of the software to create semantic objects. The confusion matrix shows an overall accuracy of 82% for the automatic classification compared to manual reclassification considering all 17 sample tiles. The minimum overall accuracy was 65% for historical maps of poor quality and the maximum was 91% for very high-quality ones. Although accuracy is between high and moderate, coarse land cover patterns in the past and trends in land cover change can be analyzed. We conclude that such long-term analysis of land cover is a prerequisite for quantifying long-term changes in ecosystem services.

TI  - The role of computational methods for automating and improving clinical target volume definition
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Treatment planning in radiotherapy distinguishes three target volume concepts: the gross tumor volume (GTV), the clinical target volume (CTV), and the planning target volume (PTV). Over time, GTV definition and PTV margins have improved through the development of novel imaging techniques and better image guidance, respectively. CTV definition is sometimes considered the weakest element in the planning process. CTV definition is particularly complex since the extension of microscopic disease cannot be seen using currently available in-vivo imaging techniques. Instead, CTV definition has to incorporate knowledge of the patterns of tumor progression. While CTV delineation has largely been considered the domain of radiation oncologists, this paper, arising from a 2019 ESTRO Physics research workshop, discusses the contributions that medical physics and computer science can make by developing computational methods to support CTV definition. First, we overview the role of image segmentation algorithms, which may in part automate CTV delineation through segmentation of lymph node stations or normal tissues representing anatomical boundaries of microscopic tumor progression. The recent success of deep convolutional neural networks has also enabled learning entire CTV delineations from examples. Second, we discuss the use of mathematical models of tumor progression for CTV definition, using as example the application of glioma growth models to facilitate GTV-to-CTV expansion for glioblastoma that is consistent with neuroanatomy. We further consider statistical machine learning models to quantify lymphatic metastatic progression of tumors, which may eventually improve elective CTV definition. Lastly, we discuss approaches to incorporate uncertainty in CTV definition into treatment plan optimization as well as general limitations of the CTV concept in the case of infiltrating tumors without natural boundaries.

TI  - High-resolution stable isotope profiles of modern elephant (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>) tusk dentin and tail hair from Kenya: Implications for identifying seasonal variability in climate, ecology, and diet in ancient proboscideans
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable isotope ratios in tissues of large mammalian herbivores record diet and climate information integrated over large spatial areas and can be used to study modern and fossil ecosystems. Sound interpretation of data requires that tissue growth rates be determined accurately and that ecological and behavioral variables that influence stable isotope ratios of tissues be measured and related to experienced environmental conditions assessed through field observations, remote sensing data, and meteorological records. If well-understood in modern herbivores, stable isotopes from closely-related extinct taxa have tremendous potential for resolving paleodiet, paleoenvironment, and paleoclimate of terrestrial ecosystems. We present multiyear, high-resolution (i.e., weekly) stable isotope records from bioapatite in tusk dentin (delta C-13(dentin) and delta O-18(dentin)) and tail hair (delta C-13(hair) and delta N-15(hair)) of an African elephant (Loxodonta africana) from Kenya that was fitted with a GPS collar intermittently over a five year period and observed for nearly a decade. GPS and observational data provide behavioral, life history, and location information. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, and isotopic data from plants and water provide further constraints for interpreting isotope profiles. We determine tusk and hair growth rates using a combination of histological and geochemical approaches, including bomb-curve radiocarbon, that confirm approximately weekly resolution in the stable isotope profiles. Tusk dentin isotope profiles spanning the periods 1982 to 1987 and 2000 to 2006 record weekly variability in delta C-13(dentin), where increases of up to 4.5 parts per thousand from baseline values due to diet switches from predominantly C-3 browsing to mixed C-3 browsing and C-4 grazing occur during the twice-yearly (biannual) rainy seasons. The delta C-13(hair) values show a similar trend. The delta C-13 profiles served as a proxy for seasonal changes in rainfall, vegetation, and diet. The delta O-18 of tusk bioapatite varied approximately biannually up to 5 parts per thousand, likely reflecting increases in the proportion of plant water ingested during the wet season. Using a least squares inverse filter, we show that NDVI can be used to predict delta C-13 of dentin and vice versa, offering the possibility to reconstruct seasonal changes in vegetation and rainfall in the geologic past. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution tusk isotope profiles serve as a proxy for seasonality of diet and precipitation, and thus can be used to reconstruct aspects of elephant life history, vegetation, and climate at unprecedented resolution from modern and fossil proboscidean samples.

TI  - How much spatial resolution do we need to model a local flood event? Benchmark testing based on UAV data from Biga River (Turkey)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are important in flood modelling as they present surface information and obstacles giving the direction of water during a flood event. All hydraulic modelling software needs both channel and floodplain elevation data to simulate the water flow from upstream to downstream. Based on the accuracy and representative capacity of the surface, modelling results can be evaluated in terms of hazard and risk analysis. Developments in remote sensing and GIS technology provide many sources to freely obtain DEM data of different resolution and accuracy. However, access to and the processing of high-resolution data associated with large areas is difficult and time-consuming. This study, therefore, focuses on determining the availability of different resolutions and DEM sources in flood modelling by testing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data. For this, freely available DEMs such as ALOS DEMs (12.5 and 30 m), EU-DEM (25 m), ASTER GDEM (30 m), SRTM (30 and 90 m), MERIT DEM (90 m) and TANDEM-X (90 m) were chosen to investigate part of Biga River (Turkey) which features a natural channel. Then, 1D flood modelling was examined using different DEM resolutions, Manning's values and flood data of various frequencies (10, 100 and 1000 years). Results were tested using high-resolution DEM data (5 cm) gathered from a UAV. It was concluded that EU-DEM is the most suitable dataset in terms of flood extent, depth and velocity. However, depending on the boundary characteristics of the data, ALOS 12.5 DEM and MERIT DEM (90 m) data are the most suitable in their extent, depth and velocity for high-resolution and low-resolution flood modelling worldwide extent.

TI  - About Validation-Comparison of Burned Area Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a validation-comparison method for burned area (BA) products. The technique considers: (1) bootstrapping of scenes for validation-comparison and (2) permutation tests for validation. The research focuses on the tropical regions of Northern Hemisphere South America and Northern Hemisphere Africa and studies the accuracy of the BA products: MCD45, MCD64C5.1, MCD64C6, Fire CCI C4.1, and Fire CCI C5.0. The first and second parts consider methods based on random matrix theory for zone differentiation and multiple ancillary variables such as BA, the number of burned fragments, ecosystem type, land cover, and burned biomass. The first method studies the zone effect using bootstrapping of Riemannian, full Procrustes, and partial Procrustes distances. The second method explores the validation by using distance permutation tests under uncertainty. The results refer to Fire CCI 5.0 with the best BA description, followed by MCD64C6, MCD64C5.1, MCD45, and Fire CCI 4.1. It was also found that biomass, total BA, and the number of fragments affect the BA product accuracy.

TI  - Damage Assessment and Recovery Mapping for the "Las Penuelas" Wildfire, Moguer (Huelva ). Satellite Imagery. Year 2017
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep knowledge of the regeneration processes after a forest fire is key to addressing their adverse environmental impacts, these are especially evident in the vegetation. In the post-fire environment context, the fire severity constitutes a critical variable that affects the ecosystem response in terms of vegetation recovery and hydrogeomorphological dynamics after the fire. Therefore, the severity accurate assessment is essential for the burned areas management because of it allows the identification of priority areas and, therefore, it helps to carry out recovery strategies and measures. The area of interest is located in the natural place of Las Penuelas (Huelva), where a large fire took place on June 24, 2017 that affected almost 10 000 ha. The methodology was based on the calculation of the RBR (Relativized Burn Ratio) spectral index to estimate the severity of the fire, and the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) index to evaluate the recovery of vegetal vigor. For the work, images from the Sentinel-2 and Pleiades satellites, images acquired by UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and field samplings were used. The result was a cartography showing the levels of recovery or degradation of the affected vegetation.

TI  - Dating flowering cycles of Amazonian bamboo-dominated forests by supervised Landsat time series segmentation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo-dominated forests are unusual and interesting because their structure and biomass fluctuate in decades-long cycles corresponding to the flowering and mortality rhythm of the bamboo. In southwestern Amazonia, these forests have been estimated to occupy an area of approximately 160 000 km(2), and a single reproductively synchronized patch can cover up to thousands of square kilometers. Accurate mapping of these forests is challenging, however: the forests are spatially heterogeneous, with bamboo densities varying widely among adjacent sites; much of the area is inaccessible, so field verification of bamboo presence is difficult to obtain and georeferenced records of past flowering events virtually non-existent; and detectability of the bamboo by remote sensing varies considerably during its life cycle. In this study, we develop a supervised time series segmentation approach that allows us to identify both the presence of bamboo forests and the years in which the bamboo flowering and subsequent mortality have occurred. We then apply the method to the entire Landsat TM/ETM+ archive from 1984 to the end of 2018 and validate the classification by visual interpretation of very high resolution imagery. Collecting accurate ground reference data of bamboo presence and bamboo mortality timing is notably difficult in these forests, and we therefore developed a methodology that takes advantage of imperfect reference data obtained from the Landsat time series itself. Our results show that bamboo forests can be differentiated from non-bamboo forests using any of the infrared bands, but band 5 produces the highest classification accuracy. Interestingly, there appears to be a temporal difference in the spectral responses of the three infrared bands to bamboo flowering and mortality: near infrared (band 4) reflectance reacts to the event earlier than shortwave infrared (bands 5 and 7) reflectance. The long Landsat TM/ETM+ archive allows our methodology to detect some areas with two mortality events, with a theoretical maximum interval of 29 years. Analysis of these pixels with repeated mortality confirms that the life cycles of the local bamboo species (Guadua sarcocarpa and G. weberbauerii) last typically 28 years.

TI  - Delay in Breast Cancer Treatments During the First COVID-19 Lockdown. A Multicentric Analysis of 432 Patients
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Extraordinary restrictions aimed to limit Sars-CoV-2 spreading; they imposed a total reorganization of the health-system. Oncological treatments experienced a significant slowdown. The aim of our multicentric retrospective study was to evaluate screening suspension and surgical treatment delay during COVID-19 and the impact on breast cancer presentation. Patients and Methods: All patients who underwent breast surgery from March 11, 2020 to May 30, 2020 were evaluated and considered as the Lockdown group. These patients were compared with similar patients of the previous year, the Pre-Lockdown group. Results: A total of 432 patients were evaluated; n=223 and n=209 in the Lockdown and Pre-lockdown-groups, respectively. At univariate analysis, waiting times, lymph-nodes involvement and cancer grading, showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis identified waiting-time on list (OR=1.07) as a statistically significant predictive factor of lymph node involvement. Conclusion: Although we did not observe a clinically evident difference in breast cancer presentation, we reported an increase in lymph node involvement.

TI  - Cloud-Resolving Model Applied to Nowcasting: An Evaluation of Radar Data Assimilation and Microphysics Parameterization
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research explores the benefits of radar data assimilation for short-range weather forecasts in southeastern Brazil using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model's three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) system. Different data assimilation options are explored, including the cycling frequency, the number of outer loops, and the use of null-echo assimilation. Initially, four microphysics parameterization are evaluated (Thompson, Morrison, WSM6, and WDM6). The Thompson parameterization produces the best results, while the other parameterization generally overestimate the precipitation forecast, especially WDSM6. Additionally, the Thompson scheme tends to overestimate snow, while the Morrison scheme overestimates graupel. Regarding the data assimilation options, the results deteriorate and more spurious convection occurs when using a higher cycling frequency (i.e., 30 min instead of 60 min). The use of two outer loops produces worse precipitation forecasts than the use of one outer loop, and the null-echo assimilation is shown to be an effective way to suppress spurious convection. However, in some cases, the null-echo assimilation also removes convective clouds that are not observed by the radar and/or are still not producing rain, but have the potential to grow into an intense convective cloud with heavy rainfall. Finally, a cloud convective mask was implemented using ancillary satellite data to prevent null-echo assimilation from removing potential convective clouds. The mask was demonstrated to be beneficial in some circumstances, but it needs to be carefully evaluated in more cases to have a more robust conclusion regarding its use.

TI  - On the nature of eco-anxiety: How constructive or unconstructive is habitual worry about global warming?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Three studies investigated habitual worry about global warming as an example of 'eco-anxiety'. The key question was whether such worrying is constructive (a motivated pro-environmental response) or unconstructive (a symptom of pathological worry). Pathological worry and worry about global warming were assessed together with two other worry sources, that is, personal issues and the world economy (Study 1) and personal issues and the corona virus (Study 2). In both studies a statistically significant correlation was found between pathological worry and global warming worry. However, this relationship was nonsignificant when controlled for the other two worry sources. Comparisons between Studies 1 and 2 conducted one month before and during the COVID-19 crisis, respectively, as well as between order conditions within Study 2 suggested that global warming worry was unaffected by the COVID-19 context. Study 3 demonstrated that global warming worry was associated with the perception of a proximal as well as a distal threat, and correlated positively with determinants of pro-environmental behaviour, that is, a pro-ecological worldview, pro-environmental values, past pro-environmental behaviour and a 'green' identity. Global warming worry also correlated positively with emotion clusters signifying determination, anxiety, and anger, respectively. The three studies together suggest that while habitual global warming worry may be unconstructive and part of intrapersonal dysfunction for some individuals, for many others it is a constructive adaptive pro-environmental response.

TI  - Combining Satellite Remote Sensing and Climate Data in Species Distribution Models to Improve the Conservation of Iberian White Oaks (<i>Quercus</i> L.)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Iberian Peninsula hosts a high diversity of oak species, being a hot-spot for the conservation of European White Oaks (Quercus) due to their environmental heterogeneity and its critical role as a phylogeographic refugium. Identifying and ranking the drivers that shape the distribution of White Oaks in Iberia requires that environmental variables operating at distinct scales are considered. These include climate, but also ecosystem functioning attributes (EFAs) related to energy-matter exchanges that characterize land cover types under various environmental settings, at finer scales. Here, we used satellite-based EFAs and climate variables in species distribution models (SDMs) to assess how variables related to ecosystem functioning improve our understanding of current distributions and the identification of suitable areas for White Oak species in Iberia. We developed consensus ensemble SDMs targeting a set of thirteen oaks, including both narrow endemic and widespread taxa. Models combining EFAs and climate variables obtained a higher performance and predictive ability (true-skill statistic (TSS): 0.88, sensitivity: 99.6, specificity: 96.3), in comparison to the climate-only models (TSS: 0.86, sens.: 96.1, spec.: 90.3) and EFA-only models (TSS: 0.73, sens.: 91.2, spec.: 82.1). Overall, narrow endemic species obtained higher predictive performance using combined models (TSS: 0.96, sens.: 99.6, spec.: 96.3) in comparison to widespread oaks (TSS: 0.80, sens.: 92.6, spec.: 87.7). The Iberian White Oaks show a high dependence on precipitation and the inter-quartile range of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (i.e., seasonal water availability) which appears to be the most important EFA variable. Spatial projections of climate-EFA combined models contribute to identify the major diversity hotspots for White Oaks in Iberia, holding higher values of cumulative habitat suitability and species richness. We discuss the implications of these findings for guiding the long-term conservation of Iberian White Oaks and provide spatially explicit geospatial information about each oak species (or set of species) relevant for developing biogeographic conservation frameworks.

TI  - Spatial shape feature descriptors in classification of engineered objects using high spatial resolution remote sensing data
T2  - EVOLVING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and spectral features are two important attributes that form the knowledge based database, useful in classification of engineered objects, using remote sensing data. Spectral features alone may be insufficient to identify buildings and roads in urban areas due to spectral homogeneity and similarity exhibited by them. This has led researchers to explore the spatial features described in terms of shape descriptors to improve accuracy of classification of engineered objects. This paper discusses the parameters of spatial shape features and the method for implementing these features for improving the extraction of engineered objects, using the support vector machine (SVM). SVM classified results obtained using spatial shape features is compared with gray level co-occurrence statistical features in which the former has shown better classification accuracy for buildings and roads. The classification accuracy is also calculated using spectral features of buildings and roads by classifiers such as spectral angle mapper and spectral information divergence. The analysis shows that spatial shape features improve the classification results of buildings and roads in urban areas.

AB  - The results of satellite wildfire monitoring and estimates for the amounts of emissions of harmful gases and fine aerosols in Siberia from 2001 to 2019 are presented. The features of space monitoring used to assess the burned-out areas and the amounts of wildfire emissions are described. The analysis of satellite data processing has allowed us to reveal that the total burned-out areas and the amounts of emissions of harmful gases and fine aerosols in Siberia were abnormally high in 2019. In 2019, 72.4 thousand km(2) of Siberia was affected by wildfires, which constituted 42% of the area of wildfires that occurred this year throughout Russia. In 2019, the Irkutsk oblast suffered the most from wildfires in July (11.14 thousand km(2)) and August (7.24 thousand km(2)).

TI  - <i>The Great Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language</i> as a Reflection of Economic Change: Semantic Dynamics of Words with the Root <i>Torg</i>-
T2  - VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the dynamics of a fragment of the Russian linguistic worldview projected onto the experience of academic lexicography. Based on the data extracted from the three editions of the Great Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language (also referred to as the Dictionary), which serves as a reflection of the 80-yearlong history of the Soviet and Russian society, the sociocultural dynamics of a conceptual view of economy and trade is uncovered through its lexical, semantic and lexicographic realization. The aim of the research is to analyze the semantic dynamics of the words with root torg- [trade] based on the Dictionary data. This includes the study of the lexicographic interpretation of these words as well as the justification of new lexicographic solutions. The key attention is paid to a number of polysemantic words: torg, torgovat', torgovat'sya, torgovlya, torgovyy. In the course of the research, the method of componential semantic analysis is applied together with the comparison of the entries from different editions of the Dictionary and with the selection of text illustrations by means of linguistic corpora. Two aspects of the semantic dynamics of the words with root torg- are discussed: 1) reflection of lexicographic principles adopted by the authors of the Dictionary and 2) lexical and semantic objectivation of the Russian linguistic worldview. The first aspect is represented by the trend of semantic differentiation typical of the Dictionary and manifested in both enlargement and specification of the word semantic structure. Syncretic meanings that can be seen in the first edition are later splintered into separate meanings or even shades of meaning (torgash, torgashestvo, torgovat'). The sociocultural dynamics is presented by a number of linguistic trends. The first trend is generating new collocations, and the adjective torgovyy shows here the highest productivity. Adjacent to it stands the active formation of compound words beginning with torgovo-. The second (controversial) trend is obsolescence of words and meanings: notions of the Soviet economy are going out of use (torg as a `trade institution'). The third trend is actualization of obsolete words and meanings, which is often only illusive. In the Soviet period, many notions of economy were considered inadmissible or typical of the Czarist era, hence, these words were defined as obsolete ones. However, the historic change of the early 1990s showed that this part of vocabulary was always commonly used, even in the Soviet texts that could not serve as a source of illustrations due to censorship. Thus, the considered aspects of the semantic dynamics of the words with the root torg- demonstrate the general way of conceptualizing the economic sphere by the Russians. It is mainly reflected in the social revaluation of the market relations, trade, and entrepreneurship. The lexical and semantic objectivation of this revaluation requires shrewd lexicographic solutions.

TI  - Status of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Vulvar and Cervical Cancer
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Review
AB  - Assessment of lymphatic metastasis is an essential component of solid tumour staging. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows regional lymph node involvement by tumour to be estimated by selectively examining the sentinel lymph node while minimising the morbidity of systematic lymph node dissection. Within the group of genital cancers, the diagnostic value of SLN biopsy is rated differently. For selected patients with early-stage vulvar cancer (unifocal primary tumour < 4 cm, clinically negative inguinal lymph nodes) the SLN technique is already an established procedure in the guidelines of the German Society for Gynaecology and Obstetrics (DGGG)/German Cancer Society (DKG) and the recommendations of the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO). For cervical cancer, SLN biopsy has not yet been sufficiently standardised but can be considered for patients without risk factors with a primary tumour size < 2 cm. The SLN is identified by combined use of radioactive (99m)technetium nanocolloid and patent blue. The use of indocyanine green offers an alternative for SLN identification with few side effects. Recent studies aim to increase the diagnostic reliability of intraoperative frozen section analysis as this continues to show limited sensitivity in both vulvar and cervical cancer. The rate of detection of micrometastases can be increased by additional ultrastaging, the prognostic significance of which for both diseases is still unclear. The prognostic value of SLN biopsy compared with systematic lymph node dissection is being investigated in current studies (GROINSS-V-II for vulvar cancer and SENTIX-, SENTICOL-3 for cervical cancer). For this review article, a guideline-based literature search was performed in the National Library of Medicine (PubMed/MEDLINE) database with a particular focus on recent cohort studies and conference contributions.

TI  - Uncertainty of drought information in a data-scarce tropical river basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Wami River basin in east-central Tanzania features the Eastern Arc Mountains and dichotomous climate regimes.Study focus: Drought characteristics are vital in planning and managing water resources in river basins. However, the estimation of drought characteristics from the evapotranspiration deficit index (ETDI) is susceptible to the uncertainty associated with alternative datasets from hydrological models and remote sensing images. Thus, this study investigated scenario uncertainty in ETDI-based drought characteristics in the river basin using evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration data from a classical Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images between the years 2000 and 2010.New hydrological insights: The findings showed a substantial scenario uncertainty in drought duration, severity, and intensity at various locations in the river basin. Localized severe MODIS-based overall drought intensity (MODIS-ODI) in the middle of the basin was attributed to prolonged low rainfall amounts. In the downstream, localized severe SWAT-based overall drought intensity (SWAT-ODI) was attributed to an imperfection of the SWAT model in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin. However, at the basin level, both SWAT-ODI and MODIS-ODI between the years 2000 and 2010 were moderate. These findings can be used as the baseline information in improving drought estimation in the river basin. Moreover, this study also demonstrates the importance of assessing scenario uncertainty in drought characterization.

TI  - An assessment of marine atmospheric boundary layer roll detection using Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to detect marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) roll-induced roughness modulation of the sea surface wave field is well known. This study presents SAR measurements of MABL rolls using global coverage data collected by the European Space Agency's C-band Sentinel-1A satellite in 2016-2017. An automated classifier is used to identify likely roll events from more than 1.3 million images that were acquired at two incidence angles of 23 degrees and 36.5 degrees in either VV or HH polarization. Characteristics of the detected rolls are examined for different wind speeds, polarizations, incidence and relative azimuth angles. Roll detection counts are much higher at the higher incidence angle and nearly equivalent for VV and HH polarizations. Detection depends strongly on the relative azimuth with roll detection rates at crosswind being 3-10 times lower than for upor downwind. All data show a low wind speed threshold near 2 m s(-1) and that rolls are most commonly observed at wind speeds near 9 m s(-1). For all viewing configurations, we find that rolls induce a wide range of mean surface wind speed modulation with the most frequent value being 8% (+/- 3.5%). Roll detection at crosswind is associated with stronger roll-induced surface wind en-hancement. Dependencies of roll detection on the incidence and relative azimuth angles are consistent with rapid short-scale wind-wave adjustments to the roll-induced surface wind gusts. These cm-scale waves are highly directional and provide limited crosswind backscatter at shallower incidence angles. The same roll-induced surface forcing is thus not equally detectable at all viewing geometries or polarizaions. Stronger and possibly longer-duration wind forcing is likely needed to produce detectable roll-induced modulations at crosswind.

TI  - Integrating satellite and unmanned aircraft system (UAS) imagery to model livestock population dynamics in the Longbao Wetland National Nature Reserve, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection of field-based animal data is laborious, risky and costly in some areas, such as various nature reserves. Although multiple studies have used satellite imagery, aerial imagery, and field data individually for some animal species surveys, several technical issues still need to be addressed before full standardization of remote sensing methods for modeling animal population dynamics over large areas. This study is the first to model the population dynamics of livestock in the LongbaoWetland National Nature Reserve, China by utilizing yak estimations from Worldview-2 satellite imagery (0.5 m) collected in 2010 and yaks counted in a ground-based survey conducted in 2011 in combination with the animal population structure precisely extracted from UAS imagery captured in 2016. As a consequence, 5501, 5357, and 5510 yaks were estimated to appear in the reserve in 2010, 2011 and 2016, respectively. In total, 1092, 1062 and 1092 sheep were estimated to appear in the reserve in 2010, 2011 and 2016, respectively. The uncertainty of the presented method is also discussed. Primary experiments show that both the satellite imagery and UAS imagery are promising for use in yak censuses, but no sheep were observed in the satellite imagery because of the low resolution. Compared to the ground-based survey conducted in 2011, the UAS image estimate and satellite imagery count deviated in yak quantity by 2.69% and 2.86%, respectively. UASs are a reliable and low-budget alternative to animal surveys. No discernable changes in animal behaviors and animal distributionswere observed as the UAS passed at a height of 700 m, and the accuracy of UAS imagery counts were not significantly affected by the short-distance animal movement and image mosaicking errors. The experimental results illustrate the advantages of the combination of satellite and UAS imagery in modeling animal population dynamics. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Impact of Assimilating FY-3C GNOS GPS Radio Occultation Observations on GRAPES Forecasts
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, a gross quality control (QC) procedure is proposed for the Global Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder (GNOS) Global Positioning System radio occultation (GPS RO) refractivity data to remove abnormal data before they are assimilated. It consists of a climate extreme check removing data outside the range of the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) climate maxima and minima over approximately five years, and a vertical gradient check that rejects profiles containing super-refractions. These two QC steps were applied sequentially to identify outliers in GNOS GPS RO refractivity data during boreal winter 2013/2014. All of the abnormal refractivity profiles and the outliers at each level of the GNOS GPS RO observations were effectively removed by the proposed QC procedure. The post-QC GNOS GPS RO refractivity observations were then assimilated in the Global/Regional Analysis and PrEdiction System (GRAPES) using the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) system. The impacts of the GNOS refractivity observation on GRAPES analysis and forecasting were evaluated and analyzed using an observation system experiment run over one whole winter season of 2013/2014. The experiment results demonstrated a positive impact of GNOS GPS RO data on analysis and forecast quality. The root mean squared error of GRAPES analysis temperature was reduced by 1% in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropics and in the tropics, and the anomaly correlation scores of the forecasted 500-hPa geopotential height over the SH increased significantly during days 1 to 5. Overall, the benefits of using GNOS GPS RO data are significant in the SH and tropics.

TI  - Analysis of Combining SAR and Optical Optimal Parameters to Classify Typhoon-Invasion Lodged Rice: A Case Study Using the Random Forest Method
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lodging, a commonly occurring rice crop disaster, seriously reduces rice quality and production. Monitoring rice lodging after a typhoon event is essential for evaluating yield loss and formulating suitable remedial policies. The availability of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 open-access remote sensing data provides large-scale information with a short revisit time to be freely accessed. Data from these sources have been previously shown to identify lodged crops. In this study, therefore, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data after a typhoon event were combined to enable monitoring of lodging rice to be quickly undertaken. In this context, the sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features (SF) and spectral indices (SI) extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to lodged rice were analyzed, and a model was constructed for selecting optimal sensitive parameters for lodging rice (OSPL). OSPL has high sensitivity to lodged rice and strong ability to distinguish lodged rice from healthy rice. After screening, Band 11 (SWIR-1) and Band 12 (SWIR-2) were identified as optimal spectral indices (OSI), and VV, VV + VH and Shannon Entropy were optimal SAR features (OSF). Three classification results of lodging rice were acquired using the Random Forest classification (RFC) method based on OSI, OSF and integrated OSI-OSF stack images, respectively. Results indicate that an overall level of accuracy of 91.29% was achieved with the combination of SAR and optical optimal parameters. The result was 2.91% and 6.05% better than solely using optical or SAR processes, respectively.

TI  - Analysing the Driving Forces and Environmental Effects of Urban Expansion by Mapping the Speed and Acceleration of Built-Up Areas in China between 1978 and 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Abundant data sets produced from long-term series of high-resolution remote sensing data have made it possible to explore urban issues across different spatiotemporal scales. Based on a 40-year impervious area data set released by Tsinghua University, a method was developed to map the speed and acceleration of urban built-up areas. With the mapping results of the two indices, we characterised the spatiotemporal dynamics of built-up area expansion and captured different types of expansion. Combined with socioeconomic data, we examined the temporal changes and spatial heterogeneity of driving forces with an ordinary least square (OLS) model and a panel data model, as well as exploring the environmental effects of the expansion. Our results reveal that China has experienced drastic urban expansion over the last four decades. Among all cities, megacities and large cities in eastern China, as well as megacities in central and northeast China have experienced the most dramatic urban expansion. A growing number of cities are categorised as thriving, which means that they have both high expansion speed and acceleration. The overall driving force of urban expansion has significantly increased. More specifically, it was associated with population increase in the early stages; however, since 2000, it has been substantially associated with increases in GDP and fixed asset investments. The major driving factors also differ between regions and urban sizes. Urban expansion is identified as being closely associated with environmental deterioration; thus, speed and acceleration should be included as key indicators in exploring the environmental effects of urban expansion. In summary, the results of the presented case study, based on a data set of China, indicate that speed and acceleration are useful in analysing the driving forces of urban expansion and its environmental effects, and may generate more interest in related research.

TI  - STATUS PREDICTION BY 3D FRACTAL NET CNN BASED ON REMOTE SENSING IMAGES
T2  - FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources is becoming increasingly prominent, whose main reason is the eutrophication of rivers and lakes. However, limited and inaccurate data makes it impossible to establish a precise model to successfully predict eutrophication levels. Moreover, it is incompetent to distinguish the degree of eutrophication status of lakes by manual calculation and processing. Focusing on these inconveniences, this study proposes 3D fractal net CNN to extract features in remote sensing images automatically, aiming at achieving scientific forecasting on eutrophication status of lakes. In order to certificate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we predict the state of the water body based on remote sensing images of natural lake. The images in natural lake were accessed by MODIS satellite, cloud-free chlorophyll inversion picture of 2009 was resized into 273 x 273 patches, which were collected as training and testing samples. In the total of 162 pictures, our study makes three consecutive pictures as a set of data so as to attain 120 group of training and 40 testing data. Taking one set of data as input of the neural network and the next day's eutrophication level as labels, CNNs act considerable efficiency. Through the experimental results of 2D CNN, 3D CNN and 3D fractal net CNN, 3D fractal net CNN has more outstanding performance than the other two, with the prediction accuracy of 67.5% better than 47.5% and 62.5%, respectively.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Albedo from MODIS and VIIRS Data: A Multi-Sensor Strategy Based on the Direct Estimation Algorithm and Statistical-Based Temporal Filter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is an important variable for Earth's radiation and energy budget. Over the past decades, many surface albedo products have been derived from a variety of remote sensing data. However, the estimation accuracy, temporal resolution, and temporal continuity of these datasets still need to be improved. We developed a multi-sensor strategy (MSS) based on the direct-estimation algorithm (DEA) and Statistical-Based Temporal Filter (STF) to improve the quality of land surface albedo datasets. The moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data onboard Terra and Aqua and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) were used as multi-sensor data. The MCD43A3 product and in situ measurements from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and FLUXNET sites were employed for validation and comparison. The results showed that the proposed MSS method significantly improved the temporal continuity and estimation accuracy during the snow-covered period, which was more consistent with the measurements of SURFRAD (R = 0.9498, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.0387, and bias = -0.0017) and FLUXNET (R = 0.9421, RMSE = 0.0330, and bias = 0.0002) sites. Moreover, this is a promising method to generate long-term, spatiotemporal continuous land surface albedo datasets with high temporal resolution.

TI  - The use of mobile lidar data and Gaofen-2 image to classify roadside trees
T2  - MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Roadside trees are a vital component of urban greenery and play an important role in intelligent transportation and environmental protection. Quickly and efficiently identifying the spatial distribution of roadside trees is key to providing basic data for urban management and conservation decisions. In this study, we researched the potential of data fusing the Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite imagery rich in spectral information and mobile light detection and ranging (lidar) system (MLS) high-precision three-dimensional data to improve roadside tree classification accuracy. Specifically, a normalized digital surface model (nDSM) was derived from the lidar point cloud. GF-2 imagery was fused with an nDSM at the pixel level using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm. Then, samples were set including roadside tree samples from lidar data extracted by random sample consensus and other objects samples from field observation using the Global Positioning System. Finally, we conducted a segmentation process to generate an object-based image and completed the roadside tree classification at object level based on a support vector machine classifier using spectral features and completed local binary pattern (CLBP) texture features. Results show that classification using GF-2 alone and using nDSM alone result in 67.34% and 69.39% overall accuracy respectively with serious misclassification. The fusion image based on GF-2 and nDSM yields 77.55% overall accuracy. This means that the fusion of multi-source data is a great improvement over individual data. After adding the CLBP texture feature to the classification procedure, the classification accuracy of the fusion image is increased to 87.76%. The addition of CLBP texture features can clearly reduce the noise . Our results indicate that the classification of urban roadside trees can be realized by the fusion of satellite data and mobile lidar data with CLBP texture feature using the target-based classification method. Results also suggest that MLS data and CLBP texture features have the potential to effectively and efficiently improve the accuracy of satellite remote sensing classification.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing and Landscape Characteristics to Estimate Soil Salinity Using Machine Learning Methods: A Case Study from Southern Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization, one of the most severe global land degradation problems, leads to the loss of arable land and declines in crop yields. Monitoring the distribution of salinized soil and degree of salinization is critical for management, remediation, and utilization of salinized soil; however, there is a lack of thorough assessment of various data sources including remote sensing and landscape characteristics for estimating soil salinity in arid and semi-arid areas. The overall goal of this study was to develop a framework for estimating soil salinity in diverse landscapes by fusing information from satellite images, landscape characteristics, and appropriate machine learning models. To explore the spatial distribution of soil salinity in southern Xinjiang, China, as a case study, we obtained 151 soil samples in a field campaign, which were analyzed in laboratory for soil electrical conductivity. A total of 35 indices including remote sensing classifiers (11), terrain attributes (3), vegetation spectral indices (8), and salinity spectral indices (13) were calculated or derived and correlated with soil salinity. Nine were used to model and estimate soil salinity using four predictive modelling approaches: partial least squares regression (PLSR), convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM) learning, and random forest (RF). Testing datasets were divided into vegetation-covered and bare soil samples and were used for accuracy assessment. The RF model was the best regression model in this study, with R-2 = 0.75, and was most effective in revealing the spatial characteristics of salt distribution. Importance analysis and path modeling of independent variables indicated that environmental factors and soil salinity indices including digital elevation model (DEM), B10, and green atmospherically resistant vegetation index (GARI) showed the strongest contribution in soil salinity estimation. This showed a great promise in the measurement and monitoring of soil salinity in arid and semi-arid areas from the integration of remote sensing, landscape characteristics, and using machine learning model.

TI  - Geo-simulation of land use/cover scenarios and impacts on land surface temperature in Sapporo, Japan
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is receiving increasing attention as a measure of urban health and sustainable development. With rapid urbanization and industrialization, the urban heat island phenomenon, which causes excessive energy consumption and climatic and environmental deterioration, has become prevalent in many cities. It is well known that optimizing land use/cover (LUC) distribution can reduce the urban heat island phenomenon. Therefore, monitoring LUC changes and analyzing their effects on LST is crucial for healthy urban development. In this study, an attempt is made to examine LST and LUC changes in Sapporo, Japan. Using Landsat data, we attempted to analyze the LST in each LUC category from 1985 to 2015. The results show that: (1) LUC types and spatial distribution have great influences on LST, (2) expanding development has been the most significant factor affecting urban heat island phenomenon over the past 30 years, and (3) green space and water areas have helped cool the city. This study revealed a strong relationship between LUC distribution and LST, opening research avenues for future LUC simulation. Our analysis not only contributes to urban health and sustainable development but also provides significant insights into the promotion of city competence.

TI  - Mapping Dragon Fruit Croplands from Space Using Remote Sensing of Artificial Light at Night
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The nighttime light (NTL) on the surface of Earth is an important indicator for the human transformation of the world. NTL remotely sensed data have been widely used in urban development, population estimation, economic activity, resource development and other fields. With the increasing use of artificial lighting technology in agriculture, it has become possible to use NTL remote sensing data for monitoring agricultural activities. In this study, National Polar Partnership (NPP)-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) NTL remote sensing data were used to observe the seasonal variation of artificial lighting in dragon fruit cropland in Binh Thuan Province, Vietnam. Compared with the statistics of planted area, area having products and production of dragon fruit by district in the Statistical Yearbook of Binh Thuan Province 2018, values of the mean and standard deviation of NTL brightness have significant positive correlations with the statistical data. The results suggest that the NTL remotely sensed data could be used to reveal some agricultural productive activities such as dragon fruits production accurately by monitoring the seasonal artificial lighting. This research demonstrates the application potential of NTL remotely sensed data in agriculture.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Argo Float Observations Reveal Physical Processes Initiating a Winter-Spring Phytoplankton Bloom South of the Kuroshio Current Near Shikoku
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BIO-Argo float (chlorophyll a (Chl-a), temperature, and salinity profiles) and remote sensing data (Chl-a, photosynthetic available radiation (PAR), and wind) located south of the Kuroshio current near Shikoku from September 2018 to May 2019 were used to study phytoplankton bloom and their mechanisms of development in open oceans. Results show that higher (lower) Chl-a concentrations are correlated with a deeper (shallower) mixed layer (R-Pearson = 0.77, R-crit = 0.12 (alpha = 0.05, n = 263)) compared to the average of Chl-a and mixed layer depth (0.13 mg/m(3) and 105 m). The average net accumulation rates (r) of phytoplankton were close to 0.08 d(-1). An increasing r corresponds to a gradually increasing surface Chl-a (S (Chl-a): 0-20 m average Chl-a) and integrated Chl-a inventory (I (Chl-a): integrated Chl-a from surface to euphotic depth). These phenomena indicate that the mechanism of winter-spring phytoplankton blooms is consistent with the dilution-recoupling hypotheses (DRH). During the bloom formation, winter deep mixing and eddy-wind Ekman pumping are enhanced by a strong winter monsoon. The enhancement may disturb predator-prey interactions and dilute zooplankton in deep mixed layers. Moreover, winter deep mixing and eddy-wind Ekman pumping can cause the nutrients to be transported into the euphotic layer, which can promote the growth of phytoplankton and increase grazing. During the bloom extinction, the stratification strengthens and the intensity of light increases; this increases grazing and nutrient consumption, and decreases the phytoplankton bloom significantly (S (Chl-a) and I (Chl-a) increase by 0.3 mg/m(3) and 27 mg/m(2), respectively). The output from a biogeochemistry model shows that nutrients are consistent with the temporal distribution of S (Chl-a) and I (Chl-a). Our results suggest that physical processes (deep winter mixing and eddy-wind Ekman pumping) under the DHR framework are critical factors for winter-spring blooms in open oceans with an anticyclone eddy.

TI  - Environmental Influence on the Spatiotemporal Variability of Fishing Grounds in the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distribution of fishing grounds in the Beibu Gulf and its relationship with marine environment were analyzed using the survey data of light falling-net vessels and satellite remote sensing data including sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) and net primary production (NPP), based on the generalized additive model (GAM) and the center of gravity (COG) of fishing grounds. The results showed that the total deviance explained by GAM for the catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the Beibu Gulf was 42.9%, in which SST was the most important influencing factor on CPUE, with a relative contribution of 40%; followed by latitude, Chl a, month and NPP, with relative contributions of 25.2%, 19%, 10.4% and 5.4%, respectively. Fishing grounds in the Beibu Gulf were mainly distributed in waters with SST of 27-29 degrees C, Chl a of 0.5-1.5 mg m(-3) and NPP of 500-700 mg m(-2) d(-1). Light falling-net fishing grounds were concentrated in waters with latitude of 18.5 degrees N and 20-20.25 degrees N. There was a significant correlation between the mean latitude of optimum NPP and the latitudinal COG of CPUE, with the R-2 being 0.91. These were connected with environmental factors such as the northeast monsoon that began in autumn and winter, warm pools near 19 degrees N and local upwelling in the Beibu Gulf.

TI  - Contrasting chlorophyll-<i>a</i> seasonal patterns between nearshore and offshore waters in the Bohai and Yellow Seas, China: A new analysis using improved satellite data
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal cycles of sea surface Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in the Bohai and Yellow Seas (BYS) were examined using new remotely sensed Chl-a products derived using a regional algorithm. Based on objective clustering analysis, two contrasting Chl-a seasonal patterns were delineated: 1) A nearshore pattern with a long-lasting Chl-a peak from spring to autumn, coinciding with sufficient nutrient supply and high light availability, and lower Chl-a values in winter due to the light-limitation as a consequence of low solar irradiance and high diffuse attenuation coefficient of light for the water column; 2) An offshore pattern with a strong spring bloom triggered by alleviated light limitation and abundant nutrients coinciding with high water column stability. A weak autumn peak induced by new nutrient replenishment from bottom re-suspension and horizontal transportation, a low Chl-a trough in winter mainly attributed to light-limitation, and a Chl-a trough in summer due to nutrient scarcity were observed. The linkages between the province-specific Chl-a seasonal patterns and the seasonal cycles of the corresponding environmental variables as well as other potential influencing factors are comprehensively delineated and discussed.

TI  - Mapping an Urban Boundary Based on Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 and POI Data: A Case Study of Zhengzhou City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately identifying and delineating urban boundaries are the premise for and foundation of the control of disorderly urban sprawl, which is helpful for us to accurately grasp the scale and form of cities, optimize the internal spatial structure and pattern of cities, and guide the expansion of urban spaces in the future. At present, the concept and delineation of urban boundaries do not follow a unified method or standard. However, many scholars have made use of multi-source remote sensing images of various scales and social auxiliary data such as point of interest (POI) data to achieve large-scale, high-resolution, and high-precision land cover mapping and impermeable water surface mapping. The accuracy of small- and medium-scale urban boundary mapping has not been improved to an obvious extent. This study uses multi-temporal Sentinel-2 high-resolution images and POI data that can reflect detailed features of human activities to extract multi-dimensional features and use random forests and mathematical morphology to map the urban boundaries of the city of Zhengzhou. The research results show that: (1) the urban construction land extraction model established with multi-dimensional features has a great improvement in accuracy; (2) when the training sample accounts for 65% of the sample data set, the urban construction land extraction model has the highest accuracy, reaching 96.25%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.93; (3) the optimized boundary of structural elements with a size of 13 x 13 is selected, which is in good agreement in terms of scope and location with the boundary of FROM-GLC10 (Zhengzhou) and visual interpretations. The results from the urban boundary delineation in this paper can be used as an important database for detailed basic land use mapping within cities. Moreover, the method in this paper has some reference value for other cities in terms of delineating urban boundaries.

TI  - Feasibility of Laser Communication Beacon Light Compressed Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Compressed Sensing (CS) camera can compress images in real time without consuming computing resources. Applying CS theory in the Laser Communication (LC) system can minimize the assumed transmission bandwidth (normally from a satellite to a ground station) and minimize the storage costs of beacon light-spot images; this can save more than ten times the typical bandwidth or storage space. However, the CS compressive process affects the light-spot tracking and key parameters in the images. In this study, we quantitatively explored the feasibility of the CS technique to capture light-spots in LC systems. We redesigned the measurement matrix to adapt to the requirement of light-tracking. We established a succinct structured deep network, the Compressed Sensing Denoising Center Net (CSD-Center Net) for denoising tracking computation from compressed image information. A series of simulations was made to test the performance of information preservation in beacon light spot image storage. With the consideration of CS ratio and application scenarios, coupled with CSD-Center Net and standard centroid, CS can achieve the tracking function well. The information preserved in compressed information correlates with the CS ratio; higher CS ratio can preserve more details. In fact, when the data rate is up than 10%, the accuracy could meet the requirements what we need in most application scenarios.

TI  - Mapping of glacial lakes using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and a random forest classifier: Strengths and challenges
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes pose a serious threat to downstream areas and significantly impact glacier melt. The number and area of lakes has grown in most regions during the last decades due to the ongoing atmospheric warming and retreating glaciers. It is therefore important to identify and monitor these lakes. However, mapping of glacial lakes in alpine regions is challenged by many factors. These factors include the small size of glacial lakes, cloud cover in optical satellite images, cast shadows from mountains and clouds, seasonal snow in satellite images, varying degrees of turbidity amongst glacial lakes, and frozen glacial lake surfaces. In our study, we have developed a fully automated method for mapping glacial lakes across alpine regions including the Python package called "GLakeMap". The method uses multi-source data such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument data, a digital elevation model, and a random forest classifier model. We use multi-source datasets as inputs for rule-based segmentation of images, mainly aiming at extracting glacial lake objects from satellite images using a set of rules. Segmented objects are then classified either as glacial lake or non-glacial lake objects by the random forest classifier model. The method was tested in eight sites across alpine regions mainly located in High Mountain Asia but also in the Alps and the Andes. We show that the proposed method overcomes a majority of the aforementioned challenges to detect and delineate glacial lakes. The method performs efficiently irrespective of geographic, geologic, and climatic conditions of glacial lakes.

M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Granulomatous mastitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown causes that forms a breast mass and may be difficult to distinguish from breast cancer on imaging studies. The patient was a woman in her 50's. Needle biopsy was performed for a mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast and revealed granulomatous mastitis. Breast magnetic resonance imaging showed that the tumor was malignant. Taking into account that there is a difference between histologic findings and imaging findings and that surgery after steroid therapy for granulomatous mastitis is more likely to cause complications, we decided to perform lumpectomy. The definitive pathological diagnosis was a triple negative, pT1cN0cM0 medullary carcinoma. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was performed. The absence of axillary lymph-node metastasis was confirmed by right axillary sentinel lymph-node biopsy. Radiotherapy was performed on the preserved breast region. Even if granulomatous mastitis is diagnosed, biopsy should be repeated while paying attention to biopsy methods if there is a difference between pathological findings and image findings.

TI  - Residential proximity to green space and preeclampsia in California
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We investigated whether residing near more green space might reduce the risk of preeclampsia.Methods: Participants were women who delivered a live, singleton birth between 1998 and 2011 in eight counties of the San Joaquin Valley in California. There were 7276 cases of preeclampsia divided into mild, severe, or superimposed on preexisting hypertension. Controls were 197,345 women who did not have a hypertensive disorder and delivered between 37 and 41 weeks. Green space was estimated from satellite data using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an index calculated from surface reflectance at the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Values closer to 1 denote a higher density of green vegetation. Average NDVI was calculated within a 50 m, 100 m, and 500 m buffer around each woman's residence. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated comparing the lowest and highest quartiles of mean NDVI to the interquartile range comparing each preeclampsia phenotype, divided into early (20-31 weeks) and late (32-36 weeks) preterm birth, to full-term controls.Results: We observed an inverse association in the 500 m buffer for women in the top quartile of NDVI and a positive association for women in the lowest quartile of NDVI for women with superimposed preeclampsia. There were no associations in the 50 and 100 m buffers.Conclusion: Within a 500 m buffer, more green space was inversely associated with superimposed preeclampsia. Future work should explore the mechanism by which green space may protect against preeclampsia.

TI  - Shallow water bathymetry with multi-spectral satellite ocean color sensors: Leveraging temporal variation in image data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar-orbiting ocean color satellites such as Landsat-8, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP), and Sentinel-3 offer valuable image data for the derivation of water bathymetry in optically shallow environments. Because of the multi-spectral limitation, however, it is challenging to derive bathymetry over global shallow waters without reliable mechanistic algorithms. In this contribution, we present and test a physics-based algo-rithm for improved retrieval of bathymetry with multi-spectral sensors. The algorithm leverages the temporal variation of water-column optical properties in two satellite measurements. By incorporating two remote sensing reflectance spectra in an optimization procedure, it enhances the spectral constraining condition for the optimization, thus leading to improved retrieval accuracy. This scheme is evaluated using synthetic multi-spectral data. It is shown that the new approach can provide accurate estimation of water depths over 0-30 m range with three types of benthic substrates (corals, seagrass, and sand) and for a wide range of water column optical properties. Based on the degree of improvement, Landsat-8 appears to be benefited the most, followed by SNPP, and then Sentinel-3. The application of the new approach is demonstrated with satellite images over shallow waters (0-30 m) dominated with coral reefs, seagrass, and sand, respectively. This proof-of-concept study confirms the promise of multi-spectral satellite sensors for accurate water depth retrieval by accounting for the temporal characteristics in multiple measurements, suggesting a path forward for the derivation of bathymetry from the existing satellites over global shallow waters.

TI  - Improving low-quality satellite remote sensing reflectance at blue bands over coastal and inland waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB  - The satellite remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)) at two short blue bands (410 or 412 nm and 443 nm) are prone to large uncertainties in coastal and inland waters, prohibiting algorithms from generating reliable ocean color products associated with these bands. In this study, we developed an algorithm to estimate Rrs(41x) and Rrs (443) when the satellite Rrs(lambda) in blue bands suffer from large uncertainties. The algorithm first determines the Rrs(lambda) spectral shape from the satellite-measured Rrs(lambda) values at three wavelengths of 48x (486, 488, or 490), 55x (547, 551, or 555), and 67x (667, 670, or 671) nm. The algorithm then derives Rrs(41x) and Rrs(443) from the estimated Rrs(lambda) spectral shape with algebraic formulations. We assessed the algorithm performance with satellite (SeaWiFS, MODISA, and VIIRS-SNPP) and in situ Rrs(lambda) matchups from global waters. It is shown that the uncertainties of estimated Rrs(41x) and Rrs(443) are substantially smaller than the original satellite products when applicable. Besides, implementation of the algorithm contributes to a significant increase in the number of utilizable Rrs(41x) and Rrs(443) values. The algorithm is relatively stable and is best applicable to the satellite Rrs(lambda) spectra for which the Rrs(48x) and Rrs(55x) measurements are subject to small uncertainties. The demonstrations support the application of the blue-band estimation algorithm to a wide range of coastal waters.

TI  - A Water Body Extraction Methods Comparison Based on FengYun Satellite Data: A Case Study of Poyang Lake Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body extraction can help eco-environmental policymakers to intuitively grasp surface water resources. Remote sensing technology can accurately and quickly extract surface water information, which is of great significance for monitoring surface water changes. Fengyun satellite images have the advantages of high time resolution and multispectral bands. This provides important image data suitable for high-frequency surface water monitoring. Based on Fengyun 3 medium resolution spectral imager (FY-3/MERSI) data, 7 methods were applied in this study, which include single-band threshold method, water body index method, knowledge decision tree classification method, supervised classification method, unsupervised classification method, spectral matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization (SMDPSO), and improved spectral matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization with linear feature enhancement (SMDPSO+LFE). These methods were used to extract the land surface water of Poyang Lake, check the samples from the Landsat image with similar times to the FY-3 images, and calculate the classification accuracy via the confusion matrix. The results showed that the overall classification accuracy (OA) of the SMDPSO+LFE is 97.64%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.95. To analyze the stability of the surface water extracted by SMDPSO+LFE in different regions, this paper selected eight test sites with different surface water types, landscapes, and terrains to extract surface water. Based on an analysis of the land surface water results at the eight test sites, every OA in the eight sites was higher than 94.5%, the Kappa coefficient was greater than 0.88. In conclusion, the SMDPSO+LFE is found to be the most suitable method among the 7 methods and effectively distinguish between different surface water bodies and backgrounds with good stability.

TI  - Remote sensing in urban planning: Contributions towards ecologically sound policies?
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has evolved to become a key tool for various fields of environmental analysis, thus actively informing policy across areas and domains. To evaluate the degree to which remote sensing is contributing to the science of ecologically-oriented urban planning, we carried out a systematic literature review using the SCOPUS database, searching for articles integrating knowledge in urban planning, remote sensing and ecology. We reviewed 186 articles, analysing various issues in urban environments worldwide. Key findings include that the level of integration between the three disciplines is limited, with only 12% of the papers fully integrating ecology, remote sensing and planning while 24% of the studies use specific methods from one domain only. The vast majority of studies is oriented towards contributing to the knowledge base or monitoring the impacts of existing policies. Few studies are directly policy relevant by either contributing to direct issues in planning and making specific design suggestions or evaluations. The accessibility of the scientific findings remains limited, as the majority of journal articles are not open access and proprietary software and data are frequently used. To overcome these issues, we suggest three future avenues for science as well as three potential entry points for remote sensing into applied urban planning. By doing so, remote sensing data could become a vital tool actively contributing to policies, civil engagement and concrete planning measures by providing independent and cost effective environmental analyses.

TI  - The effects of green nudges on consumer valuation of bio-based plastic packaging
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic packaging is widely associated with negative environmental consequences, which is why the food industry is increasingly interested in pro-environmental packaging alternativessuch as bio-based plastic. As the market share for bio-based plastic packaging is still small, strategies to raise consumer awareness and willingness to pay (WTP) are needed. This study integrates insights from environmental psychology and behavioral economics into choice models to assess which green nudges are most effective to increase consumer WTP for biobased packaging. We tested a total of four strategies by providing consumers with nature pictures, reflection questions, information on bio-based plastics and normative information. Using a sample of 1019 German consumers, our results indicate that the strongest effects are generated when the nudging strategy matches the characteristic of consumers' cognitive style. For example, providing nature pictures only seems to increase WTP for bio-based packaging when consumers base their decision on their emotions and intuition. On the other hand, the strategies that provide normative information and activate the reflection about environmental consequences of plastics are most effective for consumers who enjoy cognitive deliberation.

TI  - Active surveillance for acute respiratory infections among pediatric long-term care facility staff
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Transmission of respiratory viruses between staff and residents of pediatric long-term care facilities (pLTCFs) can occur. We assessed the feasibility of using text or email messages to perform surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among staff.Methods: From December 7, 2016 to May 7, 2017, 50 staff participants from 2 pLTCFs received weekly text or email requests to report the presence or absence of ARI symptoms. Those who fulfilled the ARI case definition (>= 2 symptoms) had respiratory specimens collected to detect viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. Pre- and postsurveillance respiratory specimens were collected to assess subclinical viral shedding.Results: The response rate to weekly electronic messages was 93%. Twenty-one ARIs reported from 20 (40%) participants fulfilled the case definition. Respiratory viruses were detected in 29% (5/17) of specimens collected at symptom onset (influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus [CoV] 229E, rhinovirus [RV], and dual detection of CoV OC43 and bocavirus). Four participants had positive presurveillance (4 RV), and 6 had positive postsurveillance specimens (3 RV, 2 CoV NL63, and 1 adenovirus).Conclusions: Electronic messaging to conduct ARI surveillance among pLTCF staff was feasible.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method for Mapping Glacial Lakes from the Combined Use of Synthetic-Aperture Radar and Optical Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes (GLs), a vital link between the hydrosphere and the cryosphere, participate in the local hydrological process, and their interannual dynamic evolution is an objective reflection and an indicator of regional climate change. The complex terrain and climatic conditions in mountainous areas where GLs are located make it difficult to employ conventional remote sensing observation means to obtain stable, accurate, and comprehensive observation data. In view of this situation, this study presents an algorithm with a high generalization ability established by optimizing and improving a deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation network model for extracting GL contours from combined synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) amplitude and multispectral imagery data. The aim is to use the high penetrability and all-weather advantages of SAR to reduce the effects of cloud cover as well as to integrate the multiscale and detail-oriented advantages of multispectral data to facilitate accurate, quantitative extraction of GL contours. The accuracy and reliability of the model and algorithm were examined by employing them to extract the contours of GLs in a large region of south-eastern Tibet from Landsat 8 optical remote sensing images and Sentinel-1A amplitude images. In this study, the contours of a total 8262 GLs in south-eastern Tibet were extracted. These GLs were distributed predominantly at altitudes of 4000-5500 m. Only 17.4% of these GLs were greater than 0.1 km(2) in size, while a large number of small GLs made up the majority. Through analysis and validation, the proposed method was found highly capable of distinguishing rivers and lakes and able to effectively reduce the misidentification and extraction of rivers. With the DL model based on combined optical and SAR images, the intersection-over-union (IoU) score increased by 0.0212 (to 0.6207) on the validation set and by 0.038 (to 0.6397) on the prediction set. These validation data sufficiently demonstrate the efficacy of the model and algorithm. The technical means employed in this study as well as the results and data obtained can provide a reference for research and application expansion in related fields.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Their Driving Factors in the Desert/Grassland Biome Transition Zone of the Sahel Region of Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological system of the desert/grassland biome transition zone is fragile and extremely sensitive to climate change and human activities. Analyzing the relationships between vegetation, climate factors (precipitation and temperature), and human activities in this zone can inform us about vegetation succession rules and driving mechanisms. Here, we used Landsat series images to study changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over this zone in the Sahel region of Africa. We selected 6315 sampling points for machine-learning training, across four types: desert, desert/grassland biome transition zone, grassland, and water bodies. We then extracted the range of the desert/grassland biome transition zone using the random forest method. We used Global Inventory Monitoring and Modelling Studies (GIMMS) data and the fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5) meteorological assimilation data to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of NDVI and climatic factors (temperature and precipitation). We used the multiple regression residual method to analyze the contributions of human activities and climate change to NDVI. The cellular automation (CA)-Markov model was used to predict the spatial position of the desert/grassland biome transition zone. From 1982 to 2015, the NDVI and temperature increased; no distinct trend was found for precipitation. The climate change and NDVI change trends both showed spatial stratified heterogeneity. Temperature and precipitation had a significant impact on NDVI in the desert/grassland biome transition zone; precipitation and NDVI were positively correlated, and temperature and NDVI were negatively correlated. Both human activities and climate factors influenced vegetation changes. The contribution rates of human activities and climate factors to the increase in vegetation were 97.7% and 48.1%, respectively. Human activities and climate factors together contributed 47.5% to this increase. The CA-Markov model predicted that the area of the desert/grassland biome transition zone in the Sahel region will expand northward and southward in the next 30 years.

TI  - Improved mask R-CNN-based cloud masking method for remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds lead to missing or distorted land-related information in impacted areas in optical remote sensing images. Cloud masking, which labels cloud-contaminated pixels, forms the basis for subsequent image utilization, such as excluding the distorted pixel or filling in the missing area. However, due to the diverse spectral, textural, and shape characteristics of different clouds and complicated combinations with the underlying land surfaces, cloud masking has become a challenge in remote sensing image processing. In recent years, the Mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) method, which performs instance segmentation from a complex background and generates a pixelwise mask for the object of interest, has been used widely in object segmentation tasks. When the Mask R-CNN method is used for cloud masking, the mask result has certain problems, such as failing to extract uncommon clouds and outputting inaccurate mask boundaries for large clouds. To address these problems, we introduce two strategies, group training and boundary optimization, to improve the Mask R-CNN. For group training, samples are divided into several groups. The samples in the first group are used for the initial training, and the samples in the next group are used for evaluation. Only samples with missing or falsely detected clouds are used for tuning the classifier; then, these processes are repeated until all groups have been used or the detection precision becomes stable. For boundary optimization, a block-by-block mask strategy is adopted to guarantee that clouds with diverse sizes have similar performances. Finally, two open data sets and one data set labelled by ourselves are selected to test the proposed method, and the results demonstrate that our method can produce cloud masks for different cloud types and diverse underlying land surfaces and can achieve high accuracies, thereby providing an effective alternative for cloud masking. Compared with the original Mask R-CNN method, our method improves the average recall, average precision, and intersection over union by 5.88%, 2.4%, and 0.071 in pixel level, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our improvement.

TI  - Epidemiology of imported infectious diseases, China, 2014-18
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The frequent movement of population between countries brings an increasing number of travel-related infections. This study aims to define the spectrum and dynamics of imported infections observed from international travel in the Chinese mainland.Methods: Sick travellers were screened by inbound sentinel surveillance and post-travel clinic visits from 2014 to 18. The infections were classified as respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood/sexually transmitted and mucocutaneous. The analysed variables included the place of origin of the travellers (Chinese or foreign) and the time when travel-related infection was present (at the time of return, during travel and post-travel visits to the clinic).Results: In total, 58 677 cases were identified amongst 1 409 265 253 travellers, with an incidence of 41.64/million, comprising during-travel incidence of 27.44/million and a post-travel incidence of 14.20/million. Respiratory infections constituted the highest proportion of illnesses during travel (81.19%, 31 393 of 38 667), which mainly came from Asian countries and tourists; with influenza virus and rhinovirus infections being mainly diagnosed. Vectorborne diseases constituted the highest proportion of post-travel illnesses (98.14%, 19 638 of 20 010), which were mainly diagnosed from African countries and labourers; with malaria and dengue fever being mainly diagnosed. The differential infection spectrum varied in terms of the traveller's demography, travel destination and travel purpose. As such, a higher proportion of foreign travellers had blood/sexually transmitted diseases (89.85%, 2832 of 3152), while Chinese citizens had a higher prevalence of vector-borne diseases (85.98%, 19 247 of 22 387) and gastrointestinal diseases (79.36%, 1115 of 1405). The highest incidence ratewas observed amongst travellers arriving from Africa, while the lowest was observed amongst travellers arriving from Europe.Conclusions: The findings might help in preparing recommendations for travellers and also aid in primary care or other clinics that prepare travellers before trips abroad. The findings will also help to identify locations and the associated types of infections that might require attention.

TI  - Development of CO<sub>2</sub> Band-Based Cloud Emission and Scattering Indices and Their Applications to FY-3D Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) onboard the Feng Yun-3D (FY-3D) satellite is the first Chinese hyperspectral infrared instrument. In this study, an improved cloud detection scheme using brightness temperature observations from paired HIRAS long-wave infrared (LWIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels at CO2 absorption bands (15-mu m and 4.3-mu m) is developed. The weighting function broadness and a set of height-dependent thresholds of cloud-sensitive-level differences are incorporated into pairing LWIR and SWIR channels. HIRAS brightness temperature observations made under clear-sky conditions during a training period are used to develop a set of linear regression equations between paired LWIR and SWIR channels. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud mask data are used for selecting HIRAS clear-sky observations. Cloud Emission and Scattering Indices (CESIs) are defined as the differences in SWIR channels between HIRAS observations and regression simulations from LWIR observations. The cloud retrieval products of ice cloud optical depth and cloud-top pressure from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed cloud detection scheme for FY-3D HIRAS observations. Results show that the distributions of modified CESIs at different altitudes can capture features in the distributions of AIRS-retrieved ice cloud optical depth and cloud-top pressure better than the CESIs obtained by the original method.

TI  - InSAR- and PIM-Based Inclined Goaf Determination for Illegal Mining Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The determination of the depth and boundary of the goaf is of great significance for the detection of illegal mining. However, determining the current location of unknown goafs mainly relies on low-efficiency, time-consuming, and labor-intensive physical detection methods such as geomagnetic field changes. Due to their large coverage and high degree of automation, research on remote sensing methods has been conducted to locate mining activities by monitoring surface deformation. This paper proposes a method that relies on the principle of the probability integration method (PIM) and on synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) to retrieve the location of an underground goaf. First, the relationship between ground subsidence and the location of the mined-out area was established according to PIM; then, the location of the mined-out area was obtained by the surface deformation acquired by InSAR. The proposed method does not rely on complex nonlinear models and has complete parameters; therefore, it has higher engineering application value. A test site in the Fengfeng mining area and 11 Radarsat-2 images were used to verify the proposed method. The experimental results showed that the average relative error of the proposed method is 6.35%, which is 27.56% higher than that of similar algorithms based on complex nonlinear models. Compared to algorithms that ignore the coal seam dip, the accuracy is improved to 98.27%.

TI  - Automatic extraction of aquaculture ponds based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture is one of China's fastest-growing animal food production sectors. It accounts for the largest share in the world, mainly distributed in coastal areas. Due to the depletion of offshore resources and increasing domestic demand for aquatic products, more and more land, including newly reclaimed land, is gradually being used to build aquaculture ponds. Understanding the location, spatial pattern, scale, and other properties is critical for China's food and protein security. However, until recently, how to detect, monitor and map the aquaculture ponds with remote sensing is still a problem, which hinders the understanding of its magnitude and value, and interferes sustainable management of coastal ecosystems. Here we proposed a framework for extracting aquaculture ponds by integrating existing multi-source remote sensing data on the Google Earth Engine platform. Taking Shanghai as a study area, the Multi-threshold Connected Component Segmentation and Random Forest algorithm method were used to extract aquaculture ponds automatically. The results show that this method can effectively generate the maps of Shanghai's aquaculture ponds from 2016 to 2019, and the overall accuracy of the classification results in 2018 can reach 91.8%. This method can greatly improve the efficiency of extracting aquaculture ponds, and has a good performance in detecting non-intensive aquaculture pond areas. It can also be easily used and has high spatio-temporal transferability with the help of the Google Earth Engine platform.

TI  - An LSWI-Based Method for Mapping Irrigated Areas in China Using Moderate-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial information about irrigation is crucial to a variety of applications, such as water resources management, water exchange between the land surface and atmosphere, climate change, hydrological cycle, food security, and agricultural planning. Our study proposes a new method for extracting cropland irrigation information using statistical data, mean annual precipitation and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover type data and surface reflectance data. The approach is based on comparing the land surface water index (LSWI) of cropland pixels to that of adjacent forest pixels with similar normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In our study, we validated the approach over mainland China with 612 reference samples (231 irrigated and 381 non-irrigated) and found the accuracy of 62.09%. Validation with statistical data also showed that our method explained 86.67 and 58.87% of the spatial variation in irrigated area at the provincial and prefecture levels, respectively. We further compared our new map to existing datasets of FAO/UF, IWMI, Zhu and statistical data, and found a good agreement with the irrigated area distribution from Zhu's dataset. Results show that our method is an effective method apply to mapping irrigated regions and monitoring their yearly changes. Because the method does not depend on training samples, it can be easily repeated to other regions.

TI  - Sentinel-2 red-edge spectral indices (RESI) suitability for mapping rubber boom in Luang Namtha Province, northern Lao PDR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) tree cultivation is being continuously expanded northward by replacing evergreen forests and swidden-related regenerated vegetation across the uplands of mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), e.g., Laos, a landlocked mountainous country. The non-native tree establishment in the northern tropical edge, or the non-traditional suitable planting area, provides stable supplies of natural latex, yet also leads to severe ecological degradation and environmental effects in water conservation, soil quality, rainforest fragmentation and biodiversity. Rubber plantations in the northern part of MSEA are normally characterized by periodic deciduous during the dry season, along with a lengthy defoliation-foliation duration, because of seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation. It thus lays a phenological and physiological base for dynamics monitoring with common multispectral (e.g., near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands) satellites, particularly Landsat. However, whether Sentinel-2 red-edge based algorithms are suitable for discriminating rubber plantations is not yet exclusively reported. Here, we developed a red-edge spectral indices (RESI) method through the normalization of three red-edge bands and applied it to identify and map rubber plantations in Luang Namtha Province of northern Laos, where a rubber boom begun in the mid-2000s. The RESI algorithm highlights the sensitivity of red-edge bands to the changes in moisture content and canopy density of rubber plantations. The area of mature rubber plantations was estimated to be 771.2 km(2) in this province bordering southwest China in 2018, which was nearly twice as much as that of 2011, with the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient up to 92.50% and 0.91, respectively. Our phenology-based RESI approach not only indicates that Sentinel-2 imagery holds significant potential for monitoring rubber plantations, but also improves the remotely-sensed methods of rubber boom mapping via introducing the red-edge channel.

TI  - Monitoring Spatiotemporal Evolution of Urban Heat Island Effect and Its Dynamic Response to Land Use/Land Cover Transition in 1987-2016 in Wuhan, China
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the relationship between the urban heat island (UHI) effect and land use/land cover (LULC) is of great significance in land use planning to adapt to climate change. However, the dynamic response of the UHI effect to LULC change over space and time has not been deeply studied. In this study, a transfer matrix method was carried out to monitor the class-to-class transitions between different LULC types, as well as those between different NLST (normalized land surface temperature) levels over space and time. The spatiotemporal correlation and dynamic coupling between UHI variation and LULC change from 1987 to 2016 were simulated based on multi-temporal remote sensing data in Wuhan, China. The results showed that high temperature (level V) and sub-high temperature (level IV) were mainly concentrated in construction land, while the majority of low temperature (level I) was distributed in water bodies. During the study period, the most notable changes were the rapid increase in construction land, as well as the continuous shrinkage of farmland and water bodies. The inward transfer of construction land was mainly from farmland and water bodies, with the transferred area of 218.3 km(2) (69.2%) and 78.9 km(2) (25.0%). These transitions were mainly responsible for the thermal deterioration in the study area. The transition of farmland to construction land contributed the most (66.3% and 81.6%) to thermal deterioration in the original medium temperature area (level III). The transition of water bodies to construction land was the main driving force in rapidly upgrading NLST level I into level IV (55.8%) and level V (58.6%). These findings provided detailed information for decision support in optimizing land use structure to fight against the thermal deterioration caused by urbanization.

TI  - Evaluations and comparisons of rule-based and machine-learning-based methods to retrieve satellite-based vegetation phenology using MODIS and USA National Phenology Network data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator that reflects the vegetation-atmosphere interactions and vegetation processes under global atmospheric changes. Fast-developing remote sensing technologies that monitor the land surface at high spatial and temporal resolutions have been widely used in vegetation phenology retrieval and analysis at a large scale. While researchers have developed many phenology retrieving methods based on remote sensing data, the relationships and differences among the phenology retrieving methods are unclear, and there is a lack of evaluation and comparison with the field phenology recoding data. In this study, we evaluated and compared eight phenology retrieving methods using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the USA National Phenology Network data from across North America. The studied phenology retrieving methods included six commonly used rule-based methods (i.e., amplitude threshold, the first-order derivative, the second-order derivative, the third-order derivative, the relative change curvature, and the curvature change rate) and two newly developed machine learning methods (i.e., neural network and random forest). At the large scale, the start of the season (SOS) values, derived by all methods, had similar spatial distributions; however, the retrieved values had large uncertainties in each pixel, and the end of the season (EOS) inverted values were largely different among methods. At the site scale, the SOS and EOS values extracted by the rule-based methods all had significant positive correlations with the field phenology observations. Among the rule-based methods, the amplitude threshold method performed the best. The machine learning methods outperformed the rule-based methods in terms of retrieving the SOS when assessed using the field observations. Our study highlighted that there were large differences among the methods in retrieving the vegetation phenology from satellite data and that researchers must be cautious in selecting an appropriate method for analyzing the satellite-retrieved phe-nology. Our results also demonstrated the importance of field phenology observations and the usefulness of the machine learning methods in understanding the satellite-based land surface phenology. These findings provide a valuable reference for the future development of global and regional phenology products.

TI  - Monitoring Annual Changes of Lake Water Levels and Volumes over 1984-2018 Using Landsat Imagery and ICESat-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With new Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat)-2 lidar (Light detection and ranging) datasets and classical Landsat imagery, a method was proposed to monitor annual changes of lake water levels and volumes for 35 years dated back to 1980s. Based on the proposed method, the annual water levels and volumes of Lake Mead in the USA over 1984-2018 were obtained using only two-year measurements of the ICESat-2 altimetry datasets and all available Landsat observations from 1984 to 2018. During the study period, the estimated annual water levels of Lake Mead agreed well with the in situ measurements, i.e., the R-2 and RMSE (Root-mean-square error) were 1.00 and 1.06 m, respectively, and the change rates of lake water levels calculated by our method and the in situ data were -1.36 km(3)/year and -1.29 km(3)/year, respectively. The annual water volumes of Lake Mead also agreed well with in situ measurements, i.e., the R-2 and RMSE were 1.00 and 0.36 km(3), respectively, and the change rates of lake water volumes calculated by our method and in situ data were -0.57 km(3)/year and -0.58 km(3)/year, respectively. We found that the ICESat-2 exhibits a great potential to accurately characterize the Earth's surface topography and can capture signal photons reflected from underwater bottoms up to approximately 10 m in Lake Mead. Using the ICESat-2 datasets with a global coverage and our method, accurately monitoring changes of annual water levels/volumes of lakes-which have good water qualities and experienced significant water level changes-is no longer limited by the time span of the available satellite altimetry datasets, and is potentially achievable over a long-term period.

TI  - Towards a comprehensive and consistent global aquatic land cover characterization framework addressing multiple user needs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Aquatic land cover represents the land cover type that is significantly influenced by the presence of water over an extensive part of a year. Monitoring global aquatic land cover types plays an essential role in preserving aquatic ecosystems and maintaining the ecosystem service they provide for humans, while at the same time their accurate and consistent monitoring for multiple purposes (e.g. climate modelling, biodiversity conservation, water resource management) remains challenging. Although a number of global aquatic land cover (GALC) datasets are available for use to monitor aquatic ecosystems, there are prominent variabilities among these datasets, which is primarily caused by the inconsistency between different land versus water-related monitoring approaches and character-ization schemes. As aquatic land cover exists in many different forms on Earth (e.g. wetland, open water) and can be mapped by different approaches, it is necessary to consider a much more consistent and comprehensive characterization framework that not only ensures the consistency in the monitoring of aquatic land cover but also serves the needs of multiple users (e.g. climate users, agricultural users) interested in different aspects of aquatic lands. In this study, we addressed this issue by 1) reviewing 33 GALC datasets and user needs identified from the citing papers of current datasets and international conventions, policies and agreements in relation to aquatic ecosystems, 2) proposing a global characterization framework for aquatic land cover based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classifier principles and the identified user needs, and 3) highlighting the opportunities and challenges provided by remote sensing techniques for the implementation of the proposed framework. Results show that users require or prefer various kinds of information on aquatic types including vegetation type, water persistence, the artificiality of cover (i.e. artificial vs natural), water salinity, and the accessibility to the sea (i.e. coastal vs inland). Datasets with medium to high spatial resolution, intra-annual dynamics and inter-annual changes are needed by many users. However, none of the existing datasets can meet all these requirements and a rigorous quantitative accuracy assessment is lacking to evaluate its quality for most of the GALC datasets. The proposed framework has three levels and users are allowed to derive their aquatic land cover types of interest by combining different levels and classifiers of information. This comprehensive mapping framework can help to bridge the gap between user needs and current GALC datasets as well as the gap between generic and aquatic land cover monitoring. The implementation of the framework can benefit from evolving satellite-data availability, improved computation capability and open-source machine learning algorithms, although at the same time it faces challenges mainly coming from the complexity of aquatic ecosystems. The framework proposed in this study provides insights for future operational aquatic land cover monitoring initiatives and will support better understanding and monitoring of complex aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Establishing a model to predict the single boll weight of cotton in northern Xinjiang by using high resolution UAV remote sensing data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Single boll weight is the main factor of cotton yield and a key index used to evaluate the quality of cotton. Predicting the single boll weight in a large area is important for variety selection and yield improvement. A model was established to predict the single boll weight by using the multitemporal high-resolution visible light remote sensing data obtained from UAV. Specifically, remote sensing data were collected for 29 fields in the Changji, Shihezi and Shawan areas in northern Xinjiang during the blooming period and boll opening stage. Five circular areas with a radius of 1 m were selected from each field as the ground investigation area for collection of the cotton boll samples. Fully convolutional networks (FCN) was used to recognize and extract bolls at the boll opening stage in the remote sensing images as a dependent variable of the model. Correlation analysis was carried out by combining VDVI (Visible-band difference vegetation index) at the flowering and boll setting stages, VDVI at boll opening stages, VDVI at boll opening areas (Extracted by FCN) and RGB mean values, then use the least squares linear regression and BP neural networks to model the upper, middle, lower cotton layers and average single boll weight in investigation area. Subsequently, K-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate the results. The results showed that the results of the least squares linear regression (R-2 = 0.8162) and BP neural networks (R-2 = 0.8170) were nearly equivalent. The percentage of boll opening in the area and VDVI at the flowering and boll setting stages were highly correlated with upper single boll weight. This study proposes a method to realize the large scale prediction of single boll weight, which provided a new idea for cotton yield prediction and breeding screening.

TI  - Reliability Analysis of Shield Tunnel Lining in Service with Field Inspection
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Under long-term service, shield tunnel linings are prone to diseases such as bolt corrosion, reinforcement corrosion, and cracks; therefore reliability analysis of tunnel linings is significant for overall tunnel stability. This study aimed at developing a reliability analysis method for the bearing capacity of shield tunnel linings in service. Six failure modes of tunnel linings, related to the concrete structure, reinforcement structure, concrete joints, and joint bolts (inner-row bolts and outer-row bolts), are highlighted, and the performance functions of tunnel linings are established according to the failure modes. In this study, the joint structure was treated as a continuous heterogeneous beam in order to simplify the calculation of bolt tension and concrete stress of joints connected with double-row bolts by satisfying the equilibrium of internal force and coordination of deformation. In addition, a field inspection method for lining structure deterioration parameters and a method for calculating the mechanical parameters of deteriorated concrete and reinforcement are elaborated. Because shield tunnel linings suffer from eccentric loads, a Monte Carlo sampling method was used to calculate the probability of a full and partial section compressed condition. The first order reliability method (FORM) (JC method) program was compiled by MATLAB version R2018b to calculate the reliability index of tunnel lining structures; furthermore, sensitivity analysis of random variables was included. The proposed method was verified using inspection data from the Shanghai Dapulu Tunnel. The results showed that the minimum comprehensive reliability index was 2.46 (section 90 degrees) and the maximum comprehensive reliability index was 8.33 (section 40 degrees). The reliability of joint sections was more sensitive to fc, k0, Ab2, gamma, whereas structure sections were more sensitive to k0, fy, fc, As, As ', gamma.

TI  - Assessment of Landsat atmospheric correction methods for water color applications using global AERONET-OC data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the longest archive of satellite remote sensing images, the Landsat series of satellites have demonstrated their great potential in aquatic environmental studies. However, although various atmospheric correction (AC) methods have been developed for Landsat observations in water color applications, a comprehensive assessment of their accuracies across different AC methods and instruments has yet to be performed. Using in situ spectral data collected by Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) sites, the performances of five types of AC methods over three different Landsat missions (i.e., Landsat 5/7/8) were evaluated. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) showed more accurate AC retrievals than the other two instruments, and the results for its green and red bands appeared more reliable than those for the other wavelengths (uncertainty levels of similar to 30 %). The iterative NIR algorithm with 2-bands (NIR-SWIR2) model selection embedded in SeaDAS showed the best performances for OLI in two blue bands. Moreover, larger residual errors were found for most Landsat 5/7 bands regardless of the AC methods and spectral bands employed with an uncertainty of > 50 %. Interestingly, a simple aerosol subtraction method over the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) outperformed the exponential extrapolation (EXP) algorithms, especially for Landsat 5/7. Neither the image-based AC algorithm nor the surface reflectance (SR) products provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) showed acceptable performances over coastal environments. The uncertainties in the various Landsat reflectance products over water surfaces could be associated with a relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in addition to radiometric calibration uncertainties, imperfect aerosol removal methods. Future research is required to collect in situ data across a wider range of water optical properties (particularly more turbid inland waters) to examine the corresponding applicability of Landsat-series observations.

TI  - Detecting Harvest Events in Plantation Forest Using Sentinel-1 and-2 Data via Google Earth Engine
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - South Africa is reported to experience timber shortages as a result of growing timber demands and pulp production, coupled with the government's reluctance to grant new forestry permits. Rampant timber theft in the country makes these circumstances worse. The emergence of cloud-based platforms, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), has greatly improved the accessibility and usability of high spatial and temporal Sentinel-1 and -2 data, especially in data-poor countries that lack high-performance computing systems for forest monitoring. Here, we demonstrate the potential of these resources for forest harvest detection. The results showed that Sentinel-1 data are efficient in detecting clear-cut events; both VH and VV backscatter signals decline sharply in accordance with clear-cutting and increase again when forest biomass increases. When correlated with highly responsive NDII, the VH and VV signals reached the best accuracies of 0.79 and 0.83, whereas the SWIR1 achieved -0.91. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm based on Sentinel-2 data also achieved over 90% accuracies for classifying harvested and forested areas. Overall, our study presents a cost-effective method for mapping clear-cut events in an economically important forestry area of South Africa while using GEE resources.

AB  - Endometrial cancer(EC)is often the sentinel cancer in women with Lynch syndrome(LS), but the actual incidence of EC as the sentinel cancer in patients with LS is not well-known in Japan. We investigated the history of malignancies and incidence of sentinel cancers in patients with LS-associated EC and their relatives. We examined 8 patients with LS-associated EC between 2005 and 2019. Five of them(63%)had suffered from a cancer other than EC, while 5(63%)had developed a cancer after EC. Seven patients(88%)had EC as the sentinel cancer, while 1(13%)developed colorectal cancer before EC. Among first-degree relatives(15 men and 23 women), 15(40%)had a history of cancer, of whom 7 were women (30%). Five women(22%)had EC, all sentinel. Among second-degree relatives(40 men, 44 women, 14 unknown), 16 (16%)had cancer. Four women(9%)had a history of cancer, of whom 2(5%)had EC, all sentinel. Although we only investigated a few LS cases, the importance of EC as the sentinel cancer was highlighted in Japanese women with LS.

AB  - A 69-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with the lump in the left breast. Further examination was performed for the lesion, and it was diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma. Partial resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Pathological diagnosis was metaplastic carcinoma with squamous metaplasia. As the adjuvant treatment, docetaxel and cyclophosphamide(TC)therapy and radiotherapy was performed. Following the treatment of those, tegafur-uracil was administered for 2 years. Three years after the surgery, an isolated lung metastasis was revealed by CT. Capecitabine and cyclophosphamide(XC)therapy was administered, but not effective. Stereotactic body radiation therapy(SBRT)was performed for the lesion. As a result, the metastatic lesion was obscured. Drug therapy was stopped due to adverse events, and she is observed by no medication. Thirty-six months after SBRT and 78 months after the surgery, the patient is alive without recurrence. SBRT could be an effective treatment strategy for the oligometastais of the lung.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests and agricultural lands are the main resources on the earth's surface and important indicators of regional ecological environments. In this paper, Landsat images from 1990 and 2017 were used to extract information on forests in Malaysia based on a remote-sensing classification method. The spatial-temporal changes of forests and agricultural lands in Malaysia between 1990 and 2017 were analyzed. The results showed that the natural forests in Malaysia decreased by 441 Mha, a reduction of 21%. The natural forests were mainly converted into plantations in Peninsular Malaysia and plantations and secondary forests in East Malaysia. The area of agricultural lands in Malaysia increased by 55.7%, in which paddy fields increased by 1.1% and plantations increased by 98.2%. Paddy fields in Peninsular Malaysia are mainly distributed in the north-central coast and the Kelantan Delta. The agricultural land in East Malaysia is dominated by plantations, which are mainly distributed in coastal areas. The predictable areas of possible expansion for paddy fields in Peninsular Malaysia's Kelantan (45.2%) and Kedah (16.8%) areas in the future are large, and in addition, the plantations in Sarawak (44.7%) and Sabah (29.6%) of East Malaysia have large areas for expansion. The contradiction between agricultural development and protecting the ecological environment is increasingly prominent. The demand for agriculture is expected to increase further and result in greater pressures on tropical forests. Governments also need to encourage farmers to carry out existing land development, land recultivation, or cooperative development to improve agricultural efficiency and reduce the damage to natural forests.

TI  - Polarization of Light Reflected by Grass: Modeling Using Visible-Sunlit Areas
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bidirectional polarization distribution function (BPDF) of land surfaces is important for studies of land surfaces and aerosol. With the availability of a huge number of polarization measurements, several semi-empirical BPDF models have been proposed. However, these models do not pay much attention to canopy structure, which is fundamental for generation of polarization. In this article, we propose a new BPDF model using canopy structure information, which is parameterized by visible-sunlit areas. It is evaluated over grassland using POLDER BPDF and MOWS leaf area index data sets. Experiments suggest that compared to Nadal-Braun and Litvinov models, the new BITE model reduces root-mean-square error by 7% and 10%, respectively. The new BPDF model also provides better performance when it is fitted using observations clustered by sun zenith angle. The new BPDF model thus provides an effective tool for the study of land surface polarization.

TI  - Exploring the Dynamics of Urban Greenness Space and Their Driving Factors Using Geographically Weighted Regression: A Case Study in Wuhan Metropolis, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban greenness plays a vital role in supporting the ecosystem services of a city. Exploring the dynamics of urban greenness space and their driving forces can provide valuable information for making solid urban planning policies. This study aims to investigate the dynamics of urban greenness space patterns through landscape indices and to apply geographically weighted regression (GWR) to map the spatially varied impact on the indices from economic and environmental factors. Two typical landscape indices, i.e., percentage of landscape (PLAND) and aggregation index (AI), which measure the abundance and fragmentation of urban greenness coverage, respectively, were taken to map the changes in urban greenness. As a case study, the metropolis of Wuhan, China was selected, where time-series of urban greenness space were extracted at an annual step from the Landsat collections from Google Earth Engine during 2000-2018. The study shows that the urban greenness space not only decreased significantly, but also tended to be more fragmented over the years. Road network density, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), terrain elevation and slope, and precipitation were found to significantly correlate to the landscape indices. GWR modeling successfully captures the spatially varied impact from the considered factors and the results from GWR modeling provide a critical reference for making location-specific urban planning.

TI  - The 2019 M<sub>w</sub> 5.9 Torkaman chay earthquake in Bozgush mountain, NW Iran: A buried strike-slip event related to the sinistral Shalgun-Yelimsi fault revealed by InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 7 November 2019, an M-w 5.9 earthquake with a left-lateral strike-slip mechanism struck the Bozgush mountain in NW Iran, marking the largest event in the mountain area in the past 44 years. Because no surface rupture associated with the earthquake has been reported, the causative fault of the earthquake is unknown. This event provides an opportunity to gain insight into the active tectonics of the region. Here, we acquire the coseismic deformation associated with this earthquake through Sentinel-1A interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and further invert the fault geometry and the detailed coseismic slip of this event based on the planar fault model. By a joint analysis of the inversion results, aftershocks sequence and local tectonics, we propose that the buried branch fault splaying from the Shalgun-Yelimsi fault (SYF) at depth may be responsible for this earthquake. Both the uniform and distributed slip models infer a smaller fault rupture size than predicted by classical fault scaling relation. We suggest that the subsurface fault geometry of the SYF may stop the rupture propagation further down to southeast at depth, thus resulting in high slip and stress drop at such a small fault plane. Considering the proximity of the epicenter to the SYF, we also invert for the distributed slip model on an anti-listric fault with the purpose to explore the possible complexity of rupture fault. However, due to the lack of obvious improvement to fit the observed data and the limited slip in the deep fault segment, the planar fault model is still regarded as the optimal one. According to the calculated coseismic Coulomb stress changes, we find that 55 % of aftershocks are triggered by the statics stress and that the northern segment of SYF and the eastern segment of SBF have a potential rupture risk. The occurrence of this earthquake, together with the prominent offset feature and slip style of surrounding active fault, indicates an active conjugate fault system, which may accommodate the small-scale northeastward lateral extrusion.

TI  - Optimizing local climate zones to mitigate urban heat island effect in human settlements
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has caused radical changes in urban climates. As a result, issues related to urban thermal environments have become more prominent. Finding a balance between urban expansion and thermal environment quality is key to ensuring sustainable urban development. Taking Dalian City (China) as an example, we used multi-source datasets, including Luojia1-01 nighttime light imagery, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and building vector data, to analyze the thermal characteristics of different local climate zones (LCZs). Additionally, the LCZ combination mode with the lowest heat island effect intensity in the human settlements was also investigated. The results showed that the human settlements covered an area of 351.976 km(2), with 33.476% corresponding to building LCZs (LCZ1-10) and 66.524% to natural LCZs (LCZA-G). The different LCZs had different thermal environment characteristics, and the UHIA values for the building LCZs were significantly higher than those of the natural LCZs. Additionally, for the building LCZs, the UHIA values for compact building LCZs (LCZ 1-3) were also significantly higher than those for open and spare building LCZs. With the current settlement area and population size, the most appropriate LCZ layout model for the study area was LCZ5 + LCZ6 + (LCZ7+LCZ8+LCZA + LCZC + LCZD + LCZE + LCZG), which had areas 28.585, 57.170, 57.170, 28.585, 54.236, 54.236, and 54.236 km(2), respectively. This layout model had the smallest UHIA value (11.654 degrees C), and urban planning according to the above ratio can alleviate the UHI effect in different cities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Reconstruction of High-Temporal- and High-Spatial-Resolution Reflectance Datasets Using Difference Construction and Bayesian Unmixing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-temporal- and high-spatial-resolution reflectance datasets play a vital role in monitoring dynamic changes at the Earth's land surface. So far, many sensors have been designed with a trade-off between swath width and pixel size; thus, it is difficult to obtain reflectance data with both high spatial resolution and frequent coverage from a single sensor. In this study, we propose a new Reflectance Bayesian Spatiotemporal Fusion Model (Ref-BSFM) using Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance, which is then used to construct reflectance datasets with high spatiotemporal resolution and a long time series. By comparing this model with other popular reconstruction methods (the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Model, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, and the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model), we demonstrate that our approach has the following advantages: (1) higher prediction accuracy, (2) effective treatment of cloud coverage, (3) insensitivity to the time span of data acquisition, (4) capture of temporal change information, and (5) higher retention of spatial details and inconspicuous MODIS patches. Reflectance time-series datasets generated by Ref-BSFM can be used to calculate a variety of remote-sensing-based vegetation indices, providing an important data source for land surface dynamic monitoring.

TI  - Impact of Meteorological Changes on Particulate Matter and Aerosol Optical Depth in Seoul during the Months of June over Recent Decades
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of meteorological changes on particulate matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10, referred to as PM in this study) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Seoul were investigated using observational and modeling analysis. AOD satellite data were used, obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and PM concentration data were used from in-situ observations. The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and MERRA Version 2 (MERRA-2) were used for meteorological field analysis in modeling and observation data. The results from this investigation show that meteorological effects on PM and AOD were strong in the month of June, revealing a clear decreasing trend in recent decades. The investigation focused on the underlying mechanisms influencing the reduction in PM resulting from meteorological changes during the months of June. The results of this study reveal that decreases in atmospheric stability and humidity induced the aerosol change observed in recent decades. The changes in atmospheric stability and humidity are highly correlated with changes in the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). This suggests that the unstable and drying atmosphere by weakening of the EASM in recent decades has improved PM air quality in Seoul during the summer. The effects of atmospheric stability and humidity were also observed to vary depending on the aerosol species. Humidity only affects hydrophilic aerosols such as sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium, whereas atmospheric stability affects all species of aerosols, including carbonaceous aerosols.

TI  - An Ongoing Blended Long-Term Vegetation Health Product for Monitoring Global Food Security
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Remotely observing global vegetation from space has endured for nearly 50 years. Many datasets have been developed to monitor vegetation status. Tailored to specifically monitor global food security concerning drought and crop yield, a suite of datasets based on vegetation health concepts and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observation was developed in the 1980s and utilized throughout the world. Nowadays, satellites based imaging radiometers have evolved into the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) era. With proper algorithm development, the blended version of the data suite, composed of the AVHRR dataset from 1981 to 2012 and VIIRS dataset from 2013 and afterwards, has bridged the long-term AVHRR observation and high-quality VIIRS data. This paper explains the blended version of the data suite.

TI  - Combined Effects of Impervious Surface Change and Large-Scale Afforestation on the Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity of Beijing, China Based on Remote Sensing Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) attenuation is an essential aspect for maintaining environmental sustainability at a local, regional, and global scale. Although impervious surfaces (IS) and green spaces have been confirmed to have a dominant effect on the spatial differentiation of the urban land surface temperature (LST), comprehensive temporal and quantitative analysis of their combined effects on LST and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) changes is still partly lacking. This study took the plain area of Beijing, China as an example. Here, rapid urbanization and a large-scale afforestation project have caused distinct IS and vegetation cover changes within a small range of years. Based on 8 scenes of Landsat 5 TM/7ETM/8OLI images (30 m x 30 m spatial resolution), 920 scenes of EOS-Aqua-MODIS LST images (1 km x 1 km spatial resolution), and other data/information collected by different approaches, this study characterized the interrelationship of the impervious surface area (ISA) dynamic, forest cover increase, and LST and SUHII changes in Beijing's plain area during 2009-2018. An innovative controlled regression analysis and scenario prediction method was used to identify the contribution of ISA change and afforestation to SUHII changes. The results showed that percent ISA and forest cover increased by 6.6 and 10.0, respectively, during 2009-2018. SUHIIs had significant rising tendencies during the decade, according to the time division of warm season days (summer days included) and cold season nights (winter nights included). LST changes during warm season days responded positively to a regionalized ISA increase and negatively to a regionalized forest cover increase. However, during cold season nights, LST changes responded negatively to a slight regionalized ISA increase, but positively to an extensive regionalized ISA increase, and LST variations responded negatively to a regionalized forest cover increase. The effect of vegetation cooling was weaker than ISA warming on warm season days, but the effect of vegetation cooling was similar to that of ISA during cold season nights. When it was assumed that LST variations were only caused by the combined effects of ISA changes and the planting project, it was found that 82.9% of the SUHII rise on warm season days (and 73.6% on summer days) was induced by the planting project, while 80.6% of the SUHII increase during cold season nights (and 78.9% during winter nights) was caused by ISA change. The study presents novel insights on UHI alleviation concerning IS and green space planning, e.g., the importance of the joint planning of IS and green spaces, season-oriented UHI mitigation, and considering the thresholds of regional IS expansion in relation to LST changes.

TI  - Cocoa Production and Forest Dynamics in Ivory Coast from 1985 to 2019
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The cocoa economy of Ivory Coast started in the eastern part of the country in the 1970s and spread to the central-western and then south-western regions. For nearly a decade, it has been in the West of Ivory Coast with a population increase caused by large waves of migration. This study aims to determine different factors explaining dynamics of the cocoa economy from the East to West of Ivory Coast. The method adopted consisted of processing Landsat images from 1985-2018 and an individual survey of 278 heads of households. The results obtained showed that the development of the cocoa economy led forest cover degradation with a total loss estimated at 60.80%, 46.39%, 20.76% and 51.18% of forest area in the East, Centre-West, South-West and West, respectively. The creation of new cocoa farms in the West of Ivory Coast is governed by non-native people (51.13%) settled between 2010 and 2018. About 41% of these producers come mainly from the Centre-West (25%) and the South-West (16%). In addition, 29% of producers come from the West of Ivory Coast. Despite the abiotic characteristics being considered unfavourable, the west of Ivory Coast is in the process of becoming the country's new zone of high cocoa production.

TI  - Coastline extraction and land use change analysis using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology - A review of the literature
T2  - REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastlines mapping techniques or the coastline automated analyses have been sought after. In practice, various sorts of seacoasts, for example, biological, silty, arenaceous, artificial, and bedrock coasts, have their own attributes, which force various degrees of intricacy on coastline mapping. As an extraordinary kind of complex artificial coast, aquaculture coast is shaped by the farming of aquatic organisms on silt tidal flats. With the rapid growth of coastal aquaculture in recent years, aquaculture coasts have increased in some developing countries. It has been estimated that aquaculture coasts constitute about 30% of all coastlines in mainland China. In order to identify, monitor, model, and manage the vast expanse of coastal aquaculture, effective methods of extracting aquaculture coastlines from remotely sensed imagery are desired. Secondly, with the rapid economic development in coastal areas, the development of coastal zone resources is also increasing day by day, which benefits the development of island coastal zone. Using oneself has become an important link in the development of marine economy. Due to the limited coastal resources and low environmental carrying capacity, the overexploitation and utilization of coastal resources will lead to a series of problems, such as coastal erosion, coastal migration and accumulation, island area reduction, etc., Both man-made activities and natural factors will lead to coastline changes, which will lead to corresponding changes in coastal ecological environment, thus affecting the coordinated development of coastal economy and the survival of coastal residents. Therefore, efficient, accurate and timely acquisition of coastline information and research on the spatial-temporal changes of coastline are of great significance to the protection of the living environment of coastal residents, the effective development of island and coastal resources, the coordination of sustainable economic development in coastal areas and the mitigation of marine disasters. This paper presents a review of those papers reporting coastline extraction and land use and land cover (LULC) change analysis using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology.

TI  - Application of Lithological Mapping Based on Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI) Imagery Onboard Gaofen-5 (GF-5) Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI), carried by the Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite, is the first hyperspectral sensor that simultaneously offers broad coverage and a broad spectrum. Meanwhile, deep-learning-based approaches are emerging to manage the growing volume of data produced by satellites. However, the application potential of GF-5 AHSI imagery in lithological mapping using deep-learning-based methods is currently unknown. This paper assessed GF-5 AHSI imagery for lithological mapping in comparison with Shortwave Infrared Airborne Spectrographic Imager (SASI) data. A multi-scale 3D deep convolutional neural network (M3D-DCNN), a hybrid spectral CNN (HybridSN), and a spectral-spatial unified network (SSUN) were selected to verify the applicability and stability of deep-learning-based methods through comparison with support vector machine (SVM) based on six datasets constructed by GF-5 AHSI, Sentinel-2A, and SASI imagery. The results show that all methods produce classification results with accuracy greater than 90% on all datasets, and M3D-DCNN is both more accurate and more stable. It can produce especially encouraging results by just using the short-wave infrared wavelength subset (SWIR bands) of GF-5 AHSI data. Accordingly, GF-5 AHSI imagery could provide impressive results and its SWIR bands have a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which meets the requirements of large-scale and large-area lithological mapping. And M3D-DCNN method is recommended for use in lithological mapping based on GF-5 AHSI hyperspectral data.

TI  - Crop Classification Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data in the Shiyang River Basin of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate crop classification is of enormous significance for agriculture management. The Shiyang River Basin, an inland river basin, is one of the most prominent water resource shortage regions with intensive agriculture activities in northwestern China. However, a free crop map with high spatial resolution is not available in the Shiyang River Basin. The European Space Agency (ESA) satellite Sentinel-2 has multi-spectral bands ranging in the visible-red edge-near infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-RE-NIR-SWIR) spectrum. Understanding the impact of spectral-temporal information on crop classification is helpful for users to select optimized spectral bands combinations and temporal window in crop mapping when using Sentinel-2 data. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data acquired in the growing season in 2019 were applied to the random forest algorithm to generate the crop classification map at 10 m spatial resolution for the Shiyang River Basin. Four experiments with different combinations of feature sets were carried out to explore which Sentinel-2 information was more effective for higher crop classification accuracy. The results showed that the augment of multi-spectral and multi-temporal information of Sentinel-2 improved the accuracy of crop classification remarkably, and the improvement was firmly related to strategies of feature selections. Compared with other bands, red-edge band 1 (RE-1) and shortwave-infrared band 1 (SWIR-1) of Sentinel-2 showed a higher competence in crop classification. The combined application of images in the early, middle and late crop growth stage is significant for achieving optimal performance. A relatively accurate classification (overall accuracy = 0.94) was obtained by utilizing the pivotal spectral bands and dates of image. In addition, a crop map with a satisfied accuracy (overall accuracy > 0.9) could be generated as early as late July. This study gave an inspiration in selecting targeted spectral bands and period of images for acquiring more accurate and timelier crop map. The proposed method could be transferred to other arid areas with similar agriculture structure and crop phenology.

TI  - Topographic Correction for Landsat 8 OLI Vegetation Reflectances Through Path Length Correction: A Comparison Between Explicit and Implicit Methods
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic correction is a prerequisite for generating radiometrically consistent Landsat 8 OLI vegetation reflectances in support of temporally continuous and spatially mosaicked applications. Path length correction (PLC) is a physically solid topographic correction method that avoids the involvement of any empirical parameter and is therefore suitable for reproducing the inherent reflectance of vegetation. This article compared two different implementation pathways of PLC, i.e., the explicit method (EM) and the implicit method (IM), which are based on the numerical inverse and analytical approximation of the PLC model, respectively. The results show that both EM and IM can obviously reduce the topographic effects on Landsat 8 OLI vegetation reflectances. EM performed slightly better than IM in eliminating the correlation between the topographic characteristics and the vegetation reflectances: the coefficient of determination between the green/red/near-infrared (Nir) band reflectance and the local illumination was reduced from 0.257/0.148/0.467 for the uncorrected (UNCORR) case to 0.016/0.004/0.012 and 0.027/0.014/0.094 for the EM and IM corrected results, respectively. The coefficient of variation of the three band reflectances across different aspects was reduced from 16.5%/18.5%/18.7% for the UNCORR case to 3.2%/1.8%/0.9% and 5.3%/7.1%/7.3% for the EM and IM corrected results, respectively. In addition, the intraclass reflectance variability was also reduced after both the EM and IM corrections. Nevertheless, due to the ill-posed nature of the numerical inverse process, EM cannot fully reproduce the inherent vegetation reflectances, and the reflectances after topographic correction overestimated the inherent vegetation values. In contrast, the IM can achieve an appropriate tradeoff between topographic effect elimination and vegetation inherent reflectance preservation. In addition, IM is computationally very efficient compared to EM: using an ordinary laptop, IM can finish the topographic correction for a Landsat OLI image within several seconds, while this would take more than 20 h for EM. This article highlights the potential of using IM for generating radiometrically consistent Landsat 8 OLI vegetation reflectances.

TI  - Biomass burning spatiotemporal variations over South and Southeast Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer active fire and land use products were integrated to extract and classify biomass burning (BB) data for South Asia (SA) and Southeast Asia (SEA). Several trend and geographic distribution analyses were conducted at the grid (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) and regional scales. As the principal local form of BB, crop residue burning (CRB) in SA increased by 844 spots/yr, and the Mann-Kendall (MK) tau reached 0.61. Additionally, the CRB in Punjab-Haryana, a region a well-known for severest CRB, presented a significant declining trend. BB in mainland SEA was much more intense and was dominated by forest and shrubland fires. Forest fires in mainland SEA declined at a rate of -209 spots/yr, and shrubland fire conversely grew at a rate of 803 spots/yr, which was likely related to the dramatic land cover change induced by the local swidden agriculture. Unlike other regions, BB in equatorial SEA primarily occurred in the second half of the year (August to October), and it was extremely vulnerable to El Nino events. When the annual sea surface temperature anomalies within the Nino 3 region improved by 1 degrees C, the annual BB spots and fire radiative power in equatorial SEA increased by 5.18 x 10(4) and 2.40 x 10(6) MW, respectively. Although the interannual variations in equatorial SEA were dramatic, the robust Siegel's repeated median estimator still revealed that equatorial SEA BB significantly declined by -1825 spots/yr. This regional decline reflects government endeavors to curb indigenous BB. However, regions with enhanced BB still need to draw more attention, and it is imperative for the Indonesian government to take substantial measures to reduce anthropogenic fire sources during El Nino events.

TI  - Cloud detection in Landsat-8 imagery in Google Earth Engine based on a deep convolutional neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a convenient platform for applications based on optical satellite imagery of large areas. With such data sets, the detection of cloud is often a necessary prerequisite step. Recently, deep learning-based cloud detection methods have shown their potential for cloud detection but they can only be applied locally, leading to inefficient data downloading time and storage problems. This letter proposes a method to directly perform cloud detection in Landsat-8 imagery in GEE based on deep learning (DeepGEE-CD). A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was first trained locally, and then the trained DCNN was deployed in the JavaScript client of GEE. An experiment was undertaken to validate the proposed method with a set of Landsat-8 images and the results show that DeepGEE-CD outperformed the widely used function of mask (Fmask) algorithm. The proposed DeepGEE-CD approach can accurately detect cloud in Landsat-8 imagery without downloading it, making it a promising method for routine cloud detection of Landsat-8 imagery in GEE.

TI  - The Component-Spectra-Parameterized Angular and Spectral Kernel-Driven Model: A Potential Solution for Global BRDF/Albedo Retrieval From Multisensor Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The angular and spectral kernel-driven (ASK) model distinguishes soil and vegetation spectral features by the component spectra and is a promising model which combines multisensor data for inversion. However, its global application is limited by the component spectra. This article proposes parameterization of the ASK component spectra of soil and leaf from global spectra libraries as ANGERS, GOSPEL, LOPEX, and USGS. A statistical ratio (gamma) of various leaf to soil spectra is used to capture their spectral differences and variations, with mean (m) + u (0, +/- 0.5, +/- 1) standard deviations (sigma) [i.e., gamma (m+u sigma)]. Optimization inversion is applied to determine the ratio candidates gamma (m + u sigma), allowing more tolerance for spectral uncertainty, which releases the semiempirical nature of the kernel-driven model. Simulation data analysis proves its feasibility and good capture of vegetation-soil spectral differences. The model's bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) fitting error [root-mean-square error (RMSE)] of 0.0245 is slightly larger than the true component spectra of 0.0178, and albedo RMSE is 0.0116 in Black Sky Albedo and 0.0182 in White Sky Albedo. The result also shows its good robustness to the noises, where the level up to 20% noise conducts a 0.0277 error in BRF fitting and an ignorable influence in albedo. The synergistic-retrieved albedo from multisensor satellite data consists of in situ measurements with an RMSE of 0.0171, compared to 0.0131 from true component spectra retrievals. The new parameterization sacrifices some accuracy, but it is simple and operational for global retrieval with a satisfactory precision.

TI  - Evaluation of the DCT-PLS Method for Spatial Gap Filling of Gridded Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long time-series gridded data is crucial for the analyses of Earth environmental changes. Climate reanalysis and satellite images are now used as global-scale periodical and quantitative information for the atmosphere and land surface. This paper examines the feasibility of DCT-PLS (penalized least square regression based on discrete cosine transform) for the spatial gap filling of gridded data through the experiments for multiple variables. Because gap-free data is required for an objective comparison of original with gap-filled data, we used LDAPS (Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System) daily data and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) monthly products. In the experiments for relative humidity, wind speed, LST (land surface temperature), and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), we made sure that randomly generated gaps were retrieved very similar to the original data. The correlation coefficients were over 0.95 for the four variables. Because the DCT-PLS method does not require ancillary data and can refer to both spatial and temporal information with a fast computation, it can be applied to operative systems for satellite data processing.

TI  - A Novel Approach to Modelling Mangrove Phenology from Satellite Images: A Case Study from Northern Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Around the world, the effects of changing plant phenology are evident in many ways: from earlier and longer growing seasons to altering the relationships between plants and their natural pollinators. Plant phenology is often monitored using satellite images and parametric methods. Parametric methods assume that ecosystems have unimodal phenologies and that the phenology model is invariant through space and time. In evergreen ecosystems such as mangrove forests, these assumptions may not hold true. Here we present a novel, data-driven approach to extract plant phenology from Landsat imagery using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Using GAMs, we created models for six different mangrove forests across Australia. In contrast to parametric methods, GAMs let the data define the shape of the phenological curve, hence showing the unique characteristics of each study site. We found that the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) model is related to leaf production rate (from in situ data), leaf gain and net leaf production (from the published literature). We also found that EVI does not respond immediately to leaf gain in most cases, but has a two- to three-month lag. We also identified the start of season and peak growing season dates at our field site. The former occurs between September and October and the latter May and July. The GAMs allowed us to identify dual phenology events in our study sites, indicated by two instances of high EVI and two instances of low EVI values throughout the year. We contribute to a better understanding of mangrove phenology by presenting a data-driven method that allows us to link physical changes of mangrove forests with satellite imagery. In the future, we will use GAMs to (1) relate phenology to environmental variables (e.g., temperature and rainfall) and (2) predict phenological changes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In determining the best options for lymphoscintigraphy, investigators have tried many different radiopharmaceuticals and protocols. There are varying opinions on the best route of administration, timing for delayed images, and radiopharmaceutical. Debate around which radiopharmaceutical is best arises from the requirement that it clear from healthy lymph channels quickly enough to reveal the SLN. This paper reviews and compares 9 recognized publications on lymphoscintigraphy, illustrates the different preferences regarding the procedure, and describes the generally accepted protocols for the best way to locate the sentinel lymph node. Detailed explanations are given for the variable involvement of the sentinel lymph node and the variations in disease stage seen with different protocols. All discrepancies between protocols are supported with evidence such as positive results or false-positive results. On reading this paper, you will be able to form an opinion on the best protocols and radiopharmaceuticals and learn why lymphoscintigraphy is a crucial tool in improving a patient's prognosis.

TI  - Extraction of land-cover and wetland area in Bohai Rim region based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The land cover of Bohai Rim region has changed greatly due to urbanization and economic development. Monitoring the land cover with high accuracy and real time is the most important basis for relevant researches. Traditional single-machine processing mode is difficult to realize rapid monitoring for large-scale and long-time series. The emergence of remote sensing big data makes it possible to combine computing platform and massive data. The land cover maps of study area were interpreted based on Google Earth Engine ( GEE) platform with decision tree (CART) method from 2000 to 2019. The land cover change was analyzed, and the interpretation results using different data sources were compared. The results showed that the GEE platform could realize the rapid land cover interpretation in a large area, which interpreted coastal wetlands and other cover types with high accuracy over 80% comparing the surveyed points. Compared with Landsat images, the Sentinel-2A images interpretation results had a great improvement in accuracy, which increased from 85% to 95%, and thus more detailed surface information could be reflected. In 2000, the area of wetland, build-up area, farmland, forest, and water in the study area were 1612.5, 5734.9, 32074.8, 11853 and 3504.3 km(2), accounting for 2.9%, 10.5%, 58.6%, 21.6% and 6.4% respectively. By 2019, wetlands had been reduced by 775.1 km(2), with a decline of 40.1%; built-up area increased by 5310.5 km(2) with an increasing rate of 92.6%. The area of farmland, fkifestland and water area decreased 1841.6, 1823.5 and 870.3 km(2), with a decreasing rate of 5.7% , 24.8% and 48.1%, respectively. The coastal urbanization process caused the occupation of built-up area to other land use types, which was the main driving force of land cover change in the study area.

TI  - Mean Sea Surface Model over the Sea of Japan Determined from Multi-Satellite Altimeter Data and Tide Gauge Records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mean sea surface (MSS) is an important datum for the study of sea-level changes and charting data, and its accuracy in coastal waters has always been the focus of marine geophysics and oceanography. A new MSS model with a grid of 1 ' x 1 ' over the Sea of Japan and its adjacent ocean (named SJAO2020) (25 degrees N similar to 50 degrees N, 125 degrees E similar to 150 degrees E) was established. It ingested 12 different satellites altimeter data (including TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1/2/3, ERS-1/2, Envisat, GFO, HaiYang-2A, SRL/Altika, Sentinel-3A, Cryosat-2) and 24 tide gauge stations' records and joint GNSS data. The latter were used to correct the sea surface height within 10 km from the coastline by using the Gaussian inverse distance weighting method in SJAO2020. The differences among SJAO2020, CLS15, and DTU18, as well as the differences between them and the altimeter data of HY-2A, Jason-3, and Sentinel-3A were introduced. By comparing with tide gauge records, satellite altimeter data, and other models (DTU18, DTU15, CLS15, CLS11 and WHU13), it was demonstrated that SJAO2020 produces the smallest errors, and its coastal accuracy is relatively reliable.

T2  - STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin-walled circular tubes have been widely used in space lattice structures and other industrial areas. Corrosion is inevitable for steel tubes in terms of service life, and it will considerably reduce the axial stiffness and change the mechanical behavior of the entire structure. The present work aims to investigate the axial stiffness of corroded circular steel tubes (CSTs) subjected to compression force. Initial and elastoplastic stiffness values were investigated, and an analytical formula was proposed. The influence of corrosion thickness tc and material strength fy on the residual moment capacity of CSTs was also investigated. The proposed analytical formula can accurately predict the axial stiffness of CSTs with random pitting corrosion.

TI  - The Motif of Temptation in Leonid Leonov's <i>The Thief</i>
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of the analysis of the temptation motif in Leonid Leonov's novel The Thief, which, despite the high degree of knowledge of the writer's individual texts and their motif structure, remains little-studied. The relevance of the work is due to the plot-forming function of this motif and its role in interpreting the ideological content of the novel, which was noted by the largest researchers of Leonov (A.A. Dyrdin, L.P. Yakimova, T.M. Vakhitova). The methodological basis of the study was works on the poetics of motif (V.Ya. Propp, I. E. Silantyev), religious and philosophical research (S. Kierkegaard, G. Egorov, F.N. Kozyrev). The method of structural-typological motivational analysis revealed the key options for the motif of temptation. In The Thief it is revealed in the sense of testing the heroes' spirit, moral fortitude, faith and is often correlated by the writer with biblical stories about seduction (Adam and Eve in the Eden, Christ in the desert). Through the test of the heroes by love and revolution (Mitka Vekshin - V'yuga - Baluyev), pride (Vekshin - Pchkhov, Vekshin V'yuga), power (Vekshin - Sanka Bicycle), knowledge (Vekshin - V'yuga - Tanya Vekshina), Leonov shows their ability to resist temptation, independent choice of path, degree of moral decline. These allomotifs are of great artistic value primarily for interpreting the image of the protagonist, Mitka Vekshin, expressing the spirit and thinking of the crisis time. Another significant allomotif - temptation with creativity, to which several characters (Manyukin, Chikilev, Firsov) are subjected - is a variation of temptation with pride, since each of these heroes seems to have a unique glory of a genius, worthy of perpetuation. Unlike other allomotifs, Leonov almost always shows the temptation of creativity in a playful, ironic manner. Most of the heroes of The Thief are subjected to various types of temptation, but since none of them is able to pass this spiritual test completely, the mode of temptation is replaced by the mode of fall (moral (V'yuga, Mitka) and physical (Tanya Vekshina)) and eternal despair; Kierkegaard, in his Fear and Trembling, very subtly called their combination "demonic despair". Obviously, Leonov rethought the situations of temptation, which allusively go back to the texts of the Holy Scripture; and their assessment does not always correspond to the orthodox biblical one, entering into a worldview conflict with it. The development of the image of the protagonist, who has not passed the spiritual test and, at the same time, is attractive to the narrator by his rebellion against the system (the prodigal son Vekshin is the only one to violate the principle of "not looking back"), indicates the ambiguity of Leonov's intention, which changed during the repeated editing of the novel.

TI  - Detailed Geological Mapping of the Olon-Ovoot Gold Ore Cluster (Southern Mongolia) Based on the Interpretation of Satellite Images of Medium and High Spatial Resolution
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the results of an interpretation of the territory of the Olon-Ovoot ore cluster using medium and high spatial resolution satellite images. The interpretation is based on the Sentinel-2 image, which has been orthorectified and reduced to a common spatial resolution (10 m). Indices of iron hydroxide and iron silicate in Sentinel-2 images are used for selecting areas. The subpixel structure is analyzed using high spatial resolution satellite images from the Google Earth computer program in order to identify the areas of concentration of quartz-carbonate veins in Sentinel-2 images. The structural and morphological interpretation with lineament extraction has not required spectral domain analysis in high-resolution images. Remote sensing data interpretation have made it possible to significantly clarify the geological structure of the territory and improve from the mapping scale from 1 : 200 000 to 1 : 20 000 for key areas. The fusion of satellite images of different functional scales has led to an order of magnitude increase in mapped geological features (e.g., dikes). Detailed mapping of the territory makes it possible to come close to geo-information modeling of geological structural elements, i.e., leading indicators.

AB  - During cruise 79 of R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh in the Atlantic Antarctic, information is supplied using optical and radar high-, mid-, and low-resolution satellite data, in combination with geoinformation technologies. During field studies from December 2019 to February 2020, preliminarily processed information obtained by a multisatellite Earth remote sensing (ERS) system on sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, icebergs, altimetry, and the concentration of near-surface layer matter (chlorophyll, particulate organic carbon, inorganic suspended particulate matter, and total suspended matter) is transmitted to the vessel. A description is given of the information infrastructure that provides the research vessel with routine satellite data that is automatically integrated into the user's geoinformation environment as unified spatiotemporal distributions of important water environment parameters. Aspects of using satellite information when planning a ship's route and making measurements are described.

TI  - Remote Sensing Index for Mapping Canola Flowers Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and tracing the changes in canola planting areas and yields in China are of great significance for macro-policy regulation and national food security. The bright yellow flower is a distinctive feature of canola, compared to other crops, and is also an important factor in predicting canola yield. Thus, yellowness indices were previously used to detect the canola flower using aerial imagery or median-resolution satellite data like Sentinel-2. However, it remains challenging to map the canola planting area and to trace long-term canola yields in China due to the wide areal extent of cultivation, different flowering periods in different locations and years, and the lack of high spatial resolution data within a long-term period. In this study, a novel canola index, called the enhanced area yellowness index (EAYI), for mapping canola flowers and based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series data, was developed. There are two improvements in the EAYI compared with previous studies. First, a method for estimating flowering period, based on geolocation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series, was established, to estimate the flowering period at each place in each year. Second, the EAYI enhances the weak flower signal in coarse pixels by combining the peak of yellowness index time-series and the valley of NDVI time-series during the estimated flowering period. With the proposed EAYI, canola flowering was mapped in five typical canola planting areas in China, during 2003-2017. Three different canola indices proposed previously, the normalized difference yellowness index (NDYI), ratio yellowness index (RYI) and Ashourloo canola index (Ashourloo CI), were also calculated for a comparison. Validation using the samples interpreted through higher resolution images demonstrated that the EAYI is better correlated with the reference canola coverage with R-2 ranged from 0.31 to 0.70, compared to the previous indices with R-2 ranged from 0.02 to 0.43. Compared with census canola yield data, the total EAYI was well correlated with actual yield in Jingmen, Yili and Hulun Buir, and well correlated with meteorological yields in all five study areas. In contrast, previous canola indices show a very low or even a negative correlation with both actual and meteorological yields. These results indicate that the EAYI is a potential index for mapping and tracing the change in canola areas, or yields, with MODIS data.

TI  - Prediction of future grassland vegetation cover fluctuation under climate change scenarios
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are subject to degradation in arid and semi-arid areas as the result of various pressures, including climate change. Therefore, spatial and temporal monitoring of vegetation cover fluctuation is needed for better understanding and management of natural resources to sustain livelihoods that depend on these grasslands. In this study, changes in vegetation cover were monitored over 1985-2015, using vegetation indices derived from the Landsat images in Chaharmahal-va-Bakhtiyari province, Iran. The percentage of vegetation cover was recorded from sampling plots in the study areas and vegetation indices were calculated from Landsat data over the study period. The relationship between vegetation cover and climate parameters (temperature (T) and precipitation (P)) was determined from precipitation maps, produced from spatial interpolation of weather stations data and temperature maps, produced by regression equation established between DEM-derived elevation and temperature. Then, a regression equation between climate variables and vegetation cover over a period of 30 years' period was developed and applied on projected climatic variables for the 2050 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The Green Vegetation Index (GVI) was found to be the best index for estimation of vegetation cover from the correlation coefficient (r = 0.79) and model RMSE (1.98). The GVI fluctuation was associated with the fluctuation in climate variables, and this was especially evident in especially dry years (1999, 2001 and 2012). From the difference between current and future vegetation cover maps, future vegetation cover change maps were produced and vulnerable areas most likely to be impacted by climate change were identified. The results predict that vegetation cover will be reduced under both scenarios, mostly in the eastern parts of the study region, while 5-25% of vegetation cover increases are projected for some areas in the western parts of the region. Further analysis showed that currently, oak forest covers large swaths of the western parts adjacent to grasslands, but forest degradation will lead to increase of grassland areas at the expense of oak forests. Overall, substantial loss of vegetation cover is predicted in the central parts and extends to the southern parts of the province. Loss of vegetation cover would pave the way to conversion of grassland to other non-productive cover types for pastoral systems. Appropriate management programs and adaptation strategies should be designed and implemented to reduce climate change impacts on grasslands in the identified vulnerable areas.

TI  - Sub-Mesoscale Vortex Streets in the Region of the Shantar Islands (Sea of Okhotsk), According to Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Images in the visible range of the MODIS Terra/Aqua and ETM+ Landsat 7/OLI Landsat 8 satellites are used to study vortex streets (VSes) in the region of the Shantar Islands (Sea of Okhotsk ). Two stable VSes are observed in the Northeast Strait separating Large and Small Shantar Islands. The northern VS forms near Diomede Stones Island, while the southern VS arises near a nameless group of rocks. The northern VS is 9-11 km long and consists of 4-5 pairs of cyclone-anticyclone vortices. The average diameter of a northern vortex is 0.73 +/- 0.09 km. Vortices in the southern street are traced at distances of 6-7 km, with 3-5 vortex pairs recorded. The average diameter of a southern vortex is 0.47 +/- 0.07 km. Vortices in the chain propagate mainly in the easterly direction at low tide and in the westerly direction at high tide. The spatial and temporal scales of the phenomenon show that both the vortices and VSes in the Northeast Strait are of a sub-mesoscale nature. The remote sensing data allow geometric parameters characterizing the stability of the oceanic VSes to be determined. The results from measurements and calculations can be used as tests demonstrating the possibility of applying the existing theory of similarity to VSes under real oceanic conditions. The parameters of oceanic VSes are compared to the results obtained in laboratory experiments and the characteristics of atmospheric VSes.

TI  - Effects of land use and land cover change on carbon sequestration and adaptive management in Shanghai, China
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving well-being for all, while mitigating climate change, is a central idea in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and one of the most pressing global challenges. Land use and land cover change are affecting the global and regional climate change through the carbon emissions. Meanwhile, carbon sequestration could replenish and contribute to the decrease of CO2 emissions. Rapid urbanized areas have typical urbanized characteristics and carbon reduction target. Therefore, it is a vital issue to explore the carbon sequestration in rapid urbanized area. This paper analyzed the mechanism between carbon sequestration and land use and land cover change in Shanghai city. Based on the Landsat TM/ETM images from 1990 to 2015 and using the InVEST model, we assessed the temporal and spatial variations of carbon sequestration in response to the expansion of built-up areas and obtained a reliable estimate of terrestrial carbon sequestration at 30 m x 30 m grid scale, including biomass and soil carbon stocks. The results show that the total carbon stock decreased by 73.19 x 105 t during the period 1990-2015, representing 0.48% per year. The urbanization process in response to land use and land cover change has significant negative impacts on carbon sequestration capacity in the urban ecosystem. According to these results, some potential policy measures are proposed for mitigating terrestrial carbon losses for Shanghai, which are mainly manifested in adaptive management for carbon sequestration, contributing to achieve SGDs and sustainable development.

TI  - A Model-Downscaling Method for Fine-Resolution LAI Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a critical parameter for characterizing the structure and function of vegetation in ecosystems. Currently, operational LAI products always have coarse spatial resolution, and fine-resolution LAI maps are urgently needed for ecological environment assessment and the precise monitoring of cropland growth. LAI downscaling methods are efficient at improving the spatial resolution of LAI products but often ignore the scaling effect of the model. In this study, a novel model-downscaling method is proposed for fine-resolution LAI estimation. It uses scaling equations of model parameters (SEMPs) to describe the scaling relations of models at different spatial resolutions and construct a downscaled model from a coarse-resolution model. Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at 30 m and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI at 1 km spatial resolutions are used because they are readily available. The downscaled model is evaluated by a fine-resolution model directly constructed with fine-resolution data. The fine-resolution LAI values estimated by this model-downscaling method are evaluated with field LAI measurements. The validation results show that the proposed method can generate highly accurate LAIs, with an RMSE of 0.821 at the Pshenichne cropland site in Ukraine and an RMSE of 0.515 at the Camerons forest site in Australia when compared with field LAI measurements. The results are also better than those of Ovakoglou's downscaling method. These results demonstrate that the model-downscaling method for fine-resolution LAI estimation is viable and referable for related studies.

TI  - Spatial Pattern of Construction Land Distribution in Bays along the Coast of Vietnam
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Current studies of urban spatial morphology have rarely focused on the particularity of coastal cities, such as sea-land gradient features and bay types. In this paper, we provide a method to analyze the spatial and vertical distribution of construction land in the bay area and discuss the influence of bay type on the distribution characteristics. Landscape indexes and a clustering algorithm were used to identify the spatial pattern of construction land distribution. Strip division was used to analyze the landscape features of construction land in the sea-land direction. We established eight large bays in Vietnam as the study area. According to the formation and geomorphology of the bay, the eight bays were divided into five types: delta bay, lagoon bay, structural bay, bedrock erosion-stacking bay and estuary bay. The construction land data were generated from Landsat images captured in 1988 and 2015 or so. The study effectively identified five spatial patterns of construction land distribution in bays without prior knowledge. Danang Bay (a bedrock erosion-stacking bay) had a typical high intensity-high concentration pattern, and Hai Loc Bay (a delta bay) had a typical high intensity-low concentration pattern. In the sea-land gradient, the proportions of construction land in the 0-2 km zone were greatest. In Danang Bay, the proportion generally decreased in the sea-land direction; while in Hai Loc Bay, the proportion increased.

TI  - Effects of sea ice on wave energy flux distribution in the Bohai Sea
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The wave energy flux distribution in the Bohai Sea during wintertime is re-evaluated based on SWAN with the added sea-ice effect, which is derived from an ice-ocean coupled model, FVCOM. Simulated wave parameters and ice cover agree well with the measured wave data and the MODIS images of sea-ice cover, respectively. The results indicate that the decrease of wave energy flux is mainly caused by the formed ice which leads to the reduction of the effective wind fetch and transferred momentum from air to the ocean surface. The numerical results in a typical winter from 2011 to 2012 show that, due to the presence of sea ice, the average wave energy fluxes can be decreased by up to 80% in Liaodong Bay, while up to 50% in Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay. Under the extreme winter-weather conditions, more pro-nounced reduction of wave energy flux caused by ice is observed. The findings also imply that in the design of wave energy converters (WECs) and their deployed locations in the Bohai Sea, even the likely ice-free areas in winter time, the effect of other ice-covered regions on the decrease of wave energy flux as a result of decrease in wind fetch should be considered.

TI  - Design of global-contextual detection model for optical remote sensing targets
T2  - CHINESE OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the detection accuracy and reduce the complexity of optical remote sensing of target images with a complex background, a global context detection model based on optical remote sensing of targets is proposed. First, a feature encoder-feature decoder network is used for feature extraction. Then, to improve the positioning ability of multi-scale targets, a method that combines global-contextual features and target center local features is used to generate high-resolution heat maps. The global features are used to achieve the pre-classification of targets. Finally, a positioning loss function at different scales is proposed to enhance the regression ability of the model. Experimental results show that the mean average precision of the proposed model reaches 97.6% AP(50) and 83.4% AP(75) on the NWPU VHR-10 public remote sensing data set, and the speed reaches 16 PFS. This design can achieve an effective balance between accuracy and speed. It facilitates subsequent porting and application of the algorithm on the mobile device side, which meets design requirements.

TI  - Three-dimensional regional oceanic element field reconstruction with multiple underwater gliders in the Northern South China Sea
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional three-dimensional fine oceanic element field reconstruction and feature surface extraction are of considerable significance to oceanographic research and military application. In this paper, a three-dimensional regional oceanic element field reconstruction method based on spatio-temporal Kriging interpolation is proposed, and is studied experimentally. Using discrete data with uneven temporal and spatial distributions, the spatio-temporal variogram of Kriging interpolation is constructed by adopting an integral model. Then, based on experimental data acquired by seven underwater gliders and satellite remote sensing data in the northern South China Sea (NSCS), three-dimensional regional oceanic temperature and salinity fields are constructed for a particular area of interest. Through comparison with the spatial Kriging method and the spatio-temporal weight method, the cross-verification results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of oceanic element field construction. Finally, feature surfaces are extracted from the three-dimensional oceanic element fields, and can be used to reveal thermohaline characteristics of NSCS. Furthermore, the proposed method can be applied in other areas that construct three-dimensional models from discrete data.

TI  - High adsorption of Cd (II) by modification of synthetic zeolites Y, A and mordenite with thiourea
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Zeolites Y, A and mordenite (ZY, ZA and ZM) were obtained from diatomite in a template-free system, and the products were modified by thiourea (TU). Characterization studies results indicated that the TU molecules were loaded onto the exterior surfaces of the synthetic zeolites as well as the channels. Elemental analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer proved that the TU molecules loaded on to ZA were more than ZY and ZM. Removal of Cd(II) was investigated, and it was found that the modified zeolites have higher removal capacity, modified ZA is especially noticeable. In the adsorption experiments, the effects of various parameters such as sorbent content, contact time, concentration of cadmium solution, pH, selectivity and regeneration were discussed. At the best removal efficiency by modified zeolites, the maximum adsorption capacity is 94.3 mg.g(-1), 103.2 mg.g(-1) and 89.7 mg.g(-1) at 25 degrees C, respectively. The sorbents show good efficiency for the removal of Cd(11) in the presence of different multivalent cations and have good regeneration effect. For the modified samples, removal experiments take place via ion exchange and complexation processes.

TI  - The spatial and temporal impact of agricultural crop residual burning on local land surface temperature in three provinces across China from 2015 to 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - China has suffered from severe crop residue burning (CRB) for a long time. As a type of biomass burning, CRB leads to a huge alteration in climate due to the emission of greenhouse gases and particulates in the atmosphere and damages to surface characteristics on land. At present, a growing body of research focuses on the impact of biomass burning (BB) (e.g., forest fire, grass fire, and CRB) on climate change from the aspect of atmospheric process. Meanwhile, a small number of research studies have started to pay attention on the damage caused by BB (e.g. forest fire) on land surface and consequent changes in the land surface temperature (LST). However, at present there is no study concerning the effect of CRB on the surface temperature. Considering its large incidence, highly seasonal concentration, and large spatial scale in China, this study attempted to reveal the impact of CRB on LST. Specifically, we identified the influence of CRB on the LST in surrounding areas based on MODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire product and MODIS LST product during the CRB season for three provinces of China: Heilongjiang, Hebei, and Guangxi from 2015 to 2017. The results showed that there was a strong positive correlation between daily CRB spots and daily LST (R between 0.30 and 0.61) in Heilongjiang (20,184-24,902 spots of CRB from 2015 to 2017). On the other hand, in Hebei and Guangxi provinces, where the total CRB number was less (2,367-2,754 spots of CRB from 2015 to 2017 in Hebei, and 701 to 653 spots of CRB from 2015 to 2017 in Guangxi), even if R was only 0.36-0.53 and 0.11-0.53, respectively, the peaks of CRB spots and peaks of daily LST were highly matched. Furthermore, the spatial analysis showed that LST on agricultural land in 10-15 km distance from the center of CRB was higher (1-3 degrees C) than that in other regions in Heilongjiang province. On the other hand, the influence scale of CRB in Hebei and Guangxi was only 2-4 km with a similar to 2 degrees C increase on LST. Finally, according to the typical case analysis, it was found that the influence of CRB on LST existed for 1-3 days and did not disappear immediately. The study proved the impact of CRB on LST in surrounding areas, and favors action on climate change relief through CRB control. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Validation and inter-comparison of the FY-3B/MERSI LAI product with GLOBMAP and MYD15A2H
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) describes the structure of vegetation and is a key variable for Earth system process modelling and eco-hydrological models at regional and global scales. The Medium-Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard China's new generation of polar-orbiting meteorological satellite series FengYun-3 (FY-3) can provide continuous and global observations of the land surface. Therefore, it could be a potential data source for global LAI retrieval. In this study, a LAI product was generated from FY-3B/MERSI data using the GLOBCARBON LAI algorithm. Cross-calibration of the FY-3B/MERSI spectral response function with Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat) Thematic Mapper (TM), allowed to correct the influence of the spectral response function difference on the inversion results. Field measurements of LAI and scale-converted LAI reference images provided by the ImagineS project were used to validate and inter-compare the FY-3B/MERSI LAI product with two widely used medium-resolution LAI products, GLOBMAP LAI product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product (MYD15A2 H). The results demonstrate that FY-3B/MERSI LAI has the lowest uncertainty of the three products. The low uncertainty of FY-3B/MERSI LAI in shrub-grass mixed areas (root mean square error, RMSE = 0.07), in part, by the generally underestimated LAI value. For deciduous broadleaf forest, of the three products tested, FY-3B/MERSI LAI is closest to the LAI obtained from the reference image (coefficient of determination,R-2 = 0.70) and yields the lowest uncertainty (RMSE = 0.81). GLOBMAP (R-2 = 0.58), which uses the same algorithm, and surface cover data as FY-3B/MERSI LAI, significantly overestimates the LAI. This overestimation may partly due to the use of a relatively lower clumping index. MYD15A2H shows a relatively weak correlation with the reference data (R-2 = 0.25) and a higher uncertainty (RMSE = 1.45). For mature crops, all three LAI products display systematic underestimation of LAI. FY-3B/MERSI LAI yields the greatest underestimation (about 50%), followed by GLOBMAP (about 35%) and MYD15A2H (about 15%). Our inter-comparison of the three LAI products demonstrates that all have higher correlation for low LAI values. FY-3B/MERSI shows similar capabilities and quality to those of the MODIS sensor with respect to the top of atmosphere observations. However, different atmospheric correction processes may cause large changes in the input Simple Ratio (SR), which in turn will cause bias when retrieving high LAI values. In addition, the temporal and spatial variation of clumping index was insufficiently considered in FY-3B/MERSI LAI product, further improvement is needed by using timely updated and high spatial resolution clumping index data.

TI  - The Effects of Fireworks Discharge on Atmospheric PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration in the Chinese Lunar New Year
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Discharging fireworks during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations is a deep-rooted custom in China. In this paper, we analyze the effect of this cultural activity on PM2.5 concentration using both ground observations and satellite data. By combining remote sensing data, the problem of uneven spatial distribution of ground monitoring has been compensated, and the research time span has been expanded. The results show that the extensive firework displays on New Year's Eve lead to a remarkable increase in nationwide PM2.5 concentration, which were 159 similar to 223% of the average level, indicating the instantaneous effect far exceeds that of any other factor over the whole year. However, the averaged PM2.5 concentrations of the celebration period were 0.99 similar to 16.32 mu g/m(3) lower compared to the average values of the corresponding pre-celebration period and post-celebration period, indicating the sustained effect is not very significant. The implementation of firework prohibition policies can greatly reduce the instantaneous PM2.5 increase, but no obvious air quality improvement is observed over the entire celebration period. Combining these findings and the cultural significance of this activity, we recommend that this custom is actively maintained, using new technologies and scientific governance programs to minimize the negative effects.

TI  - Land use changes in the coastal zone of China's Hebei Province and the corresponding impacts on habitat quality
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone is a transition zone between land and sea, and has a high biodiversity. Land use changes in the coastal zone will inevitably have huge impacts on habitat quality and biodiversity. However, in previous researches, land use changes in the coastal zone over long time scales were usually neglected due to available data. In addition, quantitative assessment methods have not been widely used to clarify the contributions of changes in land use on changes in habitat quality. Therefore, we integrated topographic map and remote sensing data to analyze land use changes in the coastal zone of Hebei Province (CZHP) in China from 1950 to 2017. Furthermore, we used the InVEST model to evaluate the influence of land use changes on habitat quality. The results showed that dramatic land use changes occurred in the CZHP from 1950 to 2017. The areas of wetland and idle land decreased by 78.41 and 72.03 %, respectively. Substantial lands were reclaimed for as cultivated land, aquaculture, and industrial and mining land. At the same time, the areas of residential land and industrial and mining land increased by 345.63 and 975.19 %, respectively. The expansion of residential land occurred at the cost of cultivated land loss, while the increase in industrial and mining land was mainly a result of the occupation of wetland and idle land. Land use changes in the CZHP led to an obvious decrease in habitat quality, with an average decline of 37.37 % from 1950 to 2017.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Incident and Net Shortwave Radiation from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Using an Optimization Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Incident surface shortwave radiation (ISR) is a key parameter in Earth's surface radiation budget. Many reanalysis and satellite-based ISR products have been developed, but they often have insufficient accuracy and resolution for many applications. In this study, we extended our optimization method developed earlier for the MODIS data with several major improvements for estimating instantaneous and daily ISR and net shortwave radiation (NSR) from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite observations (VIIRS), including (1) an integrated framework that combines look-up table and parameter optimization; (2) enabling the calculation of net shortwave radiation (NSR) as well as daily values; and (3) extensive global validation. We validated the estimated ISR values using measurements at seven Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites and 33 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) sites during 2013. The root mean square errors (RMSE) over SURFRAD sites for instantaneous ISR and NSR were 83.76 W/m(2) and 66.80 W/m(2), respectively. The corresponding daily RMSE values were 27.78 W/m(2) and 23.51 W/m(2). The RMSE at BSRN sites was 105.87 W/m(2) for instantaneous ISR and 32.76 W/m(2) for daily ISR. The accuracy is similar to the estimation from MODIS data at SURFRAD sites but the computational efficiency has improved by approximately 50%. We also produced global maps that demonstrate the potential of this algorithms to generate global ISR and NSR products from the VIIRS data.

TI  - Combining Segmentation Network and Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform for Automatic Marine Raft Aquaculture Area Extraction from Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine raft aquaculture (MFA) plays an important role in the marine economy and ecosystem. With the characteristics of covering a large area and being sparsely distributed in sea area, MFA monitoring suffers from the low efficiency of field survey and poor data of optical satellite imagery. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery is currently considered to be an effective data source, while the state-of-the-art methods require manual parameter tuning under the guidance of professional experience. To preclude the limitation, this paper proposes a segmentation network combined with nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) to extract MFA areas using Sentinel-1 images. The proposed method is highlighted by several improvements based on the feature analysis of MFA. First, the NSCT was applied to enhance the contour and orientation features. Second, multiscale and asymmetric convolutions were introduced to fit the multisize and strip-like features more effectively. Third, both channel and spatial attention modules were adopted in the network architecture to overcome the problems of boundary fuzziness and area incompleteness. Experiments showed that the method can effectively extract marine raft culture areas. Although further research is needed to overcome the problem of interference caused by excessive waves, this paper provides a promising approach for periodical monitoring MFA in a large area with high efficiency and acceptable accuracy.

AB  - Henry of Ghent attempted to integrate an Aristotelian empiricism, Platonic exemplarism and an Augustinian doctrine of Divine Illumination, to form a firm philosophical basis for Augustine's theory of knowledge, meanwhile trying to restore its theological connotations. However, his new synthesis was doomed to fail, because the tensions between the Christian metaphysical worldview and the epistemological requirements of the Aristotelian system were unsolvable. The need for divine illumination was waning in the face of encroaching Aristotelianism at the end of 13th century.

TI  - An Evaluation of Eight Machine Learning Regression Algorithms for Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation from Multiple Satellite Data Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provided a comprehensive evaluation of eight machine learning regression algorithms for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation from satellite data based on leaf area index, canopy height, net primary production, and tree cover data, as well as climatic and topographical data. Some of these algorithms have not been commonly used for forest AGB estimation such as the extremely randomized trees, stochastic gradient boosting, and categorical boosting (CatBoost) regression. For each algorithm, its hyperparameters were optimized using grid search with cross-validation, and the optimal AGB model was developed using the training dataset (80%) and AGB was predicted on the test dataset (20%). Performance metrics, feature importance as well as overestimation and underestimation were considered as indicators for evaluating the performance of an algorithm. To reduce the impacts of the random training-test data split and sampling method on the performance, the above procedures were repeated 50 times for each algorithm under the random sampling, the stratified sampling, and separate modeling scenarios. The results showed that five tree-based ensemble algorithms performed better than the three nonensemble algorithms (multivariate adaptive regression splines, support vector regression, and multilayer perceptron), and the CatBoost algorithm outperformed the other algorithms for AGB estimation. Compared with the random sampling scenario, the stratified sampling scenario and separate modeling did not significantly improve the AGB estimates, but modeling AGB for each forest type separately provided stable results in terms of the contributions of the predictor variables to the AGB estimates. All the algorithms showed forest AGB were underestimated when the AGB values were larger than 210 Mg/ha and overestimated when the AGB values were less than 120 Mg/ha. This study highlighted the capability of ensemble algorithms to improve AGB estimates and the necessity of improving AGB estimates for high and low AGB levels in future studies.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variation of Water Heat Flux Using MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product over Hulun Lake, China During 2001-2018
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat flux is important for studying interactions between atmosphere and lake. The heat exchange between air-water interfaces is one of the important ways to govern the temperature of the water surface. Heat exchange between the air-water interfaces and the surrounding environment is completed by solar radiation, conduction, and evaporation, and all these processes mainly occur at the air-water interface. Hulun Lake was the biggest lake which is also an important link and an indispensable part of the water cycle in Northeast China. This study mapped surface energy budget to better understand spatial and temporal variations in Hulun Lake in China from 2001 to 2018. Descriptive statistics were computed to build a historical time series of mean monthly heat flux at daytime and nighttime from June to September during 2001-2018. Remote sensing estimation methods we used was suitable for Hulun Lake (R-2 = 0.81). At month scale, shortwave radiation and latent heat flux were decrease from June to September. However, the maximum sensible heat flux appeared in September. Net longwave radiation was the largest in August. The effective heat budget showed that Hulun Lake gained heat in the frost-free season with highest value in June (686.31 W/m(2)), and then steadily decreased to September (439.76 W/m(2)). At annual scale, net longwave radiation, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux all show significant growth trend from 2001 to 2018 (P < 0.01). Wind speed had the well correlation on sensible heat flux and latent heat flux. Water surface temperature showed the highest coefficient in sensitivity analysis.

TI  - Fast Ice Prediction System (FIPS) for land-fast sea ice at Prydz Bay, East Antarctica: an operational service for CHINARE
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A Fast Ice Prediction System (FIPS) was constructed and is the first regional land-fast sea-ice forecasting system for the Antarctic. FIPS had two components: (1) near-real-time information on the ice-covered area from MODIS and SAR imagery that revealed, tidal cracks, ridged and rafted ice regions; (2) a high-resolution 1-D thermodynamic snow and ice model (HIGHTSI) that was extended to perform a 2-D simulation on snow and ice evolution using atmospheric forcing from ECMWF: either using ERA-Interim reanalysis (in hindcast mode) or HERS operational 10-day predictions (in forecast mode). A hindcast experiment for the 2015 season was in good agreement with field observations, with a mean bias of 0.14 +/- 0.07 m and a correlation coefficient of 0.98 for modeled ice thickness. The errors are largely caused by a cold bias in the atmospheric forcing. The thick snow cover during the 2015 season led to modeled formation of extensive snow ice and superimposed ice. The first FIPS operational service was performed during the 2017/18 season. The system predicted a realistic ice thickness and onset of snow surface melt as well as the area of internal ice melt. The model results on the snow and ice properties were considered by the captain of R/V Xuelong when optimizing a low-risk route for on-ice transportation through fast ice to the coastal Zhongshan Station.

TI  - Remote Sensing Evaluation of Total Suspended Solids Dynamic with Markov Model: A Case Study of Inland Reservoir across Administrative Boundary in South China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and quantitative assessment of the impact of natural environmental changes and human activities on total suspended solids (TSS) concentration is one of the important components of water environment protection. Due to the limits of traditional cross-sectional point monitoring, a novel water quality evaluation method based on the Markov model and remote sensing retrieval is proposed to realize the innovation of large-scale spatial monitoring across administrative boundaries. Additionally, to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of TSS, a new three-band remote sensing model of TSS was built by regression analysis for the inland reservoir using the synchronous field spectral data, water quality samples and remote sensing data in the trans-provincial Hedi Reservoir in the Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces of South China. The results show that: (1) The three-band model based on the OLI sensor explained about 82% of the TSS concentration variation (R2=0.81, N=34, p value<0.01) with an acceptable validation accuracy (RMSE=6.24 mg/L,MRE=18.02%, N=15), which is basically the first model of its kind available in South China. (2) The TSS concentration has spatial distribution characteristics of high upstream and low downstream, where the average TSS at 31.54 mg/L in the upstream are 2.5 times those of the downstream (12.55 mg/L). (3) Different seasons and rainfall are important factors affecting the TSS in the upstream cross-border area, the TSS in the dry season are higher with average TSS of 33.66 mg/L and TSS are negatively correlated with rainfall from upstream mankind activity. Generally, TSS are higher in rainy seasons than those in dry seasons. However, the result shows that TSS are negatively correlated with rainfall, which means human activities have higher impacts on water quality than climate change. (4) The Markov dynamic evaluation results show that the water quality improvement in the upstream Shijiao Town is the most obvious, especially in 2018, the improvement in the water quality level crossed three levels and the TSS were the lowest. This study provided a technical method for remote sensing dynamic monitoring of water quality in a large reservoir, which is of great significance for remediation of the water environment and the effective evaluation of the river and lake chief system in China.

TI  - Exploring difference in land surface temperature between the city centres and urban expansion areas of China's major cities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China has experienced rapid urbanization over the past decades, which has changed the physical environment of its urban areas. Based on Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature observations from the Google Earth Engine, this study focuses on the difference in daytime and night-time temperature between the city centres and the annual expansion areas of China's 34 municipalities, defined as the surface urban heat difference (SUHD), from 2002 to 2013 considering both summer and winter. Our result showed that the land surface temperature in the urban expansion areas in nearly all cities was lower than those in the city centres in three out of the four periods except for winter days. For temporal characteristics, the largest SUHD occurred in the winter night-time, followed by the summer night-time, summer daytime and winter daytime. Then we revealed spatial characteristics of SUHD on city and urban expansion region level. Cities were grouped into two major clusters based on the average temperature difference between the city centres and the urban expansion areas, exhibiting significant spatial heterogeneity. SUHD of moister cities mostly ranged from 0 degrees C to 2 degrees C in four different times while that of dryer cities distributed from -2 degrees C to 4 degrees C. Generally, the SUHD of cities with moist climates was stronger in the day but weaker at night and decreased more rapidly after land cover was urbanized. When comparing the SUHD in different expansion years, our results showed that areas that had developed earlier had a weaker SUHD. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) difference between urban centre and urban expansion regions and moisture were significant indicators effecting the SUHD.

TI  - First Year On-Orbit Calibration of the Chinese Environmental Trace Gas Monitoring Instrument Onboard GaoFen-5
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental trace gas monitoring instrument (EMI) onboard GaoFen-5 was launched in May 2018 and has successfully operated on-orbit for more than a year. EMI contains four grating spectrometers, covering wavelengths in the range 240-710 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.3-0.5 nm, and enables one-day global coverage. For EMI on-orbit calibration, two onboard solar diffusers (SD), one surface reflectance aluminum diffuser, and one quartz volume diffuser (QVD) are used to measure solar spectra. The solar spectra are used to perform accurate spectral and radiometric calibrations. EMI on-orbit spectral calibration contains wavelength calibration and instrument spectral response function (ISRF), both of which are the key quantities in trace gas retrievals based on differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) analysis. The wavelength calibration is performed using the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum, and the ISRF parameters are obtained by fitting high-resolution and EMI-measured solar spectra. Based on the known solar irradiation and characteristic of SD, SD radiance can be calculated and is used for EMI on-orbit radiometric calibration. The radiometric calibration also determines the absolute Earth reflectance spectra that are used as inputs for atmospheric retrieval algorithms. For EMI on-orbit radiometric monitoring, aluminum diffuser is used as reference SD to monitor QVD degradation. An internal white light source is used to detect pixel performance and monitor radiometric throughput.

TI  - Spatial distribution of supraglacial debris thickness on glaciers of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and surroundings
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris-covered glaciers, characterized by the presence of supraglacial debris mantles in their ablation zones, are widespread in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and surroundings. For these glaciers, thin debris layers accelerate the melting of underlying ice compared to that of bare ice, while thick debris layers retard ice melting, called debris-cover effect. Knowledge about the thickness and thermal properties of debris cover on CPEC glaciers is still unclear, making it difficult to assess the regional debris-cover effect. In this study, thermal resistance of the debris layer estimated from remotely sensed data reveals that about 54.0% of CPEC glaciers are debris-covered glaciers, on which the total debris-covered area is about 5,072 km(2), accounting for 14.0% of the total glacier area of the study region. We find that marked difference in the extent and thickness of debris cover is apparent from region to region, as well as the debris-cover effect. 53.3% of the total debris-covered area of the study region is concentrated in Karakoram, followed by Pamir with 30.2% of the total debris-covered area. As revealed by the thermal resistance, the debris thickness is thick in Hindu Kush on average, with the mean thermal resistance of 7.0x10(-2) ((m(2).K)/W), followed by Karakoram, while the thickness in western Himalaya is thin with the mean value of 2.0x10(-2) (( m(2).K)/W). Our findings provide a basis for better assessments of changes in debris-covered glaciers and their associated hydrological impacts in the CPEC and surroundings.

TI  - COLOR: Cycling, Offline Learning, and Online Representation Framework for Airport and Airplane Detection Using GF-2 Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring airports using remote sensing imagery require us to first detect the airports and then perform airplane detection. Detecting airports and airplanes with large-scale remote sensing imagery are significant and challenging tasks in the field of remote sensing. Although many detection algorithms have been developed for detecting airports and airplanes in remote sensing imagery, the efficiency of the processing does not meet the needs of real applications in large-scale remote sensing imagery. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), have achieved great progress in image recognition. However, training a DCNN needs a large number of training examples to accurately fit the data distribution. Annotating training examples in large-scale remote sensing imagery is time-consuming, which makes the pipeline inefficient. In this article, to overcome the above two weaknesses, we propose a novel cycling data-driven framework for efficient and robust airport localization and airplane detection. The proposed method consists of three modules: cycling by example refinement (C), offline learning (OL), and online representation (OR), namely cycling, offline learning, and online representation (COLOR). The OR module is a coarse-to-fine cascaded convolutional neural network, which is used to detect airports and airplanes. The example refinement (ER) module implements the cycling and makes use of the unlabeled remote sensing images and the corresponding predictions obtained by the OR module, to generate training examples. The OL module aims to use the training examples from the ER module to update the OR module, to further improve the performance. The whole workflow involves COLOR. The COLOR framework was used to detect airplanes and airports in 512 large-scale Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing images with 29 200 x 27 620 pixels. The results showed that the proposed method obtained a mean average precision (mAP) of 88.32% for the airplane detection. In addition due to the proposed coarse-to-fine cascaded OR module the proposed method is much faster than the traditional approaches in real-world applications.

TI  - Robust Building Extraction for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images with Self-Attention Network
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Building extraction from high spatial resolution remote sensing images is a hot spot in the field of remote sensing applications and computer vision. This paper presents a semantic segmentation model, which is a supervised method, named Pyramid Self-Attention Network (PISANet). Its structure is simple, because it contains only two parts: one is the backbone of the network, which is used to learn the local features (short distance context information around the pixel) of buildings from the image; the other part is the pyramid self-attention module, which is used to obtain the global features (long distance context information with other pixels in the image) and the comprehensive features (includes color, texture, geometric and high-level semantic feature) of the building. The network is an end-to-end approach. In the training stage, the input is the remote sensing image and corresponding label, and the output is probability map (the probability that each pixel is or is not building). In the prediction stage, the input is the remote sensing image, and the output is the extraction result of the building. The complexity of the network structure was reduced so that it is easy to implement. The proposed PISANet was tested on two datasets. The result shows that the overall accuracy reached 94.50 and 96.15%, the intersection-over-union reached 77.45 and 87.97%, and F1 index reached 87.27 and 93.55%, respectively. In experiments on different datasets, PISANet obtained high overall accuracy, low error rate and improved integrity of individual buildings.

TI  - A note on the lake level variations of Nam Co, south-central Tibetan Plateau from 2005 to 2019
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tibetan lake levels are sensitive to global change, and their variations have a large impact on the environment, local agriculture and animal husbandry practices. While many remote sensing data of Tibetan lake level changes have been reported, few are from in-situ measurements. This note presents the first in-situ lake level time series of the central Tibetan Plateau. Since 2005, daily lake level observations have been performed at Lake Nam Co, one of the largest on the Tibetan Plateau. The interannual lake level variations show an overall increasing trend from 2006 to 2014, a rapid decrease from 2014 to 2017, and a surge from 2017 to 2018. The annual average lake level of the hydrological year (May-April) rose 66 cm from 2006 to 2014, dropped 59 cm from 2014 to 2017, and increased 20 cm from 2017 to 2018, resulting in a net rise of 27 cm or an average rate of about 2 cm per year. Compared to the annual average lake level based on the calendar year, it is better to use the annual average lake level based on the hydrological year to determine the interannual lake level changes. As the lake level was stable in May, it is appropriate to compare May lake levels when examining interannual lake level changes with fewer data. Overall, remote sensing results agree well with the in-situ lake level observations; however, some significant deviations exist. In the comparable 2006-2009 period, the calendar-year average lake level observed insitu rose by 10-11 cm per year, which is lower than the ICESat result of 18 cm per year.

TI  - Glacier changes in the Qaidam Basin from 1977 to 2018
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat MSS/TM/OLI remote sensing images, glaciers vector data in the Qaidam Basin were extracted for 1977, 2002, and 2018, and their spatial-temporal variations were analyzed. Results show that there were 2,050 glaciers covering an area of 1,693.54 +/- 40.96 km(2) and having an ice volume of 108.65 +/- 2.43 km(3) in the Qaidam Basin in 2018. Glaciers with areas <1.0 km(2) accounted for the largest number, while glaciers with areas of 1.0-5.0 km(2) accounted for the most glacierized area. In the past 50 years, the number of glaciers decreased by 177, and the glacier area and volume reduced by 338.08 km(2) (-8.12 km(2)/a) and 19.92 km(3) (-0.48 km(3)/a), respectively. Retreat altitudes of glaciers were concentrated at 4,900-5,600 m, 4,700-5,200 m, and 5,000-5,600 m and reduced areas accounted for 95.53%, 77.80%, and 69.19% in the Kunlun, Qilian, and Altun mountains, respectively. The area of north-oriented glaciers decreased the most (-125.43 km(2)), but the west- and east-oriented glaciers retreated at the fastest rate (i.e., -27.11% and -27.10%). All glaciers showed a decreasing trend in sub-regions of the Qaidam Basin from 1977 to 2018. The decreasing trend was accelerated gradually from northwest to southeast in the northern part of the basin, while glacier change was the smallest in the middle section and gradually accelerated towards both ends of the basin's southern part. The temperature had continued to rise, and the precipitation had increased slowly in the Qaidam Basin during the past 50 years. The continuous rise in air temperature was the main reason for the retreat of glaciers.

TI  - Sediment concentration variations in the East China Seas over multiple timescales indicated by satellite observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the East China Seas (ECSs) is modulated by a host of physical processes such as wind waves, tides, and circulations on different timescales, which in turn lead to SSC variations on the corresponding timescales. However, understanding of SSC variations and their modulation mechanisms remain limited. This study aims to quantify SSC variations on multiple timescales (intratidal, spring-neap, seasonal and long-term timescales) and their modulation mechanisms using high spatial-temporal resolution satellite remote sensing data from MODIS and GOCI. The results indicate that in the ECSs (total area 13.0x10(5) km(2)), the seasonal variations of wind-waves and ocean stratification play the most important roles in modulating SSC, causing high SSC variation (> 30 mg/L) in 7.33% of the total area, and medium SSC variation (5-30 mg/L) in 31.57% of the total area. Tidal current variations on intratidal timescale play the next most important role, causing high SSC variation in 0.60% of the study area and medium SSC variation in 26.10% of the study area. Spring-neap tidal current variations also have a significant influence on modulating SSC, causing high SSC variation in 0.06% of the study area, and medium SSC variation in 13.10% of the study area. SSC variations on long-term timescale (10 years) are not significant, as strong long-term SSC variations are only observed in an area of 0.0012x10(5) km(2) in the Bohai Sea. These new SSC datasets provide an important new data source to better understand SSC spatial-temporal variability and modulation mechanisms in the ECSs.

TI  - Assessing Community-Level Livability Using Combined Remote Sensing and Internet-Based Big Geospatial Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid urbanization, retrieving livability information of human settlements in time is essential for urban planning and governance. However, livability assessments are often limited by data availability and data update cycle, and this problem is more serious when making an assessment at finer spatial scales (e.g., community level). Here we aim to develop a reliable and dynamic model for community-level livability assessment taking Linyi city in Shandong Province, China as a case study. First, we constructed a hierarchical index system for livability assessment, and derived data for each index and community from remotely sensed data or Internet-based geospatial data. Next, we calculated the livability scores for all communities and assessed their uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations. The results showed that the mean livability score of all communities was 59. The old urban and newly developed districts of our study area had the best livability, and got a livability score of 62 and 58 respectively, while industrial districts had the poorest conditions with an average livability score of 48. Results by dimension showed that the old urban district had better conditions of living amenity and travel convenience, but poorer conditions of environmental health and comfort. The newly developed districts were the opposite. We conclude that our model is effective and extendible for rapidly assessing community-level livability, which provides detailed and useful information of human settlements for sustainable urban planning and governance.

TI  - The Structure of Potential Amur Tiger (<i>Panthera tigris altaica</i>) Habitats and Evaluation of Its Prey in Taipingou National Reserve (China) Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The population of the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in the Russian Far East is currently being restored; young individuals are being spread within the historical range, including territory in China. Here, the assessment of the suitability for the territories that exist in Northeastern China as the Amur tiger habitat and its food supply-prey base (three species of ungulates, namely wild boar, red deer and roe deer) are shown. A specially protected area-the Taipingou Natural Reserve, located on the border of the People's Republic of China and Russia-was examined. The modelling of habitat suitability for ungulates was performed on the basis of Earth remote sensing data by using two different approaches: expert geo-information assessment of the territory and discriminant analysis modelling. Based on discriminant analysis, the modelling of the suitability of ungulate habitats (without the variability of plant communities) showed a small difference between the model results for wild boar and roe deer. Nevertheless, the connection with the morphometric characteristics of the relief was more important for the wild boar than the roe deer. Furthermore, the variability of vegetation types was more important for the roe deer. The analysis of the biotopes showed that wild boars prefer the central and northern parts of Taipingou National Reserve, while the main roe deer distribution is in the western part of the Reserve; red deer are more common in the southern part of the Reserve.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Hydrological Variations and Their Impacts on Vegetation in Semiarid Areas from Multiple Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of hydrological components and their impacts on vegetation are critical for comprehending hydrological, climatological, and ecological processes under environmental change and solving future water management challenges. Innovative methods need to be developed in semiarid areas to analyze the special hydrological factors in the water resource systems of these areas. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were applied with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data in this paper to analyze spatiotemporal changes of hydrological factors in the Xiliaohe River Basin (XRB). The results showed that precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET) and temperature (T) had similar seasonal change patterns at rates of 0.05 cm/yr., 0.01 cm/yr. and -0.05 degrees C/yr., respectively. Total water storage change (TWSC) was consistent with the change trend of soil moisture change (SMC) and showed a fluctuating trend. Groundwater change (GWC) showed a decreasing trend at a rate of -0.43 cm/yr. P and ET had a greater impact on GLDAS data (R = 0.634, P < 0.05 and R = 0.686, P < 0.01, respectively) than on other factors. GWC was more sensitive to changes in T (R = 0.570, P < 0.05). Furthermore, a lag period of 0 to 1 months was observed for the effects of P and ET on TWSC and GLDAS. NDVI showed an upward trend at a rate of 0.001 yr(-1) between 2002 and 2014. A spatial distribution of NDVI was heterogeneous in the study area. ET, GLDAS and GWC in growing season limited vegetation growth and were more important than other factors in XRB. The results may contribute to an understanding of the relationships between the hydrological cycle and climate change and provide scientific support for local environmental management.

TI  - The Prohibition of Discrimination and Unequal Treatment of Women and Homosexuals in the Spheres of Work and in Public Life <i>An Empirical Comparative Study on the Influence of Religion and National Culture</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Differences in race, ethnic origin, gender, belief and worldview, disability and chronic disease, age, and sexual orientation must not be a reason for discriminating against people. Non-discrimination is enshrined as a fundamental right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in numerous subsequent documents and in the constitutions of democratic states. Also the major religions are hostile to discriminatory distinctions. Among the groups that repeatedly experience discrimination are, on the one hand, women, who have to put up with disadvantages even in countries that advocate equality. Secondly, they include people with a homosexual orientation, who sometimes have to endure open rejection. This research uses a sample of N=5363 from 10 countries to examine the attitudes of young people about non-discrimination. Specifically, it asks whether religious belonging and the country of origin show any impact on this attitude, and whether the religiosity of respondents moderates the influence of religion and country. The empirical findings show that discrimination against women is rejected, but with differences between religious groups and countries. Homosexuality is seen more controversially and there is no uniform rejection of discrimination against homosexuals. However, depending on religious affiliation and national context, individual religiosity can have positive and negative effects on the rejection of discrimination.

TI  - Valuing natural capital amidst rapid urbanization: assessing the gross ecosystem product (GEP) of China's 'Chang-Zhu-Tan' megacity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) is an aggregate measure of the monetary value of final ecosystem services, or the direct benefits that people derive from nature. In this study, we focus on the 'Chang-Zhu-Tan' (CZT) urban agglomeration-an emerging megacity of over 15 million people situated on the Yangtze River-as a case study of the dynamics of ecological production amidst rapid urbanization. In this study, we couple a spatial-temporal analysis of regional ecological change based on remote-sensing data with economic valuation methods (e.g. travel cost method) using official statistics and survey data. We find that while the land cover of natural ecosystems decreased slightly between 2000 and 2015, their quality-and therefore economic value-greatly improved. From 2000 to 2015, the GEP of CZT increased by 56.77%. In particular, the value of regulating services grew by 7.43% (calculated using inflation-adjusted prices). GEP can reflect nature's contribution to human well-being. At the same time, its long-term trends can serve as an indicator of the extent and quality of local and regional ecosystems, thereby providing a corrective or complement to more conventional measures of development. Although urbanization increases spatial constraints on the management of natural capital, progress in ecological protection and restoration can still improve the quality of ecosystems and the services they provide. Our study shows how GEP, and the value of natural capital it reflects, can grow amidst the pressures of rapid urbanization.

TI  - Climate-Related Changes in the Vegetation Cover of the Taiga and Tundra of West Siberia over the Period of 1982-2015 Based on Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a trend and correlation analysis of the air temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) performed for the warm season in the taiga and tundra zones of West Siberia over the period of 1982-2015. Both in the taiga and tundra zones, a significant increase in NDVI values is observed in certain months of the spring-summer period amid significant (alpha = 0.05) positive air temperature trends. The air temperature and NDVI trends have been computed for the taiga and tundra zones from April to October over the period of 1982-2015; the irregularity of their spatial distribution in the study area is demonstrated. It is established that the vegetation development during the warm season is significantly determined by its development in the first month of the warm season (May for taiga and June for tundra). In the taiga zone, the NDVI value in May is formed under the influence of April and May temperatures; in the tundra zone, it is formed in June under the influence of June temperatures. However, the input of May temperatures into the formation of the tundra vegetation cover has increased in recent years due to climate warming. Significant correlation coefficients between the NDVI and averaged temperatures in April-May and May-June are typical for most of the study area, except for coastal northern regions in the first case and southwestern regions in the second case.

TI  - Lymph node mapping in gastric cancer surgery: current status and new horizons
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the most important malignant diseases with significant geographical, ethnic, and socioeconomic differences in distribution. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is an accepted way to assess lymphatic spread in several solid tumors; however, the complexity of gastric lymphatic drainage may discourage use of this procedure, and the estimated accuracy rate is, in general, reasonably good. This study aimed at reviewing the current status of SLN mapping and navigation surgery in GC. SLN mapping should be limited to tumors clinically T1 and less than 4 cm in diameter. Combination SLN mapping with radioactive colloid and blue dye is used as the standard. Despite its notable limitations, SLN mapping and SLN navigation surgery present a novelty individualizing the extent of lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Spatiotemporal pattern of forest degradation and loss of ecosystem function associated with Rohingya influx: A geospatial approach
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Violence in Rakhine State of Myanmar forcibly displaced nearly one million Rohingya. They took refuge, from August 25, 2017 to the time of writing, in Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Peninsula of Bangladesh. Initially, nearly 2,000 ha of forested lands had to be cleared to accommodate them in one of the most ecologically critical areas (ECA) in the Peninsula. To support Rohingyas livelihoods, fuelwood collection and illegal logging have become widespread since their arrival, causing severe environmental degradation, including loss of a vast amount of forest cover. To devise conservation and protection strategies for a highly sensitive ecosystem, it is imperative to understand the degree of forest cover deterioration and associated impacts related to Rohingya emigration. This study employed satellite images and collateral data to monitor and model spatiotemporal patterns of forest cover degradation and loss of ecosystem function in Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Peninsula. Supervised classification method was used to derive multi-date land use/cover data which was then utilized to monitor spatiotemporal pattern of forest cover change from 2017 to 2019. A projection of forest cover loss was also carried out using the Markov chain with cellular automata technique. Dynamic modeling was performed to predict changes in forest covers, assuming that displaced Rohingya continues to reside in this environmentally sensitive location. The result revealed that 3,130 ha of forested lands of different categories were transformed into either refugee camps or Rohingya influenced degraded forests between 2017 and 2019. Prediction showed that around 5,115 ha of forest cover may experience loss from 2019 to 2027. Furthermore, aboveground biomass and carbon stock estimation indicated a consistent and substantial loss during the study period, which is likely to swell if present deforestation rate continues. The findings have considerable implications in developing conservation decisions, priority interventions and public policies to save the ECA of Bangladesh.

TI  - Traditional knowledge of mushrooms with biocultural importance in seven communities in the Chinantec region of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico
T2  - Scientia Fungorum
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Currently, the chinantec Mexican ethnic group has received little ethnomycological attention, despite the precise and profuse traditional knowledge that it has related to its fungal resource.Objective: To document the traditional knowledge related to the use and importance of wild mushrooms by the chinantec people.Methodology: During May to October 2018, visits to seven chinantec communities were conducted. Through unstructured, semi-structured and structured surveys, 10 % of the population of each of these communities were interviewed. In addition, field work was carried out with local experts where sporomes were collected.Results and conclusions: Thirty-six species used by the chinantec people were registered, of which 31 are consumed and prepared in eight different ways; three are used in traditional medicine, and two are used with ludic purposes. In addition, 27 names were reported in chinantec language, which in all cases have the root "Nit" or "Nat" that means fungus, followed by two or three adjectives that refer to elements of the chinantec worldview. The present work analyses the biocultural importance of wild mushrooms in the millennian chinantec group.

TI  - The use of remote sensing to derive maize sowing dates for large-scale crop yield simulations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major sources of uncertainty in large-scale crop modeling is the lack of information capturing the spatiotemporal variability of crop sowing dates. Remote sensing can contribute to reducing such uncertainties by providing essential spatial and temporal information to crop models and improving the accuracy of yield predictions. However, little is known about the impacts of the differences in crop sowing dates estimated by using remote sensing (RS) and other established methods, the uncertainties introduced by the thresholds used in these methods, and the sensitivity of simulated crop yields to these uncertainties in crop sowing dates. In the present study, we performed a systematic sensitivity analysis using various scenarios. The LINTUL-5 crop model implemented in the SIMPLACE modeling platform was applied during the period 2001-2016 to simulate maize yields across four provinces in South Africa using previously defined scenarios of sowing dates. As expected, the selected methodology and the selected threshold considerably influenced the estimated sowing dates (up to 51 days) and resulted in differences in the long-term mean maize yield reaching up to 1.7 t ha(-1) (48% of the mean yield) at the province level. Using RS-derived sowing date estimations resulted in a better representation of the yield variability in space and time since the use of RS information not only relies on precipitation but also captures the impacts of socioeconomic factors on the sowing decision, particularly for smallholder farmers. The model was not able to reproduce the observed yield anomalies in Free State (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.16 to 0.23) and Mpumalanga (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.11 to 0.18) in South Africa when using fixed and precipitation rule-based sowing date estimations. Further research with high-resolution climate and soil data and ground-based observations is required to better understand the sources of the uncertainties in RS information and to test whether the results presented herein can be generalized among crop models with different levels of complexity and across distinct field crops.

TI  - Alexander Bogdanov's holistic world picture: a materialist mirror image of idealism
T2  - STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 1899 and 1906, Alexander Bogdanov developed a scientific philosophy intended to substantiate the basic principle of historical materialism-the idea that existence determines consciousness-in terms of the most advanced science and empiricist epistemology/ontology of his day. At the same time, however, he strove 'to answer the broad needs of our workers for an overall worldview', and in the process of doing so he elaborated a complete philosophical system and a holistic worldview. Although his intention was to serve the proletariat and advance socialist revolution, Bogdanov also provided the sort of integral vision of the interconnectedness of the individual, society, and the cosmos that the Russian intelligentsia had traditionally pursued. Bogdanov adopted a number of the principles of nineteenth-century German and Russian idealism, including the concept of the unity of the subject and the object and the ideas that the laws of thought are the same as the laws of being, that there is no qualitative difference between humans and nature, and that humanity is central in the progressive development of the cosmos. Bogdanov, however, provided a materialist mirror image of the idealist worldview. While Russian idealists celebrated spirituality, individual personhood, freedom, and religion, Bogdanov advocated materialism, collectivism, determinism, and naturalism.

TI  - A Comparative Study of the Innate Humoral Immune Response to Avian Influenza Virus in Wild and Domestic Mallards
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Domestic mallards (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) are traditionally used as a model to investigate infection dynamics and immune responses to low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) in free-living mallards. However, it is unclear whether the immune response of domestic birds reflects the response of their free-living counterparts naturally exposed to these viruses. We investigated the extent to which the innate humoral immune response was similar among (i) wild-type domestic mallards in primary and secondary infection with LPAIV H4N6 in a laboratory setting (laboratory mallards), (ii) wild-type domestic mallards naturally exposed to LPAIVs in a semi-natural setting (sentinel mallards), and (iii) free-living mallards naturally exposed to LPAIVs. We quantified innate humoral immune function by measuring non-specific natural antibodies (agglutination), complement activity (lysis), and the acute phase protein haptoglobin. We demonstrate that complement activity in the first 3 days after LPAIV exposure was higher in primary-exposed laboratory mallards than in sentinel and free-living mallards. LPAIV H4N6 likely activated the complement system and the acute phase response in primary-exposed laboratory mallards, as lysis was higher and haptoglobin lower at day 3 and 7 post-exposure compared to baseline immune function measured prior to exposure. There were no differences observed in natural antibody and haptoglobin concentrations among laboratory, sentinel, and free-living mallards in the first 3 days after LPAIV exposure. Our study demonstrates that, based on the three innate humoral immune parameters measured, domestic mallards seem an appropriate model to investigate innate immunology of their free-living counterparts, albeit the innate immune response of secondary-LPAIV exposed mallards is a better proxy for the innate immune response in pre-exposed free-living mallards than that of immunologically naive mallards.

TI  - RSDB: an easy to deploy open-source web platform for remote sensing raster and point cloud data management, exploration and processing
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring biodiversity and its change over space and time is a key challenge for ecological research. Utilizing remote sensing data in ecological research has been shown to be a powerful complement to labor-intensive field work to derive area-wide biodiversity indices, which can also capture larger spatiotemporal areas. However, preprocessing different types of remote sensing data for specific studies often requires extensive computational skills as the algorithms for creating final data products are scattered across the literature.Our remote sensing database (RSDB, <>) serves as an integrative storage, management and processing solution for several types of remote sensing data. Transparent data processing capabilities for more than 200 biodiversity-related indices are included and can be used to calculate ready-to-use data products for a variety of ecological studies. These data products, for example, leaf area, vertical distribution of biomass and foliage height derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, are individually calculated for user-specified study areas and can serve as proxies for ecological variables, such as the availability of resources or habitat heterogeneity.The primary RSDB user interface is web browser based on management, exploration, visualization and product processing capabilities. The RSDB stores data in layers that are discoverable by textual metadata and mapping on overview maps. Individual data layers can be explored using interactive maps and 3-D visualizations. We additionally provide a seamless connection of the RSDB's functionality with the R environment through our accompanying R package for scripting and advanced processing tasks.We designed the RSDB to be an easily accessible solution for on-demand processing of comprehensive biodiversity indices. To date, the RSDB has been used and tested in several studies, and we are convinced that it will continue to facilitate biodiversity monitoring via its application to ecological research.

TI  - Comparison of hourly aerosol retrievals from JAXA Himawari/AHI in version 3.0 and a simple customized method
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Himawari imager (AHI) carried on the new-generation geostationary meteorological Himawari-8 satellite of Japan has been generating aerosol observations with a high temporal resolution since 7 July 2015. However, the previous studies lack a comprehensive quality assessment and spatial coverage analysis of AHI hourly aerosol products (level 3 version 3.0) across the full disk scan. The monitoring accuracy of different AHI aerosol products (AOD(pure) and AOD(merged)) and a simple customized product (AOD(mean)) was evaluated against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations from May 2016 to February 2019 in this study. Results showed that AHI AOD(mean) demonstrates a better agreement to AERONET AOD measurements than AOD(pure) and AOD(merged) over land (R=0.81, bias=-0.011) and all the AHI land retrievals present a significant regional performance differences, while the relatively better performance is observed in AOD(merged) over the coastal regions (R=0.89, bias=0.053). Over ocean, AHI exhibited overall overestimation in retrieving AOD against MAN observations and the relatively lower uncertainties were found in AOD(pure) retrievals (R=0.96, bias=0.057). The hourly comparisons in different AHI products demonstrated a robust performance in the late afternoon (16:00-17:00 LT) over land and around the noon (10:00-13:00 LT) over coast. AHI AOD products indicated an obvious underestimation when compared to MODIS AOD retrievals over both land and ocean. Furthermore, the performance differences of AHI AOD products have also affected by the vegetation cover, pollution levels and relative humidity. For spatiotemporal coverage, the results of different AHI products demonstrated that AOD(mean) can achieve relatively higher coverage than AOD(pure) and AOD(merged), and AHI retrievals present significant regional differences in coverage capability.

TI  - Improved detection of sentinel lymph node metastases allows reliable intraoperative identification of patients with extended axillary lymph node involvement in early breast cancer
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background An improved procedure that allows accurate detection of negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) and of SLN macrometastases during surgery would be highly desirable in order to protect patients from further surgery and to avoid unnecessary costs. We evaluated the accuracy of an intraoperative procedure that combines touch imprint cytology (TIC) and subsequent frozen section (FS) analysis. 2276 SLNs from 1072 patients with clinical node-negative early breast cancer were evaluated during surgery using TIC. Only cytologically-positive SLN were subsequently analysed with a single FS, preserving cytologically-negative SLN for the final postoperative histological diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity and the accuracy of this approach were analysed by comparing the results from intra- and postoperative SLN and axillary node evaluation. This intraoperative method displayed 100% specificity for SLN metastases and was significantly more sensitive for prognostically relevant macrometastases (85%) than for micrometastases (10%). Sensitivity was highest for patients with two or more positive LNs (96%) than for those with only one (72%). 98% of the patients with final pN2a-pN3a were already identified during surgery. Patients who received primary axillary lymph node dissection had significantly more frequent metastases in further LNs (44.6%). Sensitivity was highest for patients with luminal-B, HER2+ and triple negative breast cancer and for any subtype if Ki-67 > 40%. TIC and subsequent FS of cytologically-positive SLNs is highly reliable for detection of SLN macrometastases, and allows accurate identification of patients with a high risk of extended axillary involvement during surgery, as well as accurate histological diagnosis of negative SLN.

TI  - Cloud-native Seascape Mapping of Mozambique's Quirimbas National Park with Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of detailed spatial information on coastal resources, notably shallow water coral reefs and associated benthic habitats, impedes our ability to protect and manage them in the face of global climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we develop a semi-automated workflow in the cloud that uses freely available Sentinel-2 data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus programme to derive information on near-shore coral reef habitats in the Quirimbas National Park (QNP), a recently declared biosphere reserve in northern Mozambique. We use an end-to-end cloud-based framework within the Google Earth Engine cloud geospatial platform to process imagery from raw pixels to cloud-free composites which are corrected for glint and surface artefacts, water column and derived estimated depth and then classified into four benthic habitats. Using independent training and validation data, we apply three supervised classification algorithms: random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and classification and regression trees (CART). Our results show that random forests are the most accurate supervised algorithm with over 82% overall accuracy. We mapped over 105 000 ha of shallow water habitat inside the protected area, of which 18% are dominated by coral and hardbottom; 27.5% are seagrass and submerged aquatic vegetation and another 23.4% are soft and sandy substrates, and the remaining area is optically deep water. We employ satellite-derived bathymetry to assess slope, bathymetric position, rugosity and underwater topography of these habitats. Finally, a spectral unmixing model provides further sub-pixel-level information of habitats with the potential to monitor changes over time. This effort provides the first, consistent and repeatable and also scalable coastal information system for an east African tropical marine protected area, which hosts shallow-water ecosystems which are of great significance to local communities and building resilience towards climate change.

TI  - Application of remote sensing technology to estimate productivity and assess phylogenetic heritability
T2  - APPLICATIONS IN PLANT SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - PREMISE Measuring plant productivity is critical to understanding complex community interactions. Many traditional methods for estimating productivity, such as direct measurements of biomass and cover, are resource intensive, and remote sensing techniques are emerging as viable alternatives.METHODS We explore drone-based remote sensing tools to estimate productivity in a tallgrass prairie restoration experiment and evaluate their ability to predict direct measures of productivity. We apply these various productivity measures to trace the evolution of plant productivity and the traits underlying it.RESULTS The correlation between remote sensing data and direct measurements of productivity varies depending on vegetation diversity, but the volume of vegetation estimated from drone-based photogrammetry is among the best predictors of biomass and cover regardless of community composition. The commonly used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a less accurate predictor of biomass and cover than other equally accessible vegetation indices. We found that the traits most strongly correlated with productivity have lower phylogenetic signal, reflecting the fact that high productivity is convergent across the phylogeny of prairie species. This history of trait convergence connects phylogenetic diversity to plant community assembly and succession.DISCUSSION Our study demonstrates (1) the importance of considering phylogenetic diversity when setting management goals in a threatened North American grassland ecosystem and (2) the utility of remote sensing as a complement to ground measurements of grassland productivity for both applied and fundamental questions.

TI  - Exploring the African Philosophy of Humor through Igbo Proverbs on Laughter
T2  - SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - An understudied aspect of African thought is the question of laughter and humor. Little attempt has, as yet, been made to locate whether laughter and humor add any value in the African worldview and whether this has any theoretical potential in the effort to improve the human condition through an African perspective. By "improving the human condition" is meant (re-)articulating those core values, such as peace, happiness, and contentment, around which life and human existence acquire meaning and is lived in the best possible manner. This article sets out to address this knowledge gap. It provides views that illustrate a philosophy of humor with an African pedigree. To do this, it maps out a variety of axioms and proverbs in Igbo thought to interpret them and illustrate the insight they provide in locating an African philosophy of humor. The method applied is a mixed method of hermeneutics and critical synthesis.

TI  - Investigating the presence of equine piroplasmosis in Ireland
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a notifiable disease in Ireland and a significant concern to domestic and international equine industries. Information regarding EP presence in Ireland is currently limited. This retrospective surveillance study describes a serological and molecular analysis of blood samples submitted to the Irish Equine Centre for EP testing between January 2013 and April 2016.Methods: Following serological testing, seropositive samples were screened using a PCR targeting the 18S ribosomal RNA gene. Amplicon sequences were bioinformatically analysed to identify the parasite species and to assess genetic diversity.Results: From 2099 screened equine blood samples, 2.5 per cent and 1 per cent were seropositive for Theileria equi and Babesia caballi, respectively. T equi DNA was detected in 9 per cent of the seropositive samples while B caballi DNA was not detected in any sample. The T equi DNA sequences displayed no genetic diversity at this locus, in contrast to samples from the UK and from endemic areas.Conclusion: Detection of EP-seropositive and parasitaemic horses in Ireland indicates a clear and present health risk to the equine population. It is recommended that owners adopt appropriate biosecurity measures and that clinicians are mindful of this disease as a differential diagnosis.

TI  - The Reduction in Near-Global Cloud Cover After Correcting for Biases Caused by Finite Resolution Measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A solution to the common problem that sensors have in overestimating cloud fraction (CF) due to their finite resolution is implemented by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) to produce a resolution-corrected CF product. Here we evaluate the efficacy of this product toward the development of an improved global cloud climatology. We found a large reduction in CF across various regions of the globe due to the correction, with reductions >0.4 in regions dominated by shallow cumulus clouds. The MISR resolution-corrected CF lies within +/- 0.05-0.08 of 180 randomly selected scenes of 15-m resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data, where MISR uncorrected CF and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) CF overestimated this benchmark by 0.40-0.50. We conclude that the CF between 50 degrees N and 50 degrees S is much lower than that reported by the original MISR and MODIS and that the new MISR cloud product indeed provides improved estimates of CF.

TI  - Lessons learned from histological step-sectioning of sentinel lymph nodes in penile cancer
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Histopathological examination of sentinel lymph nodes in penile cancer has varied during the first 10 years after introduction of the dynamic sentinel node (SLN) procedure in Denmark, and guidelines have been sparse. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of rigorous step-sectioning of sentinel lymph nodes in penile cancer and improve guidelines.Methods and results Seventy-two penile squamous cell carcinoma patients undergoing SLN procedure at a single institution in 2000-2010 were included. The archived lymph node tissues already subjected to a standard pathological examination were retrieved and the initially negative lymph nodes were subjected to an extended step-sectioning procedure. The results were compared to clinical patient outcome from a national database and subsequent pathology reports. The original histopathological examination had detected 26 SLN with metastasis, 21 macro metastases and five micro metastases. The additional step-sectioning procedure of this study generated 4606 slides; seven SLN metastases, two macro metastases and five micro metastases, were detected. One of the macro metastases originated from a patient in which a clinical relapse had occurred in the same groin. None of the other metastases detected in this study showed ipsilateral relapse during follow-up.Conclusion The results underline the value of our current practice of step-sectioning sentinel lymph nodes in penile cancer and the need for histopathological routines and guidelines. The Danish national guidelines on histopathological handling of sentinel lymph nodes have been adapted to detect any potential clinically relevant metastases.

TI  - Observational Evidence of the Basin-Wide Gyre Reversal in the Gulf of Taranto
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper shows for the first time the observational evidence of basin-wide gyre reversal in the Gulf of Taranto (north-western Ionian Sea in the eastern Mediterranean Sea) by means of two specifically designed in situ oceanographic campaigns (based on CTD and ADCP measurements). The analysis of the in situ data shows a change in circulation from anticyclonic in October 2014 to cyclonic in June-July 2016. Furthermore, long-term (1993-2018) analysis using gridded satellite altimetry data in the Gulf of Taranto shows that the cyclonic gyres are more frequent than anticyclonic gyres. The latter occur only for 2 to 3 years at a time in some decades.Plain Language Summary The work shows the observational evidence of a phenomenon named gyre reversal (the circulation changes from cyclonic to anticyclonic), occurring in ocean regions with specific geometry characteristics, among others the Gulfs. In particular, our results unequivocally show for the first time the reversal of the basin-scale gyre circulation in the Gulf of Taranto (north-western Ionian Sea in the eastern Mediterranean Sea), by means of in situ oceanographic measurements and satellite data.

TI  - Geodetic Source Modeling of the 2019 M<sub>w</sub> 6.3 Durres, Albania, Earthquake: Partial Rupture of a Blind Reverse Fault
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We address geometric and kinematic properties of the M-w 6.3 26 November 2019 Durres earthquake, the strongest earthquake in Albania in the past 40 years. Using coseismic surface displacements from Sentinel-1 Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) and nearby Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) stations, we invert for the geometry and slip of the causative fault. We find that both a steep SW-dipping fault (dip 71 degrees) and a shallow NE-dipping fault (dip 15 degrees) can fit the data equally well. However, the slip on the SW-dipping fault occurs at depths 11-23 km, similar to the depths of the mainshock and aftershock seismicity, and thus, we prefer that model. The location of our preferred fault plane correlates with the mapped SW-dipping backthrust, the Vore fault. The fault rupture did not reach the surface, which implies that an updip stress propagation onto the unruptured shallow portion of the Vore fault and its secondary structures pose an increased seismic hazard for cities in Albania, including the capital, Tirana.

TI  - Risk-based surveillance for bluetongue virus in cattle on the south coast of England in 2017 and 2018
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Bluetongue (BT) is a viral disease of ruminants and camelids which can have a significant impact on animal health and welfare and cause severe economic loss. The UK has been officially free of bluetongue virus (BTV) since 2011. In 2015, BTV-8 re-emerged in France and since then BTV has been spreading throughout Europe. In response to this outbreak, risk-based active surveillance was carried out at the end of the vector seasons in 2017 and 2018 to assess the risk of incursion of BTV into Great Britain.Method: Atmospheric dispersion modelling identified counties on the south coast of England at higher risk of an incursion. Blood samples were collected from cattle in five counties based on a sample size designed to detect at least one positive if the prevalence was 5 per cent or greater, with 95 per cent confidence.Results: No virus was detected in the 478 samples collected from 32 farms at the end of the 2017 vector season or in the 646 samples collected from 43 farms at the end of the 2018 vector season, when tested by RT-qPCR.Conclusion: The negative results from this risk-based survey provided evidence to support the continuation of the UK's official BTV-free status.

TI  - A classifier-combined method based on D-S evidence theory for the land cover classification of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a region with high altitudes and complicated terrain conditions. Due to the special conditions of this region, it is also regarded as the third pole of the Earth. The land cover and vegetation in this region have not been extensively studied, so this study investigated the possibility of using a combined classifier that was established based on D-S evidence theory to extract the land cover of the TP. Multiple feature images were obtained based on a single classification rule, and the feature images were normalized to obtain the basic probability assignment (BPA). The BPA was used as the evidence source to represent the belief level of each type of land cover. The information for the different belief levels was combined based on the D-S evidence theory. The maximum belief level of the combination results was used to identify the land cover types on the TP. The results of this study indicate that based on the D-S evidence theory, multiple classifiers can effectively be combined to improve the classification results. This study has also revealed that more classifiers fused together to make a combined classifier did not result in the combined classifier's accuracy being higher than those of the original classifiers. Higher accuracies were only obtained when more high accuracy evidence theory was used in the classifier combination, in which case, the combined classifier's classification accuracy was also high.

TI  - On the Covariation of Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Photosynthesis Across Scales
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have garnered wide interest from the biogeoscience and Earth system science communities, due to the observed linearity between SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) at increasing spatiotemporal scales. Three recent studies, Maguire et al., (2020, ), He et al. (2020, ), and Marrs et al. (2020, ) highlight a nonlinear relationship between fluorescence and photochemical yields and show empirical evidence for the decoupling of SIF, stomata, and the carbon reactions of photosynthesis. Such mechanistic studies help advance our understanding of what SIF is and what it is not. We argue that these findings are not necessarily contradictory to the linear SIF-GPP relationship observed at the satellite scale and provide context for where, when, and why fluorescence and photosynthesis diverge at smaller spatiotemporal scales. Understanding scale dependencies of remote sensing data is crucial for interpreting SIF as a proxy for GPP.Plain Language Summary When exposed to light, plants re-emit a small amount of light from chlorophyll molecules called fluorescence. Remote sensing instruments are now capable of measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (which is emitted between 650-850 nm) from canopies to the globe (solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; SIF). A growing number of papers have highlighted an empirical linear relationship between SIF and whole-ecosystem photosynthesis (gross primary productivity; GPP). These advances have excited the broader Earth science research community, but recent studies have pointed out that the linear SIF-GPP relationship at coarse scales does not hold true at smaller spatiotemporal scales. In this commentary, we synthesize three recent studies that provide insight into the relationship between fluorescence and photosynthesis at leaf and canopy scales, under natural and controlled conditions. At fine spatiotemporal scales, fluorescence can be decoupled with photosynthetic carbon uptake, but we argue that satellite measurements are often too coarse in time and space to observe the SIF-photosynthesis decoupling and that the integration of canopy processes explains the observed linearity. As such, SIF plays an important role as an estimate of GPP at spatial and temporal scales relevant for monitoring global terrestrial productivity, benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and earth system models, and managing ecosystems.Key PointsSolar-induced fluorescence (SIF) is widely used as a remote estimate of ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP), but why does it work? Three recent studies point to inherent nonlinearities in the fluorescence-photosynthesis relationship at fine spatiotemporal scales We synthesize mechanisms to suggest that these results are not contradictory to the increasingly linear SIF:GPP relationship across scales

TI  - Water, water, but not everywhere: analysis of shrinking water bodies using open access satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of water cannot be overstated. Not only it is essential for life, it is a vital resource for sustainable development. Water resource management is pivotal to ensure water security and sustainability. Having such water monitoring resources is challenging, especially in less developed countries that have limited resources. With the advancement in technology and availability of open-access satellite data, there are opportunities to reinforce the abilities of researchers and decision-makers to monitor and identify changes in water resources. In this work, we describe an easy to implement workflow for estimation of surface area of waterbodies using open-access data from Sentinel-2 satellites. The method uses Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) for surface water detection that is used to estimate the surface area of the waterbody and analyse changes over a period of time. We develop four case studies based on waterbodies in Spain, Morocco, and India to highlight how satellite imaging can effectively help in estimating and visualizing the changes in water surface area. Temperature and rainfall data are analysed to understand the impact of climate change on water resources due to increase in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns. The proposed method is validated by testing it on four additional lakes and comparing the results with publicly available data. We show how open-access satellite data can potentially be used for regular monitoring of waterbodies as well as filling the knowledge gap to assist in decision making at both local and regional levels.

AB  - The IFS (Internal Family Systems) model may be an effective framework for addictions treatment in Indian Country. When recovery from addiction and Indigenous wellbeing are understood from an Indigenous worldview perspective, the need for a treatment framework that aligns with a client's worldview becomes obvious. Through the storytelling dialogue of this article, the IFS model is located as a framework that has potential to align with the many unique cultures that are streams in an Indigenous worldview. The Western-developed IFS model's use in non-Western populations around the world points toward exploring its assumptions, language, and protocol for use in Indian Country.

TI  - Fracture aquifers identification in the Zou basin (West Africa) using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The riparian communities of the Zou basin of West Africa rely heavily on drinking water supplied by fractured aquifer systems. This study aims to provide accurate fracture maps and derived products (fracture density, coincidence map and cross-points) using Landsat 8 (visible and infrared bands) and PALSAR DEM datasets with borehole data collected from the national integrated database. Digital image processing techniques through image enhancement and directional Sobel filters application were used to analyse Landsat 8 and PALSAR data. Results show that the main orientations of fractures are N10-N20, N90-N100 and N180 for the visible, N10-N20, N40-N50, N90, N140 and N180 for the infrared and for the PALSAR DEM, they are N10-N20, N90-N100 and N170-N180. The fracture length overall interval is 0.15 to 21.2km and the cumulative length of each fracture map is adjusted to power law with characteristic of exponent respectively 0.86, 0.91 and 0.96. The chi square (chi(2)) test of cumulative length versus class frequency reveals a significant relationship for the visible and PALSAR fracture maps. Although, the calculated chi(2) is greater than the theoretical chi square for the infrared, there is a strong and positive correlation for the three fracture maps (0.94, 0.99 and 0.98). More than 50% of the fracture cross-points (CP) occurs with the North-South (NS) orientations. The coincidence map analysis shows that the PALSAR fracture map has the highest ratio of 0.88, proving it should prioritize over the visible and infrared maps. High flow (Q > 5 cubic m/h) boreholes located near the N10, N20 and N180 main orientations are more than 50% confirming their significant contribution to aquifers' productivity. The spatial and statistical analyses of these fractured aquifers are critical to improve drinking water access and water resources planning for the basin communities.

TI  - Detection of Coccolithophore Blooms With BioGeoChemical-Argo Floats
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coccolithophores (calcifying phytoplankton) form extensive blooms in temperate and subpolar oceans as evidenced from ocean-color satellites. This study examines the potential to detect coccolithophore blooms with BioGeoChemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats, autonomous ocean profilers equipped with bio-optical and physicochemical sensors. We first matched float data to ocean-color satellite data of calcite concentration to select floats that sampled coccolithophore blooms. We identified two floats in the Southern Ocean, which measured the particulate beam attenuation coefficient (c(p)) in addition to two core BGC-Argo variables, Chlorophyll-a concentration ([Chl-a]) and the particle backscattering coefficient (b(bp)). We show that coccolithophore blooms can be identified from floats by distinctively high values of (1) the b(bp)/c(p) ratio, a proxy for the refractive index of suspended particles, and (2) the b(bp)/[Chl-a] ratio, measurable by any BGC-Argo float. The latter thus paves the way to global investigations of environmental control of coccolithophore blooms and their role in carbon export.Plain Language Summary Coccolithophores are a group of phytoplankton that form an armor of calcite plates. Coccolithophores may form intense blooms which can be identified from space by so-called ocean-color satellites, providing global images of the color of the surface ocean. BioGeoChemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats, robots profiling down to 2,000 m with a variety of physicochemical and bio-optical sensors, present an increasingly attractive and cost-effective platform to study phytoplankton blooms and their impact on oceanic biogeochemical cycles. We show that coccolithophore blooms can be detected by BGC-Argo floats with high confidence, hence providing a new way to study them at the global scale as well as their role in sinking carbon.Key PointsWe matched profiling float trajectories with ocean-color satellite observations of coccolithophore blooms Two simple bio-optical indices permitted successful identification of coccolithophore blooms from floats in the Southern Ocean A method for identifying coccolithophore blooms at the global scale is proposed using regional thresholds of bio-optical float measurements

TI  - Detection of Melt Ponds on Arctic Summer Sea Ice From ICESat-2
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hemisphere-wide observations of melt ponds on sea ice are needed to understand their influence on the surface radiation budget of the Arctic Ocean and to extend the satellite sea ice thickness data record. Here we present a first assessment of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) over individual Arctic sea ice melt ponds with different reflective properties. We use coincident high-resolution satellite imagery from WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 over different sea ice topographies to show that smooth ponds are highly reflective and can saturate the ICESat-2 photon detection system. Rougher ponds have a more varied backscatter signal, and in some cases both the water and underlying ice surfaces are visible in photon height distributions. Characterizing the complex photon backscatter signals of melt ponds on sea ice is a first step toward automating retrievals of pond parameters such as width, melt pond fraction and depth, and improving higher-level ICESat-2 sea ice height and freeboard products.Plain Language Summary In summer, surface melt water forms ponds that can cover up to half of the Arctic sea ice surface. Because melt ponds reduce the reflective and insulative properties of sea ice, they can alter the Arctic energy budget and ecosystem. The presence of melt ponds also complicates satellite altimeter (radar and laser) estimates of sea ice freeboard (the height of the ice above the ocean) and thickness. Here we combine data from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) laser altimeter and high-resolution satellite imagery to locate individual melt ponds on Arctic sea ice. We explore how melt ponds affect the return laser signal and discuss how ICESat-2 data could be used to retrieve parameters of scientific interest such as melt pond width, fraction, and depth. We finish by summarizing the complications and potential solutions associated with sea ice height and freeboard retrievals from ICESat-2 in summer.Key PointsWe present a first assessment of NASA's ICESat-2 over a range of individual Arctic sea ice melt ponds ICESat-2 backscatter signatures over melt ponds vary significantly, depending on surface roughness Our ability to estimate melt pond width, fraction, and depth and improve ICESat-2 sea ice freeboard products depends on surface backscatter

TI  - Why Are There More Summer Afternoon Low Clouds Over the Tibetan Plateau Compared to Eastern China?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze the relationships between summer afternoon low cloud cover and environmental conditions over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Using in situ measurements, satellite data, and reanalysis, and based on theoretical analysis, we find that there is stronger thermal turbulence, lower temperature, and higher frequency of low cloud formation for the same surface relative humidity over the eastern and central TP compared with eastern China. With the same sensible heat flux, decreased air density enhances buoyancy flux, which increases the planetary boundary layer height and moisture vertical transport. At the same time, with the same near-surface relative humidity, lower temperature over the TP decreases the lifting condensation level, which increases the probability of the air parcel reaching this level. Compared to the low-elevation region in eastern China, these two mechanisms enhance low cloud occurrence in the afternoon over the TP.Plain Language Summary Previous studies suggested that planetary boundary layer processes play an important role in the formation of more low clouds in the afternoon over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, detailed mechanisms for the differences in low cloud occurrence in the afternoon over the TP versus eastern China (low-elevation region) remain unclear. Using in situ measurements, satellite data, and reanalysis, and based on theoretical analysis, we first quantify the more frequent low cloud occurrence over the TP, and then propose two mechanisms: (i) compared to eastern China, in the afternoon over the TP, the lower near-surface temperature results in a lower height where condensation occurs (given the same relative humidity), and (ii) the lower air density (given the same surface sensible heat flux) results in a larger buoyancy flux, leading to a deeper boundary layer. These two mechanisms work together to increase cloud formation in the afternoon over the TP.Key PointsThere are more summer afternoon low clouds over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) than over eastern China as a result of two mechanisms Compared to eastern China, with the same relative humidity, lower temperature over the TP results in a lower lifting condensation level With the same surface sensible heat flux, lower air density over the TP results in a larger buoyancy flux and a deeper boundary layer

TI  - Aseismic Deformation During the 2014 <i>M</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> 5.2 Karonga Earthquake, Malawi, From Satellite Interferometry and Earthquake Source Mechanisms
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aseismic deformation has been suggested as a mechanism to release the accumulated strain in rifts. However, the fraction and the spatial distribution of the aseismic strain are poorly constrained during amagmatic episodes. Using Sentinel-1 interferograms, we identify the surface deformation associated with the 2014 M(w)5.2 Karonga earthquake, Malawi, and perform inversions for fault geometry. We also analyze aftershocks and find a variety of source mechanisms within short timescales. A significant discrepancy in the earthquake depth determined by geodesy (3-6 km) and seismology (11-13 km) exists, although both methods indicate M(w)5.2. We propose that the surface deformation is caused by aseismic slip from a shallow depth. This vertical partitioning from seismic to aseismic strain is accommodated by intersecting dilatational faults in the shallow upper crust and sedimentary basin, highlighting the importance of considering aseismic deformation in active tectonics and time-averaged strain patterns, even in rifts with little volcanism.

TI  - A systematic exploration of satellite radar coherence methods for rapid landslide detection
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergency responders require information on the distribution of triggered landslides within 2 weeks of an earthquake or storm. Useable satellite radar imagery is acquired within days of any such event worldwide. Recently, several landslide detection methods that use these data have been developed, but testing of these methods has been limited in each case to a single event and satellite sensor. Here we systematically test five methods using ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 data across four triggering earthquakes. The best-performing method was dependent on the satellite sensor. For three of our four case study events, an initial ALOS-2 image was acquired within 2 weeks, and with these data, co-event coherence loss (CECL) is the best-performing method. Using a single post-event Sentinel-1 image, the best-performing method was the boxcar-sibling (Bx-S) method. We also present three new methods which incorporate a second post-event image. While the waiting time for this second post-event image is disadvantageous for emergency response, these methods perform more consistently and on average 10 % better across event and sensor type than the boxcar- sibling and CECL methods. Thus, our results demonstrate that useful landslide density information can be generated on the timescale of emergency response and allow us to make recommendations on the best method based on the availability and latency of post-event radar data.

TI  - A Method to Update Model Kinematic States by Assimilating Satellite-Observed Total Lightning Data to Improve Convective Analysis and Forecasting
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the benefit of convective-scale data assimilation (DA) for model initialization using well-known functional relationships between lightning flash rate and vertical velocity. Based on the relationships, a lightning DA scheme to update model kinematic states was implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation (WRFDA) three-dimensional variational (3DVar) system. This scheme combines total lightning observations with model-based prescribed vertical velocity profiles to retrieve kinematic information through a DA scheme. With the availability of space-borne lightning imagers in recent years, total lightning observations from the Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) on board the FY-4A geostationary satellite were assimilated in combination with radar DA. A detailed analysis of the impact of the lightning DA scheme on convective precipitation forecasting was conducted using a squall line case over Beijing on 13 July 2017. The assimilation of LMI data provides added benefits to the assimilation of radar radial winds by reducing wind errors and strengthening convergence along the squall line in the analysis. Although the microphysical states are identical due to the assimilation of reflectivity, the lightning DA scheme helps in promoting updraft developments at lightning observation locations, which improves the representation of mixed-phase convection. The quantitative verification of short-term convective forecasts indicated that the lightning DA adds value to the radar DA by improving the precipitation forecast skill. The lightning DA scheme was evaluated further for a heavy rainfall case in 2018 over the Beijing metropolitan area and revealed overall similar forecast improvements for composite reflectivity and accumulated rainfall.Plain Language Summary Lightning flashes are closely related to the upward air motions in thunderstorms and hence are indicative of strong wind convergence. Currently, lightning imagers on board the geostationary satellites provide increased availability of lightning data over broad regions and can improve weather forecasting accuracy. This paper describes how the space-borne lightning observations could be employed to update model kinematic states and improve convective precipitation forecasting.

TI  - Using ICESat-2 and Operation IceBridge altimetry for supraglacial lake depth retrievals
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes and melt ponds occur in the ablation zones of Antarctica and Greenland during the summer months. Detection of lake extent, depth, and temporal evolution is important for understanding glacier dynamics. Previous remote sensing observations of lake depth are limited to estimates from passive satellite imagery, which has inherent uncertainties, and there is little ground truth available. In this study, we use laser altimetry data from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) over the Antarctic and Greenland ablation zones and the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) for Hiawatha Glacier (Greenland) to demonstrate retrievals of supraglacial lake depth. Using an algorithm to separate lake surfaces and beds, we present case studies for 12 supraglacial lakes with the ATM lidar and 12 lakes with ICESat-2. Both lidars reliably detect bottom returns for lake beds as deep as 7 m. Lake bed uncertainties for these retrievals are 0.05-0.20m for ATM and 0.12-0.80m for ICESat-2, with the highest uncertainties observed for lakes deeper than 4 m. The bimodal nature of lake returns means that high-confidence photons are often insufficient to fully profile lakes, so lower confidence and buffer photons are required to view the lake bed. Despite challenges in automation, the altimeter results are promising, and we expect them to serve as a benchmark for future studies of surface meltwater depths.

TI  - Accelerating land cover change in West Africa over four decades as population pressure increased
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population growth in West Africa has exerted increasing pressures on land resources, leading to observable changes in the land cover and land use. However, spatially explicit and thematically detailed quantitative analyses of land cover change over long time periods and at regional scale have been lacking. Here we present a change intensity analysis of a Landsat-based, visually interpreted, multi-date (1975, 2000, 2013) land cover dataset of West Africa, stratified into five bioclimatic sub-regions. Change intensities accelerated over time and increased from the arid to the sub-humid sub-regions, as did population densities. The area occupied by human-dominated land cover categories more than doubled from 493,000km(2) in 1975 to 1,121,000km(2) in 2013. Land cover change intensities within 10km of new settlement locations exceeded the region-wide average by up to a factor of three, substantiating the significant role of population pressure as a force of change. The spatial patterns of the human footprint in West Africa, however, suggest that not only population pressure but also changing socioeconomic conditions and policies shape the complexity of land cover outcomes. Land cover change has accelerated in West Africa between 1975 and 2013 as human-dominated land area more than doubled, suggest analyses of Landsat based land cover data sets.

TI  - The impact of monitoring techniques on progression to chronic breast cancer-related lymphedema: a meta-analysis comparing bioimpedance spectroscopy versus circumferential measurements
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Chronic breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a potentially serious complication following treatment. Monitoring for progression to BCRL may allow for earlier detection and intervention, reducing the rate of progression to chronic BCRL. Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of monitoring techniques on the incidence of chronic BCRL among patients monitored by bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) and circumference as compared to background rates. Methods Eligible peer-reviewed studies from PubMed, CINHAL, or Google Scholar that were published in English from 2013 onward and conducted in North America, Europe, or Oceania. Incidence rates abstracted from studies were classified by BCRL monitoring method: background (no standardized BIS or circumference assessments), BIS or circumference. A random-effects model was used to calculate a pooled annualized estimate of BCRL incidence while accounting for clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses examined differences in duration of follow-up as well as breast and axillary surgery. Results 50 studies were included, representing over 67,000 women. The annualized incidence of BCRL was 4.9% (95% CI: 4.3-5.5) for background studies (n = 35), 1.5% (95% CI: 0.6-2.4) for BIS-monitored studies (n = 7), and 7.7% (95% CI: 5.6-9.8) for circumference-monitored studies (n = 11). The cumulative BCRL incidence rate in BIS-monitored patients was 3.1% as compared to 12.9% with background monitoring (69% reduction) and 17.0% with circumference-monitored patients (81% reduction). Conclusions Evidence suggests that monitoring with BIS allowing for early intervention significantly reduces the relative risk of chronic BCRL with a 69% and 81% reduction compared to background and circumference, respectively. Circumference monitoring did not appear to provide a benefit with respect to chronic BCRL incidence. Based on these results, BIS should be considered for BCRL screening in order to detect subclinical BCRL and reduce rates of chronic BCRL, particularly in high-risk patients.

TI  - Remotely sensed characterization of <i>Acacia longifolia</i> invasive plants in the Cape Floristic region of the Western Cape, South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Acacia longifolia, like any other invasive species, poses a threat to the natural ecosystems in South Africa and beyond. In South Africa, the species is reported to cause significant loss to vegetation biodiversity and is associated with high water use. It remains a challenge to understand the extent of their invasion in complex landscapes, where the use of ground-based surveys is difficult. Considering the heterogeneity and complexity of hydrological and ecological processes at catchment scale, the implementation of remote sensing to detect the distribution of these species becomes critical for continuous monitoring of their extent and associated impacts. We, therefore, aim at species-specific characterization of the spatial distribution of Acacia longifolia invasive wood species at catchment scale within the Cape Floristic region located in the Western Cape Province, using Sentinel 2 remotely sensed data. Overall, the distribution of A. Longifolia was found to be patchy and heterogeneous, across the catchment. However, the main hot spots were detected within the fynbos vegetation, low-lying areas, as well as along the southern coastal belt. Although the catchment is predominantly under cultivation, A. longifolia was found to occupy almost 10% of its area. Classification using combined variables, using both vegetation indices and bands produced the highest overall accuracy of 88.66%, than when bands (66.19%) and indices (76.05%) were used as independent dataset. For example, the producer's classification accuracy of A. longifolia increased by almost 15%, whereas the user's increased by almost 10% from spectral bands accuracies. The classification of A. longifolia was primarily attributed to near-infrared, short wave-infrared (centered at 2190 nm), red edge (705 and 740 nm), as well as, chlorophyll vegetation index, the leaf water content index, and normalized difference vegetation index, derived using the near-infrared and red-edge band (at 740 nm) variables. The findings of this study underscore the relevance of satellite-based remote sensing in monitoring invasions in natural ecosystems and can be used as baseline information for invasivespecies clearing endeavors in the area.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Involvement by Epithelial Inclusions Mimicking Metastatic Carcinoma: A Diagnostic Pitfall
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Rare diseaseBackground: An epithelial inclusion cyst within a lymph node denotes a heterotopic phenomenon. Nodal epithelial inclusion cysts have been reported in a variety of anatomical locations including pelvic, abdominal, mediastinal, and axillary regions. While nodal melanocytic nevus (also known as nevus cell aggregates) is the most common heterotopic phenomena involving the axillary lymph nodes, the presence of benign epithelial inclusion cysts in axillary lymph nodes is a rare but well-reported finding. Such documentation is in part due to assessment of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer becoming standard of care. These epithelial inclusion cysts offer a diagnostic pitfall in evaluation of sentinel lymph node in the setting of breast carcinoma. They also complicate assessment of sentinel lymph node during intraoperative frozen sections analysis.Case Report: We report a case of co-existent of benign squamous-type and glandular-type epithelial inclusions cysts in 2 sentinel lymph nodes in a patient with grade III invasive ductal carcinoma involving the left breast. There have been at least 4 cases reported in literature in which benign epithelial inclusion cysts in sentinel lymph nodes were first mistakenly diagnosed as metastatic carcinoma both during intraoperative frozen section analysis and during review of permanent sections. The missed diagnosis could potentially occur intraoperatively during frozen section sentinel lymph node analysis secondarily due to lack of availability of the primary tumor for comparison and inability to use immunohistochemical stains.Conclusions: Pathologists should be aware of this pitfall especially in frozen section analysis of sentinel lymph node to avoid misdiagnosis and its associated potential grave consequences.

TI  - Dissecting the Lymphatic System to Predict Melanoma Metastasis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer in the United States. Current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging uses Breslow depth and ulceration as the two primary tumor factors that predict metastatic risk in cutaneous melanoma. Early disease stages are generally associated with high survival rates. However, in some cases, patients with thin melanomas develop advanced disease, suggesting other factors may contribute to the metastatic potential of an individual patient's melanoma. This review focuses on the role of the lymphatic system in the metastasis of cutaneous melanoma, from recent discoveries in mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis to elements of the lymphatic system that ultimately may aid clinicians in determining which patients are at highest risk. Ultimately, this review highlights the need to integrate pathological, morphological, and molecular characteristics of lymphatics into a "biomarker" for metastatic potential.

TI  - Impacts of Greenland Block Location on Clouds and Surface Energy Fluxes Over the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and blocking activity have been implicated as causes of increased Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) melt in the 21st century. Although Greenland blocks (i.e., long-lasting, mostly stationary anticyclones) generally reduce cloud cover and move warm air over Greenland, the elevated GrIS perturbs air and moisture transport in complex ways, implying a need to better understand how blocks affect cloud and surface energy flux anomaly patterns. In this study, we use a combination of daily MODIS cloud data and meteorological and energy flux data from MERRA-2 reanalysis to better understand how Greenland block location, separated into four equal-area quadrants, affects regional cloud and surface energy flux spatial patterns in the summer months of 2002-2018. Overall, cloud fraction and cloud water path reductions are approximately four times greater during northern block days than southern block days. Net cloud radiative forcing anomalies are negative for all Greenland block locations because negative longwave cloud radiative forcing anomalies exceed positive shortwave cloud radiative forcing changes. However, greater cloud cover reductions during northern block days produce more negative net cloud radiative forcing anomalies than southern block days. Greenland-average (i.e., latitude-weighted average of all GrIS grids) net surface energy flux anomalies range from +7 to +12W/m(2) for all block quadrants. While net shortwave energy anomalies dominate the total surface energy response during western Greenland block days, sensible heating is responsible for approximately half of positive total surface energy change during eastern Greenland block days.

TI  - Detecting precursors of an imminent landslide along the Jinsha River
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are major hazards that may pose serious threats to mountain communities. Even landslides in remote mountains could have non-negligible impacts on populous regions by blocking large rivers and forming dambreached mega floods. Usually, there are slope deformations before major landslides occur, and detecting precursors such as slope movement before major landslides is important for preventing possible disasters. In this work, we applied multi-temporal optical remote sensing images (Landsat 7 and Sentinel-2) and an image correlation method to detect subpixel slope deformations of a slope near the town of Mindu in the Tibet Autonomous Region. This slope is located on the right bank of the Jinsha River, similar to 80 km downstream from the famous Baige landslide. We used a DEMderived aspect to restrain background noise in image correlation results. We found the slope remained stable from November 2015 to November 2018 and moved significantly from November 2018. We used more data to analyse slope movement in 2019 and found retrogressive slope movements with increasingly large deformations near the riverbank. We also analysed spatial-temporal patterns of the slope deformation from October 2018 to February 2020 and found seasonal variations in slope deformations. Only the foot of the slope moved in dry seasons, whereas the entire slope was activated in rainy seasons. Until 24 August 2019, the size of the slope with displacements larger than 3 m was similar to that of the Baige landslide. However, the river width at the foot of this slope is much narrower than the river width at the foot of the Baige landslide. We speculate it may continue to slide down and threaten the Jinsha River. Further modelling works should be carried out to check if the imminent landslide could dam the Jinsha River and measures should be taken to mitigate possible dam breach flood disasters. This work illustrates the potential of using optical remote sensing to monitor slope deformations over remote mountain regions.

TI  - Salt dome related soil salinity in southern Iran: Prediction and mapping with averaging machine learning models
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to manage soil salinity effectively, it is necessary to understand the origin and the spatial distribution of salinity. There are about 120 salt dome outcrops in southern Iran and little is known about their contribution as the potential sources of salts and the spatial pattern of salts around them. Six machine learning algorithms were applied to model topsoil electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in the Darab Plain (surrounded by six salt domes), Fars Province. Decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), support vector machines (SVM), Cubist, random forests (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used as primary models and the Granger-Ramanathan (GR) method was used to combine the predictions of these models. The results showed that remotely sensed data contributed more to predict EC and SAR than terrain-based data. In terms of root mean square errors (RMSE), Cubist followed by the RF model, tended to give the best estimates of EC, whereas for SAR, RF performed best and was followed closely by SVM and Cubist. Compared to the primary models, the GR method on average resulted in a decrease of 6.1% and 3.9% in RMSE and an increase of 10% and 10.9% in R-2 for EC and SAR, respectively. The spatial pattern of SAR and EC suggested that the contribution of salt domes in soil salinization varied significantly according to their hydraulic behaviour in relation to adjacent aquifers and their activity. In general, the model averaging approach showed the potential to improve the estimates of EC and SAR.

TI  - Effect of climate change and urbanisation on flood protection decision-making
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The changing climate and the rapid urbanisation may alter flood severity and influence the decision-making process for flood management. In this study, a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework for optimal decision-making in flood protection is developed and applied to a central flood-prone basin of Jakarta, Indonesia. Specifically, the decisions are on levees corresponding to protection under different rainfall return periods (RP), considering climate change and associated uncertainties, urbanisation, and evolving socio-economic features of the flood plain. Three cases were studied to analyse future (year 2050) conditions (i) future rainfall/current urban, (ii) current rainfall/future urban and (iii) future rainfall/future urban. Future climate change projections from the NASA Earth Exchange are used to obtain information about changes in rainfall, whereas Landsat derived imperviousness maps along with the population projections are used for future urban conditions. Annual Expected Loss, Graduality, upgrade Construction cost and Net-Socio-Economic Vulnerability Index are the criteria used in the MCDA. It is found that climate change has a higher impact compared to urbanisation on the flood protection decisions. For the basin studied, the extreme future case of increased rainfall and urbanised conditions have the optimal decision in levee protection level corresponding to 250 years RP under current rainfall which corresponds to similar to 60 years RP under future rainfall.

TI  - Let your maps be fuzzy!-Class probabilities and floristic gradients as alternatives to crisp mapping for remote sensing of vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping vegetation as hard classes based on remote sensing data is a frequently applied approach, even though this crisp, categorical representation is not in line with nature's fuzziness. Gradual transitions in plant species composition in ecotones and faint compositional differences across different patches are thus poorly described in the resulting maps. Several concepts promise to provide better vegetation maps. These include (1) fuzzy classification (a.k.a. soft classification) that takes the probability of an image pixel's class membership into account and (2) gradient mapping based on ordination, which describes plant species composition as a floristic continuum and avoids a categorical description of vegetation patterns. A systematic and comprehensive comparison of these approaches is missing to date. This paper hence gives an overview of the state of the art in fuzzy classification and gradient mapping and compares the approaches in a case study. The advantages and disadvantages of the approaches are discussed and their performance is compared to hard classification (a.k.a. crisp or boolean classification). Gradient mapping best conserves the information in the original data and does not require an a priori categorization. Fuzzy classification comes close in terms of information loss and likewise preserves the continuous nature of vegetation, however, still relying on a priori classification. The need for a priori classification may be a disadvantage or, in other cases, an advantage because it allows using categorical input data instead of the detailed vegetation records required for ordination. Both approaches support spatially explicit accuracy analyses, which further improves the usefulness of the output maps. Gradient mapping and fuzzy classification offer various advantages over hard classification, can always be transformed into a crisp map and are generally applicable to various data structures. We thus recommend the use of these approaches over hard classification for applications in ecological research.

TI  - Shelf-oceanic dynamics of surface environmental parameters in the Kangaroo Island-Bonney Coast region
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The shelf and oceanic waters of the Kangaroo Island-Bonney Coast region are important foraging habitats for top marine predators in the ecosystem; however, the dynamics between the two distinct water types have not been investigated. This study examined the spatial and temporal variability of oceanographic parameters in the southern waters of Australia (36-43 degrees S, 136-141 degrees E) associated with the Bonney Upwelling (shelf) and subtropical front (STF; oceanic). Using satellite data from 1997 to 2016, we found that productive oceanic waters were associated with the STF and eddy activity; they were generally furthest from the shelf break in spring-summer (upwelling season on the shelf) and closest to the shelf break in winter-autumn (downwelling season on the shelf). Inter-annual variabilities of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), sea-surface temperature and sea surface-height anomaly were generally higher in summer than in winter for both shelf and oceanic waters. El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode and Indian Ocean Dipole were cross-correlated with anomalous shelf and oceanic Chl-a at various lagged times (range = 15-0 months). This study provides a regional perspective of the spatial and temporal oceanographic variability in southern Australian waters, which may help with understanding apex-predator ecology in the ecosystem.

TI  - Efficacy of extended release formulations of Natular™ (spinosad) against larvae and adults of <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes in western Kenya
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Larval source management is recommended as a supplementary vector control measure for the prevention of malaria. Among the concerns related to larviciding is the feasibility of implementation in tropical areas with large numbers of habitats and the need for frequent application. Formulated products of spinosad that are designed to be effective for several weeks may mitigate some of these concerns. Methods In a semi-field study, three formulations of spinosad (emulsifiable concentrate, extended release granules and tablet formulations) were tested in naturalistic habitats in comparison to an untreated control. Cohorts of third instar Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae) were introduced into the habitats in screened cages every week up to four weeks after application and monitored for survivorship over three days. A small-scale field trial was then conducted in two villages. Two of the spinosad formulations were applied in one village over the course of 18 months. Immature mosquito populations were monitored with standard dippers in sentinel sites and adult populations were monitored by pyrethrum spray catches. Results In the semi-field study, the efficacy of the emulsifiable concentrate of spinosad waned 1 week after treatment. Mortality in habitats treated with the extended release granular formulation of spinosad was initially high but declined gradually over 4 weeks while mortality in habitats treated with the dispersable tablet formulation was low immediately after treatment but rose to 100% through four weeks. In the field study, immature and adult Anopheles mosquito populations were significantly lower in the intervention village compared to the control village during the larviciding period. Numbers of collected mosquitoes were lower in the intervention village compared to the control village during the post-intervention period but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions The extended release granular formulation and the dispersible tablet formulations of spinosad are effective against larval Anopheles mosquitoes for up to four weeks and may be an effective tool as part of larval source management programmes for reducing adult mosquito density and malaria transmission.

TI  - Captive sentinel hosts efficiently measure the establishment, seasonality and dispersal of a parasitoid biological control agent
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduced biological control agents are used to suppress populations and reduce the damage caused by many exotic herbivorous insects in New Zealand pasture. Understanding the dispersal behaviour of a recently introduced biocontrol agent in its new environment is important as it helps biocontrol practitioners make decisions on the number and location of future releases. In this study, a monitoring device which contained sentinel hosts was developed to monitor the establishment and dispersal of the Irish strain of Microctonus aethiopoides (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) into areas of the South Island of New Zealand where the clover pest Sitona obsoletus Gmelin (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) had recently become established. Field tests of the monitoring device at five sites in Marlborough confirmed that M. aethiopoides would enter the device through a 900 mu m mesh and parasitise the sentinel weevils within. In a further trial conducted over 4 years at four sites in North Canterbury, monitoring devices successfully tracked the dispersal and establishment of M. aethiopoides at sites up to 27 km from the original release site. Monitoring devices containing sentinel hosts may help reduce the cost of classical biological control programmes as they enable rapid sampling of numerous sites and largely eliminate the time consuming practice of dissecting field collected hosts to determine the presence of the parasitoid.

TI  - Keeping up with the cool stars: one TESS year in the life of AB Doradus
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term, high precision photometry delivered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) enables us to gain new insight into known and hitherto well-studied stars. In this paper, we present the result of our TESS study of the photospheric activity of the rapid rotator AB Doradus. Due to its favorable position near the southern ecliptic pole, the TESS satellite recorded almost 600 rotations of AB Doradus with high cadence, allowing us to study starspots and flares on this ultra-active star. The observed peak-to-peak variation of the rotational modulations reaches almost 11%, and we find that the starspots on AB Doradus show highly preferred longitudinal positions. Using spot modeling, we measured the positions of the active regions on AB Doradus and we find that preferred spot configurations should include large regions extending from low to high stellar latitudes. We interpret the apparent movement of spots as the result of both differential rotation and spot evolution and argue that the typical spot lifetimes should range between 10 and 20 days. We further find a connection between the flare occurrence on AB Doradus and the visibility of the active regions on its surface, and we finally recalculated the star's rotation period using different methods and we compared it with previous determinations.

TI  - Dynamic Changes of the Ionospheric Artificial Airglow Region Caused by High-Power Radio Waves Based on a Joint Analysis of Night-Sky Snapshots in the 630 nm Line and Total Electron Content Variation Maps
T2  - RADIOPHYSICS AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a method for joint analysis of the night-sky snapshots and total electron content (TEC) variation maps and present a dynamic spatiotemporal configuration of the TEC variation intensity in the ionospheric airglow region in the red line of atomic oxygen (lambda = 630 nm) stimulated by high-power radio waves from the Sura facility. The measurements were performed on the 29th of August, 2016. Two-dimensional TEC variation maps were plotted according to a network of 30 GNSS stations located within a radius of 700 km from the Sura heater. It is shown that the region of the maximum brightness of the artificial ionospheric airglow spot is spatially localized in the region of the minimum intensity of TEC variations, while the region of the maximum intensity of TEC variations corresponds to the region of the minimum brightness of the artificial airglow spot. Quantitative estimates for a cavity with reduced electron density in the artificial airglow region, which forms after the Sura pump wave is switched on, vary in the range Delta N-e/N-e approximate to 4-9%, where N-e is the electron density and Delta N-e is its variation in the cavity. The proposed experimental technique eliminates the limitations associated with the need for a navigation satellite to flyby directly over the main lobe of the Sura antenna pattern, which significantly increases the chances of successful simultaneous measurements of TEC variations and artificial ionospheric airglow in the 630 nm line.

TI  - Abject Objects: Perversion and the Modernist Grid
T2  - ARCHITECTURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article challenges current psychoanalytical thought according to which the three Lacanian clinics of the neurotic, pervert and psychotic coexist in any given era, and suggests instead that identifiable environmental conditions are key to the surfacing of a specific and dominant construction of the self. In the case of the pervert, the narcissistic wounds inflicted by science and technology, as well as an increasingly hostile lifestyle dictated by the Industrial Revolution, become key factors that delineate a form of subjectivity in urgent need of overcoming internal splits. The modernist grid, which both the artistic avant-garde and the pioneers of modern architecture address during the first half of the twentieth century as the panacea for a corrupted world, is here discussed in terms of a subject whose imaginary worldview is determined by the vantage point offered by visual-machines, such as geometric grids, as applied to the production of a sanitized and overcontrolled urban environment. Both the mechanisms and outcomes of this interpretation of the evolution of Western city design are part of the original research question that this article addresses.

Australia expected co-circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza and other seasonal respiratory viruses. However, influenza notifications were 7,029 (March-September) compared with an average 149,832 for the same period in 2015-2109, despite substantial testing. Restrictions on movement within and into Australia may have temporarily eliminated influenza. Other respiratory pathogens also showed remarkably changed activity in 2020.

TI  - Experiences of Elder Abuse in Pacific Island Communities of Aotearoa New Zealand: a Cultural Lens
T2  - JOURNAL OF POPULATION AGEING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to uncover some experiences and perceptions of elder abuse among New Zealand Pacific elders within their own communities. A qualitative design was used, in which data were collected and analysed, and meanings were ascribed, based on the cultural perspective and philosophical worldview of Pacific Island elders and the Fonofale model of holistic well-being. The Fonofale framework, congruent with a Pacific worldview, allowed for a guided understanding of abuse, as perceived by 50 older Pacific Island participants. In this study, the themes of abuse included psychological, financial, spiritual, neglect and cultural abuse in the form of disrespect. Importantly, spiritual and cultural abuse often overlaid the other forms, and intergenerational differences emerged as a prominent factor contributing to abuse. Shame, fear and loyalty negatively impacted help seeking behaviours. The Fonofale model of health and well-being was used to evaluate the findings, and inform evidence-based research that can guide healthcare professionals when addressing abuse within their own individual Pacific communities.

TI  - Phase-angle dependence of colour ratios and potential implications for lunar remote sensing
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. The colour-ratio technique has been widely used in mapping planetary surfaces, but its solar phase-angle dependence is not well understood. Understanding the phase-angle dependence of the colour ratio would enhance our abilities in interpreting planetary remote sensing data.Aims. We aim to investigate the dependence of the colour ratio indices on mineralogy, phase angle, particle size, and the degree of simulated space weathering.Methods. We measured the multi-band (i.e. 458, 633, 750, and 905 nm) and multi-angle reflectance spectra of four typical lunar-type minerals with different particle sizes using a custom multi-angular imaging device.Results. The colour ratio does have a phase-angle dependence that is more sensitive to the mineralogy and wavelength and less sensitive to particle size distribution.Conclusions. The combined analysis of the colour ratio and its phase dependence can improve efficiency in mapping the lunar surface. With a prior knowledge of the phase behaviours of colour ratios of specific lunar-type minerals, an optimised colour ratio at certain phase angles can be found to efficiently distinguish the composition of a target surface.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year during the peak winter months (December-January), dense and prolonged fog envelops the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) over the Indian sub-continent leading to economic loss. Many efforts are being made to understand its characteristics to improve forecasting skills. In the present work Indian National SATellite (INSAT-3D), a geostationary satellite, retrieved fog data available at every 30 min interval throughout the day and night is used to study its evolution, spatial and temporal variability for the winter months of December 2016 and January 2017 in conjunction with surface measurements. Fog data when compared with ground-based horizontal visibility over different stations in IGB showed good relationship, also depicted similar temporal variability in tune with the favorable meteorological parameters of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. It is observed that INSAT-3D captured fog very well for visibility ranging from 0 to 500 m representing very dense, dense, and moderate fog, while, the shallow fog with visibility >600 m is captured occasionally. From the maps of spatial and temporal variability of fog, the regions most affected are identified based on fog duration. The intense fog events covering the entire IGB for long duration are observed mostly in the midnight (00:00-04:00) and early morning (04:00-08:00) hours (local time) of December as compared to January. While in January, moderate intense fog spans the entire IGB during day time also. Due to increase in pollution levels, including biomass burning as inferred from MODIS fire counts, and stable atmosphere, high aerosol optical depths (AOD) are observed across IGB. The high AOD regions (> 0.8) covering central and west IGB, are also the hotspot regions of fog/smog onset and slowly expand over a larger area and intensify. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Environmental contamination by naturally occurring asbestos (NOA): Analysis of sentinel animal lung tissue
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ophiolites are known sources of naturally occurring asbestos (NOA). In Calabria (Southern Italy) NOA are mainly concentrated in the ophiolitic sequences cropping in the Mount Reventino area, in the southern part of the Sila massif, and along the Coastal Chain. The most common type of asbestos identified in the rocks of these areas belongs to the tremolite-actinolite series. Mother identified asbestiform mineral is fibrous antigorite belonging to the serpentine mineral group with a minor amount of chrysotile. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the diffusion of natural asbestiform fibers from NOA using sentinel animals. Fifteen lung samples of sheep, goats and wild boars from Mount Reventino area and two from an area free from NOA were collected. The lung samples were subjected to anatomopathological examination and lung fiber burden analysis by electron microscopy. Abundant tremolite and few antigorite fibers were detected in the lung samples coming from the NOA area. No corpuscle of asbestos was observed. No fiber was found in the two lung samples of sheet from the area free from NOA. These concentrations of fibers per gram of dry weight of lung tissue (figdw) ranged from 10(4) to 10(6) figdw. The asbestos fibers detected in the lungs of the examined animals reflect the geological features of the areas where they grazed and lived. The anatomopathological analysis showed that 60% of the examined animals had macroscopic lesions affecting their lungs. The presence of tremolite fibers in the lungs confirms the diffusion of mineral fibers in the environment and the real advantage of using animal populations in the study areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion and spatial variation of land surface temperature over mining areas of Jixi, Heilongjiang, China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Jixi is a typical mining city in China that has undergone dramatic changes in its land-use pattern of mining areas over the development of its coal resources. The impacts of coal mining activities have greatly affected the regional land surface temperature and ecological system.Methods. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data from 2015 and 2019 were used from the Jiguan, Didao, and Chengzihe District of Jixi in Heilongjiang, China as the study area. The calculations to determine the land-use classification, vegetation coverage, and land surface temperature (LST) were performed using ArcGIS10.5 and ENVI 5.3 software packages. A correlation analysis revealed the impact of land-use type, vegetation coverage, and coal mining activities on LSTs.Results. The results show significant spatial differentiation in the LSTs of Jixi City. The LSTs for various land-use types were ranked from high to low as follows: mining land > construction land > grassland > cultivated land > forest land > water area. The LST was lower in areas with high vegetation coverage than in other areas. For every 0.1 increase in vegetation coverage, the LST is expected to drop by approximately 0.75 degrees C. An analysis of mining land patches indicates that the patch area of mining lands has a significant positive correlation with both the average and maximum patch temperatures. The average patch temperature shows a logarithmic increase with the growth of the patch area, and within 200,000 m(2), the average patch temperature increases significantly. The maximum patch temperature shows a linear increase with the patch area growth, and for every 100,000 m(2) increase in the patch area of mining lands, the maximum patch temperature increases by approximately 0.81 degrees C. The higher the average patch temperature of mining land, the higher the temperature in its buffer zone, and the greater its influence scope. This study provides a useful reference for exploring the warming effects caused by coal mining activities and the definition of its influence scope.

TI  - Eutrophication assessment of seasonal urban lakes in China Yangtze River Basin using Landsat 8-derived Forel-Ule index: A six-year (2013-2018) observation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes eutrophication have been a complex and serious problem for China's Yangtze River Basin. A series of algorithms based on different remote sensing dataset have been proposed to simulate the lakes trophic state. However, these algorithms are often targeted at a particular lake and cannot be applied to a watershed management. In this study, a Forel-Ule index (FUI) method based on Landsat 8 OLI image is proposed to simulate trophic state index (TSI) in three typical urban lakes (Dianchi, Donghu, and Chaohu) from 2013 to 2018. The results show that the Landsat 8 derived FUI can well represent the lake TSI with an accuracy of R-2 = 0.6464 for the in situ experimental TSI dataset (N = 115) and R-2 = 0.8065 for the lake average TSI dataset (N = 315). In the study period 2013-2018, the order of the simulated TSI is Dianchi > Chaohu > Donghu. Seasonal dynamics show differences where the percentage of eutrophic area in summer is significantly lower than the other seasons for Lake Dianchi and Chaohu. However, the percentage of eutrophic area for Lake Donghu is highest in summer and lowest in winter. To further detect the driving factors of eutrophication in study lakes, the Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. The results show that sunshine and temperature are, respectively, the most and the second most significant factors for Lake Dianchi with explanations of 14.8% and 22.0%; temperature and pollution are the main influencing factors for Lake Donghu (39.2% and 10.9% explanation, respectively) and Chaohu (57.2% and 60.7% explanations, respectively). In addition, the wind is another negatively significant factor for Lake Chaohu with an explanation of 31.3%. Our results serve as an example for other lakes in the Yangtze River Basin and support the formulation of effective strategies to reduce seasonal eutrophication. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Synthesis and catalytic performance of zeolite-Y supported on silicon carbide in n-heptane cracking
T2  - APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we demonstrate a facile approach for the synthesis of zeolite-Y crystals (size, ca. -400 nm) supported on silicon carbide (SiC) with the assistance of the cationic template (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA). The polymeric cationic template used to treat SiC particles induces a positive charge on SiC surface which electro-statically attracts negatively charged aluminosilicate seeds and promotes the growth of zeolite (ZY) particles over SiC, thus leading to the formation of stable ZY@SiC supported catalysts. The supported ZY catalysts with different weight ratio of ZY and SiC were synthesized and characterized by various techniques such as XRD, SEM, SEM-EDX, SEMmapping, TEM, STEM, FT-IR, Al-27 MAS NMR and N-2 sorption. The characterization of the supported ZY catalysts suggests the uniform growth of ZY particles over SiC together with the creation of hierarchical micro-mesopores assembly. In the catalytic cracking of n-heptane, the catalyst ZY@SiC-50 displayed a remarkable improvement in reaction rate when compared to commercial zeolite-Y (CBV-600) amounting to 3.5 folds enhancement. Interestingly, the light olefins yield is also substantially improved. At WHSV of 8 h(-1) and 475 degrees C, the highest light olefin yield (24-36 %) was achieved over ZY@SiC-50 whereas the reference catalyst, CBV-600 produced lower light olefins yield (7-17 %). Moreover, the supported ZY catalyst exhibited less deactivation rates. This improved performance is attributed to the hierarchical micro-mesopores assembly created by the homogeneous dispersion of zeolite crystals on SiC which offers fast diffusion pathways for the reactants and enhanced accessibility to active sites thus leading to higher observed reaction rates and fast diffusion of products thus minimizing the occurrence of side reactions.

TI  - Early-season mapping of winter wheat in China based on Landsat and Sentinel images
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Early-season crop identification is of great importance for monitoring crop growth and predicting yield for decision makers and private sectors. As one of the largest producers of winter wheat worldwide, China outputs more than 18% of the global production of winter wheat. However, there are no distribution maps of winter wheat over a large spatial extent with high spatial resolution. In this study, we applied a phenology-based approach to distinguish winter wheat from other crops by comparing the similarity of the seasonal changes of satellite-based vegetation index over all croplands with a standard seasonal change derived from known winter wheat fields. Especially, this study examined the potential of early-season large-area mapping of winter wheat and developed accurate winter wheat maps with 30m spatial resolution for 3 years (2016-2018) over 11 provinces, which produce more than 98% of the winter wheat in China. A comprehensive assessment based on survey samples revealed producer's and user's accuracies higher than 89.30% and 90.59 %, respectively. The estimated winter wheat area exhibited good correlations with the agricultural statistical area data at the municipal and county levels. In addition, the earliest identifiable time of the geographical location of winter wheat was achieved by the end of March, giving a lead time of approximately 3 months before harvest, and the optimal identifiable time of winter wheat was at the end of April with an overall accuracy of 89.88 %. These results are expected to aid in the timely monitoring of crop growth. The 30m winter wheat maps in China are available via an open-data repository (DOI: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12003990, Dong et al., 2020a).

TI  - Impact of mating system on range size and niche breadth in <i>Epipactis</i> (Orchidaceae)
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims The geographical distribution of plant species is linked fundamentally not only to environmental variables, but also to key traits that affect the dispersal, establishment and evolutionary potential of a species. One of the key plant traits that can be expected to affect standing genetic variation, speed of adaptation and the capacity to colonize and establish in new habitats, and therefore niche breadth and range size, is the plant mating system. However, the precise role of the mating system in shaping range size and niche breadth of plant species remains unclear, and different studies have provided contrasting results. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that range size and niche breadth differed with mating system in the orchid genus Epipactis.Methods We modelled the ecological niches of 14 Epipactis species in Europe using occurrence records and environmental satellite data in Maxent. Niche breadth and niche overlap in both geographic and environmental space were calculated from the resulting habitat suitability maps using ENMTools, and geographic range was estimated using alpha-hull range definition. Habitat suitability, environmental variable contributions and niche metrics were compared among species with different mating systems.Key Results We did not detect significant differences in niche breadth, occurrence probability or geographical range between autogamous and allogamous Epipactis species, although autogamous species demonstrated notably low variation in niche parameters. We also found no significant differences in niche overlap between species with the same mating system or different mating systems. For all Epipactis species, occurrence was strongly associated with land cover, particularly broad-leafed and coniferous forests, and with limestone bedrock.Conclusions These results suggest that the mating system does not necessarily contribute to niche breadth and differentiation, and that other factors (e.g. mycorrhizal specificity) may be more important drivers of range size and niche breadth in Epipactis and orchids in general.

TI  - Advantage of Combining OBIA and Classifier Ensemble Method for Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely collection of urban land use and land cover information is crucial for many aspects of urban development and environment protection. Very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images have made it possible to detect and distinguish detailed information on the ground. While abundant texture information and limited spectral channels of VHR images will lead to the increase of intraclass variance and the decrease of the interclass variance. Substantial studies on pixel-based classification algorithms revealed that there were some limitations on land cover information extraction with VHR remote sensing imagery when applying the conventional pixel-based classifiers. Aiming at evaluating the advantages of classifier ensemble strategies and object-based image analysis (OBIA) method for VHR satellite data classification under complex urban area, we present an approach-integrated multiscale segmentation OBIA and a mature classifier ensemble method named random forest. The framework was tested on Chinese GaoFen-1 (GF-1), and GF-2 VHR remotely sensed data over the central business district (CBD) of Zhengzhou metropolitan. Process flow of the proposed framework including data fusion, multiscale image segmentation, best optimal segmentation scale evaluation, multivariance texture feature extraction, random forest ensemble learning classifier construction, accuracy assessment, and time consumption. Advantages of the proposed framework were compared and discussed with several mature state-of-art machine learning algorithms such as the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree classifier (DTC). Experimental results showed that the OA of the proposed method is up to 99.29% and 98.98% for the GF-1 dataset and GF-2 dataset, respectively. And the OA is increased by 26.89%, 11.79%, 11.89%, and 4.26% compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms such as the decision tree classifier (DTC), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF) on the test of the GF-1 dataset; OA increased by 32.31%, 13.48%, 9.77%, and 7.72% for the GF-2 dataset. In terms of time consuming, by rough statistic, OBIA-RF spends 223.55 s, SVM spends 403.57 s, KNN spends 86.93 s, and DT spends 0.61 s on average of the GF-1 and GF-2 datasets. Taking the account classification accuracy and running time, the proposed method has good ability of generalization and robustness for complex urban surface classification with high-resolution remotely sensed data.

M3  - Article

CP  - 13th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)
CL  - Krakow, POLAND
AB  - This study presents the design process and preliminary results of a 1.8-m reflectarray antenna able to generate a complete multi-spot coverage for transmission from a geostationary satellite operating in Ka-band (18.2-20.2 GHz). The reflectarray is designed using a newly validated method which makes it possible to generate four spaced beams per feed at different frequencies and polarisations. Two different antenna configurations have been evaluated: first, a 1.8-m flat reflectarray has been designed to produce a total of 108 spot beams in two frequencies and two polarisations using 27 dual-polarised feeds; then, the design has been extended to consider a 1.8-m parabolic reflectarray to overcome the limitations related to the phase distributions in large flat reflectarrays. The proposed concept can allow a reduction in the number of antennas and feed chains on board the satellite since only two reflectarray antennas would be needed to produce a four-colour multi-spot coverage in Ka-band, one for transmit and other for receive.

TI  - Water quality monitoring of Lake Burullus (Egypt) using Landsat satellite imageries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Burullus is one of the most important coastal lakes in Egypt, as it participates with a considerable amount of fish yield in Egypt. Despite its importance, it is considered as a vulnerable lake, since it is subjected to significant environmental changes caused by various anthropogenic activities. Severe deterioration of its water quality status, as well as a decrease in its water area, has been noticed throughout the last four decades. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of remote sensing for assessing the water quality status of the lake for the period from August 2010 to August 2013. Remote sensing technique was used to retrieve and predict the lake water quality parameter records through the assessment period (August 2010 to August 2013). Stepwise multi-linear regression technique was used to correlate between the field measurements of water quality parameters and the reflectance of remote sensing imageries, and then the derived models were validated. The results revealed the critical status of water quality conditions of the lake, particularly of its southern and southeastern parts. The results showed also that some water quality parameters (Chl-a, TSS, pH, Fe, Zn, Cr, and NH4) can be retrieved from remote sensing imageries with reasonable accuracy (R-2 = 0.86, 0.67, 0.65, 0.63, 0.62, 0.61, and 0.6, respectively), while the water quality parameters, which can be predicted, based on calibrated and validated regression models are TSS and Chl-a, with acceptable accuracy (R-2 = 0.6 and 0.43, respectively). Lake Burullus needs urgent plans and strategies to protect its water quality from the potential hazards of human activities. The study proved the ability of remote sensing as an effective technique to monitor the changes in water quality conditions of shallow coastal lagoons and to predict with some water quality parameters without field measurements; therefore, it is highly recommended to be used by decision makers.

TI  - Analysis of Spatio-temporal Dynamical Change and Landscape Characteristics of Mangroves and <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> in Fujian Based on Satellite Imageries From 1999 to 2018
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves and Spartina alterniflora are important coastal wetland vegetation resources in Fujian. Identifying the spatio-temporal distribution and evolution characteristics of mangroves and Spartina alterniflora is of great significance for the safety of coastal ecological environment. Based on the data of multi-source satellite imageries such as Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OIL, Quickbird and GF-1 imageries from 1999 to 2018, the spatial distribution and dynamical change of mangroves and Spartina alterniflora were studied and analyzed using the methods of image processing, geographic information systems (GIS) , global positioning system ( GPS) technology and field investigations. The changes of landscape structure and characteristics were analyzed and evaluated by adopting the aspects of "patch-corridor-matrix" pattern and landscape ecology index. The results show that : (1) The total areas of mangroves and Spartina alterniflora in Fujian grew rapidly from 1999 to 2018, the increased area of mangroves and Spartina alterniflora was 477. 3 and 2 647. 81 hm(2), respectively. The annual growth rate of mangroves and Spartina alterniflora were dropped significantly, the annual growth rate of Spartina alterniflora was greater than that of mangroves in the mangrove reserve. (2) The number of the big patches (320 hm(2)) was decreased by 3. 39% between 1999 and 2018, while that of the small patches ( <20 hm(2)) was increased by 18. 03%. The degree of fragmentation of wetland landscape had increased and the instability of wetland landscape construction increased gradually during the past 20 years. (3) The proportions of based pattern in most main sea were decreased except for Sansha Bay, and the wetland landscape pattern tended to be heterogeneous (i. e., increased fragmentation and decreased aggregation of tidal flat). In the past 20 years, Spartina alterniflora occupied the dominant position in the northern sea of Fujian, and Spartina alterniflora competed with mangroves in southern sea of Fujian. Moreover, Spartina alterniflora had invaded the core areas of mangroves in nature reserve, and actions should be taken to clean it away. The research results can provide foundational data and theoretical support for mangrove protection and Spartina alterniflora management.

TI  - Correlation between ferromagnetic and isotopic tracers for sentinel lymph node detection in cutaneous melanoma: IMINEM study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in staging cutaneous melanoma has been proven. Therefore, different tracers have been used to identify the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The use of isotopic tracers together with radioactivity detectors allowed a much more precise and direct approach to the SLNs. However, not all centres have access to a Nuclear Medicine department hindering sentinel lymph node detection (SLND) and consequently, other markers such as ferromagnetic tracers have been evaluated looking for the same advantages and effectiveness as isotopic tracers. Ferromagnetic tracers have proven their usefulness in other cancer entities such as breast, prostate and thyroid cancer. The objective was to assess the detection and concordance rates between isotopic and ferromagnetic techniques for SLNB in cutaneous melanoma.Method Isotopic SLNB technique and ferromagnetic tracer were compared for cutaneous melanoma in a non-inferiority multicentre prospective study carried out in six Spanish hospitals.Results A total of 60 patients were recruited and 133 lymph nodes removed. The detection rate was slightly higher with ferromagnetic tracer in head-neck and trunk melanomas, and with isotopic tracer in limbs. The patients' and nodes' concordance rates between both techniques for ex vivo samples were 95% and 86% for head-neck and trunk tumours and 97% and 93% for limbs tumours, respectively. The concordance rates for involved nodes were 100% and 88.2% for patients and nodes, respectively.Conclusion The intraoperative detection and biopsy of SLN in cutaneous melanoma using a ferromagnetic was a reliable alternative method to the isotopic technique in cutaneous melanomas.

TI  - Effect of lockdown due to SARS COVID-19 on aerosol optical depth (AOD) over urban and mining regions in India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-COronaVlrus Diseases 2019 (SARS-COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat to human health (death) and substantial economic losses across the globe. It was however presumed that extreme preventive measures of entire lockdown in India might have reduced the air pollution level and therefore decreased the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) daily AOD product was deployed to investigate the change in AOD level during lockdown phases across the Indian Territory as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000-2019) of the same periods. The key findings of the study revealed that AOD level over the Indian Territory is greatly reduced (similar to 45%) during the lockdown periods as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000-2019). Furthermore, a noteworthy negative AOD anomaly (similar to 6 to 37%) was observed across the four metropolitan cities in India during the entire lockdown period (25th March to 15th May 2020). However, coal mining regions of the various coalfields in India showed a positive anomaly (similar to+-11 to 40%) during the lockdown periods due to ongoing mining operations. In a nutshell, the study results indicated a huge drop in the AOD level over Indian Territory during lockdown periods. It is expected that the pandemic can influence some policy decisions to propose air pollution control methods. Lockdown events possibly may play a crucial role as a potential solution for air pollution abatement in the future. It may not be uncommon in future when the governments may implement deliberately selective lockdowns at pollution hotspots to control the pollution level. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lockdown measures are essential to containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but they will slow down economic growth by reducing industrial and commercial activities. However, the benefits of activity control from containing the pandemic have not been examined and assessed. Here we use daily carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction in China estimated from statistical data for energy consumption and satellite data for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) as an indicator for reduced activities consecutive to a lockdown. We perform a correlation analysis to show that a 1% day(-1) decrease in the rate of COVID-19 cases is associated with a reduction in daily CO2 emissions of 0.22% +/- 0.02% using statistical data for energy consumption relative to emissions without COVID-19, or 0.20% +/- 0.02% using satellite data for atmospheric column NO2. We estimate that swift action in China is effective in limiting the number of COVID-19 cases <100,000 with a reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 23% by the end of February 2020, whereas a 1-week delay would have required greater containment and a doubling of the emission reduction to meet the same goal. By analyzing the costs of health care and fatalities, we find that the benefits on public health due to reduced activities in China are 10-fold larger than the loss of gross domestic product. Our findings suggest an unprecedentedly high cost of maintaining activities and CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic and stress substantial benefits of containment in public health by taking early actions to reduce activities during the outbreak of COVID-19.

TI  - On-Orbit Modulation Transfer Function Estimation of Optical Satellite Camera
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Modulation transfer function (MTF) is one of the important parameters for the image quality evaluation of optical satellite cameras. On-orbit MTF estimation has a bearing on the application of remote sensing data and the future development of remote sensing cameras. For the photoelectric imaging system widely used for earth observation at present, according to the physical definition of MTF, the satellite cameras are subjected to on-orbit MTF estimation through subpixel position detection and parameterized model fitting, during which the special point, line, and plane targets for convenient mathematical description are taken as references, such as reflecting point source arrays, radial targets, and large-area knife-edge targets. The experimental results show that the point source method is the most rigorous estimation approach and can fully characterize the imaging capability of remote sensing cameras. In contrast, with the assist of large-area targets, the square wave method can directly obtain the MTF value at the Nyquist frequency of the imaging system, and the knife-edge method is a common estimation method of optical cameras but can only have access to the MTF in the orbit direction and that perpendicular to the orbit direction. On-orbit MTF values obtained by the above three methods are of good consistency and the maximum relative error is smaller than 6.00%. At the same time, the above methods have their own characteristics and varied applicability.

TI  - Pet hair as a potential sentinel of human exposure: Investigating partitioning and exposures from OPEs and PAHs in indoor dust, air, and pet hair from China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the levels, compositions, and partitioning behaviors of organophosphate esters (OPEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in indoor air, dust, and pet hair from North China, as well as their potential exposures for humans and pets. The mean OPE concentrations in the indoor air (n = 19), dust (n = 26), and pet hair (n = 29) samples were 52.1 ng/m(3), 3510 ng/g, and 1440 ng/g; while the mean PAH concentrations were 369 ng/m(3), 6000 ng/g, and 22.6 ng/g, respectively. The matrix-air partitioning of OPEs and PAHs may reach equilibrium for compounds with octanol-air partition coefficients (logK(oa)) between 7 and 11 for dust and logK(oa) < 12 for pet hair. Correlation analysis suggested that pet hair could be used as a sentinel for the exposure to certain PAHs, e.g., phenanthrene (PHE) or fluoranthene (FLA), via exposure to indoor air. This work suggests that pet hair may be a better sentinel than air and dust for human exposure to OPEs and PAHs across different indoor microenvironments. Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) to OPEs and PAHs via air inhalation, dust ingestion, and dermal absorption were calculated for children, adults, and pets. The median Sigma EDIs for children, adults, and pets were 26.7, 5.40, and 55.0 ng/kg/day for Sigma OPEs, and 68.8, 19.1, and 130 ng/kg/day for Sigma PAHs, respectively. Air inhalation was the main exposure route to PAHs and OPEs with logK(oa) < 10, whereas dust ingestion was the main exposure route to those with logK(oa) > 10. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - GIS-based spatial modeling of snow avalanches using four novel ensemble models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow avalanches can destroy lives and infrastructure and are very important phenomena in some regions of the world. This study maps snow avalanche susceptibility in Sirvan Watershed, Iran, using a new approach. Two statistical models - belief function (Bel) and probability density (PD) - are combined with two learning models multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and logistic regression (LR) - to predict avalanche susceptibility using remote sensing data in a geographic information system (GIS). A snow avalanche inventory map was generated from Google Earth imagery, regional documentation, and field surveys. Of 101 avalanche locations, 71 (70%) were used to train the models and 30 (30%) were used to validate the resulting models. Fourteen snow avalanche conditioning factors were used as independent variables in the predictive modeling process. First, the weight of Bel and PD techniques were applied to each class of factors. Then, they were combined with two MLP and LR learning models for snow avalanche susceptibility mapping (SASM). The results were validated using positive predictive values, negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, root-mean-square error, and area-under-the-curve (AUC) values. Thus, the AUCs for the PD-LR. Bel-LR, Bel-MLP, and PD-MLP hybrid models are 0.941,0.936, 0.931 and 0.924, respectively. Based on the validation results, the PD-LR hybrid model achieved the best accuracy among the models. This hybrid modeling approach can provide accurate and reliable evaluations of snow avalanche-prone areas for management and decision making. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of glacier changes and their controlling factors in the Kanchenjunga region, Himalaya based on multi-source remote sensing data from 1975 to 2015
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal behavior of glaciers in the Himalayas has varied greatly in response to reported climate warming and other modulating factors such as topography, debris cover, and glacier morphology. In this paper, 429 glaciers were examined in the Kanchenjunga region in the middle of the Himalayas. Geodetic methods, feature-based image matching, and multi-parametric integrated approaches were used to detect differences of glacier change and the dominant characteristics driving these differences based on digital elevation models (DEMs), Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images, Envisat/ASAR and Sentinel-1 data. The results showed that the average change rates in glacier area and surface elevation in 1975-2015 were -0.18 +/- 0.07% a 1 and - 0.32 +/- 0.02 m a(-1), respectively. The rates of areal shrinkage of glaciers and the glacier surface velocity on the northern side of the Himalayan crest were 1.25 and 1.7 times larger than those of the glaciers on the southern slopes, respectively, whereas the rates of glacier thinning were lower in the north than in the south. The temperature increase from 1975 to 2015 caused an overall widespread glacier retreat in the region. However, differences in the topography of the Kanchenjunga region led to spatial variability in glacier changes with discrepancies as large as several times. The features of individual glaciers, such as glacier size, debris cover, and development of ice-contact glacial lakes enhanced the local complexity of glacier change and elusive response behaviors of the glaciers to-climate warming led by the different topographic conditions.

TI  - Microbial activity and diversity in the rhizosphere soil of the invasive species <i>Zizania latifolia</i> in the wetland of Wuchang Lake, China
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the consequences of invasive species overgrowing freshwater wetlands is limited. According to remote sensing data, the invasive species Zizania latifolia spreads at an annual rate of 1.78 km(2) in the freshwater wetland of Wuchang Lake, China, resulting in wetland loss and degradation due to the overgrowth. This species not only increases soil organic matter, total carbon, total nitrogen, total sulfate, available nitrogen and the C/N ratio in the rhizosphere soil, but also results in increased urease, sucrose and catalase activity, as well as fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. In this study, we have analysed microbial diversity in rhizosphere soils among different habitat types of Z. latifolia. Microbial communities in different habitats invaded by Z. latifolia differed considerably at the genus level, although all soil samples were predominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi. The dominant bacterial taxa in the rhizosphere soil from the floating blanket included Acidimicrobiales, Thiomonas, Alicyclobacillus, Acetobacteraceae and Acidocella, whereas those in rhizosphere soils from the lake sludge were Acidobacteria, Anaerolineaceae, Bacteroidetes and Nitrospirae. The bacterial community in the rhizosphere soil differed significantly from that in the non-rhizosphere soil. Z. latifolia potentially creates suitable habitats and provides substrate for a unique set of microbes, further facilitating the succession of this species.

TI  - Integration of HF Radar Observations for an Enhanced Coastal Mean Dynamic Topography
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimeters provide continuous information of the sea level variability and mesoscale processes for the global ocean. For estimating the sea level above the geoid and monitoring the full ocean dynamics from altimeters measurements, a key reference surface is needed: The Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT). However, in coastal areas, where, in situ measurements are sparse and the typical scales of the motion are generally smaller than in the deep ocean, the global MDT solutions are less accurate than in the open ocean, even if significant improvement has been done in the past years. An opportunity to fill in this gap has arisen with the growing availability of long time-series of high-resolution HF radar surface velocity measurements in some areas, such as the south-eastern Bay of Biscay. The prerequisite for the computation of a coastal MDT, using the newly available data of surface velocities, was to obtain a robust methodology to remove the ageostrophic signal from the HF radar measurements, in coherence with the scales resolved by the altimetry. To that end, we first filtered out the tidal and inertial motions, and then, we developed and tested a method that removed the Ekman component and the remaining divergent part of the flow. A regional high-resolution hindcast simulation was used to assess the method. Then, the processed HF radar geostrophic velocities were used in synergy with additional in situ data, altimetry, and gravimetry to compute a new coastal MDT, which shows significant improvement compared with the global MDT. This study showcases the benefit of combining satellite data with continuous, high-frequency, and synoptic in situ velocity data from coastal radar measurements; taking advantage of the different scales resolved by each of the measuring systems. The integrated analysis of in situ observations, satellite data, and numerical simulations has provided a further step in the understanding of the local ocean processes, and the new MDT a basis for more reliable monitoring of the study area. Recommendations for the replicability of the methodology in other coastal areas are also provided. Finally, the methods developed in this study and the more accurate regional MDT could benefit present and future high-resolution altimetric missions.

AB  - Background Genetic variants in the SLC14A1, ACKR1, and KEL genes, which encode Kidd, Duffy, and Kell red blood cell antigens, respectively, may result in weakened expression of antigens or a null phenotype. These variants are of particular interest to individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), who frequently undergo chronic transfusion therapy with antigen-matched units. The goal was to describe the diversity and the frequency of variants in SLC14A1, ACKR1, and KEL genes among individuals with SCD using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data.Study Design and Methods Two large SCD cohorts were studied: the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III) (n = 2634) and the Outcome Modifying Gene in SCD (OMG) (n = 640). Most of the studied individuals were of mixed origin. WGS was performed as part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program.Results In SLC14A1, variants included four encoding a weak Jk(a) phenotype and five null alleles (JK(null)). JKA*01N.09 was the most common JK(null). One possible JK(null) mutation was novel: c.812G>T. In ACKR1, identified variants included two that predicted Fy(x) (FY*X) and one corresponding to the c.-67T>C GATA mutation. The c.-67T>C mutation was associated with FY*A (FY*01N.01) in four participants. FY*X was identified in 49 individuals. In KEL, identified variants included three null alleles (KEL*02N.17, KEL*02N.26, and KEL*02N.04) and one allele predicting K-mod phenotype, all in heterozygosity.Conclusions We described the diversity and distribution of SLC14A1, ACKR1, and KEL variants in two large SCD cohorts, comprising mostly individuals of mixed ancestry. This information may be useful for planning the transfusion support of patients with SCD.

TI  - The uterine pathological features associated with sentinel lymph node metastasis in endometrial carcinomas
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn recent years, sentinel lymph node excision and ultrastaging have been performed in endometrial carcinomas to obtain information about lymph node status, avoiding unnecessary complete pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. The purpose of this retrospective study was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the pathological features of endometrial carcinomas and their significance in association with sentinel lymph node involvement.MethodsPatients with endometrial carcinomas, preceded by sentinel lymph node mapping, were classified into Group-I and Group-II with negative and positive involvement, respectively. The pathological features, associated with sentinel lymph node involvement, were statistically analyzed, including determination of test performance parameters.ResultsAmong 70 patients who had undergone hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node excision, 61 had carcinoma and 9 had atypical hyperplasia. There were 50 patients in Group-I and 10 in Group-II. In Group-II, the significant pathological features were: 1) lower uterine segment involvement (100%), 2) an average tumor size of >= 5 CM, 3) lymphovascular invasion (50%), 4) cervical stromal invasion (40%), and 5) depth of myometrial invasion of >= 50% (50%). The incidences of these pathological features were significantly less in Group-I. Statistical analyses singled out "lower uterine segment involvement" as the most important feature.ConclusionsWe have identified five pathological features which are associated with sentinel lymph node involvement. Since lower uterine segment involvement has occurred in all cases of the Group-II cohort, we recommend FIGO and other organizations that determine staging rules should consider whether tumors that involve the lower uterine segment should be staged as higher than "1a", if the findings in this small series are confirmed by other studies. The results of this study may guide pathologists and oncologists in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to management of endometrial carcinomas.

TI  - An inversion model for estimating the negative air ion concentration using MODIS images of the Daxing'anling region
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative air ion (NAI) concentration is an essential indicator of air quality and atmospheric pollution. The NAI concentration can be used to monitor air quality on a regional scale and is commonly determined using field measurements. However, obtaining these measurements is time-consuming. In this paper, the relationship between remotely sensed surface parameters (such as land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and leaf area index) obtained from MODIS data products and the measured NAI concentration using a stepwise regression method was analyzed to estimate the spatial distribution of the NAI concentration and verify the precision. The results indicated that the NAI concentration had a negative correlation with temperature, leaf area index (LAI), and gross primary production while it exhibited a positive correlation with the NDVI. The relationship between land surface temperature and the NAI concentration in the Daxing'anling region is expressed by the regression equation of y = -35.51x(1) + 11206.813 (R-2 = 0.6123). Additionally, the NAI concentration in northwest regions with high forest coverage was higher than that in southeast regions with low forest coverage, suggesting that forests influence the air quality and reduce the impact of environmental pollution. The proposed inversion model is suitable for evaluating the air quality in Daxing'anling and provides a reference for air quality evaluation in other areas. In the future, we will expand the quantity and distribution range of sampling points, conduct continuous observations of NAI concentrations and environmental parameters in the research areas with different land-use types, and further improve the accuracy of inversion results to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamic changes in NAI concentration and explore the possibility of expanding the application areas of NAI monitoring.

TI  - Detecting Water Depth from Remotely Sensed Imagery Based on ELM and GA-ELM
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The shallow seawater depth inversion based on remote sensing technology is important for water depth detection, which is of considerable significance to marine engineering, shipping, and marine military security. In this study, we took the Taiping Island and its adjacent waters in the South China Sea as a test bed and developed a water depth inversion model on the basis of extreme learning machine (ELM) and extreme learning machine optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-ELM). In GA-ELM, the input weights and the hidden layer biases were optimized by genetic algorithm. The two models allowed the evaluation of nonlinear relationships between the reflectance of high-resolution imagery from WorldView-2 and actual water depth obtained from the S-57 sea chart. The eight bands of the high-resolution image and the actual water depth were used as the input layer and the output layer, and the sigmoid function was introduced as activation function. Finally, the model accuracy was evaluated by using mean relative error (MRE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and the regression analysis between the retrieved water depth and the actual data. The simulation results showed that the two models had better stability than the second-order polynomial regression, BP neural network, and RBF neural network. Furthermore, GA-ELM had a more compact network structure and better generalization ability than ELM. Thus, we concluded that GA-ELM had higher precision and could achieve a better inversion result in the experimental area.

TI  - Health promotion perspectives on the COVID-19 pandemic: The importance of religion
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article we examine the importance of religion for COVID-19 health promotion. We advance three main arguments. First, religion plays an important role in affecting how likely it is that people will become infected with COVID-19. Second, religion should not be seen as a 'problem' with regards to COVID-19 but as an important part of the worldview and lifestyle of many people. Third, there are valuable health promotion lessons we can learn not only from the intersection of religion and other infectious diseases, but also from approaches taken within science education. Contentious science topics such as evolution and vaccine hesitancy have been effectively communicated to those with a religious faith who are disposed to reject them by reframing and considering religion as a worldview and treating those who do not accept standard scientific theories sensitively. Religion has much to contribute to health promotion, including introducing perspectives on life's meaning and on death that can differ from those held by many without religious faith. Furthermore, religious leaders are important gatekeepers to their communities and can therefore play a vital role in policy implementation, even when that policy makes no overt reference to religion. Our contention is that by working with those of faith in the context of COVID-19, health promotion can be enhanced.

TI  - Assessing water surface temperature from Landsat imagery and its relationship with a nuclear power plant
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water temperature is fundamental to understand the functioning of aquatic systems. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of warm water discharge from a nuclear power plant on the water surface temperature (WST) of a reservoir. Using a 6-year Landsat-derived WST dataset, which includes 3 years of the power plant being in operation (2013-2015) and 3 years in which the power plant was not functioning (2016-2018), the effect of the thermal pollution was assessed. The results show that, although the warm water discharge did not reveal a statistically significant increase on the mean WST of the reservoir (p > 0.05), multi-temporal Landsat imagery revealed that the power plant generated a local thermal impact. This was the principal heat flux following a dissipation line that was wide near the cooling channel and expanding towards the rest of the reservoir.

TI  - Self-Sampling of Oropharyngeal Swabs Among Healthcare Workers for Molecular Detection of Respiratory Viruses: A Valuable Approach for Epidemiological Studies and Surveillance Programs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at assessing the validity of self-collected (self-sampled) oropharyngeal (OP) swabs among healthcare workers compared to those collected by trained sentinel general practitioners (GP-sampled) from individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI), to be implemented in epidemiological studies and/or surveillance programs of viral pathogens involved in community respiratory infections. In our study, OP swabs were collected from adults (>18 years) with ILI during the 2018-2019 influenza season. Two groups of samples were considered: group 1-131 self-sampled OP swabs collected by healthcare workers after being trained on the sampling procedure; group 2-131 GP-sampled OP swabs collected from outpatients by sentinel GPs operating within the Italian Influenza Surveillance Network. To assess swabbing quality, following RNA extraction, each sample was tested for the presence of the human ribonuclease P gene (RNP) by in-house real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) <35 were considered adequate for further virological analysis. Influenza viruses (IVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus (RV) genomes were detected by in-house real-time RT-PCR. All samples were positive to RNP detection with Ct <35. The mean Ct value was similar in the two groups (group 1 vs. group 2: 25.93 +/- 2.22 vs. 25.46 +/- 2.40; p = 0.10). IVs, RSV, and RV positivity rates were 26.7 vs. 52.7% (p < 0.01), 7.6 vs. 9.9% (p = 0.52), and 21.4 vs. 19.9% (p = 0.76), respectively. Self-sampled OP swabs resulted as valid as GP-sampled OP swabs for molecular detection of respiratory viruses. Self-swabbing can thus be a worthwhile strategy for sample collection to implement molecular surveillance of respiratory pathogens and carry out epidemiological studies, easily reaching a larger population size.

TI  - Students of Academic Capitalism: Emotional Dimensions in the Commercialization of Higher Education
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article spotlights the emotional aspect of the commercialization of university studies. Whereas the literature on current challenges of higher education highlights the students' customer role, we reveal how neoliberal studenthood combines a consumerist worldview with the discourse of emotional experience. The narratives of Israeli students in the present article show consumerist-emotional therapeutic duality in the ways they make sense of their encounter with the university. Students evaluate how their professors meet their emotional, therapeutic, and consumer needs and perceive the knowledge they acquire as providing them with both pragmatic skills and emotional experience. We argue that this duality is significant to the emerging culture of 'academic capitalism' and show how the commercialized feelings and pragmatics of self-development operate as a manifestation of 'emotional capitalism'.

TI  - A study of mapping usual care and unmet need for vocational rehabilitation and psychological support following major trauma in five health districts in the UK
T2  - CLINICAL REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:To identify where and how trauma survivors' rehabilitation needs are met after trauma, to map rehabilitation across five UK major trauma networks, and to compare with recommended pathways.Design:Qualitative study (interviews, focus groups, workshops) using soft-systems methodology to map usual care across trauma networks and explore service gaps. Publicly available documents were consulted. CATWOE (Customers, Actors, Transformation, Worldview, Owners, Environment) was used as an analytic framework to explore the relationship between stakeholders in the pathway.Setting:Five major trauma networks across the UK.Subjects:106 key rehabilitation stakeholders (service providers, trauma survivors) were recruited to interviews (n = 46), focus groups (n = 4 groups, 17 participants) and workshops (n = 5 workshops, 43 participants).Interventions:None.Results:Mapping of rehabilitation pathways identified several issues: (1) lack of vocational/psychological support particularly for musculoskeletal injuries; (2) inconsistent service provision in areas located further from major trauma centres; (3) lack of communication between acute and community care; (4) long waiting lists (up to 12 months) for community rehabilitation; (5) most well-established pathways were neurologically focused.Conclusions:The trauma rehabilitation pathway is complex and varies across the UK with few, if any patients following the recommended pathway. Services have developed piecemeal to address specific issues, but rarely meet the needs of individuals with multiple impairments post-trauma, with a lack of vocational rehabilitation and psychological support for this population.

TI  - Identification of Desakota Region and Urban Growth Analysis in Patna City, India Using Remote Sensing Data and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, the urban population is likely to be 40% of its total population by the year 2030. In such a scenario, managing urban areas is a challenge for planners in terms of developing sustainable infrastructures and addressing environmental issues. The transitional areas in the surroundings of the peripheral region of large and growing cities are called Desakota. Monitoring of such areas is essential as these provide the foundation for future urban establishments. This study tried to identify and assess the peripheral growth of Patna city, a megacity of the state of Bihar in India together with new developing urban areas by applying well-established image classification techniques on the multi-temporal Landsat satellite images of the years 1995, 2005 and 2015. Analysis of the LULC revealed a significant built-up growth in an elongated shape preferably on the upland areas. We also observed an increase in vegetation class area which is in fact due to the increased practice of agricultural plantation in low-lying areas and along the river course. Moreover, the study identified the Desakota regions for different periods, mainly along the major roads in the periphery of the city. The results were validated in the field using GPS based field survey.

TI  - Long-term MAX-DOAS measurements of NO<sub>2</sub>, HCHO, and aerosols and evaluation of corresponding satellite data products over Mohali in the Indo-Gangetic Plain
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present comprehensive long-term groundbased multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements of aerosols, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and formaldehyde (HCHO) from Mohali (30.667 degrees N, 76.739 degrees E; similar to 310m above mean sea level), located in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India. We investigate the temporal variation in tropospheric columns, surface volume mixing ratio (VMR), and vertical profiles of aerosols, NO2, and HCHO and identify factors driving their ambient levels and distributions for the period from January 2013 to June 2017. We observed mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 360 nm, tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD), and tropospheric HCHO VCD for the measurement period to be 0.63 +/- 0.51, (6.7 +/- 4.1) x 10(15), and (12.1 +/- 7.5) x 10(15) molecules cm(-2), respectively. Concerning the tropospheric NO2 VCDs, Mohali was found to be less polluted than urban and suburban locations of China and western countries, but comparable HCHO VCDs were observed. For the more than 4 years of measurements during which the region around the measurement location underwent significant urban development, we did not observe obvious annual trends in AOD, NO2, and HCHO. High tropospheric NO2 VCDs were observed in periods with enhanced biomass and biofuel combustion (e.g. agricultural residue burning and domestic burning for heating). Highest tropospheric HCHO VCDs were observed in agricultural residue burning periods with favourable meteorological conditions for photochemical formation, which in previous studies have shown an implication for high ambient ozone also over the IGP. Highest AOD is observed in the monsoon season, indicating possible hygroscopic growth of the aerosol particles. Most of the NO2 is located close to the surface, whereas significant HCHO is present at higher altitudes up to 600m during summer indicating active photochemistry at high altitudes. The vertical distribution of aerosol, NO2, and HCHO follows the change in boundary layer height (BLH), from the ERA5 dataset of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, between summer and winter. However, deep convection during the monsoon transports the pollutants at high altitudes similar to summer despite a shallow ERA5 BLH. Strong gradients in the vertical profiles of HCHO are observed during the months when primary anthropogenic sources dominate the formaldehyde production. High-resolution MODIS AOD measurements correlate well but were systematically higher than MAX-DOAS AODs. The ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements were used to evaluate three NO2 data products and two HCHO data products of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for the first time over India and the IGP. NO2 VCDs from OMI correlate reasonably with MAX-DOAS VCDs but are lower by similar to 30 %-50% due to the difference in vertical sensitivities and the rather large OMI footprint. OMI HCHO VCDs exceed the MAX-DOAS VCDs by up to 30 %. We show that there is significant scope for improvement in the a priori vertical profiles of trace gases, which are used in OMI retrievals. The difference in vertical representativeness was found to be crucial for the observed biases in NO2 and HCHO surface VMR intercomparisons.Using the ratio of NO2 and HCHO VCDs measured from MAX-DOAS, we have found that the peak daytime ozone production regime is sensitive to both NOx and VOCs in winter but strongly sensitive to NO x in other seasons.

TI  - Modelling Spatial Drivers for LU/LC Change Prediction Using Hybrid Machine Learning Methods in Javadi Hills, Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) information can be extracted through continuous monitoring and observation of the global environment in the field of RS and GIS (remote sensing and geographic information system). With many inventions on satellite technologies, RS plays a crucial role throughout the world, and the researchers had shown their interest in finding the past, present, and future LU/LC information using the RS satellite data. In this research work, the non-forest- and forest-covered changes of Javadi Hills located in India were simulated and predicted using the hybrid machine learning models. The Markov chain-artificial neural network with cellular automata (MC-ANN-CA) and Markov chain-logistic regression with cellular automata (MC-LR-CA) were used and compared using the actual LU/LC maps of 2009, 2012, and 2015 along with the spatial variables (slope, aspect, hill shade, and distance road map). The results of the comparative analysis between the predicted and actual map of 2015 had shown a higher percentage of correctness in the MC-ANN-CA model for the spatial variables like slope, aspect, and distance road map. The LU/LC for 2021 and 2027 was predicted using the MC-ANN-CA model. By 2021, the forest-covered area will decrease by nearly - 0.38%, and the non-forest-covered area will increase by 0.79%. By 2027, forest-covered areas will decrease by - 0.52%, and non-forest-covered areas will increase by 1.06%, respectively, indicating the impacts of human and urbanization on LU/LC in Javadi Hills.

TI  - Exploring constraints on a wetland methane emission ensemble (WetCHARTs) using GOSAT observations
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland emissions contribute the largest uncertainties to the current global atmospheric CH4 budget, and how these emissions will change under future climate scenarios is also still poorly understood. Bloom et al. (2017b) developed WetCHARTs, a simple, data-driven, ensemble-based model that produces estimates of CH4 wetland emissions constrained by observations of precipitation and temperature. This study performs the first detailed global and regional evaluation of the WetCHARTs CH4 emission model ensemble against 9 years of high-quality, validated atmospheric CH4 observations from GOSAT (the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite). A 3-D chemical transport model is used to estimate atmospheric CH4 mixing ratios based on the WetCHARTs emissions and other sources.Across all years and all ensemble members, the observed global seasonal-cycle amplitude is typically underestimated by WetCHARTs by -7.4 ppb, but the correlation coefficient of 0.83 shows that the seasonality is well-produced at a global scale. The Southern Hemisphere has less of a bias (-1.9 ppb) than the Northern Hemisphere (-9.3 ppb), and our findings show that it is typically the North Tropics where this bias is the worst (-11.9 ppb).We find that WetCHARTs generally performs well in reproducing the observed wetland CH4 seasonal cycle for the majority of wetland regions although, for some regions, regardless of the ensemble configuration, WetCHARTs does not reproduce the observed seasonal cycle well. In order to investigate this, we performed detailed analysis of some of the more challenging exemplar regions (Parana River, Congo, Sudd and Yucatan). Our results show that certain ensemble members are more suited to specific regions, due to either deficiencies in the underlying data driving the model or complexities in representing the processes involved. In particular, incorrect definition of the wetland extent is found to be the most common reason for the discrepancy between the modelled and observed CH4 concentrations. The remaining driving data (i.e. heterotrophic respiration and temperature) are shown to also contribute to the mismatch with observations, with the details differing on a region-by-region basis but generally showing that some degree of temperature dependency is better than none.We conclude that the data-driven approach used by WetCHARTs is well-suited to producing a benchmark ensemble dataset against which to evaluate more complex process-based land surface models that explicitly model the hydrological behaviour of these complex wetland regions.

TI  - Assessment of regional aerosol radiative effects under the SWAAMI campaign - Part 2: Clear-sky direct shortwave radiative forcing using multi-year assimilated data over the Indian subcontinent
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clear-sky, direct shortwave aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) has been estimated over the Indian region, for the first time employing multi-year (2009-2013) gridded, assimilated aerosol products, as an important part of the SouthWest Asian Aerosol Monsoon Interactions (SWAAMI) which is a joint Indo-UK research field campaign focused at understanding the variabilities in atmospheric aerosols and their interactions with the Indian summer monsoon. The aerosol datasets have been constructed following statistical assimilation of concurrent data from a dense network of ground-based observatories and multi-satellite products, as described in Part 1 of this two-part paper. The ARF, thus estimated, is assessed for its superiority or otherwise over other ARF estimates based on satellite-retrieved aerosol products, over the Indian region, by comparing the radiative fluxes (upward) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) estimated using assimilated and satellite products with spatiotemporally matched radiative flux values provided by CERES (Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System) single-scan footprint (SSF) product. This clearly demonstrated improved accuracy of the forcing estimates using the assimilated vis-avis satellite-based aerosol datasets at regional, subregional and seasonal scales. The regional distribution of diurnally averaged ARF estimates has revealed (a) significant differences from similar estimates made using currently available satellite data, not only in terms of magnitude but also the sign of TOA forcing; (b) the largest magnitudes of surface cooling and atmospheric warming over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and arid regions from north-western India; and (c) negative TOA forcing over most parts of the Indian region, except for three subregions - the IGP, northwestern India and eastern parts of peninsular India where the TOA forcing changes to positive during pre-monsoon season. Aerosol-induced atmospheric warming rates, estimated using the assimilated data, demonstrate substantial spatial heterogeneities (similar to 0.2 to 2.0 K d(-1)) over the study domain with the IGP demonstrating relatively stronger atmospheric heating rates (similar to 0.6 to 2.0 K d(-1)). There exists a strong seasonality as well, with atmospheric warming being highest during pre-monsoon and lowest during winter seasons. It is to be noted that the present ARF estimates demonstrate substantially smaller uncertainties than their satellite counterparts, which is a natural consequence of reduced uncertainties in assimilated vis-a-vis satellite aerosol properties. The results demonstrate the potential application of the assimilated datasets and ARF estimates for improving accuracies of climate impact assessments at regional and subregional scales.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection by means of indocyanine green using the Karl Storz VITOM(R) fluorescence camera: a comparison between primary sentinel lymph node biopsy versus sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The usage of radioactive Technetium(99m) (Tc-99m) colloid for the purpose of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early breast cancer is considered the gold standard in Germany. However, new tracers, such as near-infrared (NIR) imaging agents like indocyanine green (ICG) could offer an alternative in future, as they overcome drawbacks associated with radioactive Technetium(99m) (Tc-99m) like limited availability, high costs and radioactivity exposure for both patients and surgeons. Methods In this double-arm retrospective study, we sought to establish the usefulness of indocyanine green as an alternative or an addition to the conventional Technetium(99m) (Tc-99m) in the identification of the SLN in early breast cancer. Results Among the 161 patients who underwent primary SLNB, 34 patients had at least 1 SLN with metastasis. Among these patients with SLN metastasis, 33 had the SLN detected by ICG; while 31 had the SLN detected by Tc-99m. The conventional Technetium(99m) radiotracer failed to detect 2 patients with metastasis in this Arm of the study. Among the 87 patients who underwent SLNB after NACT, 13 patients had at least 1 SLN with metastasis. Among these 13 patients with SLN metastasis, ICG and Tc-99m had detected the SLN among 12 patients, while 1 patient had been detected by ICG alone. Conclusions Our results show that ICG is as effective as the radioisotope for SLNB even among patients who have undergone NACT. This trial is registered with the German Clinical Trial Register, ID: DRKS00013606.

TI  - Acreage estimation of kharif rice crop using Sentinel-1 temporal SAR data
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most important food crop in India covering about one-fourth of the total cropped area. India is the second largest producer and consumer of rice and accounts for 21% of the world's total rice production. Rice is fundamentally a kharif season crop and grown in mainly rainfed areas. Recently there is a considerable increase in production, area and yield of rice crop in India. Temporal monitoring of crop area under cultivation is essential for the sustainable management of agricultural activities on both national and global levels. The present study is envisaged to estimate area under kharif rice using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with dual polarization (VH and VV) in Bhandara district of Maharashtra. The geographical area of Bhandara district is 4087 square kilometres and lies in between 20 degrees 64 ' 03 '' to 21 degrees 60 ' 18 '' N latitude and 79 degrees 44 ' 93 '' to 80 degrees 08 ' 70 '' E longitude. The rice area is extracted using Random Forest (RF) classification techniques available in SNAP tool and validated using the ground observation collected from the field. An area of 1760 square kilometres was found under kharif rice out of 4087 square kilometres area of entire Bhandara district. The rice is predominant crop and covered around 43% of the total geographical area of Bhandara district during kharif season. The user accuracy (omission error), producer accuracy (commission error) for rice crop, overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients were 82.7, 90.0, 91% and 0.80, respectively. The study found that SAR data can be successfully used for acreage estimation with RF classifier.

TI  - Ages and chemistry of mare basaltic units in the Grimaldi basin on the nearside of the Moon: Implications for the volcanic history of the basin
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lunar mare basalts represent flood volcanism between similar to 4.0 and 1.2 Ga, therefore, providing insights into the thermal and volcanic history of the Moon. The present study investigates the spectral and chemical characteristics as well as ages of the nearside mare basaltic units from the Grimaldi basin, namely Mare Grimaldi and Mare Riccioli, using a wealth of orbital remote sensing data. This study delineated distinct basaltic units of varying albedo, mineralogy, and titanium contents in both Mare Grimaldi and Mare Riccioli. The crater size-frequency distribution technique revealed that at least two phases of basaltic magmatism spanning similar to 3.5 to 1.5 Ga (Late Imbrian-Eratosthenian) have occurred in the Grimaldi basin. High-Ti olivine basalts dated at 2.05 Ga are found to be surrounded by the Late Imbrian (similar to 3.47 Ga) low- to intermediate-Ti basalts in Mare Grimaldi. Low- to intermediate-Ti basalts observed in Mare Riccioli date back to two different volcanic events at similar to 3.5 Ga and similar to 3.2 billion years, while patches of basalts having remarkably higher titanium content within the Mare Riccioli record the youngest age of similar to 1.5 Ga. The chemical trend of the pyroxenes from distinct basaltic units also revealed that multiple events of volcanism have occurred in the Grimaldi basin. The high-Ti basalts in the Mare Grimaldi crystallized from an Fe-enriched late-stage magma while the low-Ti basalts crystallized from an Mg- and Ca-rich initial magma that experienced an ultra-late stage quenching. The low- to intermediate-Ti basaltic magma erupted in both the units was derived by partial melting of early cumulate materials from the hybrid source region in the post-overturn upper mantle and made its way to the surface through dikes that propagated by excess pressures accumulated in the diapirs stalled at the base of the crust due to buoyancy trap. The high-Ti magma erupted in the Mare Grimaldi was generated by a hot plume ascended from deeper clinopyroxene-ilmenite-rich cumulate layer near the core-mantle boundary. However, the Eratosthenian (similar to 1.5 Ga) intermediate-Ti volcanic activity in the Mare Riccioli rather sourced from the ilmenite-clinopyroxene cumulate materials thet remained in the upper mantle after mantle overturn. The new results suggest that volcanism had not ceased in the Grimaldi basin at 3.27 Ga, rather it was active and fed by different mantle sources until 1.5 Ga for a period spanning similar to 2 billion years.

TI  - Risk stratification for prediction of locoregional recurrence in patients with pathologic T1-2N0 breast cancer after mastectomy
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPrevious studies have revealed that nearly 15-20% of selected high-risk T1-2N0 breast cancers developed LRR after mastectomy. This study is aim to indentify the risk factors of locoregional recurrence (LRR) in patients with pathologic T1-2N0 breast cancer after mastectomy in a real-world and distinguish individuals who warrant postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT).MethodsFemale patients treated from 1999 to 2014 in National Cancer Center of China were retrospectively reviewed. A competing risk model was developed to estimate the cumulative incidence of LRR with death treated as a competing event.ResultsA total of 4841 patients were eligible. All underwent mastectomy plus axillary nodes dissection or sentinel node biopsy without PMRT. With a median follow-up of 56.4months (range, 1-222months), the 5-year LRR rate was 3.9%.Besides treatment era, age <= 40years old (p<0.001, hazard ratio [HR]=2.262), tumor located in inner quadrant (p<0.001, HR=2.236), T2 stage (p=0.020, HR=1.419), and negative expressions of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) (p=0.032, HR=1.485), were patients-related independent risk factors for LRR. The 5-year LRR rates were 1.7, 3.5, and 15.0% for patients with zero, 1-2, and 3-4 risk factors (p<0.001).ConclusionsRisk Stratification based on age, T stage, ER/PR status and tumor location can stratify patients with pT1-2N0 breast cancer into subgroups with different risk of LRR. PMRT might be suggested for patients with 3-4 risk factors.

TI  - Assessing the impact of urban geometry on surface urban heat island using complete and nadir temperatures
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) when using nadir-viewing radiometric and complete surface temperature (T-r and T-c) was evaluated. The urban areas of the Kowloon peninsula and Hong Kong Island were selected and four daytime Landsat TM images and two nighttime ASTER images were collected to retrieve T-r and then model T-c based on a semi-empirical model. SUHIIs were estimated using both the retrieved T-r and modelled T-c. High spatial resolution (HR) airborne thermal images (0.2 m) observed at 12:10 noon on Oct 24, 2017 were used to retrieve T-c directly. Results based on HR data and satellite data were consistent and indicated that the geometry of the built-up space had a larger impact on SUHII when using T-c (SUHIIc) than T-r (SUHIIr). During daytime SUHIIc decreased while SUHIIr showed a very slight increase with building density. Both SUHIIc and SUHIIr decreased with higher building height but the rate of decrease of SUHIIc was higher than SUHIIr. Both SUHIIc and SUHIIr decreased with increasing building height variance and increased with increasing sky view factor (SVF). The rate of decrease with building height variance for SUHIIc was larger than SUHIIr. The rate of increase of SUHIIc with SVF was higher than SUHIIr. During nighttime, geometry effects on SUHIIc and SUHIIr were different from daytime. Both SUHIIc and SUHIIr increased with building density, while the rate of increase of SUHIIc with building density, as well as with building height, was much higher than SUHIIr. Both SUHIIc and SUHIIr decreased with SVF, but the rate of decrease of SUHIIc was higher than SUHIIr. Both SUHIIc and SUHIIr initially increased with building height variance and then remained approximately constant. We also evaluated the UHI intensity: SUHIIc was much closer to UHII than SUHIIr. Overall, building geometry had larger impact on SUHIIc than on SUHIIr, that is, SUHIIc is more representative of urban climate than SUHIIr.

TI  - Analysis of Seasonal Daytime Urban Thermal Environment Dynamics in a Tropical Coastal City Based on the Spatiotemporal Fusion Model
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the seasonal variations of daytime urban thermal environment (UTE) based on land surface temperature (LST) in Shenzhen of 2015. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) was used for retrieving seasonal daytime LST at high spatiotemporal resolution by combining MODIS and HJ-1B LST data. Next, the relationship between the land cover and daytime in each season was examined. Finally, daytime LST patterns were classified, and the effects of seasonal variations of high-grade daytime LSTs were analyzed with landscape metrics. The results showed that (1) the STARFM is capable of generating seasonal daytime LST data at high spatiotemporal resolution. (2) Daytime LSTs were generally higher in the western parts of Shenzhen in spring and summer. (3) Daytime LST in each land cover type showed an increasing trend form winter to summer and decreased from summer to autumn. The highest and lowest daytime LSTs in each season were observed in ISAs and water bodies. (4) Landscape metrics provided a quantitative method for describing seasonal variations in daytime LSTs, and it was found that seasons influenced the intensity and extent of daytime LSTs in Shenzhen. These findings may be helpful for urban planners developing regional urban strategies to improve daytime urban thermal comfort conditions.

TI  - Tracking rates of postfire conifer regeneration vs. deciduous vegetation recovery across the western United States
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Postfire shifts in vegetation composition will have broad ecological impacts. However, information characterizing postfire recovery patterns and their drivers are lacking over large spatial extents. In this analysis, we used Landsat imagery collected when snow cover (SCS) was present, in combination with growing season (GS) imagery, to distinguish evergreen vegetation from deciduous vegetation. We sought to (1) characterize patterns in the rate of postfire, dual-season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across the region, (2) relate remotely sensed patterns to field-measured patterns of re-vegetation, and (3) identify seasonally specific drivers of postfire rates of NDVI recovery. Rates of postfire NDVI recovery were calculated for both the GS and SCS for more than 12,500 burned points across the western United States. Points were partitioned into faster and slower rates of NDVI recovery using thresholds derived from field plot data (n = 230) and their associated rates of NDVI recovery. We found plots with conifer saplings had significantly higher SCS NDVI recovery rates relative to plots without conifer saplings, while plots with >= 50% grass/forbs/shrubs cover had significantly higher GS NDVI recovery rates relative to plots with <50%. GS rates of NDVI recovery were best predicted by burn severity and anomalies in postfire maximum temperature. SCS NDVI recovery rates were best explained by aridity and growing degree days. This study is the most extensive effort, to date, to track postfire forest recovery across the western United States. Isolating patterns and drivers of evergreen recovery from deciduous recovery will enable improved characterization of forest ecological condition across large spatial scales.

TI  - Fire-induced carbon emissions from tropical mixed broad-leaved forests of the Terai-Siwalik region, central Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are one of the major environmental issues globally. In Nepal, substantial amounts of forest biomass and carbon are lost due to fire. Nepal's high value lowland forests are particularly vulnerable to fire. However, there are limited studies on the estimation of biomass loss and carbon emissions due to fire. Thus, this research addresses the information gap in the tropical mixed broad-leaved forests of Nawalparasi District. The forests were divided into three strata: Lower Tropical Sal Mixed Broad-leaved Forest, Hill Sal Forest and Riverine Forest, and from these four community-managed forests were selected for estimating above ground biomass. Ninety-two sample plots were set out for above ground biomass estimation in burnt and non-burnt areas. Forest fire incidences from 2001 to 2017 were acquired from the MODIS fire data. Forest biomass and carbon emissions were estimated using standard allometric equations. The fuel fraction consumed during the fire was estimated through field surveys during the forest fire season. The results show that every year, over 3158 ha of forests are burnt, resulting in some 1108 tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to approximately 4066 t CO2, 2581 t CO and 1474 t CH4. Among the forests, the Hill Sal Forest was more vulnerable to fire. Forest management strategies, therefore, should include construction of fire lines and conservation ponds along with capacity building and raising awareness among local communities and stakeholders.

TI  - Comparing rotation forests and extreme gradient boosting for monitoring drought damage on KwaZulu-Natal commercial forests
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the utilization of rotation forests (RTF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to classify drought damage in commercial forests in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). These algorithms were trained using information obtained from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived vegetation and conditional drought indices. The results demonstrated that both algorithms were capable of accurately detecting trees that exhibit drought damage and those that did not, this was more apparent when classifying based on information derived from conditional drought indices that yielded an overall accuracy of 82% and 76% for XGBoost and RTF, respectively. However, the accuracy decreased when using vegetation indices data, resulting in an accuracy of 69% and 72% for XGBoost and RTF, respectively. Overall, the results demonstrated that MLAs could be utilized for classifying drought damage on forest vegetation. Additionally, the study showed that MODIS imagery could be used for MLA classification.

TI  - Monitoring spring phenology of individual tree crowns using drone-acquired NDVI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the timing of vegetation phenology is critical for monitoring and modelling ecosystem responses to environmental change. Phenological processes have been studied from landscape to global scales using Earth observing satellite data, and at local scale by in situ surveys of individual plants. Now, data acquired from multi-spectral sensors on drone platforms provide flexible opportunities for monitoring phenology from individual plants to small ecosystem scales efficiently, allowing community and species level information to be derived. We captured a time-series of drone-acquired normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with a multi-spectral sensor (Parrot Sequoia, (Parrot, France)) over a highly heterogeneous ecosystem in Cornwall, UK, during a period of spring green-up. We monitored NDVI trajectories at the individual crown and species' level. For deciduous crowns, we derived metrics representative of spring phenological stages: Start-of-spring (SOS), middle-of-spring green-up (MOG) and start-of-peak greenness (SOP) using a logistic function. While the exact timing of SOS, MOG and SOP appeared susceptible to understorey effects and saturation of the NDVI, relative timing of green-up for a subset of species was plausible in relation to phenological observations from an extended geographic region and in situ plant area index (PAI) measurements. In evergreen vegetation (Pinus spp.) subtle changes were also detected through the growing season. The impact of illumination differences was analysed for image pairs during leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. While significant, these effects were small (mean absolute NDVI deviation of up to 0.034 for leaf-off, 0.013 for leaf-on conditions), meaning that data captured under both constant direct and diffuse irradiance conditions can be used together and that cloudy conditions should not lead to data gaps. We conclude that the capability of drone-mounted multi-spectral instruments for spatio-temporal characterization of crown-level phenology shows great promise for improving the understanding of intra- and inter-species differences in strategy, and offers an efficient means of doing so over areas of a few hectares.

TI  - Analysis of the Economic Value and Status of the Ecosystem Services Provided by the Ashtamudi Wetland Region, a Ramsar Site in Kerala
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide critical services such as protection against flooding and wave action, water quality maintenance, habitat provision, food products, etc. Ashtamudi is the second-largest wetland ecosystem in Kerala state, and it provides numerous ecosystem services (ES). This study has analysed the economic value and current status of 11 important ES provided by this wetland. The considered services are fish production, clam production, shrimp/prawn larvae production, inland navigation, coir production, carbon sequestration and erosion prevention provided by mangroves, flood protection, cooling effect, tourism and future use-value. The total economic value of the wetland by considering the aforementioned services is 424 million US$ (in terms of 2017 International $ value), and every hundred square metres of the wetland provides an economic output of 820 US$ per year approximately. Even though the valuation of a few ES has been carried out in earlier studies, this particular study has incorporated more services in valuation and analysed the change in its value compared to previous years. This study also tried to analyse the status of 'wetland features' essential for the sustenance of ES, the spatial changes of the service providing habitats, and its impact on ES delivery. The study has been carried out in a GIS framework using inputs from various sources including remote sensing (RS) data. Landsat imageries and digital elevation model of the study area are used to understand the economic value and current status of certain services. Analysis, such as spatial change of service providing habitats, shoreline alterations, changes in NDVI of selected locations is carried out by utilizing the aforementioned RS data. Compared to the previous years, the value of supporting and regulating services is declining. At the same time, the value of certain provisioning and cultural services is improving. As the supporting and regulating services are the prerequisites for all other ES to sustain, the current trend indicates a collapse of the entire system shortly. While addressing this issue, more priority has to be given in restoring antecedent wetland condition, which will indeed lead to the improvement of supporting and regulating ES. Community-based institutional mechanisms have to be developed to ensure consistent monitoring and maintenance of the wetland.

T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node (SN) biopsy is used in the management of numerous cancers to avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomy. This was a clinical exploration/feasibility study of a novel identification technique for SN biopsy using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging during lung cancer surgery.Methods SN biopsy using ICG was performed on 22 patients who had cT1 or T2N0M0 lung cancer. ICG was injected just around the primary tumor. The fluorescence imaging system enabled visualization of the lymphatic vessels draining from the primary tumor toward the lymph nodes. Fluorescently labeled nodes were dissected, and patients were followed-up for prognosis and recurrence to confirm the pattern of lymph node metastasis after surgery.Results SNs were successfully identified in 16 (72.7%) of 22 patients. A total of 13 of 16 patients had pathological N0 and three had SN metastasis. The median follow-up time was 92.7 months. Only one patient had no SN metastasis at the postoperative pathological examination and lymph node metastasis during the follow-up period. The accuracy rate was 93.8% (15/16) and the false-negative rate was 7.7% (1/13).Conclusions SNs were identified by ICG fluorescence imaging, and this technique during lung cancer surgery had good identification and accuracy rates throughout the follow-up period.Key pointsSignificant findings of the study We attempted to identify sentinel lymph nodes by indocyanine green in lung cancer surgery. The identification rate was 72.7%. The accuracy rate was 100% immediately after surgery, and 93.8% after follow-up.What this study adds Sentinel node biopsy by indocyanine green may be useful for lymph node dissection during lung cancer surgery to avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomy.

TI  - What is priority monism?
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In a series papers, Jonathan Schaffer defended priority monism, the thesis that the cosmos is the only fundamental material object, on which all other objects depend. A primitive notion of dependence plays a crucial role in Schaffer's arguments for priority monism. The goal of this paper is to scrutinize this notion and also to shed new light on what is at stake in the debate. I present three familiar arguments for priority monism and point out that each relies on a connecting principle that ties dependence to other metaphysical relations. I then argue for two desiderata: the relation between dependence and other metaphysical relations needs to be strong enough to establish that other metaphysical relations are relevant to the direction of dependence but not so strong as to leave no room for revisionary versions of priority monism. I propose a particular way of meeting these desiderata, according to which the target notion of dependence is graded rather than all-or-nothing. One upshot is that we should be less preoccupied with priority monism itself and should instead focus on specific aspects of a broader monistic worldview.

TI  - Studying postseismic deformation of the 2010-2011 Rigan earthquake sequence in SE Iran using geodetic data
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we study the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the postseismic deformation of the 2010-2011 Rigan earthquake sequence which occurred at the southern termination of the East Lut fault system, southeast Iran. One-year GPS measurements after the Rigan earthquake sequence reveals right-lateral post-seismic displacement along the East Chahqanbar fault and left-lateral postseismic displacement along the South Chahqanbar fault. To investigate the deformation variations in time and space, InSAR time-series of COSMO-SkyMed images is applied using the Small Baseline Subset algorithm. The results confirm a clear cumulative postseismic signal increasing to 8 mm during the first five months following the first mainshock in the direction of the coseismic displacement. The cumulative postseismic displacements are well correlated with the cumulative number of the aftershocks and their associated moment release. Considering this correlation and the observation of a sharp discontinuity along the coseismic fault in the displacement map, it is concluded that the after-slip mechanism is responsible for the observed post-seismic deformation in the study region. This study is the first observation of a short-term postseismic motion in eastern Iran through geodetic data in contrast with long-lasting postseismic displacements following the earthquakes that occurred around Lut block. Modeling of the postseismic displacement results in a distributed slip pattern with a maximum slip of 0.8 m on the fault plane responsible for the 2010 Rigan coseismic deformation. This indicates that the postseismic deformation on barriers remained unbroken during the mainshock.

M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatio-temporal variation in soil moisture content (SMC) of the surface soil layer is essential for agriculture and water resource management activities, especially in regions where the socio-economic condition and livelihood depend upon agriculture and allied sectors. In the present study, we have compared different machine learning (ML) and linear regression models to estimate the SMC integrating field observed soil moisture and Sentinel-1 SAR data. Total 56 soil samples were collected from the surface soil layer (similar to 5 cm) in correspondence with the passing date of the Sentinel-1 sensor over the study area. The surface SMC was estimated for bare soil areas, which was extracted by applying the threshold values on vegetation and water index maps derived from the Sentinel-2 multispectral data. The univariate linear regression with the co-polarized VV band provided higher accuracy compared to the cross-polarized VH band. However, the multiple linear regression with VV and VH bands indicated similar accuracy as obtained by the VV band alone. The random forest model was observed as the best performing ML model for soil moisture estimation (R-2 = 0.87 and 0.93 during modeling and validation, respectively; RMSE: similar to 0.03). The obtained results indicate well accurate surface soil moisture verified with in-situ information collected during the dry rabi crop season (January to March 2019). The maximum SMC was observed for March, followed by February and January, that corroborated with the total monthly precipitation and irrigation activities. The study highlights the potentiality of ML models and Sentinel-1 SAR data for soil moisture estimation, which is useful for policy-level implications and decision making in agriculture and water resource management activities.

TI  - A New Index for Assessing Tree Vigour Decline Based on Sentinel-2 Multitemporal Data. Application to Tree Failure Risk Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and monitoring of vigour decline are certainly useful for forest managers to support future interventions. In this work a new index, from Sentinel-2 retrieved NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series, is proposed, hereafter called 'normalized Vegetation Vigour Index (nVVI)', which is specifically designed to quantify and map tree vigour decline. Results proved that nVVI is negatively correlated to tree age (r = -0.815, p < 0.001): older or unhealthy trees showed low nVVI values; younger trees showed high nVVI possibly related to vigour increase. nVVI was, finally used within a Decision Support System (DSS) specifically designed to support tree failure risk management in wide areas, like the natural parks. It was found that such approach can result in an economic saving of about 52% compared to more traditional tree stability surveys. If present, a nVVI map can highlight incipient vegetative anomalies permitting tree stability surveys to be better prioritized.

TI  - Airborne Radiometry for Calibration, Validation, and Research in Oceanic, Coastal, and Inland Waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Present-day ocean color satellite sensors, which principally provide reliable data on chlorophyll, sediments, and colored dissolved organic material in the open ocean, are not well suited for coastal and inland water studies for a variety of reasons, including coarse spatial and spectral resolution plus challenges with atmospheric correction. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) airborne mission concepts tested in 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018 over Monterey Bay, CA, and nearby inland waters have demonstrated the feasibility of improving airborne monitoring and research activities in case-1 and case-2 aquatic ecosystems through the combined use of state-of-the-art above- and in-water measurement capabilities. These competencies have evolved through time to produce a sensor-web approach: imaging spectrometer, microradiometers, and a sun photometer (airborne) with their analogous algorithms, and with corresponding in-water radiometers and ground-based sun photometry. The NASA airborne instrument suite and mission concept demonstrations, leveraging high-quality above- and in-water data, significantly improves the fidelity as well as the spatial and spectral resolution of observations for studying and monitoring water quality in oceanic, coastal, and inland water ecosystems. The goal of this series of projects was to develop and fly a portable airborne sensor suite for NASA science missions focusing on a gradient of water types from oligotrophic to turbid waters addressing the challenges of an optically complex coastal ocean zone and inland waters. The airborne radiometry in this range of aquatic conditions and sites has supported improved results of studies of water quality and biogeochemistry and provides capabilities for research areas such as ocean productivity and biogeochemistry; aquatic impacts of coastal landscape alteration; coastal, estuarine, and inland waters ecosystem productivity; atmospheric correction; and regional climate variability.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-2 vegetation indices for prediction of LAI, fAPAR and fCover of winter wheat in Bulgaria
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 allow for a greater diversity of spectral Vegetation Indices (VIs) to be calculated and used for vegetation characterization. We evaluated the utility of a selection of 40 VIs to derive Leaf Area Index (LAI), fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) and fraction of vegetation Cover (fCover) of winter wheat crop using regression method. We calibrated models for specific winter wheat development stages and compared the predictions with all-season models. The most useful VIs could be grouped into several types: (1) indices which use green and NIR band, (2) indices based on red edge bands, (3) indices which use red and NIR band and (4) the MCARI/OSAVIre index. It was found that fAPAR and fCover could be predicted with good accuracy using all-season models (rRMSE of 14% and 23% respectively), while LAI showed lower accuracy (rRMSE = 45%). The LAI model calibrated over the tillering stage was recommended for usage in the early stages of crop development. Compared with the existing methods for biophysical variables retrieval from Sentinel-2 data (i.e. the Level2B processor in SNAP) the regression approach based on VIs showed to be a viable alternative.

TI  - UAV Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Estimation of Soybean Yield Based on Physiological and Ecological Parameter and Meteorological Factor in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate soybean yield estimates are important for establishing effective agricultural and soybean trade policies aimed at ensuring food security in China. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been used to collect hyperspectral remote sensing data for soybean yield inversion owing to the flexibility, efficiency, and low cost of the technology. Traditional yield inversion algorithms are based on physiological and ecological parameters. However, meteorological factors also influence crop growth and yield and can even eliminate differences caused by physiological and ecological parameters at certain growth stages. The paper proposed a new yield estimation parameter index of effective accumulated temperature, incorporating the influence of meteorological factors into yield inversion models, which can improve the accuracy and universality of crop yield estimation. In the current study, soybean yield inversion models were developed for leaf area index (LAI), fresh biomass, and in-season estimated yield (INSEY) at different growth stages. The accuracies of the various models were evaluated by comparing yield estimates with ground-based sampling data. The analyses revealed that plant parameters, including plant height, LAI, dry biomass, and fresh biomass, correlated significantly with soybean yields, and that LAI and fresh biomass demonstrated the highest correlations with soybean yields. The results of soybean yield estimation at the single growth stage showed that the R-2 value of the model and validation increased by 50.00, 26.60, and 34.40%, and 47.20, 12.50, and 31.90%, respectively, at the flowering stage, pod stage, and seed filling stage, indicating the highest accuracy of yield estimation at the beginning seed stage. The analysis of yield estimation results of soybean at multiple growth stages showed that R-2 values of model and validation of soybean yield estimation models at three different growth stages increased by 4.50, 7.20, and 15.80%, and 4.00, 5.30, and 8.90%, respectively, compared with the beginning seed stage with the highest yield estimation accuracy. Compared with the yield estimation model of the single growth stage, the yield estimation accuracy of multiple growth stages is higher.

TI  - Effects of urban growth on the land surface temperature: a case study in Taiyuan, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, Landsat series remote sensing image are utilized to investigate the spatial and temporal changes of the urban heat island (UHI) in the Taiyuan city from 1990, 2004 and 2014. The main influencing factors of the UHI are analyzed in this regard. The single window algorithm is adopted to invert the land surface temperature (LST) from the thermal infrared data and analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of the LST in the studied area. Then, the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and biophysical composition index (BCI) are calculated in accordance with the LST. Moreover, the degree of impervious surface of the study area is divided according to the BCI value. By analyzing the correlation between the LST, NDVI and the BCI, the influences of two major factors, green space and impervious surface, on urban heat islands are discussed. It is found that the average surface temperature of the Taiyuan city has increased by 5.17 degrees C during the past 24 years from 1990 to 2014, while the impervious surface area has increased by 223.53 km(2), which is 1.179 times of that in 1990. There is a statistical correlation between the LST and the data of the NDVI and impervious surface, which shows that the reduction in green space and the increase in impervious surface in the city have a significant impact on the urban heat island effect. As the largest city in Shanxi province, there is an increasing demand in Taiyuan city for constructing lands during the urbanization process, which has led to a remarkable decrease in the green space and an increase in impervious surfaces. Therefore, the LST in Taiyuan city has been affected by the rapid urbanization. Furthermore, UTFVI indicates that the overall ecological environment of the Taiyuan city has deteriorated and the area of high temperature in the city has increased significantly. Results of the present study may provide a scientific basis for government departments to formulate urban planning and environmental protection policies. The present study may help the government to expand urban green spaces in the right places, control the expansion of the impervious surface of the city, alleviate the UHI effect and maintain the sustainable development of the Taiyuan city.

TI  - Data Quality Assessment on Congenital Anomalies in Ontario, Canada
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Congenital anomalies (CAs) are a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality in Canada. Reliably identifying CAs is essential for CA surveillance and research. The main objective of this study was to assess the agreement of eight sentinel anomalies including: neural tube defects (NTD), orofacial clefts, limb deficiency defects (LDD), Down syndrome (DS), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), gastroschisis (GS), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and transposition of great vessels (TGA) captured in the BORN Information System (BIS) database and the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD).Methods: Live birth and stillbirth records between the BIS and CIHI-DAD in the fiscal years of 2012-2013 to 2015-2016 were linked using 10 digit infant Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) numbers. Percent agreement and Kappa statistics were performed to assess the reliability (agreement) of CAs identified in the linked BIS and CIHI-DAD birth records. Then, further investigations were conducted on those CA cases identified in the CIHI-DAD only.Results: Kappa coefficients of the eight selected CAs between BIS ("Confirmed" or "Suspected" cases) and CIHI-DAD were 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.98) for GS; 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.83) for Orofacial clefts; 0.75 (95% CI: 0.72-0.77) for DS; 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.77) for TOF; 0.62 (95% CI: 0.55-0.68) for TGA; 0.59 (95% CI: 0.49-0.68) for HLHS, 0.53 (95% CI: 0.46-0.60) for NTD-all; and 0.30 (95% CI: 0.23-0.37) for LDD.Conclusions: The degree of agreement varied among sentinel CAs identified between the BIS and CIHI. The potential reasons for discrepancies include incompleteness of capturing CAs using existing picklist values, especially for certain sub-types, incomplete neonatal special care data in the BIS, and differences between clinical diagnosis in the BIS and ICD-10-CA classification in the DAD. A future data abstraction study will be conducted to investigate the potential reasons for discrepancies of CA capture between two databases. This project helps quantify the quality of CA data collection in the BIS, enhances understanding of CA prevalence in Ontario and provides direction for future data quality improvement activities.

TI  - Some respite for India's dirtiest river? Examining the Yamuna's water quality at Delhi during the COVID-19 lockdown period
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yamuna's stretch within Delhi is considered as the dirtiest river reach in India and despite numerous restoration plans, pollution levels have risen unabated. However, the enforcement of a nationwide lockdown due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can possibly provide a ray of hope. We analyze the lockdown's impact on the water quality status of this stretch using a combination of measured parameters and satellite image derived indices. Class C Water Quality Index estimates of nine stations indicate an improvement of 37% during the lockdown period. The Biological Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand values reduced by 42.83% and 39.25%, respectively, compared to the pre-lockdown phase, while Faecal Coliform declined by over 40%. Similar analysis of 20 major drains that meet the Yamuna revealed declining effluent loads and discernable improvements in drain contaminant status were ascertained via a hierarchical cluster analysis. Reach-wise suspended particulate matter content, turbidity and algal signatures were derived from multi-temporal Landsat-8 images of prior and ongoing lockdown periods for 117 channel segment zones. These parameters also declined notably within most stretches, although their extents were spatially varied. While the partial/non-operational status of most industries during the lockdown enabled significant reduction in effluent loads and a consequent betterment in the river water quality, its spatial variations and even deterioration in some locations resulted from the largely undiminished inflow of domestic sewage through multiple drains. This study provides an estimate of possible river recovery extents and degree of improvement if deleterious polluting activities and contaminants are regulated properly. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Exploring the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with the simplified 'triangle' technique for soil water content and evaporative fraction retrievals in a Mediterranean setting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is frequently used nowadays in a variety of disciplines and research fields. The present study explores for the first time the combined use of UAVs with a newly proposed technique for estimating evaporative fraction (EF) and surface soil moisture (SSM). The investigation is performed in a typical Mediterranean setting, a citrus field with flat topography divided in two plots with different irrigation schemes, in Sicily, Italy, at which ground data acquired during an extensive field campaign in July 2019. Reasonable estimates of both EF and surface wetness were produced, with patterns in agreement to vegetation cover fragmentation, topography, and other site-specific characteristics. Validation shows average error of 0.053 for EF and of 0.040 cm(3) cm(-3) for SSM. The results are comparable or better to those reported in analogous studies performed in similar areas. This implies that the investigated approach performs well under the semi-arid conditions characterizing the experimental set up. To our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation of the combined use of the 'simplified triangle' with very high-resolution UAV imagery. As such, the findings are of significance regarding the potential future use of the 'simplified triangle' approach particularly with very fine resolution imagery such as that provided by UAV for mapping and monitoring EF and SSM in agricultural and natural ecosystems.

TI  - Performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1 as a sentinel of Covid-19
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSince 1920, a decrease in serum cholesterol has been identified as a marker of severe pneumonia. We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19.MethodsWe compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 serum) and in France (20,652 serum) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 serum, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population.ResultsThe mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2-95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7-96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957-0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02-31.0; P = 0.04).ConclusionApolipoprotein-A1 could be a sentinel of the pandemic in existing routine surveillance of the general population.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study involves an object-based segmentation method to extract feature changes in tropical rainforest cover using Landsat image and airborne LiDAR (ALS). Disturbance event that are represents the changes are examined by the classification of multisensor data; that is a highly accurate ALS with different resolutions of multispectral Landsat image. Disturbance Index (DI) derived from Tasseled Cap Transformation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the ALS height are the variables for object-based segmentation process. The classification is categorized into two classes; disturbed and non-disturbed forest cover using Nearest Neighbor (NN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The overall accuracy ranging from 88% to 96% and kappa ranging from 0.79 to 0.91. Mcnemar's test p-value (<0.05) is applied to check the classification for each method used which is RF 0.03 and SVM 0.01. The accuracy increases when the integration of ALS in Landsat image (Spectral(Landsat); and Spectral(Landsat) + Height(ALS)).

TI  - Late Pleistocene slip rate of the Chaman fault based on <SUP>10</SUP>Be exposure dating of offset geomorphic surfaces near Kabul, Afghanistan
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the first late Pleistocene left-lateral slip rate of the northern Chaman fault in Afghanistan based on Be-10 dating of offset alluvial fan surfaces. Field mapping complemented with the analysis of CORONA and ALOS PRISM satellite images and shaded relief and topographic data allows us to identify piercing points across the fault zone at two displaced alluvial fans (Ghat Bandakul and Azadkhail) at Wardak Province south of Kabul. We constrain the ages of offset alluvial fans based on Be-10 terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCN) dating of wellembedded quartzite sandstone boulders and cobbles. The Ghat Bandakul alluvial fans are offset at 165 +/- 15 m and 235 +/- 24 m, for which Be-10 TCN model ages average 46.9 +/- 3.5 kyr and 66.6 +/- 4.9 kyr, respectively, yielding a slip rate of 3.5 +/- 0.4 mm/yr. At the Azadkhail site, we identified two offset terraces. Based on 500 +/- 50 m offset of a geomorphic surface with 111.2 +/- 10.5 kyr age, we obtain a slip rate of 4.5 +/- 0.6 mm/yr. Combining the 800 +/- 70 m left-lateral offset matching with an average age of 176.8 +/- 17.1 kyr for the fan yields the same geomorphic slip rate of 4.5 +/- 0.6 mm/yr. These slip rates are considerably lower than geologically, geomorphologically, and geodetically defined slip rates previously obtained along the southern Chaman fault. These results show a clear trend of decreasing fault slip rate with increasing distance to the northeast. The observations suggest that the southern portion of the fault accommodates most of the fault-parallel component of relative motion between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The lower slip rate of the Chaman fault in Afghanistan may be explained by the transfer of the left-lateral shear onto the Gardez and Mokur faults that splay northward from the Chaman fault.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing, GIS and <i>in-situ</i> data for structural mapping over a part of the NW Rif belt, Morocco
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study adopts an integrated approach using the geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques for structural mapping in inaccessible zone of the internal segment of North-Western Rif belt, Morocco. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Optimal Index Factor (OIF), band ratios and directional filtering are applied to Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) image for mapping lithology and geological structures. Tectonic lineaments are extracted using the remote sensing and GIS approach and verified by in-situ data. Lithology and detailed structural features in the study area as well as the main sets of fractures trending NW-SE and E-W are identified and highlighted. The results obtained in this research demonstrate that the integration of remote sensing imagery and GIS techniques is a reliable and low-cost approach to fracture extraction and structural mapping, particularly in remote and inaccessible regions of the African plate and other analogue zones around the world.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of 17DD attenuated yellow fever vaccine in howler monkeys (<i>Alouatta</i> spp.)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Alouatta spp. are highly susceptible to yellow fever (YF) infection and develop an often fatal disease. The threat posed by an outbreak started in 2016 leads us to investigate vaccination as a potential tool in preventing YF in non-human primates (NHP).Methods Susceptible howler monkeys were immunized with three different concentrations of the human Brazilian commercial YF17DD vaccine. Post-vaccination viremia/RNAemia, immunogenicity, and safety were characterized.Results The vaccine did not produce YF clinical manifestations in any of the NHPs. After immunization, all animals seroconverted demonstrating the ability of the YF vaccine to induce humoral response in Alouatta species.Conclusions The present work has demonstrated the safe and immunogenic profile of the existing YF 17DD vaccine in howler monkeys. This knowledge may support further studies with other susceptible monkey species and provide a possible solution for controlling epizootics and preventing the devastation of endangered species.

TI  - Characterizing urbanization-induced land surface phenology change from time-series remotely sensed images at fine spatio-temporal scale: A case study in Nanjing, China (2001-2018)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous urban expansion and its influence on land surface phenology (LSP) have been gaining considerable attention due to their impacts on climate change, carbon cycling and human health. Most previous studies have investigated the effects of urbanization on LSP from the regional to global scales by using coarse-resolution remotely sensed images and fixed land cover boundary maps. However, the influences of urbanization on LSP are also important at the local level, particularly in and around rapidly urbanizing cities as LSP is closely linked to the local ecology and people's health. To analyze the dynamic of urbanization and its effect on LSP at the local scale, this study proposed a novel framework of characterizing LSP with consideration of continuous urban expansion based on all available time-series Landsat and Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Reflectance and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) composite data. The proposed approach was capable of evaluating LSP impacts of urbanization from three aspects: 1) the phenology difference between dynamic annual urban and rural areas; 2) the different rates of phenology trend between the permanent urban and rural areas; and 3) the phenology shifts in the areas that were urbanized during the period. This approach was applied to Nanjing, China and the experimental results indicated that when compared with the rural areas, the phenology cycle started 0.59 +/- 0.58 days earlier (start of season, SOS) and ended 1.65 +/- 1.55 days later (end of season, EOS) in urban areas, accordingly leading to increased growing season length (GSL) by 2.77 +/- 2.61 days. Besides, the experiments also revealed that 70.81% SOS and 78.79% EOS in the permanent urban-rural areas were provided with delayed phenology trends, along with 80.72% of these regions tending to have a prolonged GSL. Furthermore, the rates of SOS and EOS delay in rural areas were 0.12 +/- 0.12 day/year and 0.02 +/- 0.02 day/year faster than those in urban areas, and the rate of GSL prolonging in urban regions was 0.04 +/- 0.04 day/year faster than that in rural counterparts. For the urbanized regions in Nanjing, after experiencing conversion to the impervious surface, SOS and EOS delayed in 65.77% and 70.33% of the regions, accompanied by extended GSL in 70.83% of the regions. Overall, this research proposed a novel approach of analyzing urbanization implications for LSP at the city scale and demonstrated its priority of taking continuous land cover change into account.

TI  - Imaging features of granular cell tumor in the breast Case report
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Granular cell tumor of the breast (GCTB) is a benign rare tumor. There are limited reports on its imaging manifestations. GCTB is often misdiagnosed as breast cancer, which results in unnecessary radical mastectomy and excessive treatment. In this article, we have reported a case of a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman with GCTB and highlighted the imaging features to differentiate this rare tumor from breast cancer. Patient concerns: A 56-year-old postmenopausal patient had a chief complaint of a subcutaneous nodule in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast for 2 months. She underwent physical examination, color Doppler ultrasonography, mammography, magnetic resonance, and postoperative pathology. Diagnoses: The final diagnosis was GCTB. The tumor cells were intermingled with the fibrous stroma and normal breast parenchyma and showed positive immunoreaction to S-100, CD68, and neuron-specific enolase. Interventions: The patient underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Outcomes: The patient recovered well after lumpectomy and had no complications during the 2-year follow-up. Lessons: There are some important imaging features of GCTB that can be used to distinguish it from breast carcinoma to reduce misdiagnosis.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of oil lake and oil-polluted surfaces from remote sensing data in one of the Libyan oil fields
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area, which is part of the Sirt sedimentary basin in the north-central part of Libya, is characterized by natural resources of important environmental value that need special attention as they are threatened by many human activities. The focus of this study was mainly on the production of high-resolution maps of oil-contaminated surfaces, and the series time maps of events resulting from oil pollution using multi temporal satellite data and validation of the results. Digital image processing techniques were used on satellite-based sensing, whether optical or radar data, which proved to be a cost-effective way to collect information on the volume of lake water, and to assess the depth and concentration of pollution in the study area rich in lakes taken from different periods (1972 to 2006). The area of the oil-contaminated lake, called produced water, was calculated from the 1972 Landsat MSS digital satellite imagery data and was about 1.8 km(2) and then increased to 10.7 km(2), during 2006 from Landsat digital image TM data. The size change in this area was due to the increase of the quantities of water production that continued to increase as the oil and gas fields reached maturity. The 2019 Landsat satellite imagery reveals a drastic shrinkage in the area of the lake attributed to the suspension of the produced water pumping as well as the cycle of evaporation that resulted to the water led to a limited volume of water remaining in the lake.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and characteristics of Internal Waves (IWs) are widely used in a variety of industries, including shipbuilding, maritime, as well as oil and marine engineering. In this study, IWs have been detected using field measurement and satellite remote sensing in the Persian Gulf during the period 2000-2015. In order to identify the potential areas for IWs after vertical changes in the physical parameters such as temperature, salinity, and sigma-T (sigma T) resulted by field measurements, the areas where high stratifications of seawater were identified. Satellite images corresponding to the identified areas were then prepared and the required modifications were made to the images. IWs were then manifested by such images in different parts of the study area. For the first time, a comprehensive map of the occurrence of IWs has been prepared and presented using Landsat 7 and 8, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. Then, spatio-temporal analysis of IWs indicates that the density of them decreases from the Strait of Hormuz in the east of the Persian Gulf to the Khowr-e-Musa estuary in the west. In addition, IWs mainly occur in the warm season, from early March to September and weaken or disappear in the cold season in the Persian Gulf.

TI  - The histopathological evaluation based on the indocyanine green fluorescence imaging of regional lymph node metastasis of splenic flexural colon cancer by near-infrared observation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the fluorescence on indocyanine green fluorescent imaging (ICG-FI) and the histopathological findings of regional lymph node (LN) metastasis of splenic flexural colon cancer. Methods From July 2013 to December 2018, consecutive patients with splenic flexural colon cancer with a preoperative diagnosis of N0 who underwent laparoscopic surgery were enrolled. The distribution of cancer sites in metastatic LNs (completely/not completely occupied by metastatic foci) was evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin-stained preparations. We compared the relationship between the distribution of cancer site and fluorescence of paraffin block in metastatic LNs. Results Seventy-two patients were enrolled, of whom 13 (18.1%) had metastatic LNs. A total of 25 metastatic LNs were evaluated. The median short axis of the occupied LNs was 4.5 mm, which was significantly larger than that of the non-occupied LNs (3.0 mm; p = 0.036). In the near-infrared observation of the paraffin block, the completely occupied LNs showed no fluorescence, regardless of the LN size, but 8 of 10 non-occupied LNs showed fluorescence (p < 0.001). Even the non-occupied LNs that showed fluorescence, the cancer site did not show fluorescence. Conclusions The occupied LNs showed no fluorescence, but 80% of the non-occupied LNs showed fluorescence. Even in non-occupied LNs that showed fluorescence, the cancer site did not show fluorescence. This demonstrated LN dissection should not be omitted, even if no fluorescence is noted on intraoperative ICG-FI.

TI  - Exploring Wildfire Occurrence: Local Farmers' Perceptions and Adaptation Strategies in Central Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are an important ecological threat in Cote d'Ivoire with the northern half the most affected zone. This study assessed farmers' perception of wildfire occurrence in the N'Zi River Watershed and compared this perception to remotely sensed fire data trends. To this end, 259 farmers were individually interviewed and 18 farmers were involved in three focus group discussions in three agro-ecological zones. A combination of descriptive statistics and regression analysis was used for data analysis. Results showed that 78.75% of farmers observed the upward trend in the annual wildfire activity identified by remote sensing data during 2001-2016. Most of the respondents identified hunting (65.83%), farm establishment (50%) and firebreaks establishment (46.67%) as main causes of wildfires. The perceived impacts of wildfires included immediate crop burning, crop growth delaying, mid-term post-fire crop destruction, destruction of material goods and loss of human life. Local population developed endogenous strategies to cope with this scourge. Amongst identified coping strategies, firebreaks establishment and maintenance around new clearings and farms and prohibition of fire-hunting during the dry season were highlighted. Therefore, policies and institutions that support local wildfires management initiatives must take advantage of the strong community knowledge and networks to strengthen their effectiveness and sustainability.

TI  - A large-scale change monitoring of wetlands using time series Landsat imagery on Google Earth Engine: a case study in Newfoundland
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands across Canada have been, and continue to be, lost or altered under the influence of both anthropogenic and natural activities. The ability to assess the rate of change to wetland habitats and related spatial pattern dynamics is of importance for effective and meaningful management and protection, particularly under the current context of climate change. The availability of cloud-based geospatial platforms has allowed for the production of wetland maps at scales previously unfeasible due to technical limitations, yet the assessment of changes to wetlands at the level of the wetland class (bog, fen, swamp, and marsh) has yet to be implemented across Canada. Class-level change information is important when considering changes and impacts to wetland functions and services. To demonstrate this possibility, this study assessed 30 years of change to wetlands across the province of Newfoundland using Landsat imagery, spectral indices, and Random Forest classification within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform. Overall accuracies were high, ranging from 84.37% to 88.96%. In a comparison of different classifiers, Random Forest produced the highest over accuracy results and allowed for the estimation of variable importance, when compared Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Minimum Distance (MD). The most important variables include the thermal infrared band (TIR), elevation, the difference vegetation index (DVI), the shortwave infrared bands (SWIR), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Change detection analysis shows that bog, followed by swamp and fen, are the most common wetland classes across all time periods generally, and marsh wetlands are the least common wetland classes across all time periods respectively. The analysis also shows a general instability of wetland classes, though this is largely due to conversion from one wetland class to another. Future work may integrate RADAR data and consider weather patterns. The results of this study elucidate for the first time patterns of wetland class change across Newfoundland from 1985 to 2015 and demonstrate the potential of the GEE and Landsat historical imagery to assess change at provincial and national scales.

TI  - Highly Scalable Bayesian Geostatistical Modeling via Meshed Gaussian Processes on Partitioned Domains
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a class of scalable Bayesian hierarchical models for the analysis of massive geostatistical datasets. The underlying idea combines ideas on high-dimensional geostatistics by partitioning the spatial domain and modeling the regions in the partition using a sparsity-inducing directed acyclic graph (DAG). We extend the model over the DAG to a well-defined spatial process, which we call the meshed Gaussian process (MGP). A major contribution is the development of an MGPs on tessellated domains, accompanied by a Gibbs sampler for the efficient recovery of spatial random effects. In particular, the cubic MGP (Q-MGP) can harness high-performance computing resources by executing all large-scale operations in parallel within the Gibbs sampler, improving mixing and computing time compared to sequential updating schemes. Unlike some existing models for large spatial data, a Q-MGP facilitates massive caching of expensive matrix operations, making it particularly apt in dealing with spatiotemporal remote-sensing data. We compare Q-MGPs with large synthetic and real world data against state-of-the-art methods. We also illustrate using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data from the Serengeti park region to recover latent multivariate spatiotemporal random effects at millions of locations. The source code is available at github.com/mkln/meshgp. for this article are available online.

TI  - Regional-scale forest restoration effects on ecosystem resiliency to drought: a synthesis of vegetation and moisture trends on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale changes in forest structure and ecological function throughout western North America have led to increased frequency, size, and severity of wildfires. The US Forest Service is implementing state-wide forest restoration initiatives to reduce wildfire hazards and improve forest health. We provide a synthesis of pre- and post-treatment forest vegetation and ecosystem moisture trends between 1990 and 2017 in Arizona, the first US state where the initiative has implemented a variety of thinning and burning methods in over 1,200 polygon areas across 3.5 million ha. Using 4,426 Landsat satellite images on Google Earth Engine, we calculated normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to create dense time-series datasets. The indices and 1990-2017 annual total precipitation dataset were then examined using a Mann-Kendall tau test to identify statistically significant upward and downward trends for each pixel. Our results indicate that much of the study region were experiencing drought conditions prior to restoration treatments and NDVI values were significantly decreasing, especially during the dry spring season. However, both NDMI and NDWI trends indicate that the forest restoration treatments have contributed to increased total ecosystem moisture, while precipitation in the post-treatment period exhibit stable trends. Forest restoration treatments appear to have improved the overall forest health and resiliency to drought, especially during the dry spring season, when forests are most vulnerable to water stress and wildfire risks. Our results of the spatial patterns and long-term trends in these variables can inform the currently ongoing and future restoration treatments to better target the treatment strategy across the southwestern USA. Google Earth Engine enabled our synthesis of these long-term trends over the large region and will enhance our continued monitoring in the coming decade.

TI  - Biomarker Responses of the Clam <i>Ruditapes decussatus</i> Exposed to a Complex Mixture of Environmental Stressors under the Influence of an Urban Wastewater-Treatment Plant
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the potential impact of an urban wastewater-treatment plant on Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, a sentinel species, the clam Ruditapes decussatus, was exposed along a gradient of the effluent's dispersal for 1 mo. Three exposure sites were selected to study the responses of 3 biomarkers: electron transport system, acetylcholinesterase, and lipid peroxidation. As complementary data, morphometric measurements, condition index, and lipid and protein content were considered together with in situ physicochemical characterization of the sites (temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen). Electron transport system activity levels were between 35.7 and 50.5 nmol O-2/min g protein, acetylcholinesterase activity levels ranged from 2.6 to 3.8 nmol/min g protein, and lipid peroxidation ranged from 174.7 to 246.4 nmol malondialdehyde/g protein. The exposure sites shaped the response not only of biomarkers but also of "health" parameters (protein, lipids, and condition index). Lipid peroxidation was the most responsive biomarker also associated with electron transport system, especially at the closest site to the urban wastewater-treatment plant. Because of the presence of complex mixtures of contaminants in urban effluents, biomarker responses can provide valuable information in environmental assessment. However, it is vital to identify all biological and ecological factors induced by the natural life cycle of clams. Abiotic factors can mask or overlap the response of biomarkers and should be considered in a multibiomarker approach. (C) 2020 SETAC

TI  - Time-Series Analysis of Surface-Water Quality in Xiong'an New Area, 2016-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xiong'an New Area was established by the Chinese government on 1 April 2017 as a new district in the Hebei Province, and soon after its establishment, investigations on the waterbodies of the district began to initiate governance. In this study, data from 105 Sentinel-2 cloudless images for the period April 2016-September 2019 were analysed to understand the changes in the concentrations of chlorophyll-a and water turbidity in surface waterbodies of the Xiong'an New Area. The results suggest that (1) the water quality shows an overall improving trend owing to surface-water pollution control measures by the Chinese government in the region; (2) the turbidity of the surface waterbody declined gradually particularly after the spring of 2017; (3) the concentration of chlorophyll-a shows a weak decreasing trend, with a low value in spring and a high value in summer with a four-year average of 31.3 mu g/L; and (4) by comparing the results of the water quality of two ponds inside and outside the Lake Baiyangdian and the overall water quality of Xiong'an New Area, the changes in turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration during the study period were consistent.

TI  - Distribution and seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes on Shackleton Ice Shelf, East Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) enhance surface melting and can flex and fracture ice shelves when they grow and subsequently drain, potentially leading to ice shelf disintegration. However, the seasonal evolution of SGLs and their influence on ice shelf stability in East Antarctica remains poorly understood, despite some potentially vulnerable ice shelves having high densities of SGLs. Using optical satellite imagery, air temperature data from climate reanalysis products and surface melt predicted by a regional climate model, we present the first long-term record (2000-2020) of seasonal SGL evolution on Shackleton Ice Shelf, which is Antarctica's northernmost remaining ice shelf and buttresses Denman Glacier, a major outlet of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. In a typical melt season, we find hundreds of SGLs with a mean area of 0.02 km(2), a mean depth of 0.96m and a mean total meltwater volume of 7.45 x 10(6) m(3). At their most extensive, SGLs cover a cumulative area of 50.7 km(2) and are clustered near to the grounding line, where densities approach 0.27 km(2) km(-2). Here, SGL development is linked to an albedo-lowering feedback associated with katabatic winds, together with the presence of blue ice and exposed rock. Although below-average seasonal (December-January-February, DJF) temperatures are associated with below-average peaks in total SGL area and volume, warmer seasonal temperatures do not necessarily result in higher SGL areas and volumes. Rather, peaks in total SGL area and volume show a much closer correspondence with short-lived high-magnitude snowmelt events. We therefore suggest seasonal lake evolution on this ice shelf is instead more sensitive to snowmelt intensity associated with katabatic-wind-driven melting. Our analysis provides important constraints on the boundary conditions of supraglacial hydrology models and numerical simulations of ice shelf stability.

TI  - Who may heal? A plea from traditional healers to participate in treating Covid-19
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - During 2020, communities all over the world suffered from infections and disruptions because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Health assistance in different forms was provided to assist patients. In addition, the South African Department of Health employed several measures to curb the spread of the virus. The traditional healers acting as basic health providers objected to not being asked to participate in government activities dealing with the virus. Data acquired through a qualitative approach provided insight into the pleas of traditional healers to support in the fight against Covid-19. Traditional healers were not consulted by the Department of Health, although the traditional healers are officially considered as part of the government system to provide healthcare. The Traditional Health Practitioners Act, no. 22 of 2007, provided legal recognition to traditional healers. There has been extensive written work dealing with the role of Traditional Healers in the South African healthcare system. This article investigated, through a consideration of the available literature, the differences between the Healing and Biomedical paradigms as two separate ways of presenting healthcare during the Covid-19 pandemic. Through a comparative study of the two approaches as represented by the paradigms, the reasons for not consulting and allowing traditional healers to participate in the fight against Covid-19 were investigated. Some of the reasons include the bias of science versus indigenous knowledge, as a basis for knowledge on health matters. The study recommended that traditional healers have a role to play and a contribution to make to the South African healthcare system and should be allowed to perform their activities.Contributions: The article contributes to the understanding of how different worldviews influence the application of medical services with a particular focus on treatment provided during the Covid-19 pandemic. The contribution to treatment by traditional healers is investigated. The relation between biomedical and traditional healing is highlighted with suggestions as to future collaboration.

T2  - ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIt is unclear if a non-radical diagnostic biopsy entails a higher risk for metastasis and poorer survival for patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma (cHNM).Aims/objectivesTo assess whether or not initial diagnostic biopsy modality and radicality (clear, positive, or narrow histopathological margins) influence recurrence and survival in patients with cHNM.Materials and methodsHistopathological radicality of initial diagnostic biopsies and outcome for 368 consecutive cHNM patients, clinically asymptomatic of metastatic disease and referred to a tertiary care academic center for sentinel lymph node staging from 2004 through 2018, were retrospectively analyzed.ResultsPatients with positive (n = 133) or narrow (0.1-0.5 mm) (n = 34) histopathological margins had significantly worse loco-regional (p=.004) and distant control (p=.004) as well as lower overall (p=.017) and melanoma specific (p=.0002) survival than 201 patients with clear margins. Multivariate analysis indicated positive or narrow histopathological margins as independent negative prognostic factors for melanoma specific survival (HR 2.16, p=.015), together with deeper Breslow (HR 1.17, p=.00001) and ulceration (HR 2.49, p=.003).Conclusions and significanceNon-radical primary diagnostic biopsies increase the risk for metastatic disease and impair survival in cHNM. Accordingly, radical melanoma diagnostic procedures should be encouraged in the head and neck region when possible.

TI  - Changes in Environmental Profiles of Cancer Villages: A Case Study of Aizheng Cun in China
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer villages, or popularly called Aizheng Cun in Chinese, are a new phenomenon after the economic reform in China. This study aims to investigate the degree to which the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) degraded the water quality in cancer villages with a focus on Shenqiu County in Henan Province, one of the most notorious cancer villages in China. Changes in LULC and vegetative content on water surfaces and their spatial relationships were profiled using land surface remotely sensed data. The study finds that along with the considerable expansion of built environment and farmland over thirty years (1987-2017), the mean of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on water surfaces, a proxy for surface water biomass, increased dramatically (from -0.11 to 0.34). Moreover, around 80 percent of the newly fabricated built environment and 74 percent of the new farmland occurred in close proximity (within 1 km) to the water bodies with increased NDVI. Because vegetative content on water surfaces was used as a possible indicator for water quality degradation in water quality, the findings could support the assumption that wastewater discharges from anthropogenic activities contribute to the degrading water quality in cancer villages.

TI  - A novel homomorphic RASD framework for secured data access and storage in cloud computing
T2  - OPEN COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the distributed computing worldview, the client and association's information is put away remotely on the cloud server. Clients and associations can get to applications, administrations, and foundation on-request from a cloud server through the internet, withstanding the various advantages, numerous difficulties, and issues that endure verifying cloud information access and capacity. These difficulties have featured additional security and protection issues as cloud specialist co-ops are exclusively in charge of the capacity and handling of the association's information out of its physical limits. Hence, a robust security plan is required in order to ensure the association's touchy information emerges to keep the information shielded and distant from programmers. Over the globe, specialists have proposed fluctuated security structures having an alternate arrangement of security standards with changing computational expense. Down to earth usage of these structures with low calculation cost remains an extreme test to tackle, as security standards have not been characterized.Methodology - To verify the cloud and deal with all security standards, we propose a REGISTRATION AUTHENTICATION STORAGE DATA ACCESS (RASD) structure for giving security to authoritative information put away on cloud catalogs utilizing a novel security plot, for example, (HEPS)-E-E-P-T. A RASD system involves a stage by stage process Enlistment of clients, Authentication of the client secret key, and Capacity of information just as information access on cloud registry. When the system is connected to cloud servers, all the delicate information put away on the cloud will end up being accessible just to verified clients. The essential favourable position of the proposed RASD structure is its simple usage, high security, and overall less computational expense.Moreover, we propose a homomorphic-private-practical uniformity testing-based plan structured under a schematic calculation Che Aet DPs. This calculation executes homomorphic encryption with subtractive fairness testing, notwithstanding low computational intricacy. To test the security ability, we tried the proposed RASD system with other existing conventions like Privacyprotecting examining convention, group reviewing convention, verified system coding convention, and encoded information preparing with homomorphic re-encryption convention. Findings - Experimentation-based outcomes demonstrated that the RASD structure not only gives a high-security layer for delicate information but also enables a decrease in computational expense and performs better when compared with existing conventions for distributed computing.

TI  - PSInSAR-Based Surface Deformation Mapping of Angkor Wat Cultural Heritage Site
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data are making revolutionary changes in the field of archaeology, and nowadays they have been widely used by the scientific community for regular mapping and monitoring of cultural heritage sites. The development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors helps in monitoring the heritage site with higher accuracy. This study uses the Persistent Scatter Interferometric SAR (PSInSAR), which is an advanced technique of differential SAR interferometry to find the surface deformation of the Angkor Wat temple and its premises. Seven interferometric data from the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS-1) for the period 2006-2009 and ten interferometric data from the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 for the period 2014-2018 have been used in this study to identify the deformation pattern. It is found from this study that the Angkor Wat temple and its outer walls are stable.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 25 March 2019, the Lorestan Province, Iran, suffered a heavy rainstorm. This rainstorm flooded the city of Pol-e-Dokhtar and many villages. To elucidate and monitor the nature of the spatial extent during and after the flood event, and to evaluate flood-induced ground displacement, the time series Sentinel 1 images were analyzed using threshold and SBAS-InSAR techniques. The SAR images were first calibrated, geometrically corrected, and filtered. Then, the threshold method was applied to draw the map of the affected areas. The results showed that flood spatial propagation varies through time. The nature of spatial extent was sinusoidal, so that the flood behavior complied with precipitation periods. Furthermore, the findings of the SBAS-InSAR indicated how an extreme flood can cause ground displacement. Several active movement areas were identified, showing a surface velocity up to -1.1 mm day(-1) away from the satellite. The field observations demonstrated that the landslide phenomenon occurred in some of these areas. Therefore, the other identified areas can also be at risk of landslides. Finally, based on the findings, it is evident that SAR data can effectively be used for flood water mapping, flood monitoring, and flood-induced ground displacement.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The highly polluted atmosphere above Tehran has been investigated by using a polarization lidar operating at 532 nm, in-situ particulate matter suites distributed over the city, and meteorological observations. The measurement campaign is conducted from Nov. 2014 to Jan. 2016. Three typical cases are studied in detail where, the atmosphere is polluted with urban pollution, mixture of urban pollution and dust particles from local sources, and long range transported dust from the Arabian Peninsula. For these cases, vertical profiles of the lidar backscatter coefficient, extinction coefficients, particle depolarization ratio (delta p) and mass concentrations of atmospheric aerosols (separated into dust and non-dust particles) are presented. Using the lidar recordings, variations of the planetary boundary layer height above the city are investigated along the year. During November to February, lidar profiles frequently show polluted boundary layers that are reaching up to 1 km above the ground level. The depolarization ratio (delta p) varies between 0.04 and 0.08 in the polluted boundary layer. During the campaign, for 103 days the urban pollution was dominant, 45 recorded dust events (0.15<<delta>p<0.20) were originated from the dry regions in the south of Tehran and 15 dust events (0.20<delta p<0.35) impacted the city that were originated from the Arabian Desert and Mesopotamia.

TI  - Aerosol-induced atmospheric heating rate decreases over South and East Asia as a result of changing content and composition
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol emissions from human activities are extensive and changing rapidly over Asia. Model simulations and satellite observations indicate a dipole pattern in aerosol emissions and loading between South Asia and East Asia, two of the most heavily polluted regions of the world. We examine the previously unexplored diverging trends in the existing dipole pattern of aerosols between East and South Asia using the high quality, two-decade long ground-based time series of observations of aerosol properties from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), from satellites (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)), and from model simulations (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The data cover the period since 2001 for Kanpur (South Asia) and Beijing (East Asia), two locations taken as being broadly representative of the respective regions. Since 2010 a dipole in aerosol optical depth (AOD) is maintained, but the trend is reversed-the decrease in AOD over Beijing (East Asia) is rapid since 2010, being 17% less in current decade compared to first decade of twenty-first century, while the AOD over South Asia increased by 12% during the same period. Furthermore, we find that the aerosol composition is also changing over time. The single scattering albedo (SSA), a measure of aerosol's absorption capacity and related to aerosol composition, is slightly higher over Beijing than Kanpur, and has increased from 0.91 in 2002 to 0.93 in 2017 over Beijing and from 0.89 to 0.92 during the same period over Kanpur, confirming that aerosols in this region have on an average become more scattering in nature. These changes have led to a notable decrease in aerosol-induced atmospheric heating rate (HR) over both regions between the two decades, decreasing considerably more over East Asia (- 31%) than over South Asia (- 9%). The annual mean HR is lower now, it is still large (>= 0.6 K per day), which has significant climate implications. The seasonal trends in AOD, SSA and HR are more pronounced than their respective annual trends over both regions. The seasonal trends are caused mainly by the increase/decrease in anthropogenic aerosol emissions (sulfate, black carbon and organic carbon) while the natural aerosols (dust and sea salt) did not change significantly over South and East Asia during the last two decades. The MERRA-2 model is able to simulate the observed trends in AODs well but not the magnitude, while it also did not simulate the SSA values or trends well. These robust findings based on observations of key aerosol parameters and previously unrecognized diverging trends over South and East Asia need to be accounted for in current state-of-the-art climate models to ensure accurate quantification of the complex and evolving impact of aerosols on the regional climate over Asia.

AB  - The transferrin encapsulated GdF3 nanoparticles have been fabricated via biomineralization method. The obtained GdF3@Tf NPs show an attractive T2MRI and CT enhancement effect. Furthermore, PET and NIR imaging capacity are integrated into nanoparticles through conjugating with radionuclide Cu-64 and fluorescent dye Cy7. Cu-64-GdF3@Tf-Cy7 NPs are developed and applied in small animal multimodal imaging in vivo. Compared with the previous multimodal imaging agents, Cu-64-GdF3@Tf-Cy7 NPs enable not only precise sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification, but specific imaging for transferrin receptor overexpressed colorectal tumor in vivo. The results reveal that Cu-64-GdF3(@)TfCy7 NPs are potential and efficient multimodal imaging agents for SLN and tumor preclinical imaging.

TI  - High-severity wildfires in temperate Australian forests have increased in extent and aggregation in recent decades
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have increased in size and frequency in recent decades in many biomes, but have they also become more severe? This question remains under-examined despite fire severity being a critical aspect of fire regimes that indicates fire impacts on ecosystem attributes and associated post-fire recovery. We conducted a retrospective analysis of wildfires larger than 1000 ha in south-eastern Australia to examine the extent and spatial pattern of high-severity burned areas between 1987 and 2017. High-severity maps were generated from Landsat remote sensing imagery. Total and proportional high-severity burned area increased through time. The number of high-severity patches per year remained unchanged but variability in patch size increased, and patches became more aggregated and more irregular in shape. Our results confirm that wildfires in southern Australia have become more severe. This shift in fire regime may have critical consequences for ecosystem dynamics, as fire-adapted temperate forests are more likely to be burned at high severities relative to historical ranges, a trend that seems set to continue under projections of a hotter, drier climate in south-eastern Australia.

TI  - Late Summer Peak and Scavenging-Dominant Metal Fluxes in Particulate Export Near a Seamount in the Western North Pacific Subtropical Gyre
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured sedimentation fluxes around JA06 Seamount (Xufu Guyot; 19 degrees 30 ' N, 158 degrees 00 ' E) as part of an environmental baseline survey in Japan's exploration area for cobalt-rich crusts in the subtropical northwest Pacific. Sinking particles were collected at the flat top (sediment trap depths: 900 and 1,000 m) and northeastern base (sediment trap depths: 1,000 and 4,720 m) of the seamount from June 2016 to April 2017. Total mass fluxes were very low, with average values of 4.3-4.9 and 9.3 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the shallow traps at the flat top and base, respectively, which is consistent with an oligotrophic system. The lower fluxes at the flat top probably reflect lower productivity of siliceous microplankton, such as diatoms. However, we were unable to substantiate any potential mechanisms for this difference in productivity and cannot evaluate whether this is representative of typical conditions. When combined with previous observations at two adjacent seamounts, our results indicate widespread seasonality in sediment fluxes with a peak in late summer (August-September). However, satellite data indicate that summer is the season with the lowest primary production. This discrepancy could be explained either by phytoplankton blooms fueled by symbiotic nitrogen fixation that only cause minor increases in surface-ocean chlorophyll or short-lived blooms induced by passing typhoons under thick cloud cover. At the base site, we also analyzed material and element transport rates from shallow to deep waters. Half of the organic matter and >80% of the carbonate in sinking particles was not degraded in the water column, suggesting that most of the regeneration of these materials occurs near or on the sediment surface. Furthermore, four major processes appeared to control elemental fluxes in the area: lithogenic (Al, Ti, Fe), carbonate (Mg, Ca, Sr), biogenic (+scavenging) (Ni, Zn, Cd, Pb), and scavenging (V, Mn, Co, Cu, rare earth elements) processes. The estimation of excess flux based on the composition of upper continental crust demonstrated that >85% of total Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb fluxes were attributable to scavenging (+biogenic uptake). Scavenging-dominant metal fluxes are likely ubiquitous in the oligotrophic open ocean.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the natural processes of planform change, meandering and formation of braid bars, satellite sensor data of few decades play a significant role. The present research focuses on the planform dynamics of Ganga River from Sahibganj (Jharkhand) to Jalangi in West Bengal, India. This study is based on the sequential river planform maps. These maps were prepared using Landsat 1, Landsat 3, Landsat 4, Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 data for the period 1975-2015 at an interval of 5 years. The sinuosity index, braiding index and spatial analysis of maps were used to assess and classify the river into straight, braided and meander categories. This was observed that braiding index is continuously increasing and the meandering index has decreased from 1.6 to 1.24 during 1975 to 2015. The results showed the changes in channel migration with time and space. From the analysis, it is observed that the factors causing shifting of the Ganga River in some areas are natural and anthropogenic. Landsat images were found to be effective in determining the meandering index, braiding index and planform change of a river.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most productive ecosystems on the Earth. They are generally considered a transitional state between terrestrial-aquatic habitats and provide numerous vital ecosystem services to mankind. Wetlands are under a tremendous pressure due to growing human interference, urbanization, conventional agriculture, industrial expansions, and overexploitation of ecological services. The Keoladeo National Park (KNP) is a manmade wetland, world heritage site and a designated Ramsar site in India, widely known for its avian biodiversity. Due to insufficient amount of water supply and widespread invasion of Prosopis juliflora, notable spatio-temporal changes are observed in the land cover affecting habitat quality of the park. The present study is designed to highlight the importance of very high-resolution satellite data for characterization of the wetland ecosystem. It assesses the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) and habitat quality, a model built in the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) tool, is utilized to analyze the effect of land cover changes and increase in P. juliflora on habitat quality in the park. The study concludes that drastic changes in LULC and rampant spread of P. juliflora have deteriorated the quality of habitat for bird species. Furthermore, it highlights importance of geospatial tools in mapping, monitoring, and managing wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Characterization of Sentinel Lymph Node Immune Signatures and Implications for Risk Stratification for Adjuvant Therapy in Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a standard procedure used to identify patients at risk for melanoma recurrence, it fails to risk-stratify certain patients accurately. Because processes in SLNs regulate anti-tumor immune responses, the authors hypothesized that SLN gene expression may be used for risk stratification. Methods The Nanostring nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel was used to quantify expression of 730 immune-related genes in 60 SLN specimens (31 positive [pSLNs], 29 negative [nSLNs]) from a retrospective melanoma cohort. A multivariate prediction model for recurrence-free survival (RFS) was created by applying stepwise variable selection to Cox regression models. Risk scores calculated on the basis of the model were used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups. The predictive power of the model was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. Results During a median follow-up period of 6.3 years, 20 patients (33.3%) experienced recurrence (pSLN, 45.2% [14/31] vs nSLN, 20.7% [6/29]; p = 0.0445). A fitted Cox regression model incorporating 12 genes accurately predicted RFS (C-index, 0.9919). Improved RFS was associated with increased expression of TIGIT (p = 0.0326), an immune checkpoint, and decreased expression of CXCL16 (p = 0.0273), a cytokine important in promoting dendritic and T cell interactions. Independent of SLN status, the model in this study was able to stratify patients into cohorts at high and low risk for recurrence (p < 0.001, log-rank). Conclusions Expression profiles of the SLN gene are associated with melanoma recurrence and may be able to identify patients as high or low risk regardless of SLN status, potentially enhancing patient selection for adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Dynamics and drivers of land cover change in the Afroalpine vegetation belt: Abune Yosef mountain range, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is a global concern because it could lead to the loss of biodiversity and negatively impact ecosystem services and functions, and has an important contribution to climate change. LULC change dynamics and their driving factors are not uniform globally and locally which makes decision making uncertain. This study seeks to quantify the extent of LULC change in Abune Yosef mountain range. To do this, we conducted a supervised classification using maximum likelihood classifier of 2 Landsat images from 1986 to 2017. Ground reference points and aerial photographs were used for accuracy assessment. Results revealed that the area of Afroalpine grassland has declined by -64.76%, from 10, 500 ha to 3700 ha. Other declines were seen in grazing land (-72.15%, 5900 ha), open woodland from (-100%, 3900 ha), and shrubland (-7.04%, 2500 ha). On the other hand, agricultural land area has increased from 38,300 to 48,700 ha (+ 27.15%), barren land from 5400 to 8900 ha (+ 64.81%), rivers, riverbeds, and gullies from 1100 to 3700 (+ 236.56%), plantation forests from 2500 to 4700 ha (+ 88%), and urban settlements from 300 to 500 ha (+ 66.66%). The main drivers of substantial LULC change were identified as increased human population pressure, and temperature and precipitation variability accompanied by the absence of land use policy. Policy developers, decision makers, and local communities may refer this study to develop land use policy, conservation planning, and prioritization to ensure sustainable resource utilization.

TI  - Resource availability and disturbance shape maximum tree height across the Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tall trees are key drivers of ecosystem processes in tropical forest, but the controls on the distribution of the very tallest trees remain poorly understood. The recent discovery of grove of giant trees over 80 meters tall in the Amazon forest requires a reevaluation of current thinking. We used high-resolution airborne laser surveys to measure canopy height across 282,750 ha of old-growth and second-growth forests randomly sampling the entire Brazilian Amazon. We investigated how resources and disturbances shape the maximum height distribution across the Brazilian Amazon through the relations between the occurrence of giant trees and environmental factors. Common drivers of height development are fundamentally different from those influencing the occurrence of giant trees. We found that changes in wind and light availability drive giant tree distribution as much as precipitation and temperature, together shaping the forest structure of the Brazilian Amazon. The location of giant trees should be carefully considered by policymakers when identifying important hot spots for the conservation of biodiversity in the Amazon.

TI  - Evaluating Sentinel-5P TROPOMI tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> column densities with airborne and Pandora spectrometers near New York City and Long Island Sound
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne and ground-based Pandora spectrometer NO2 column measurements were collected during the 2018 Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS) in the New York City/Long Island Sound region, which coincided with early observations from the Sentinel-5P TRO-POspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument. Both airborne- and ground-based measurements are used to evaluate the TROPOMI NO2 Tropospheric Vertical Column (TrVC) product v1.2 in this region, which has high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in NO2. First, airborne and Pandora TrVCs are compared to evaluate the uncertainty of the airborne TrVC and establish the spatial representativeness of the Pandora observations. The 171 coincidences between Pandora and airborne TrVCs are found to be highly correlated (r(2) = 0.92 and slope of 1.03), with the largest individual differences being associated with high temporal and/or spatial variability. These reference measurements (Pandora and airborne) are complementary with respect to temporal coverage and spatial representativity. Pandora spectrometers can provide continuous long-term measurements but may lack areal representativity when operated in direct-sun mode. Airborne spectrometers are typically only deployed for short periods of time, but their observations are more spatially representative of the satellite measurements with the added capability of retrieving at subpixel resolutions of 250 m x 250 m over the entire TROPOMI pixels they overfly. Thus, airborne data are more correlated with TROPOMI measurements (r(2) = 0.96) than Pandora measurements are with TROPOMI (r(2) = 0.84). The largest outliers between TROPOMI and the reference measurements appear to stem from too spatially coarse a priori surface reflectivity (0.5 degrees) over bright urban scenes. In this work, this results during cloud-free scenes that, at times, are affected by errors in the TROPOMI cloud pressure retrieval impacting the calculation of tropospheric air mass factors. This factor causes a high bias in TROPOMI TrVCs of 4 %-11 %. Excluding these cloud-impacted points, TROPOMI has an overall low bias of 19 %-33 % during the LISTOS timeframe of June- September 2018. Part of this low bias is caused by coarse a priori profile input from the TM5-MP model; replacing these profiles with those from a 12 km North American Model-Community Multiscale Air Quality (NAMCMAQ) analysis results in a 12 %-14 % increase in the TrVCs. Even with this improvement, the TROPOMI-NAMCMAQ TrVCs have a 7 %-19 % low bias, indicating needed improvement in a priori assumptions in the air mass factor calculation. Future work should explore additional impacts of a priori inputs to further assess the remaining low biases in TROPOMI using these datasets.

T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Tc-99m-tilmanocept is the first mannose-containing, receptor-directed, radiopharmaceutical for molecular imaging and mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in solid tumor staging. This review focuses on the approved and innovative clinical application of Tc-99m-tilmanocept. Results and conclusion Tc-99m-Tilmanocept is a new-generation radiotracer designed to overcome certain limitations of the conventionally used radiocolloids. The superior efficacy profile of Tc-99m-tilmanocept has been demonstrated in several preclinical and clinical studies based on its specific properties like rapid injection site clearance, high uptake in the first node, and low distal node accumulation. The capability of Tc-99m-tilmanocept for selective molecular imaging of the CD206 receptor may be used for diagnosis and treatment of several macrophage mediated diseases, including autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases (HIV and tuberculosis), neurodegenerative disorders (dementias) and cardiovascular disease (vulnerable plaque and atherosclerosis).

TI  - Flood Detection and Susceptibility Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Time Series, Alternating Decision Trees, and Bag-ADTree Models
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most damaging natural hazards globally. During the past three years, floods have claimed hundreds of lives and millions of dollars of damage in Iran. In this study, we detected flood locations and mapped areas susceptible to floods using time series satellite data analysis as well as a new model of bagging ensemble-based alternating decision trees, namely, bag-ADTree. We used Sentinel-1 data for flood detection and time series analysis. We employed twelve conditioning parameters of elevation, normalized difference's vegetation index, slope, topographic wetness index, aspect, curvature, stream power index, lithology, drainage density, proximities to river, soil type, and rainfall for mapping areas susceptible to floods. ADTree and bag-ADTree models were used for flood susceptibility mapping. We used software of Sentinel application platform, Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, ArcGIS, and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for preprocessing, processing, and postprocessing of the data. We extracted 199 locations as flooded areas, which were tested using a global positioning system to ensure that flooded areas were detected correctly. Root mean square error, accuracy, and the area under the ROC curve were used to validate the models. Findings showed that root mean square error was 0.31 and 0.3 for ADTree and bag-ADTree techniques, respectively. More findings illustrated that accuracy was obtained as 86.61 for bag-ADTree model, while it was 85.44 for ADTree method. Based on AUC, success and prediction rates were 0.736 and 0.786 for bag-ADTree algorithm, in order, while these proportions were 0.714 and 0.784 for ADTree. This study can be a good source of information for crisis management in the study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - Delia radium is a root-feeding pest of cole crops. In California, the biocontrol agents associated with D. radicum are not well understood. Soil samples and sentinel pupae were used to assess D. radicum densities and associated beneficial insects present in cauliflower fields. Delia radicum parasitoids collected from soil samples included Aleochara bilineata (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and Aphaereta pallipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Out of 10 sentinel pupae per sample, an average of 2.2 were preyed upon when placed on the soil surface, compared with only 0.3 when buried. Comprehensive (e.g. multi-seasonal) surveys are recommended to better understand D. radicum biocontrol opportunities in California.

TI  - Understanding processes that control dust spatial distributions with global climate models and satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosol is important in modulating the climate system at local and global scales, yet its spatiotemporal distributions simulated by global climate models (GCMs) are highly uncertain. In this study, we evaluate the spatiotemporal variations of dust extinction profiles and dust optical depth (DOD) simulated by the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) and version 2 (CESM2), the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1), and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) against satellite retrievals from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). We find that CESM1, CESM2, and E3SMv1 underestimate dust transport to remote regions. E3SMv1 performs better than CESM1 and CESM2 in simulating dust transport and the northern hemispheric DOD due to its higher mass fraction of fine dust. CESM2 performs the worst in the Northern Hemisphere due to its lower dust emission than in the other two models but has a better dust simulation over the Southern Ocean due to the overestimation of dust emission in the Southern Hemisphere. DOD from MERRA-2 agrees well with CALIOP DOD in remote regions due to its higher mass fraction of fine dust and the assimilation of aerosol optical depth. The large disagreements in the dust extinction profiles and DOD among CALIOP, MODIS, and MISR retrievals make the model evaluation of dust spatial distributions challenging. Our study indicates the importance of representing dust emission, dry/wet deposition, and size distribution in GCMs in correctly simulating dust spatiotemporal distributions.

TI  - Indoor spectroradiometric characterization of plastic litters commonly polluting the Mediterranean Sea: toward the application of multispectral imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Around 350 million tonnes of plastics are annually produced worldwide. A remarkable percentage of these products is dispersed in the environment, finally reaching and dispersed in the marine environment. Recent field surveys detected microplastics' concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea. The most commonly polymers found were polyethylene, polypropylene and viscose, ethylene vinyl acetate and polystyrene. In general, the in-situ monitoring of microplastic pollution is difficult and time consuming. The main goals of this work were to spectrally characterize the most commonly polymers and to quantify their spectral separability that may allow to determine optimal band combinations for imaging techniques monitoring. The spectral signatures of microplastics have been analysed in laboratory, both in dry condition and on water surface, using a full spectrum spectroradiometer. The theoretical use of operational satellite images for remote sensing monitoring was investigated by quantifying the spectral separability achievable by their sensors. The WorldView-3 sensor appears the most suitable for the monitoring but better average spectral separability are expected using the recently released PRISMA images. This research was preparatory to further outdoor experiments needed to better simulate the real acquisition condition.

TI  - Feature evaluation for land use and land cover classification based on statistical, textural, and shape features over Landsat and Sentinel imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing data has become very useful to generate statistical information about society and its environment. In this sense, land use and land cover classification (LULC) are tasks related to determining the cover on the Earth's surface. In the decision-making process, this kind of information is relevant to handle in the best way how the information about events such as earthquakes or cadastre information can be used. To attend this, a methodology to perform supervised classification based on the combination of statistical, textural, and shape features for the LULC classification problem is proposed. For the experiments, thousands of Landsat and Sentinel images covering all of Mexico and Europe, respectively, were used. Twelve LULC classes were established for Mexico territory, and 10 were established for Europe. This methodology was applied to both datasets and benchmarking with multiple well-known classifiers (random forest, support vector machines, extra trees, and artificial neural network). As a result, the overall accuracy (OA) for Landsat and Sentinel-2 was reached 77.1% and 96.7%, respectively. The performance of the different types of features was compared using Mexico and Europe images. Interesting results were achieved and some conclusions about using traditional and non-traditional features were found in the LULC classification task.

TI  - Multidisciplinary consensus on cancer management during pregnancy
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer during pregnancy is a challenge for multi- and interdisciplinary collaboration due to the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications, the need for an integrated harmonization of medical action for the pregnant patient and the embryo or foetus and the characteristics of each gestational period, which will determine the protocol to be proposed and its limitations. For this reason, a group of experts appointed by participating scientific societies, which includes the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (Sociedad Espanola de Oncologia Medica-SEOM), the Spanish Association of Surgeons (Asociacion Espanola de Cirujanos-AEC), the Spanish Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (Sociedad Espanola de Ginecologia y Obstetricia-SEGO), the Spanish Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular-SEMNIM), the Spanish Society of Oncological Radiotherapy (Sociedad Espanola de Oncologia Radioterapica-SEOR) and the Spanish Society of Medical Radiology (Sociedad Espanola de Radiologia Medica-SERAM), have worked together to establish consensus recommendations that allow the harmonization of management and ultimately the optimization of the healthcare of pregnant patients with cancer. When cancer is detected in a pregnant woman, the week of gestation in which the diagnosis is made must be considered, as well as the characteristics of the tumour. It is strongly recommended that a multidisciplinary team assesses the situation and guides the patient and her family during the informing, diagnosis and treatment process. Likewise, the foetus should be monitored and managed by specialized obstetricians who are part of a multidisciplinary cancer committee.

TI  - Suitability of 17 gridded rainfall and temperature datasets for large-scale hydrological modelling in West Africa
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the ability of different gridded rainfall datasets to plausibly represent the spatio-temporal patterns of multiple hydrological processes (i.e. streamflow, actual evaporation, soil moisture and terrestrial water storage) for large-scale hydrological modelling in the predominantly semi-arid Volta River basin (VRB) in West Africa. Seventeen precipitation products based essentially on gauge-corrected satellite data (TAMSAT, CHIRPS, ARC, RFE, MSWEP, GSMaP, PERSIANN-CDR, CMORPH-CRT, TRMM 3B42 and TRMM 3B42RT) and on reanalysis (ERA5, PGF, EWEMBI, WFDEI-GPCC, WFDEI-CRU, MERRA-2 and JRA-55) are compared as input for the fully distributed mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM). To assess the model sensitivity to meteorological forcing during rainfall partitioning into evaporation and runoff, six different temperature reanalysis datasets are used in combination with the precipitation datasets, which results in evaluating 102 combinations of rainfall-temperature input data. The model is recalibrated for each of the 102 input combinations, and the model responses are evaluated by using in situ streamflow data and satellite remote-sensing datasets from GLEAM evaporation, ESA CCI soil moisture and GRACE terrestrial water storage. A bias-insensitive metric is used to assess the impact of meteorological forcing on the simulation of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes. The results of the process-based evaluation show that the rainfall datasets have contrasting performances across the four climatic zones present in the VRB. The top three best-performing rainfall datasets are TAMSAT, CHIRPS and PERSIANN-CDR for streamflow; ARC, RFE and CMORPH-CRT for terrestrial water storage; MERRA-2, EWEMBI/WFDEI-GPCC and PGF for the temporal dynamics of soil moisture; MSWEP, TAMSAT and ARC for the spatial patterns of soil moisture; ARC, RFE and GSMaP-std for the temporal dynamics of actual evaporation; and MSWEP, TAMSAT and MERRA-2 for the spatial patterns of actual evaporation. No single rainfall or temperature dataset consistently ranks first in reproducing the spatio-temporal variability of all hydrological processes. A dataset that is best in reproducing the temporal dynamics is not necessarily the best for the spatial patterns. In addition, the results suggest that there is more uncertainty in representing the spatial patterns of hydrological processes than their temporal dynamics. Finally, some region-tailored datasets outperform the global datasets, thereby stressing the necessity and importance of regional evaluation studies for satellite and reanalysis meteorological datasets, which are increasingly becoming an alternative to in situ measurements in data-scarce regions.

TI  - Comparison of ozone vertical profiles in the upper troposphere-stratosphere measured over Tomsk, Russia (56.5° N, 85.0° E) with DIAL, MLS, and IASI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Laser ranging methods employing light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology are widely used for studying the atmosphere and monitoring its state. The purpose of this work is to measure the ozone vertical distribution (OVD) in the upper troposphere-stratosphere by differential absorption LiDAR (DIAL) at 299-341 nm and 308-353 nm and to compare the results with satellite data. A LiDAR complex for measuring the OVD in the altitude range approximately 5-45 km has been created. Here, we analyse the results of ozone LiDAR measurements at wavelengths of 299-341 nm and 308-353 nm between 2017 and 2018 at Siberian LiDAR Station (SLS) and compare them with satellite (Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)/Aura and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI)/MetOp) measurements of OVD. The retrieved LiDAR OVD profiles in the upper troposphere-stratosphere in comparison with MLS/Aura and IASI/MetOp profiles, as well as the stitched OVD profile in comparison with the mid-latitude Krueger model, confirm the prospects of using the pairs of ozone sounding wavelengths 299-341 nm and 308-353 nm. The average relative difference between LiDAR and MLS/Aura measurements is negative in the altitude range 16-38 km and attains -49.81% at 38 km, and also, the average relative difference between LiDAR and IASI/MetOp measurements is positive in the altitude ranges 6 and 7.40 to 18 km, where it attains 43.68% at 16.80 km, and is negative in the altitude range 6-7.30 km, where it attains - 43.86% at 6.20 km.

TI  - A global review of green turtle diet: sea surface temperature as a potential driver of omnivory levels
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - To better understand dietary requirements, trophic shifts, and trophic interactions of the threatened green turtle (Chelonia mydas), we conducted a comprehensive global review and literature tabulation (177 studies) reporting diets of individuals > 25 cm carapace length. We analysed those studies involving natural sites and healthy animals that reported relative proportions of all diet components (67 studies, 89 datasets at 75 sites, 13 geographic sub-regions, 3 oceans). We compared diets by sub-region and foraging site relative to four diet components, i.e., seagrass, macroalgae, terrestrial plants (including mangroves) and animal matter. To assess sea surface temperature (SST) as an environmental driver, values were extracted from satellite data (single year) and site-specific observations (study durations) and examined relative to diet composition. Satellite data indicated that at warmer sites with temperatures > 25 degrees C (>= 6 months annually), diet was predominantly herbivorous (mean = 92.97%; SE = 9.85; n = 69 datasets). At higher latitude sites and in cold-water currents with SST < 20 degrees C (>= 6 months annually), dietary animal matter featured prominently (mean = 51.47%; SE = 4.84; n = 20 datasets). Site-specific observations indicated that SST had a small but significant effect on contributions of animal matter (r(2) = 0.17, P = < 0.001) and seagrass (r(2) = 0.24, P = < 0.001) but not macroalgae and terrestrial plants. Our study presents the first quantitative evidence at a global scale that temperature may be an important driver of omnivory, providing a new perspective on variations in green turtle diet, especially in light of global warming and climate change.

TI  - Post-Soviet shifts in grazing and fire regimes changed the functional plant community composition on the Eurasian steppe
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, grasslands are shaped by grazing and fire, and grassland plants are adapted to these disturbances. However, temperate grasslands have been hotspots of land-use change, and how such changes affect interrelations between herbivory, fire and vegetation are poorly understood. Such land-use changes are widespread on the Eurasian steppe, where the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered the abandonment of cropland and pasture on globally relevant scales. Thus, to determine how relationships between plant functional composition, grazing and fire patterns changed after the Soviet Union dissolved, we studied a 358,000 km(2) region in the dry steppe of Kazakhstan, combining a large field dataset on plant functional traits with multi-scale satellite data. We found that increases in burned area corresponded to decreases in livestock grazing across large areas. Furthermore, fires occurred more often with high cover of grasses with high leaf dry matter content and thus higher flammability, whereas higher grazing pressure favoured grazing-tolerant woody forbs and ruderal plants with high specific leaf area. The current situation of low grazing pressure represents a historically exceptional, potentially non-analogue state. We suggest that the dissolution of the Soviet Union caused the disturbance regime to shift from grazer to fire control. As grazing and fire each result in different plant functional compositions, we propose that this led to widespread increases in grasses and associated changes in steppe plant community structure. These changes have potentially occurred across an area of more than 2 million km(2), representing much of the world's largest temperate grassland area, with globally relevant, yet poorly understood implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functions such as carbon cycling. Additionally, future steppe management must also consider positive implications of abandonment ('rewilding') because reverting the regime shift in disturbance and associated changes in vegetation would require grazing animals to be reintroduced across vast areas.

TI  - Small-scale spatial variability in bare-ice reflectance at Jamtalferner, Austria
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As Alpine glaciers become snow-free in summer, more dark, bare ice is exposed, decreasing local albedo and increasing surface melting. To include this feedback mechanism in models of future deglaciation, it is important to understand the processes governing broadband and spectral albedo at a local scale. However, few in situ reflectance data have been measured in the ablation zones of mountain glaciers. As a contribution to this knowledge gap, we present spectral reflectance data (hemispherical-conical-reflectance factor) from 325 to 1075 nm collected along several profile lines in the ablation zone of Jamtalferner, Austria. Measurements were timed to closely coincide with a Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 overpass and are compared to the respective ground reflectance (bottom-of-atmosphere) products. The brightest spectra have a maximum reflectance of up to 0.7 and consist of clean, dry ice. In contrast, reflectance does not exceed 0.2 for dark spectra where liquid water and/or fine-grained debris are present. Spectra can roughly be grouped into dry ice, wet ice, and dirt or rocks, although gradations between these groups occur. Neither satellite captures the full range of in situ reflectance values. The difference between ground and satellite data is not uniform across satellite bands, between Landsat and Sentinel, and to some extent between ice surface types (underestimation of reflectance for bright surfaces, overestimation for dark surfaces). We highlight the need for further, systematic measurements of in situ spectral reflectance properties, their variability in time and space, and in-depth analysis of time-synchronous satellite data.

TI  - Assessment of oil palm yield and biophysical suitability in Indonesia and Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The most crucial technical challenge facing the Malaysian and Indonesian oil palm industry is that the actual yield in the form of Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB; unit in tonne per hectare (t ha(-1))) are well below of potential levels and have stagnated over last two decades. Closing this wide yield gap would have a positive impact on the revenue as it increases productivity per hectare and it eventually leads to less pressure on opening new land and mitigates environmental costs of production. With respect to the indispensable need for closing this gap for future prosperity of this industry and sustainable production of palm oil, this study assessed oil palm yield, considering the potential growth of oil palm dependent on the site qualities and actual yield. Firstly, we mapped oil palm plantations combining yearly Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and ALOS-2 mosaics of L-band backscatter, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance (MOD13Q1), and the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field canopy cover product (MOD44B); where 10.3 and 6.68 million ha (Mha) of oil palm plantations were mapped, respectively, in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2017. Secondly, the age after planting was estimated at detected plantations using time series of MODIS canopy cover with correlation coefficient(r) of 0.68 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.7 years. Thirdly, the biophysical suitability of detected plantations was evaluated considering the spatial-temporal variation of different biophysical criteria. Combining information from second and third steps, we estimated the potential yield at 250 m spatial resolution. The average potential yield in Malaysia ranges between 13.8 t ha(-1) and 19.3 t ha(-1)in 2017, where in Indonesia it ranges between 17.8 t ha(-1) and 21.7 t ha(-1)in the same year. The actual yield in next step, has been quantified by HH-HV attribute of ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 mosaics, where the average actual yield in Malaysia ranges between 14.48 t ha-1 and 20.63 t ha(-1)and in Indonesia it ranges between 8.49 t ha(-1) and15.40 t ha(-1)in 2017. Finally, comparing estimated potential and actual yields, we evaluated oil palm industries' performances where distinct differences were found between two countries. In most of the Malaysian states quantified actual yields were above or at the level of estimated potential yields, whereas in all Indonesian provinces quantified actual yields were well below the potential level. Considering the favourability of environment, among all provinces/states, Sabah, and Sarawak states in Malaysia and Aceh and North Kalimantan provinces in Indonesia distinctly differ due to their poor performances from rest of provinces/states. The information on different yields provided in this study are indispensable needs for efficient and accountable policies as it enables governors to directly target specific objectives such as subsidies on fertilizers, productive cultivars, and new technologies for the plantations suffering from low yield. Also, this study provides benchmarks for each province/state for scopes of actual yield improvements for long-term planning.

TI  - Automated classification of a tropical landscape infested by Parthenium weed (Parthenium hyterophorus)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive Parthenium weed (Parthenium hyterophorus) adversely affects animal and human health, agricultural productivity, rural livelihoods, local and national economies, and the environment. Its fast spreading capability requires consistent monitoring for adoption of relevant mitigation approaches, potentially through remote sensing. To date, studies that have endeavoured to map the Parthenium weed have commonly used popular classification algorithms that include support vector machines and random forest classifiers, which do not capture the complex structural characteristics of the weed. Furthermore, determination of site or data specific algorithms, often achieved through intensive comparison of algorithms, is often laborious and time consuming. In addition, selected algorithms may not be optimal on datasets collected in other sites. Hence, this study adopted the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT), an automated machine learning approach that can be used to overcome high data variability during the classification process. Using Sentinel-2 and Land Satellite (Landsat) 8 imagery to map Parthenium weed, we compared the outcome of the TPOT to the best performing and optimized algorithm selected from sixteen classifiers on different training datasets. Results showed that the TPOT model yielded a higher overall classification accuracy (88.15%) using Sentinel-2 and 74% using Landsat 8, accuracies that were higher than the commonly used robust classifiers. This study is the first to demonstrate the value of TPOT in mapping Parthenium weed infestations using satellite imagery. Its adoption would therefore be useful in limiting human intervention while optimizing classification accuracies for mapping invasive plants. Based on these findings, we propose TPOT as an efficient method for selecting and tuning algorithms for Parthenium discrimination and monitoring, and indeed general vegetation mapping.

TI  - Predictors of invasive disease in patients preoperatively diagnosed with ductal carcinoma without stromal invasion, with breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes upstaged to invasive disease postoperatively. Our objective was to clarify the predictive factors of invasive disease using preoperative imaging and to investigate the positive ratio of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and the incidence of invasive disease. Methods The subjects were 402 patients with preoperatively diagnosed ductal carcinoma without stromal invasion who underwent breast surgery with concomitant SLN surgery in January 2007 to December 2016. Of the 306 included patients, all 306 patients underwent preoperative MRI and US assessment. Outcomes were analyzed for significance using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Of the 306 patients, 115 (37.6%) had invasive disease and 191 (62.4%) had DCIS only. Of the 115 patients with invasive disease, 5 (4.4%) and 4 (3.5%) had macro- and micrometastases in SLN. On the other hand, of the 191 patients with DCIS, only 1 (0.5%) had a micrometastasis. Predictors of invasive disease in the univariate analysis included having a palpable mass, were varied by biopsy method, having a US hypoechoic mass, MRI enhancement, or MRI large enhanced lesion; the size of the mass enhancement >= 1.1 cm or a spread of non-mass enhancement >= 3.1 cm (P = 0.003). Predictors of invasive disease in the multivariate analysis included US hypoechoic mass and MRI large enhanced lesion. Conclusion We need to perform SLN biopsy for preoperatively diagnosed DCIS when patients have predictors of invasive disease, but SLN biopsy will no longer be essential for patients when they have no predictors of invasive disease.

TI  - Enhanced mapping of a smallholder crop farming landscape through image fusion and model stacking
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, Smallholder farming systems (SFS) are recognized as one of the most important pillars of rural economic development and poverty alleviation because of their contribution to food security. However, support for this agricultural sector is hampered by lack of reliable information on the distributions and acreage of smallholder fields. This information is essential in not only monitoring food security and informing markets but also in guiding the determination of levels of support required from government by individual farmers. There is urgent need for robust techniques that can be used to cost-effectively and time-efficiently map smallholder crop fields especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. This study attempts to do this by using an approach in which optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are systematically combined and classified using Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost). We also investigated model stacking as another technique to improve classification accuracy. We combined Xgboost with Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Naive Bayes (NB). The combined use of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 bands, spectral indices, and Sentinel-1 produced better results than exclusive use of optical data (alpha = 0.95,p= 0.0005). Furthermore, stacking of classification algorithms based on model comparisons achieved higher accuracy than stacking the algorithms indiscriminately (alpha = 0.95,p= 0.0100). Through systematic fusion of SAR and optical data and hyper-parameter tuning of Xgboost, we achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 97.71%, while achieving a maximum accuracy of 96.06% through model stacking. This highlights the importance of multi-sensor data fusion and multi-classifier systems when mapping fragmented agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Vegetation Characterization at Community Level Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data and Random Forest Classifier in Western Himalayan Foothills, Uttarakhand
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterization of forests is an important aspect for the management and conservation of biodiversity and satellite remote sensing provides opportunity to rapidly assess biodiversity patterns across large geographical areas. The present study aimed to characterize vegetation in a landscape with heterogenous topography using medium resolution Sentinel-2 satellite data and random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. The study area falls in the Nandhaur landscape of western Himalayan foothills and forms an important part of the Terai Arc Landscape. Sentinel-2 satellite data of January, April and May months was used along with SRTM Digital Elevation Model. Primary field data was collected for dominant vegetation community characteristics and used for training and validation of the model in RF. A total of eleven forest vegetation communities was characterized with an accuracy of 70-87% for individual imageries as well as in collocation of images. Satellite image of April was found most useful for discriminating forest communities with high spectral separability among communities. Variable important analysis revealed Vegetation Red Edge, Narrow NIR and NIR bands were useful for discriminating communities with maximum information along with SWIR and Red bands. Study found that collocation of the multi-date images was useful for classifying communities with higher accuracies. This attempt at characterizing heterogeneous vegetation communities with advanced machine learning tools in Himalayan foothills showed encouraging outcomes which can be used in future studies for monitoring and management of key habitats in this area.

AB  - This is an empirical study that attempts to explore the spatiotemporal changes of Urban Water Bodies (UWBs) in the Chittagong Metropolitan City from 1989 to 2015, using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems analytic techniques. More precisely, Ground Truthing, along with Landsat (TM) data and/(OLI) satellite images was collected for the years 1989, 2001, 2010 and 2015, respectively; Checklist Survey, Key Informant Interviews and observation (overt) methods were also used for conducting the study. Narrative Analysis along with statistical tools, especially SPSS (version-20), was applied as well. The study reveals that nearly 1249 types of water bodies were detected by the checklist survey and 'Ground Truthing Method', beside 1352 types of water bodies were identified through interpretation of series satellite images in the Metropolitan area. The total number of water bodies in Chittagong City was found declining gradually, because nearly 1605, 1526, 1400 and 1352 types of water bodies were detected in 1989, 2001, 2010 and 2015 years, respectively. Although the regression analysis curve prescribed the changing pattern or decreasing rate of UWBs was similar to 10% which represented per year interval. Besides, the emerged and filled nature of UWBs was confused conditions. Some water bodies were emerged or excavated at southern and western edges of the coast due to soil collection for road construction and commercial fishing purposes. Besides that, many water bodies filled at every place in city area due to unplanned urbanization and industrialization, new settlement and housing, land pricing and fragmentation, unlawful encroachment and violence of Real Estate Corporation and so on. Therefore, strengthening of laws and policies and proper coordination among urban autonomous agencies will be significant to stop illegally filled of water bodies and to protect water bodies in a Chittagong Metropolitan city in Bangladesh.

TI  - Assessment of Rainfall-Runoff Due to the Impacts of Land-Use Changes by Integrated Geospatial Empirical Approach: Study on Koraiyar Basin, Tiruchirappalli City, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes that occur in various forms of land classes are known as land-use and land-cover changes (LULC). Such changes have a substantial impact on the contours of an urban basin and consequently have an effect on the surface runoff of the rainfall that occurs in the area. The runoff features obviously deteriorate because of the decrease in initial abstraction, and an increase in imperviousness causes enhanced runoff. The particular challenges in the urban basin are specificity calculation and quantification of surface runoff. Geospatial techniques are adopted along with the Soil Conservation Service-curve number (SCS-CN) technique to reliably predict and accurately measure runoff. The GIS is used to prepare the transformed layers of land classes from remotely sensed data. In this explorative study, LULC change and its impact on the urban Koraiyar basin, Tiruchirappalli city, South India, is studied by using SCS-CN with the aid of GIS techniques. As the basin that passes is located in a developing city, rapid changes in LULC are observed in and around the periphery of the basin. The LULC changes and their impact on surface runoff are analyzed using GIS with multi-dated Landsat satellite images for the years 1986-2016 at intervals of every 10 years. The supervised classification algorithm is used to develop LULC maps. From the study, it is observed that there is a continuous increase in settlement area of 1.04% from 1986 to 2016, especially in the northern part of the basin. A Markov model analysis is done from the historically developed LULC maps to predict the anticipated future LULC changes for the years 2026 and 2036 along with an estimation of the surface runoff. The predicted maps show that there is likely to be an increase in settlement area of 1.04% and decrease in 12.29% of agricultural land. The various thematic layers like slope, soil and curve number (CN) maps are also prepared using GIS. The composite CNs are generated for various land classes in the basin from 1986 to 2036. The increase in CN from 72 to 74.76 and their influence on runoff are studied. Finally, the study attempts to reliably estimate the present and future LULC status and its effect on surface runoff in the Koraiyar river basin.

TI  - Water Consumption Modeling by Coupling MODIS Images and Agrometeorological Data for Sugarcane Crops
T2  - SUGAR TECH
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is the main component of crop water consumption. Sugarcane requires large volumes of water during its development and may induce changes in local and regional climate. Field measurements, besides their high cost, are insufficient to understand the ETa spatial variability-a gap that can be filled with remote sensing techniques, due to the spatial nature of satellite imaging and its low cost, which allows the construction of temporal, spatial series of estimates of energy and water balances components. The Simple Algorithm For Retrieving Evapotranspiration (SAFER) model was applied to sugarcane crop in the mesoregion of Bauru, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Surface agrometeorological data were used as inputs along with parameters obtained by remote sensing from January 2015 to June 2016. The highest values of daily ETa (> 5.0 mm d(-1)) were observed in the rainy season, during the sugarcane growing stage, indicating the phase of higher water demand, and the lowest values (< 3.0 mm d(-1)) were verified in the dry season, during the stages of emergence and maturation. Sugarcane crop was responsible for the consumption of 52% to 62% of the volume of precipitated water in the Bauru meso region. The results of the SAFER model using meteorological data from remote sensing (SAFER-RS) presented d1 = 0.72 in relation to results using surface weather data from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology-INMET (SAFER-INMET). The errors in the estimation of ETa by SAFER-RS may be due to errors in the meteorological data from the remote sensing used.

TI  - Towards global mapping of salt pans and salt playas using Landsat imagery: a case study of western United States
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring salt pans is important for agricultural management in arid/semi-arid regions because salt pans can negatively affect human life, wildlife, ecology, and cause accelerated desertification, cropland loss, and economic downturn. Spectral salt pan indices based on remotely-sensed data from previous studies vary by location and may not be readily applicable to another location due to the spatial heterogeneity of salt components across the continental surface. Using Landsat-8 imagery and climate datasets, this study aims to develop a mapping scheme which effectively delineates the maximum salt pan/playa extents under various spectral conditions for different geographic locations. Calibrated by a spectral training pool sampled from eight major salt pan/playa sites in the world, this mapping scheme first implements a conservative spectral index to highlight potential salt-covered regions, from which salt pans/playas are further extracted by a support vector machine (SVM). Quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) with assistance of auxiliary datasets and high-resolution images was performed to reduce commission errors and refine the results. The mapping scheme was applied to the endorheic regions of the western United States with a total area of approximately 700,000 km(2), of which 1.6% was mapped as salt pans. Quality assessments show reasonable reliability of the mapping result for most regions, with the producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and kappa coefficient exceeding 90%. The mapped spatial details reveal that salt pans are distributed fairly evenly across the arid western United States, with areas positively correlated to the sizes of the endorheic basins. Given these results, we foresee potential applicability of the developed scheme to map salt pans/playas across Earth's continental surface. Our spectral training pool and produced salt pan/playa extents are available through https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.913152.

TI  - Performance testing of selected spectral indices in automated extraction of impervious built-up surface features using Resourcesat LISS-III image
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing urban density and spatial expansion of urbanized areas result in changes from the natural landscape to impervious surface features. Remote sensing-based spectral indices provide an efficient method in the automated identification of land use and cover classes. However, a common challenge is the accurate extraction of built-up features from satellite images. The original Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) has been modified by several researchers in the anticipation of improvement of the built-up area classification. The indices adopted in the study are Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), Built Up Index (BUI), NDBI, Modified Built-up Index (MBI), and the newly developed Impervious Built-up Index (IBUI). These indices work on automated kernel-based probabilistic thresholding algorithm to group the index values into built-up and non-built-up areas. This study investigates the performance of the above mentioned five spectral indices on Resourcesat LISS III imageries over the Kolkata-Howrah urban agglomeration, India. The indices were compared and found based on the overall accuracy that the novel IBUI provided the maximum accuracy (94%) in extracting impervious built-up areas. Based on the overall accuracy and kappa statistic the IBUI was chosen for estimating spatio-temporal urban growth of the study area from 2003 to 2018 based on the same LISS-III sensor data. It was calculated that the urban built-up area has increased from 144 to 177 km(2).

TI  - CNN-based fusion and classification of SAR and Optical data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion combines the images of different spectral, spatial, multi-date, as well as radiometric data to achieve a better quality image for improved classification results. Recently, Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based classification algorithms are extensively used for remote sensing applications. Keeping this in view, present work proposes to use CNN-based fusion and classification of Sentinel 1 (VV and VH polarization) and Sentinel 2 datasets acquired over an agricultural area near Hisar (India). For image fusion, three CNN-based approaches are used to fuse Sentinel 2 (10 m) data with VV and VH bands of Sentinel 1 data. After fusion, classification was performed using 2D-CNN classifier to judge the performance of fused images in terms of classification accuracy. Results suggest that out of the three fusion approaches, only infrared image fusion (IVF) approach performed well with the considered dataset in terms of fusion indicators and classification accuracy. Keeping in view of its better performance, this study proposes a modified IVF approach by using different image pyramid methods. Comparison of results suggests an improved performance by modified IVF approach for the fusion of Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 1 data in comparison with the original IVF approach.

TI  - Recent recovery of Antarctic Bottom Water formation in the Ross Sea driven by climate anomalies
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interacting atmospheric circulation patterns are responsible for a recent reversal of a decades-long decline in deepwater formation on the Antarctic shelf, according to an analysis of in situ and remote sensing data from the Ross Sea.Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) supplies the lower limb of the global overturning circulation, ventilates the abyssal ocean and sequesters heat and carbon on multidecadal to millennial timescales. AABW originates on the Antarctic continental shelf, where strong winter cooling and brine released during sea ice formation produce Dense Shelf Water, which sinks to the deep ocean. The salinity, density and volume of AABW have decreased over the last 50 years, with the most marked changes observed in the Ross Sea. These changes have been attributed to increased melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here we use in situ observations to document a recovery in the salinity, density and thickness (that is, depth range) of AABW formed in the Ross Sea, with properties in 2018-2019 similar to those observed in the 1990s. The recovery was caused by increased sea ice formation on the continental shelf. Increased sea ice formation was triggered by anomalous wind forcing associated with the unusual combination of positive Southern Annular Mode and extreme El Nino conditions between 2015 and 2018. Our study highlights the sensitivity of AABW formation to remote forcing and shows that climate anomalies can drive episodic increases in local sea ice formation that counter the tendency for increased ice-sheet melt to reduce AABW formation.

TI  - InSAR Reveals Complex Surface Deformation Patterns Over an 80,000 km<SUP>2</SUP> Oil-Producing Region in the Permian Basin
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we used Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data acquired between November 2014 to January 2019 to map how the basin's surface has deformed in response to fluid injection and extraction. While our stacking approach has low complexity, its accuracy increases with the Sentinel-1 data volume. With an automated outlier removal algorithm, we achieved similar to 2 mm/year accuracy across the basin in the presence of up to +/- 15 cm tropospheric noise. We observed numerous subsidence and uplift features near active production and disposal wells, with the maximum deformation rate occurring in 2018 when production peaked. The most important deformation signatures are linear patterns that extend tens of kilometers near Pecos, TX, where a cluster of increased seismic events was cataloged by the Texas Seismological Network (TexNet). Our elastic modeling results demonstrate that fluid extraction and dip slip along normal faults are potential causes for the observed seismicity and deformation patterns.

TI  - Toward Determining the Spatio-Temporal Variability of Upper-Ocean Ecosystem Stoichiometry From Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The elemental stoichiometry of particulate organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) connects the C fluxes of biological production to the availability of the limiting nutrients in the ocean. It also influences the marine food-web by modulating zooplankton's feeding behavior and organic matter decomposition by bacteria. Despite its importance, there is a general paucity of information on how the global C:N:P ratio evolves seasonally and interannually, and large parts of the global ocean remain devoid of observational data. Here, we present a new method combining satellite ocean-color data with a cellular-trait-based model to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of the phytoplankton stoichiometry in the surface mixed layer of the ocean. This new method is demonstrated specifically for the C:P ratio. The approach was applied to phytoplankton growth rates and chlorophyll-to-carbon ratios derived from MODIS-Aqua and maps of temperature-dependent nutrient limitation to generate global and seasonal maps of upper-ocean phytoplankton C:P. Taking it a step further, we determined the C:P of the bulk particulate organic matter, using MODIS-Aqua estimates of particulate organic carbon and phytoplankton biomass. Our results are within 95% confidence interval of available data for both horizontal distributions and time series, indicating our new method's viability in accurately quantifying seasonally resolved global ocean bulk C:P. We anticipate the new hyperspectral capabilities of the NASA PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) mission will facilitate the determination of phytoplankton stoichiometry for different size classes and further enhance the predictability of marine-ecosystem stoichiometry from space.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the computational capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to access and process different geospatial databases in order to generate a multiyear characterization of changes in rivers planforms. We develop the necessary code in GEE to delimit rivers at different scales using Landsat (Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System)) and Sentinel images. We implement three different methods for delimiting rivers based on satellite information: the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI). We apply these methods to annual mosaics generated for each source of information, and estimate rivers centerlines based on a thinning method. With the centerline and river planform delimitations, we automatically estimate three geomorphological indicators: mean width, connectivity and sinuosity. We apply our tool to analyse several reaches along eight representative Colombian rivers that exhibit different planforms and flow regimes, some of them correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).

M3  - Article
AB  - Context Integrated Terrain Unit (ITU) mapping is a technique used to develop maps depicting specific ecosystem services and landscape sensitivity measures useful for land-use planning and sampling designs for spatially stratified studies. Objectives Here we describe ITU classifications, mapping techniques, and geospatial products developed from 1992 to 2018 for arctic tundra in northern Alaska in areas of ongoing oil production and exploration. Methods We used data from 1779 field plots to classify and map geomorphology, surface form, vegetation, and disturbance history. We then derived map products for ecotypes, wildlife habitats, and U.S. National Wetland Inventory (NWI) wetlands by aggregating functionally similar ITU combinations. We evaluated the extent to which ground conditions may have changed in older portions of the ITU mapping using a map of Landsat-observed trends in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 1985-2012. Results The cumulative result of 26 years of study is a 3532.4 km(2) area of ITU mapping. The ITU code combinations were aggregated into 66 map ecotypes, 34 wildlife habitats, and 18 wetland classes. Most of the mapping area (65.4%) experienced no significant trend in vegetation greenness. Nearly all of the remaining area (34.6%) exhibited an increase in greenness. Conclusions The ITU mapping provides a baseline for monitoring future change against a backdrop of climate change and ongoing industrial activity. The map products serve as proxies for important subsurface characteristics in permafrost landscapes, and have facilitated seminal studies of landscape development and change in arctic Alaska.

TI  - Vertical Inhomogeneity Effect of Frozen Hydrometeor Habits in All-Sky Passive Microwave Simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we attempted to address the frozen hydrometeor habit vertical inhomogeneity (FHHVI) effects on microwave radiative transfer simulations. For simplification, we focused on a "two habits and two layers" FHHVI scheme in which two different ice habits can be assumed to be above and below a fixed habit boundary line of 325 hPa as suggested by studies of tropical cyclone vertical structure. The aforementioned FHHVI scheme was implemented into a radiative transfer for the Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) operational vertical sounder (RTTOV), which allows for close examination of the FHHVI effect on the radiative transfer process. Four scenarios (thin plate, dendrite, thin plate over dendrite, and dendrite over thin plate) were considered in the simulations at frequencies ranging from 10 to 183 GHz. We found that FHHVI has an obvious impact on the brightness temperature (BT) simulations. For real case studies, we considered the 2018 tropical cyclone Jebi in the Western Pacific basin. The hydrometeor profiles forecasted by the Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES) regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model were used, and the simulated results were compared with observations from the instruments aboard on the Fengyun-3D satellite, which recorded 61 overpasses during the life span of typhoon Jebi. We found that the overall performance of the BT simulations over multichannels could be improved by considering FHHVI effects. Specifically, the total penalty values that quantify the spectral consistency were 63.05 (dendrite), 43.88 (thin plate), 46.23 (dendrite over thin plate), and 39.03 (thin plate over dendrite), respectively.

TI  - Long-term variation in aerosol optical properties and their climatic implications over major cities of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates long-term variation in aerosol optical properties (AOP) and their associated climatic implications over selected cities of Chitral, Gwadar, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta in Pakistan for the period 2005-2018. For this purpose, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol index (AI) are retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Results revealed annual increasing trend of AOD with maximum values in summer during the study period over all study regions, except for Chitral. Similar annual trend was observed for AI but with minimum values in summer. Further, temperature and relative humidity (RH) showed significant relationships with AOD along with evidences of precipitation influences. In addition, the trajectory analysis of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) Model confirmed the arrival of both short and long-range air masses to the receptor sites. Similarly, the direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) and direct aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (DARFE) were calculated using Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data. The multiyear mean monthly atmospheric DARF values of 8.80, 16.32, 10.74, 21.64, 9.10 and 10.94 W/m(2) were observed over Chitral, Gwadar, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta, respectively. Consequently, the maximum heating rate (HR) of 0.48 K/day (Chitral), 0.93 K/day (Gwadar), 0.51 K/day (Karachi), 1.23 K/day (Lahore), 0.44 K/day (Peshawar) and 0.56 K/day (Quetta) showed a net warming effect during 2005-2018. These results can give an insight into aerosol concentration and can form the basis for aerosol-induced climatic implications in the study area.

TI  - Using TanDEM-X to measure pyroclastic flow source location, thickness and volume: Application to the 3rd June 2018 eruption of Fuego volcano, Guatemala
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of the volume of volcanic flows during an ongoing eruption is challenging but this information is crucial for improving risk assessment and for forecasting future events. Although previous studies have shown the ability of TanDEM-X satellite data to derive the thickness and the volume of lava flow fields during effusive eruptions, the method has not been explored yet for pyroclastic flows. Using bi-static interferometry, we produce TanDEM-X DEM on Fuego volcano (Guatemala) to measure the significant topographic changes caused by the 3rd June 2018 eruption, which destroyed the town of San Miguel Los Lotes. We estimate the volume of the Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs) to be 15.1 +/- 4.2 x 10(6) m(3). The deposits are likely to be the source of lahars during future rainy seasons. We identify the main channel of deposition (positive elevation changes) and the source region of pyroclastic material, areas of significant substrate erosion, and vegetation destruction (negative elevation changes). Our results show that the June 3rd 2018 pyroclastic flow was predominantly composed of material which had gravitationally collapsed from a location close to the vent. The eroded material increased the volume of the flow (bulking) and likely caused the run-out distance of the 2018 PDC to be larger than previous eruptions (1999-2017). This study highlights the potential of remote sensing techniques for actively monitoring topography changes in inaccessible locations and to rapidly derive deposit volumes. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Machine-learning classification of debris-covered glaciers using a combination of Sentinel-1/-2 (SAR/optical), Landsat 8 (thermal) and digital elevation data
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris cover on glacier surfaces hampers the accurate detection of debris-covered ice using traditional techniques based on image band ratios. Therefore, this study tests a new automatic classification scheme for hierarchical mapping of glacier surfaces based on machine learning classifiers including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Several raster layer combinations (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence image derived from Sentinel-1 data, visible near-infrared to short wave infrared bands from Sentinel-2, thermal information from Landsat 8 and geomorphometric parameters from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D 30 m mesh (AW3D30) digital elevation model) were tested to delineate the debris-covered glaciers in the Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan and Shaksgam valley, China. The highest over classification accuracy (97%) was obtained using the RF classifier (followed by the GB and SVM with radial basis function kernel) and utilizing all of the multisensor Sentinel/Landsat/ALOS data. Notably, the RF classifier showed to be robust to parameter settings, fast and accurate for mapping debris-covered ice. GB classifier showed similar performance as RF despite it has a moderately lower accuracy compared to RF. Although SVM classifier has a slower in the speed of tuning hyper-parameter, it still performs the third-best classification accuracy. As the multisensory data we used is freely and (near-)globally available, our methodology potentially could be applied for precise delineation of debris-covered glaciers in other areas.

TI  - Multiple combinations of melanocytic and vascular endothelial markers enhance the detection rate of lymphovascular invasion in cutaneous melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is believed to be the mechanism by which melanoma cells can disseminate to regional lymph nodes and distant sites and may be predictive of adverse outcome. Lymphovascular invasion often difficult to detect on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained sections, are readily identified with dual immunohistochemistry (IHC) for melanocytic and vascular markers.Methods A total of 100 primary cutaneous malignant melanoma cases that had a Breslow thickness of 1-4 mm and lacked LVI by conventional HE assessment were included. We compared the LVI detection rates of double staining for CD31/S100 and CD34/S100, and D2-40/S100, and examined the association of LVI with clinical outcomes.Results The dual immunohistochemical positivity for CD31/S100, CD34/S100, and D2-40/S100 were 40(40%), 17(17%) and 35(35%), respectively. On multivariate analysis, LVI was an independent predictor of SLN status. Multivariate analysis revealed that LVI and male gender were independent risk factors for overall survival.Conclusions The recognition of LVI is improved by dual IHC and predicts SLN metastasis. The detection of LVI using dual IHC, especially by a combination of CD31/S100 and D2-40/S100 is a useful step that inclusion should be recommended in basic evaluation parameters for cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Evaluating satellite-based evapotranspiration estimates for hydrological applications in data-scarce regions: A case in Ethiopia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resource development opens up opportunities for improving smallholder farmer livelihoods in subSaharan Africa; however, implementation of water resource interventions to ensure sustainability hinges on the availability of sufficient quantity and quality data for monitoring, analysis and planning. Such data is often acquired through instrumentation of water resources (e.g. stream flow monitoring) or the use of hydrological models. In sub-Saharan Africa, data scarcity has limited the ability to monitor and make appropriate decisions for water resource allocation and use. Data derived from remote sensing has been considered a viable option to fill this gap; however, there is limited research in the region that evaluate the quality of the remotely sensed based datasets. This study evaluated actual evapotranspiration (AET) estimates derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR AET) images and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16 AET) images using estimates from a grid-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The SWAT model was set up for the entire country of Ethiopia, and calibrated and validated using observed streamflow at several meso-scale watersheds in which satisfactory model performance was obtained. AET estimates from the calibrated and validated SWAT model were then used to evaluate remotely sensed based AET for three landscapes. The AVHRR AET better agreed with the SWAT-simulated AET than the MOD16 AET, although the AVHRR AET overestimated the SWAT-simulated AET in all of the landscapes. Both remotely sensed AET products showed better agreement with the SWAT-simulated AET over agriculture dominated landscapes compared to grassland and forest dominated landscapes. The findings of the study suggest that remotely sensed based AET may help to fine-tune hydrological models in agricultural landscapes in data-scarce regions to improve studies on the impacts of water management interventions aiming to ensure environmental sustainability while enhancing agricultural production, and household income and nutrition.

TI  - In situ production of bacterial cellulose/xanthan gum nanocomposites with enhanced productivity and properties using <i>Enterobacter</i> sp. FY-07
T2  - CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
M3  - Article
AB  - While bacterial cellulose (BC) is a widely used, high-value product, its industrial production is hindered by the limited properties and productivity. Herein, by combining optimized fermentation methods and adding XG for in situ modification during submerged fermentation of Enterobacter sp. FY-07 (FY-07), homogeneously modified BC/xanthan gum (XG) nanocomposites with enhanced productivity and properties were obtained. The relationship between BC productivity and the contact area between the bacteria and objects was explored. The productivity of BC reached 3.2 g/L/d under optimal conditions. Compared to BC, the BC/XG nanocomposite exhibited coarser fibers along with significantly higher hardness, chewiness, resilience, and tensile strength, making the nanocomposite more suitable for food and other applications. The findings provide a low-cost, simple, and efficient strategy to improve the properties and productivity of BC. This work has significant implications for the in situ modification and production of BC in the biopolymer industry.

TI  - Improved mapping and change detection of the start of the crop growing season in the US Corn Belt from long-term AVHRR NDVI
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term monitoring of crop phenology is a critical process to understand changes in cropland vegetation dynamics related to climate and human management. During the last four decades, seasonal changes in vegetation have been measured by satellite instruments, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs). However, an acceptable detection of crop phenology has been prevented due to its coarse spatial resolution (similar to 8 km) pixels in which croplands are frequently mixed with non-cropland. This study introduces a novel method for detecting the start of the growing season in cropland (SOSC) from the AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to examine the long-term changes in SOSC at the 8-km pixel level across the core cropping regions of the Midwestern United States (the so-called 'the Corn Belt') for 1982-2015. The AVHRR-based SOSC was compared with the SOSC retrieved from the pixels covering mostly croplands of the 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. These two satellite-based SOSC shows reasonable correspondence in spatial patterns so that the annual values of the root mean square difference ranges from 3.6 to 7.4 days during the overlapping period of 2008-2015. Also, an acceptable correspondence was found between the interannual variations in the AVHRR SOSCs and in the state-level survey of crop stages. For sowing stages, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.43 to 0.68; for flowering stages those ranged from 0.51 to 0.83. By analyzing long-term SOSC changes with climate factors, we found a strong tendency that warmer pre-season condition is accompanied with earlier SOSC. In addition, larger pre-season precipitation tends to postpone SOSC as strongly as the pre-season temperature affects SOSC in a considerable portion of the core cropland. This study suggests that the postponing of sowing due to larger precipitation, which has rarely been highlighted in previous studies, requires more attentions in order for better understanding of vegetation dynamics in agriculture-climate studies.

AB  - In the morning of June 21, 2018 (1:16 Universal Time (UTC)) the space body entered the Earth atmosphere in the Lipetsk region, Russia. This event was detected by a number of registration systems in cars, satellite observations of bolide light curve and subsequent dust trail. The videos, photos, satellite data allow us to calculate the trajectory and the orbit of the Ozerki bolide. The atmospheric entry velocity is 14. 9 +/- 1 km/s. The height of the depression point is 32.8 +/- 0.9 km and that of the maximum brightness is 27.2 +/- 0.9 km. The pre-atmospheric orbit of the Ozerki meteoroid was also calculated: q = 0.67 +/- 0.04 AU, a = 0.84 +/- 0.02 AU, e = 0.199 +/- 0.030, i = 18.44 degrees +/- 3.05 degrees, Omega = 89.6561 degrees and omega = 335.29 degrees +/- 5.15 degrees. The geocentric radiant position is RA = 307.51 degrees +/- 3 degrees and DEC = 43.11 degrees +/- 3.degrees The found material was called Ozerki meteorite and it is classified as an ordinary chondrite (L6). The estimated: mass of the meteoroid is 94 +/- 20 tons, the energy is 2.5 +/- 0.5 kt TNT, diameter is 3.7 +/- 0.5 m.

TI  - Estimation and evaluation of high spatial resolution surface soil moisture using multi-sensor multi-resolution approach
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Various soil moisture products (AMSR-E at 25 km, SMAP at 9 km, CCI at 25 km) available from different space agencies, derived using the active microwave remote sensing, may not be suitable for studies at a local level due to their coarse spatial resolution. Hence, an attempt has been made in this study to estimate the surface soil moisture at high spatial resolution using different high-resolution multispectral imageries from Landsat 8 OLI (Optical Land Imager) and Sentinel 2A MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), of similar date. The thermal (10.9 mu m) and short wave infra-red (SWIR) (2.2 mu m) bands of the Landsat image and the SWIR band (2.19 mu m) of Sentinel image were used to estimate the soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 30 m and 20 m respectively, whereas the red and near infrared (NIR) bands of both the images were used to estimate the dryness. As the thermal band at high spatial resolution (at 20 m or below) is not available, this study attempted to bridge the gap and integrate mull-sensor and multi-resolution feature space utilizing various scalable procedures so as to estimate soil moisture and dryness. Limitation due to unavailability of the thermal bands in Sentinel multispectral image was overcome through a bridging procedure using Landsat thermal bands derived LST and Sentinel derived NDVI to estimate Sentinel LST at 20 m. The distribution pattern of high-resolution estimated soil moisture in each coarse spatial resolution grid (1 km) was taken into consideration to downscale the available CCI and SMAP soil moisture data. The estimated soil moisture and dryness were upscaled to 1 km and then validated using the downscaled soil moisture products (SMAP and CCI), and a significant correlation having R-2 greater than 0.8, 0.5 and 0.4 was observed for the thermal band derived soil moisture, short wave band derived soil moisture, and the red and NIR band derived dryness, respectively. To understand the temporal variability of the soil moisture, data from three different seasons representing extreme soil moisture conditions (winter, summer and monsoon) were analyzed and found that the independently estimated soil moisture had errors in temporal continuity and spatial spread. Hence, the estimated soil moisture was standardized using annual information which resulted in more accurate products, and the SWIR Transformed Reflectance (STR) derived soil moisture was more accurate than LST derived product.

TI  - Transport of aerosols and trace gases during dust and crop-residue burning events in Indo-Gangetic Plain: Influence on surface ozone levels over downwind region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study addresses the influence of long-range transport from dust storm (event 1) and crop-residue burning (event 2) sources over Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) using ground-based measurements and satellite observations. In the present study, the spatial distribution and temporal variation of ambient particulate matter (PM) were assessed at 15 air quality monitoring stations situated in Rajasthan, north-western-Indo-Gangetic Plain (NW-IGP) and downwind region. During the dust event, the daily average mass concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 1.2-3.3 and 2.2-4.6 times higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS 60 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 and 100 mu g/m(3) for PM10) across stations in the vicinity of the Thar Desert. Stations in NW-IGP showed enhancement in PM2.5 and PM10 during crop-residue burning period. Agra being a downwind site was influenced by both the events and enhancement in PM levels was observed, however ozone (O-3) showed different variations during event 1 and 2. During the dust event, 6.1% reduction in the mean O-3 level compared to the study period was found while a significant enhancement (15.1%) during event 2 was observed at Agra. To determine the possible reasons for different O-3 trends, the variation of O-3 precursors carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) along with the meteorological parameters was also assessed. CO and NOx levels during event 1 were reduced similar to O-3 whereas during event 2 an enhancement in CO and NOx levels was observed. Satellite observations and backward air-mass trajectories suggested transport of aerosols from Thar Desert resulted in reduced O-3 levels during dust event while transport of O-3 precursors enhanced photochemical production of O-3 during crop-residue burning period at Agra.

TI  - Characterizing a landmark biomass-burning event and its implication for aging processes during long-range transport
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Springtime biomass burning (BB) in peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA) has a large impact on the downwind air quality as has been frequently observed at the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS). Numerous PSEA BB long-range transport events have been observed at LABS in the past decade, of which the biggest event (based on the carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratio and particulate matter (PM) loading) occurred on March 18, 2009. In this study, for the first time, in-situ observations from LABS, MERRA-2 reanalysis data, and satellite data were combined to elucidate this remarkable event. This event lasted over 29 h and seriously impacted the air quality at LABS. Average concentrations (+/- S.D.) of CO, ozone (O-3), and PM10 were 586.2 +/- 164.5 ppb, 105.2 +/- 23.4 ppb, and 90.4 +/- 24.4 mu g m(-3), respectively, which were enhanced ranging from 98% to 280% over the March 2009 average. Furthermore, significant increases in toxic air pollutants (e.g., gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and dibenzo-p-dioxin/furan) concentrations were also observed, implying a severe impact from BB smoke on ecosystems and human health. The transport pathway and BB smoke layer height were investigated with backward trajectories, daily satellite aerosol products, and lidar observations. The mean 55A 440 value of 0.87 suggested that the plume contained highly adsorbing aerosols, and the high char-EC/soot-EC ratio (low-temperature elemental carbon/high-temperature elemental carbon) of 29.4 suggested predominance of BB aerosols. In addition, plume aging indicators (e.g., Delta GEM/Delta CO, Delta O-3/ACO, char-EC/soot-EC) suggest the BB plume was only weakly aged (i.e. low air mass intermixing, low chemical transformation, low cloud interaction) and in a nearly pristine state during the whole of the long-range transport. This event study can serve as a valuable benchmark when identifying unaged BB plumes that have been transported from PSEA to LABS (>2000 km) and will be useful for characterizing PSEA BB and its impact on greater Asia environment.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the GOES-R series of geostationary satellites provides an opportunity to generate high-resolution satellite derived wind vectors over continental United States not possible from previous satellites. This study investigates the quality and the impact of assimilating satellite-derived winds (or Atmospheric Motion Vectors, AMVs) from the GOES-16 geostationary satellite on high-impact weather forecasts using the NOAA's ensemble based Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS). The WoFS runs at convection allowing scales (similar to 3 km) with a 15-min cycling frequency assimilating all available observations including conventional, radar and GOES-16 cloud water path retrievals over a limited area domain. Four severe weather events during 2018 are considered in this study to assess the potential impacts of assimilating GOES-16 AMVs into the WoFS. A total of eight experiments performed, four that assimilate AMV data and the remaining four do not with all including conventional, radar, and other satellite data. This research represents the first step to assimilated high resolution satellite derived winds into the convective-allowing ensemble data assimilation system. The results show that the overall impact of assimilation of AMVs is small, but positive for probabilistic forecasts of reflectivity objects.

TI  - Carbon exchange of a dryland cotton field and its relationship with PlanetScope remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural systems experience numerous management-associated events during the growing season that can significantly influence seasonal and annual carbon balances. Measurements of carbon fluxes from agricultural fields using micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance can improve our understanding of management and weather-driven changes in carbon budgets. In-situ carbon flux data are also valuable in developing remote sensing-based models for extrapolation of biome-specific carbon budgets to higher spatial scales. In this study, net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) was continuously measured for two years (2017 and 2018) from a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) field in College Station, Texas, USA. The measured NEE was partitioned into assimilatory (Gross Primary Production, GPP) and respiratory (Ecosystem respiration, R-eco) fluxes. There were substantial differences in carbon fluxes between the two years, which were driven by variations in meteorological conditions and growth of weeds. Due to dry conditions, growing season carbon uptake in 2018 was reduced (883 g C m(-2)) compared to 2017 (947 g C m(-2)). While the growing season of 2018 was dry, the postharvest off-season was remarkably wet with nearly 68% of the annual precipitation occurring after harvest (848 mm). This favored aggressive growth of weeds, resulting in substantial off-season carbon uptake in 2018 (374 g C m(-2) in 2018 compared to 100 g C m(-2) in 2017). Overall, the site was a net carbon source (175 g C m(-2)) in 2017, whereas it was a slight carbon sink (-5 g C m(-2)) in 2018. A significant correlation was found between satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GPP (R-2 0.78 in 2017 and 0.72 in 2018). Given that correlation, it would be possible to broaden these results to the wider region by estimating GPP with satellite data.

TI  - Stimulation of shear-transformation zones in metallic glasses by cryogenic thermal cycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cryogenic thermal cycling (CTC, between room temperature and 77 K) of a (Cu,Zr)-based bulk metallic glass (MG) leads to substantial reductions in the initial yield load F-y observed on instrumented indentation, and can reverse annealing-induced increases in Fy. In contrast, for hardness and elastic modulus, CTC has much less effect and can only partially reverse annealing effects. The distribution of Fy values is wide, reflecting heterogeneity in the MG. For a melt-spun Fe-based glass, CTC with more cycles induces similar changes in F-y, and has almost no effect on the magnetic properties. Such differing effects of CTC can be consistently interpreted in terms of its preferential effect on soft spots in a relatively rigid glass matrix. The capability for targeted stimulation of shear-transformation zones permits tailoring of MG properties, clearly facilitates initiation of plastic flow, and offers the prospect of improved plasticity and toughness even in annealed samples.

TI  - Comparison of three models to estimate the slant path atmospheric attenuation in central receiver solar thermal plants under Indian climatic conditions
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper compares three attenuation models for the distinct meteorological conditions of India and assesses the feasibility of using the satellite data to calculate the slant path extinction coefficient and the slant path transmissivity of the lower atmosphere. The attenuation models are compared for the sites of Pune, Kanpur, and Jaipur. The AERONET data is used with REST2 to model the direct normal irradiance and the total optical depth. The results indicate that the three models give similar transmissivity values for low aerosol concentrations. As the aerosol concentrations increase, the difference in the slant path transmissivity as calculated by two of the models increases with respect to the third reference model.The slant path transmissivity comparison shows that for AERONET AOD at 550 nm (AOD550) less than 0.3, the relative error in the transmissivity values estimated by two of the compared models with respect to the third model is not higher than 10 % for Pune, 18 % for Kanpur, and 12 % for Jaipur. The mean relative error in the slant path transmissivity values obtained from the reference model using MODIS data with respect to the values obtained using AERONET data is 4.8 %, 10.2 %, and 9.2 % for Pune, Kanpur, and Jaipur, respectively. A difference of 0.2 between AERONET AOD550 and MODIS AOD550 values resulted in a difference of 0.05-0.08 between the transmissivity values calculated by the reference model using AERONET AOD550 and using MODIS AOD550 for the three sites.

TI  - Mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy of carbonaceous chondrites and Calcium-Aluminum-rich inclusions
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We obtained mid-infrared reflectance spectra of powdered size fractions (0-25 mu m, 25-63 mu m, 63-125 mu m and 125-250 mu m) of 5 carbonaceous chondrites HaH 280 (CK4), Allende (CV3), NWA 10574 (CM2) and Murchison (CM2), and C2 (ungrouped) Tagish Lake. In addition, in-situ micro-FTIR reflectance spectra of CAIs in Allende, Ornans and Vigarano have been made.These spectra are part of a database for the comparison with remote sensing data of asteroids and planetary bodies, but also for laboratory studies of meteorites.Carbonaceous chondrites HaH 280 (CK4), Allende (CV3) and NWA 10574 (CM2) show mid-IR spectra with Reststrahlen bands (RB) dominated by forsterite and pyroxene features. The transparency features (TF) are at 12.1 mu m-12.9 mu m and the Christiansen features (CF) at 8.5 mu m-9.3 mu m.Murchison (CM2) and ungrouped Tagish Lake (C2) show mainly phyllosilicate features in their spectra. The CF is between 8.6 mu m and 9.0 mu m.Micro-FTIR spectra of CAIs from Allende, Vigarano, and Ornans have spinel features between 14.1 mu m and 14.3 mu m. In addition, melilite was identified in the Vigarano and Ornans samples with characteristic features at 11.7 mu m and 12.4 mu m.Nepheline and sodalite features have been identified around 14 pm in the Allende CAI as alteration phases resulting from thermal metamorphism.A band shift in spinel with increasing Fe content from thermal metamorphism could be spectral indicator for parent body metamorphism.A comparison with other bulk samples from the same meteorites/type shows high similarity.Comparison of the finest size fractions modelled in emissivity with remote sensing data of asteroids shows some similarity between a linear mixture of Allende and Murchison and the spectra of asteroid 253 Mathilde. However, the main 10 pm plateau is clearly shifted by 0.5 pm between asteroid and meteorite spectra. Also, the general band shapes are different. Differences between asteroidal environment (e.g. fairy castle structure) and laboratory make direct comparisons difficult.

TI  - Calibration and verification of century based wave climate data record along the Turkish coasts using satellite altimeter data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to produce consistent reanalysis of the climate system, ECMWF (The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) has produced firstly an uncoupled atmospheric reanalysis ERA-20C, and then a coupled climate reanalysis, called CERA-20C, which covers the period January 1900 to December 2010. Both data sets are available at 3-hour time increments. Such a century long data can be an alternative to calculate the extreme waves corresponding to low probability of occurrences without extrapolation of extreme value statistics' results which may contribute to the error in the estimation of design waves in case of small number of wave data. In this study, main purpose is to calibrate and verify the century-based wave data in order to derive the longest and the consistent wave data along the Turkish coasts as a first time to be used in the extreme wave analysis. For this purpose, first of all, significant wave height data of ERA-20C and CERA-20C are compared by using ENVISAT data over the whole Black Sea for 2007-2008 as a pilot study. Comparison results show that both datasets give similar results but CERA-20C seems to be better in terms of statistical error measures. Then CERA-20C significant wave height data are calibrated using satellite Radar Altimeter data set. Jason family of satellites (TOPEX, Jason-1 and 2) and Envisat family of satellites (ERS-2 and Envisat) are inter-calibrated to get the consistent satellite data sets with a total duration of 18 years (1995-2012) for Envisat family and 26 years (1992-2017) for Jason family in order to be used in calibration of CERA-20C wave height. The mean wave period is also estimated from RA backscatter coefficients (Ku and C bands) and the significant wave height by using Artificial Neural Network Method. Then the estimated mean wave periods are used for the calibration of CERA-20C wave period. Calibrated CERA-20C data are compared with in-situ measurements for the verification purposes. Results of verification study show that the calibrated CERA-20C wave data agree well with the in-situ measurements in terms of Quantile-Quantile analysis with lower deviations from y = x line and capture the largest sea states. In fact, CERA-20C, century-based wave data become appropriate to determine the extreme waves to be used in the design of coastal structures along the Turkish coasts. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

TI  - Response of major air pollutants to COVID-19 lockdowns in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 suddenly struck Wuhan at the end of 2019 and soon spread to the whole country and the rest of world in 2020. To mitigate the pandemic. China authority has taken unprecedentedly strict measures across the country. That provides a precious window to study how the air quality response to quick decline of anthropogenic emissions in terms of national scale, which would be critical basis to make atmospheric governance policies in the future. In this work, we utilized observations from both remote sensing and in-situ measurements to investigate impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on different air pollutions in different regions of China. It is witnessed that the PM2.5 concentrations exhibited distinct trends in different regions, despite of plunges of NO2 concentrations over the whole country. The steady HCHO concentration in urban area provides sufficient fuels for generations of tropospheric O-3, leading to high concentrations of O-3, especially when there is not enough NO to consume O-3 via the titration effect. Moreover, the SO2 concentration kept steady at a low level regardless of cities. As a conclusion, the COVID-19 lockdown indeed helped reduce NO2 concentration. However, the atmospheric quality in urban areas of China has not improved overall due to Iockdown measures. It underscores the significance of comprehensive control of atmospheric pollutants in cleaning air. Reducing VOCs (volatile organic compounds) concentrations in urban areas would be a critical mission for better air quality in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Satellite-derived turbidity in front of small rivers mouths in the Eastern Tropical Pacific coast of Mexico
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity is a key indicator of water quality. It has biotic effects due to low penetration of light into the water such as photosynthesis reduction. The seasonal and interannual variability of turbidity in the Eastern Tropical Pacific coast of Mexico were analyzed using ocean color data. The region has an extended continental shelf, with several river discharges and marked seasonal patterns of wind. Remote sensing data (1998 to 2017) of reflectance, wind, rainfall, and river discharges were analyzed through Hovmoller diagrams and Empirical Orthogonal Functions. The results indicated that wind stress explained 76% of the turbidity variance, while 8% was explained by river discharges and rainfall. In winter, turbidity is intensified by resuspension mechanisms in front of the southern river mouths. In spring, turbidity increases due tophytoplankton particulate concentrations enhanced by coastal upwelling. During summer and autumn, wind stress is weaker and river discharges increase, thus turbidity increases in front of northern river mouths. El Nino-Southern Oscillation generates turbidity anomalies by alteration of rainfall and wind stress. Despite the proximity of the river mouths, the coastal water turbidity is explained by different processes, which need to be assessed in coastal management. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

TI  - Attribution of climate and human activities to vegetation change in China using machine learning techniques
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of policies and laws have been implemented to address climate change impacts in China since the 1980s. One of the most notable policies is ecological restoration engineering. However, there are many environmental factors that affect vegetation in the ecological restoration engineering zones. The relationships among different factors cannot be explained well by traditional statistical methods due to the existence of hidden non-linear features. Moreover, it is difficult to adopt threshold methods to accurately define vegetation areas fully, or to quantitatively analyze and assess the effects of climate factors and human activities on vegetation changes. The objective of this study was to determine vegetation area and distribution using Landsat TM/ETM/OLI images combined with a support vector machine (SVM) classification model. We analyzed the dynamic characteristics of vegetation area and greenness (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in China's ecological restoration engineering zones from 1990 to 2015. Based on random forest regression (RFR) with a residual analysis method, the contributions of meteorological factors and human activities to vegetation greenness changes were quantitatively evaluated. Vegetation area and NDVI changed significantly in the study areas, increasing by more than 50% and 40%, respectively, from 1990 to 2015. Temperature, sunshine hours, and precipitation impacted vegetation greenness, which caused NDVI fluctuations in specific years. However, the NDVI increase was difficult to explain fully with meteorological factors. Using cross-validation, we predicted about 80% of the observed NDVI variation occurring from 1984 to 1994. Nine meteorological factors were related to vegetation growth, of which the average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and average relative humidity were most critical. The combined effect of the nine climatic factors contributed less to NDVI increase than human activities. Human activity was the most important factor associated with NDVI increase, with contributions of more than 100% in most study areas. Human activities derived from national or local policies had large impacts on vegetation changes. The methods and results of this study can help to understand vegetation changes observed in ecological zones and provide guidance for evaluating ecological restoration policies.

TI  - Which dual-band infrared indices are optimum for identifying aerosol compositional change using Himawari-8 data?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth algorithms predominantly use the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, quantifying sporadic dust events throughout the full 24-h period requires using continuous wavelengths such as infrared (IR). Identifying aerosols, using IR from geostationary data, has relied on subtraction indices rather than normalised differences. Limited attention has been given to determining which IR indices could be suitable for identifying aerosol compositional change. Suitable IR indices could potentially result in multi-spectral data from geostationary satellites, such as Himawari, being used to separate dust from other types of aerosols.This study evaluated three index types: subtraction (brightness temperature difference (BTD)), normalised differences, and division (i.e. quotient). The effectiveness of these three indices were assessed against three sample matrix types: (i) pure soil spectra from the USGS Spectral Library Version 7 database; (ii) potential aerosol plumes, estimated from data relating to the formation and dissipation of a dust storm; and (iii) annual variance, at a surface monitoring site. Absorbance values from the USGS spectral database were aggregated into the spectrally broad Himawari-8 infrared bands. Potential plumes (i.e. transient over a small area) were identified from daily variances in the Himawari-8 satellite data. Principal component analysis was used to determine the variance explained by the first principal component for each of the sample and index types and to evaluate the effectiveness of the indices for detecting dust events.Simple subtraction indices explained more of the variance than normalised differences or division for all sample types. Of the 45 BTD indices analysed, only seven resolved the cloud and aerosol plumes into separate groups. Of these seven indices, BTD3.9-6.2 mu m and BTD11-12 mu m had the least correlation with the other indices and were chosen as the best indices to identify aerosol compositional change. A further three indices BTD9.6-13 mu m BTD8.6-10 mu m and BTD(6.9-7.3 mu m )were selected based on low correlations between other indices and ensuring that all ten IR wavelengths were utilised. This study indicates that the combination of these five indices, rather than a single index, may optimise the identification of aerosol compositional change.

TI  - Pre- and post-failure dynamics of landslides in the Northern Apennines revealed by space-borne synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR)
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are common landscape features in the Northern Apennine mountain chain and cause frequent damages to human structures and infrastructure. Most landslides in the area can be dassified as earthflows, where the clay-shales form the substrate, whereas complex landslides with flow and sliding components are common on the slopes where fine-grained turbidites form the substrate. Most of these landslides move periodically with contained velocities and, only after particular rainfall events, some of them accelerate abruptly. Space-borne synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) provides a particularly convenient way for studying the periods before and alter failures. In this paper, we present InSAR-results derived from the Sentinel 1 satellite constellation for two landslide cases in the Northern Apennines. The first case is a complex landslide that is hosted on a pelitic flysch formation, whereas the second case is an earthflow located in chaotic clay shales. Both cases failed catastrophically and threatened or damaged important infrastructures. In the case of the complex landslide, we report spatially variations of the deformation field between repeated periods of acceleration. The data illustrate that the deformation initiated in the upper part of the slope and expanded over the whole landslide body afterward. In the case of the earthflow, we describe spatial and temporal kinematics during the period before a catastrophic failure in March 2018. We discuss the temporal deformation signal together with rainfall and snowmelt data from a nearby meteorological station. Deformation and precipitation data highlight that high total precipitation can be considered the trigger of the failure. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pyroxene chemistry and crystallization history of basaltic units in the Mare Humorum on the nearside of the Moon: Implications for the volcanic history of the region
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mare basalts are volcanic features on the lunar surface and are vital for understanding the Moon's volcanic and thermal history. The present study investigates the mineralogy and chemical variations of the mare basaltic units in the Mare Humorum on the Moon's nearside using orbital remote sensing data from recent lunar exploration missions. The previous model ages available for the Humorum basaltic units have been utilized in the present study to understand the chemical evolution of these basaltic units with time. Basalts of Imbrian-Eratosthenian periods occur in the Mare Humorum. Hyperspectral data from Moon Mineralogy Mapper onboard Chandrayaan-1 mission showed pigeonites and augites as the major compositions in these basaltic units. The compositional trend between pigeonites and augites point towards the differentiation of the basaltic magma while cooling. The older units crystallized from a Fe-enriched fractionated magma while the younger unit formed from an Mg and Ca-rich magma. The distinct chemical trends in the pyroxene quadrilateral revealed that multiple volcanic eruptions have occurred in the Mare Humorum. The longward and shoreward shifts in the Band I and Band II centres in the younger and older basalts respectively, also indicate that the older basaltic units crystallized more Fe2+-rich, Ca-depleted pyroxenes while the younger basaltic unit was formed from a rather Ca-rich magma. Hence, the basaltic magmas erupted in the Mare Humorum during Imbrian and Eratosthenian periods were derived from heterogeneous source regions.

TI  - Investigating the urban-induced microclimate effects on winter wheat spring phenology using Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the phenology of winter wheat. Rapid urbanization in China dramatically modifies the microclimate, especially temperature, surrounding cities. However, it is unclear whether such urban-induced changes in microclimate can influence the phenology of winter wheat and whether the influence is consistent across cities of different sizes. Here, we investigated the urban-induced microclimate effects on winter wheat spring phenology (i.e., the regreen-up date, RGUD) in three cities spanning a range of sizes in northern China. These three cities include Shijiazhuang (350.98 km(2)), Baoding (118.95 km(2)), and Linqing (55.12 km(2)), and the key data for this study are Sentinel-2 images. Based on the Sentinel-2 images, we first calculated a vegetation index (normalized difference phenology index, NDPI), and then extracted winter wheat RGUD. Finally, we analyzed the distribution of the RGUD along an urban-rural gradient using buffers surrounding the urban areas. Our study has three main results: (1) The RGUD shows a significant increasing trend along the urban-rural gradients in both Shijiazhuang and Baoding, suggesting that urban-induced increases in temperature indeed advance the spring phenology of winter wheat. (2) The maximum influence size of the urban-induced temperature effects on the RGUD is positively correlated with city size, i.e., 27 km for Shijiazhuang, 14 km for Baoding and 7 km for Linqing. (3) The change rate of the RGUD with distance along the urban-rural gradient is significantly higher in the large city (Shijiazhuang: 0.26 day/km) than it is in the middle- and small-scale cities (Baoding: 0.21 day/km and Linqing: 0.11 day/km), which suggests that larger cities spread heat at a faster rate than that of smaller cities. This study suggests that the planting and management of winter wheat surrounding cities should consider the influence of city size to optimize yields.

TI  - Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth from the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager data: Application over Beijing in the summer of 2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8, a new generation geostationary satellite, with the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) providing Full Disk observation with high temporal resolution (10 min) exhibits prominent advantage in monitoring aerosols over East Asia region. The AHI has 16 channels from 0.46 to 13.3 to capture visible and infrared spectral data. In this paper, we developed a regional algorithm to retrieve the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over Beijing area based on the AHI visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) data from June to August 2016. The AHI surface reflectance at 0.46, 0.64, 0.86 and 2.3 um channel was obtained using the lowest gas-corrected reflectance based on the three-month top of the atmosphere (TOA) data. The algorithm employed superposing technique and linear regression to iteratively train the AHI surface reflectance, and built optimal surface reflectance relationships between visible and SWIR bands with three Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classifications over Beijing area. Based on these surface reflectance relationships, the AHI AOD data were retrieved through the radiation transmission function. The AOD products from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) ground measurement, the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) official AHI were used to evaluate the performance of our AOD retrievals. At diurnal scale, more than 66% of AHI AOD retrievals fell within the EE in the afternoon, which indicated that these retrievals could capture the regional aerosol variability over Beijing area. In contrast, the AHI JAXA AOD product significantly overestimated aerosol loadings. The low AOD biases (13:00-16:00) under low aerosol conditions from our retrieval algorithm demonstrated that the AHI surface reflectance assumptions are available. However, AHI retrievals in XiangHe overestimated AOD under high aerosol conditions, which indicated that the urban aerosol model is inappropriate over this site. In addition, our AHI AOD algorithm was only applied over Beijing area in the summer of 2016. The retrieval time-independence in this algorithm has not been estimated in fall and winter when NDVI is lower. Future study will investigate this surface algorithm at larger temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - Riparian buffers act as microclimatic refugia in oil palm landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing interest in the ecological value of set-aside habitats around rivers in tropical agriculture. These riparian buffers typically comprise forest or other non-production habitat, and are established to maintain water quality and hydrological processes, while also supporting biodiversity, ecosystem function and landscape connectivity.We investigated the capacity for riparian buffers to act as microclimatic refugia by combining field-based measurements of temperature, humidity and dung beetle communities with remotely sensed data from LiDAR across an oil palm dominated landscape in Borneo.Riparian buffers offer a cool and humid habitat relative to surrounding oil palm plantations, with wider buffers characterised by conditions comparable to riparian sites in continuous logged forest.High vegetation quality and topographic sheltering were strongly associated with cooler and more humid microclimates in riparian habitats across the landscape. Variance in beetle diversity was also predicted by both proximity-to-edge and microclimatic conditions within the buffer, suggesting that narrow buffers amplify the negative impacts that high temperatures have on biodiversity.Synthesis and applications. Widely legislated riparian buffer widths of 20-30 m each side of a river may provide drier and less humid microclimatic conditions than continuous forest. Adopting wider buffers and maintaining high vegetation quality will ensure set-asides established for hydrological reasons bring co-benefits for terrestrial biodiversity, both now, and in the face of anthropogenic climate change.

TI  - Monitoring soil carbon flux with in-situ measurements and satellite observations in a forested region
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) flux plays a key role in the energy balance of ecosystems and effective monitor CO2 flux from soil at both large scale and high temporal resolution remains a critical scientific problem of soil science. To address this scientific problem, this study tested a novel model to estimate CO2 flux from soil with highly dense vegetation cover. In contrast to previous approaches, the developed model monitored daily CO2 flux at both high spatial and temporal resolutions. This model is applicable for different forest types by fusing the daily TERRA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Land Remote Sensing Satellite (Landsat) measurements, and monthly in-situ CO2 flux measurements collected by non-permanent chambers in the Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), the U.S. Then, daily vegetation index and surface soil temperature were estimated at high spatial resolution, and the CO2 flux was retrieved through a semi-empirical model. Two-year ground observations in the GDS were used to train and validate the model. Over the GDS area, the validation results of the retrieved CO2 flux had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.47, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.25e + 05 mu g CO2/m(2)/h. Further analysis showed that the performance of the proposed method varied slightly with forest types. The difference between R-2 was less than 0.07 and the difference between RMSE was less than 0.08e + 05 mu g CO2/m(2)/h. The GDS has three main forest types: maple gum (Ater rubrum and Nyssa sylvatica), Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), and pine pocosin (Pines serotina). For the maple-gum, the R-2 was 0.51, and the RMSE was 1.14e + 05 mu g CO2/m(2)/h. For Atlantic white cedar, the R-2 was 0.62, and the RMSE was 1.15e + 05 mu g CO2/m(2)/h. For pine pocosin, the R-2 was 0.44, and the RMSE was 1.07e + 05 mu g CO2/m(2)/h. The proposed method enables estimation of CO2 flux within forested areas, and forest type affects the monitoring results.

TI  - Improvement of snow/haze confusion data gaps in MODIS Dark Target aerosol retrievals in East China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of the most widely used meteorological remote sensing instruments. Its Dark Target aerosol optical depth (AOD) product has been widely used in en-vironment and meteorology researches, such as model evaluation and data assimilation. However, this product has a low coverage under conditions of heavy haze in China. This is because the haze can be misidentified as snow under some circumstances by the algorithm and therefore rejected, leading to large-scale data omission. In the most polluted regions, misidentified snow cover exceeded 8%. Regarding this issue, a new method com-bining the snow mask derived from the MODIS cloud mask product and Fisher discrimination analysis was developed to give a more accurate identification of snow and ice cover. Applying this new method increases the AOD data coverage significantly. Comparisons with AOD values from ground-based observations showed that the newly produced data under haze conditions had a similar accuracy with the original data in the MODIS AOD product. Because the newly supplemented data are more distributed at the seriously polluted regions, the average AOD increased significantly after data filling in many regions. In winter, AOD in the most severely polluted regions (average air quality index > 130) increased by 0.2-0.3 after improvement, about 30-50% of the original value. In 49 haze cases with large-scale pollution, the increase reached 0.3-0.6, about 50%-70% of the original value. During the haze episodes, the data omission led to an underestimation of the regional average AOD by 19-40%. The improvement in AOD coverage helps to provide a better reflection of the air pollution condition in East China through the perspective of AOD.

TI  - The development and application of satellite remote sensing for atmospheric compositions in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The variations of atmospheric compositions (ACs) can change the atmospheric interactions with other parts of the ecosystem, and it also affects the energy budget of the Earth. Satellite remote sensing plays a crucial role in monitoring AC by providing a matchless global perspective with consistency over long periods. Although China started space exploration missions in the early 1970s, the situation of lacking operational AC satellite missions was turned around until the launch of FY-3A in 2008. In the following decade, more Chinese pathfinder AC satellite missions were putting into operation, and then lead to a boom in related researches on air quality, trace gases and greenhouse gases (GHG) measurements. In particular, moderate resolution imageries of polar mission FY-3 series are used to monitor air quality, and recent comparable imagery onboard geostationary mission FY-4A could provide similar air pollution observation with higher temporal resolution of up to five minutes. Nadir spectrographs onboard FY-3 series and the latest pathfinder mission GF-5 aims to monitor various trace gases. Moreover, hyper-spectrometers onboard GF-5 and another pathfinder mission TanSat are devoted to mapping the global distribution of GHG, as a supplement to operational mission FY-3D. Besides the progress in the space borne part, the in-situ calibration and validation have achieved fruitfully since the late 1990s, gaining insight into the consistency between the satellite and in-situ observations over China. Applications and studies based on Chinese satellite missions are still growing since it has only been a few years after their launch. Furthermore, the newly planned missions for monitoring AC with active remote sensing instruments are also illustrated, such as lidar, which will be able to improve the accuracy of space-borne observations.

TI  - Re-initiating depth-discharge monitoring in small-sized ungauged watersheds by combining remote sensing and hydrological modelling: a case study in Madagascar
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a practical approach to reconstructing past and present discharge and water depth time series for operational monitoring of small-sized ungauged watersheds using remotely sensed and freely accessible datasets in conjunction with hydrological models. The methodology was applied to the Tsiribihina watershed in Madagascar. Mostly, satellite data are used, such as water levels from satellite altimetry missions and rainfall from the African Rainfall Climatology 2 product. In contrast, the Modelo de Grandes Bacias is calibrated using historical discharge measurements to simulate distributed discharge in the basin. Rating curves are computed by crossing the altimetry information of water height with the simulated discharge outputs. These rating curves enable the conversion of water levels, discharge and depth interchangeably. Present-day discharge and depth can thus be estimated in near real time with any update of satellite rainfall data and/or water level gained by altimetry missions currently flying in operational mode.

TI  - Simulating optical top-of-atmosphere radiance satellite images over snow-covered rugged terrain
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of snow-covered surfaces on Earth is largely facilitated by the wealth of satellite data available, with increasing spatial resolution and temporal coverage over the last few years. Yet to date, retrievals of snow physical properties still remain complicated in mountainous areas, owing to the complex interactions of solar radiation with terrain features such as multiple scattering between slopes, exacerbated over bright surfaces. Existing physically based models of solar radiation across rough scenes are either too complex and resource-demanding for the implementation of systematic satellite image processing, not designed for highly reflective surfaces such as snow, or tied to a specific satellite sensor. This study proposes a new formulation, combining a forward model of solar radiation over rugged terrain with dedicated snow optics into a flexible multi-sensor tool that bridges a gap in the optical remote sensing of snow-covered surfaces in mountainous regions. The model presented here allows one to perform rapid calculations over large snow-covered areas. Good results are obtained even for extreme cases, such as steep shadowed slopes or, on the contrary, strongly illuminated sun-facing slopes. Simulations of Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) scenes performed over a mountainous region in the French Alps allow us to reduce the bias by up to a factor of 6 in the visible wavelengths compared to methods that account for slope inclination only. Furthermore, the study underlines the contribution of the individual fluxes to the total top-of-atmosphere radiance, highlighting the importance of reflected radiation from surrounding slopes which, in midwinter after a recent snowfall (13 February 2018), accounts on average for 7% of the signal at 400 nm and 16% at 1020 nm (on 13 February 2018), as well as of coupled diffuse radiation scattered by the neighbourhood, which contributes to 18% at 400 nm and 4% at 1020 nm. Given the importance of these contributions, accounting for slopes and reflected radiation between terrain features is a requirement for improving the accuracy of satellite retrievals of snow properties over snow-covered rugged terrain. The forward formulation presented here is the first step towards this goal, paving the way for future retrievals.

TI  - A complex aerosol transport event over Europe during the 2017 Storm Ophelia in CAMS forecast systems: analysis and evaluation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In mid-October 2017 Storm Ophelia crossed over western coastal Europe, inducing the combined transport of Saharan dust and Iberian biomass burning aerosols over several European areas. In this study we assess the performance of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) forecast systems during this complex aerosol transport event and the potential benefits that data assimilation and regional models could bring. To this end, CAMS global and regional forecast data are analysed and compared against observations from passive (MODIS: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard Terra and Aqua) and active (CALIOP/CALIPSO: Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite sensors and ground-based measurements (EMEP: European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme). The analysis of the CAMS global forecast indicates that dust and smoke aerosols, discretely located on the warm and cold fronts of Ophelia, respectively, were affecting the aerosol atmospheric composition over Europe during the passage of the Storm. The observed MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are satisfactorily reproduced by the CAMS global forecast system, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 and a fractional gross error (FGE) of 0.4. The comparison with a CAMS global control simulation not including data assimilation indicates a significant improvement in the bias due to data assimilation implementation, as the FGE decreases by 32 %. The qualitative evaluation of the IFS (Integrated Forecast System) dominant-aerosol type and location against the CALIPSO observations overall reveals a good agreement. Regarding the footprint on air quality, both CAMS global and regional forecast systems are generally able to reproduce the observed signal of increase in surface particulate matter concentrations. The regional component performs better in terms of bias and temporal variability, with the correlation deteriorating over forecast time. Yet, both products exhibit inconsistencies on the quantitative and temporal representation of the observed surface particulate matter enhancements, stressing the need for further development of the air quality forecast systems for even more accurate and timely support of citizens and policy-makers.

TI  - The human health burden of non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> foodborne gastroenteritis in Shanghai, east China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the burden of disease due to foodborne pathogens in China is quite limited. To understand the incidence of foodborne gastroenteritis due to non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, population survey and sentinel hospital surveillance were conducted during July 2010 to June 2011 in Shanghai, east China, and a model for calculating disease burden was established. The multiplier for gastroenteritis caused by these pathogens was estimated at 59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 30-102]. Annual incidence per 100,000 population in Shanghai was estimated as 48 (95% CI 24-83) and 183 (95% CI 93-317) cases for foodborne non-typhoidal salmonellosis and V. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis, respectively, illustrating that bacterial gastroenteritis due to these two pathogens poses a substantial health burden. There is a significant difference between our simulated incidence and the data actually reported for foodborne diseases, indicating significant underreporting and underdiagnosis of non-typhoidal S. enterica and V. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis in the surveillance area. The present research demonstrates basic situation of the health burden caused by major foodborne pathogens in the surveillance area. Enhanced laboratory-based sentinel hospital surveillance is one of the effective ways to monitor food safety in east China.

TI  - Defoliation severity is positively related to soil solution nitrogen availability and negatively related to soil nitrogen concentrations following a multi-year invasive insect irruption
T2  - AOB PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding connections between ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling and invasive insect defoliation could facilitate the prediction of disturbance impacts across a range of spatial scales. In this study we investigated relationships between ecosystem N cycling and tree defoliation during a recent 2015-18 irruption of invasive gypsy moth caterpillars (Lymantria dispar), which can cause tree stress and sometimes mortality following multiple years of defoliation. Nitrogen is a critical nutrient that limits the growth of caterpillars and plants in temperate forests. In this study, we assessed the associations among N concentrations, soil solution N availability and defoliation intensity by L. dispar at the scale of individual trees and forest plots. We measured leaf and soil N concentrations and soil solution inorganic N availability among individual red oak trees (Quercus rubra) in Amherst, MA and across a network of forest plots in Central Massachusetts. We combined these field data with estimated defoliation severity derived from Landsat imagery to assess relationships between plot-scale defoliation and ecosystem N cycling. We found that trees in soil with lower N concentrations experienced more herbivory than trees in soil with higher N concentrations. Additionally, forest plots with lower N soil were correlated with more severe L. dispar defoliation, which matched the tree-level relationship. The amount of inorganic N in soil solution was strongly positively correlated with defoliation intensity and the number of sequential years of defoliation. These results suggested that higher ecosystem N pools might promote the resistance of oak trees to L. dispar defoliation and that defoliation severity across multiple years is associated with a linear increase in soil solution inorganic N.

TI  - A context-driven pansharpening method using superpixel based texture analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a context-driven injection scheme for pansharpening, in which the injection coefficients are computed over superpixel segments obtained by means of a modified Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (t-SLIC) technique applied on the texture descriptors of the PAN image. By using the t-SLIC algorithm, various homogeneous-connected components can be generated according to their spectral properties. The proposed pansharpening method relies on a multiresolution framework by employing the Generalized Laplacian Pyramid (GLP) tailored to the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the MS sensors for extracting the high frequency details. First, the injection gains are locally computed as regression coefficients between the upsampled MS and low-resolution PAN regions at a reduced scale. Then, they are multiplied by a global weighting factor computed per spectral band and defined as the ratio of variance between expanded MS bands and PAN image. Finally, the spatial details are modulated by means of the estimated global-local injection coefficients at superpixel level to produce the high-resolution MS image. The validation is assessed with two datasets acquired by IKONOS and WorldView-3 satellites. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a favourable performance both visually and quantitatively compared to the state of-the-art pansharpening algorithms.

TI  - Highlighting a population-based re-emergence of Syphilis infection and assessing associated risk factors among pregnant women in Cameroon: Evidence from the 2009, 2012 and 2017 national sentinel surveillance surveys of HIV and syphilis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSyphilis and HIV can be transmitted from pregnant women to their children and they remain a public health problem in Africa. Our study aimed to determine the trends of seroprevalence of HIV/syphilis co-infection and syphilis infection overtime through the national surveillance system in Cameroon and to explore associated risk factors.MethodsWe conducted cross-sectional studies of HIV and syphilis, targeting each year 7000 first antenatal care (ANC-1) attendees at the same sites during the 2009, 2012 and 2017 sentinel surveillance surveys. Pregnant women were enrolled at their ANC-1, sociodemographic and clinical information were collected. HIV and Syphilis test were performed by serial algorithm as per the national guidelines. Trends were assessed for HIV, syphilis and HIV/syphilis by estimating seroprevalence from cross-sectional studies. Associated risk factors were explored using multinomial logistic regression with 4 outcomes: HIV/syphilis co-infection, HIV infection only, syphilis infection only and no infection.ResultsOverall, 6 632, 6 521 and 6 859 pregnant women were enrolled in 2009, 2012 and 2017 respectively. In 2017, a total of 3 901 pregnant women enrolled were tested for syphilis. Almost half of them (47.9%) were living in urban area and were aged less than 25 years (44.7%). While HIV epidemic was on a decline (from 7.6% (95% CI: 6.99-8.28) in 2009 to 5.7% (95% CI: 4.93-6.4) in 2017), a huge significant increase of syphilis prevalence was observed (from 0.6% (95% CI:0.40-0.80) in 2009 to 5.7% (95% CI:4.93-6.40) in 2017). Pregnant women residing in rural areas were more likely to be infected with syphilis than those living in the urban area (aOR = 1.8 [95% CI: 1.3-2.4]). Unmarried pregnant women were three time more likely to be infected by HIV/Syphilis Co-infection than married, cohabiting, widow or divorced pregnant women (aOR = 2.8 [95% CI: 1.3-2.4]). Furthermore; living in Northern region was associated with a lower risk of being infected with HIV (aOR = 0.6 [95% CI: 0.5-0.9]) and Syphilis infection (aOR = 0.6 [95% CI: 0.4-0.9]).ConclusionThe epidemiological dynamics of syphilis suggests a growing burden of syphilis infection in the general population of Cameroon. Our findings support the fact that while emphasizing strategies to fight HIV, huge efforts should also be made for strategies to prevent and fight syphilis infection especially among HIV positive women, in rural area, and southern regions.

TI  - A new optimal image smoothing method based on generalized discrete iterated Laplacian minimization and its application in the analysis of earth's surface using satellite remote sensing imagery
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper a new method of image smoothing and its applications in the field of remote sensing are presented. This method is based on the minimization of the iterated Laplace operator of an arbitrary degree in the Cartesian coordinate system. Using the method of finite differences, a linear combination is derived, which represents the solution of the minimization problem. For the special case of the ordinary Laplace operator, the solution is explicitly represented in a 9 x 9 template. To show the potential applications in the field of remote sensing, a study is presented for Iran. In this study, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is used in 13 bands, with different geometric resolutions. Using the derived template, a comprehensive analysis is presented for each band. It is shown that various phenomena can be detected in the image, including location of different soil types. Comparison of the independent methods of Laplace template, L-0 gradient smoothing, local Laplacian smoothing, and tree filtering, with the newly proposed method shows that the new method is more efficient in determining the various phenomena that are present in the area of interest in the satellite imagery.

TI  - Water quality as a plausible basis for payment for ecosystem services, the buyer's perspective: Chania River Catchment, Kiambu County, Kenya
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River Chania as a water provisioning ecosystem service gets polluted by both point and non-point pollutants threatening this critical service. Command and control strategies aid in mitigating point source pollution, but are less effective in dealing with non-point pollution making payment for ecosystem services (PES) a better choice. The plausibility of PES was evaluated from a buyer's perspective using a questionnaire survey and water quality data coupled with satellite images from Landsat. A sample of 119 respondents were chosen and stratified sampling technique utilized. A total of 50.8% depend on river water for use, 80.2% are concerned about the current state of the river and 98.4% would be willing to participate in a conservation program such as PES. PES was concluded to be plausible from this angle. Sustainable land management practices, education on good farming practices and riparian zones protection are some of the incentives these payments can be used for.

TI  - Modeling hydrological response to land use/cover change: case study of Chirah Watershed (Soan River), Pakistan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of land use change impacts on watershed hydrologic processes is of great importance to draw the attention of water resource managers and policy makers for better planning and management of the shrinking resources for the survival of surrounding population of the region. Chirah watershed is an important hydrologic unit which generates an average of 0.53 MCM water per day. Soan River originates from here, supplying an average inflow of 0.2 MCM day(-1) to Simly Dam. Since a couple of decades, rainfall variability coupled with growing population is threatening Soan River flows. Deforestation and land use/land cover (LULC) changes have affected the natural pathways of water, decreased groundwater recharge, and triggered flash floods. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the impact of LULC changes on the hydrologic processes of the watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a hydrological model to propose management strategies. LULC change assessment was carried out on Landsat-5 TM and OLI_TIRS images through 'Supervised Classification' at four-time steps (1990, 1999, 2010, and 2016). Due to limited ground observations, corresponding Google Earth images were used in mapping. The SWAT model was evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and relative volumetric error (RVE) objective functions on monthly time steps. The NSE achieved during calibration and validation, 0.63 and 0.45, respectively, indicates acceptable levels of model performance despite outliers in the hydro-meteorological dataset. Similarly, the RVE was less than +/- 5% during both periods, indicating that the model simulated water balance reasonably well. Changes in LULC resulted in alteration of all the hydrological parameters. Conversion of scrub thorny forest (14.74%) into built-up areas (9%) resulted in higher imperviousness which triggered runoff to 24% and lowered groundwater recharge by 8% in 27 years indicating that the hydrologic regime is sensitive to LULC changes.

TI  - Assessment of Vegetation Cover of Bengaluru City, India, Using Geospatial Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bengaluru has a unique place due to its pleasant weather and green cover. Off late, the city has witnessed phenomenal urban growth, especially during last few decades. This study was envisaged to assess the decadal changes in vegetation cover of Bengaluru using multispectral IRS satellite imagery of 2006 and 2019 within Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) area. Satellite datasets were analysed to assess changes in vegetation cover during the last decade. Vegetation (tree cover) within BBMP area was estimated to be 26.1% (18,572.2 ha) in 2019 as compared to 30.1% (21,414.9 ha) in 2006, indicating an overall reduction of 4%. Overall classification accuracy was estimated to be 92.1% for 2006 and 95.9% for 2019. Based on the analysis, a vegetation change map highlighting positive change areas, negative change areas and no change areas within vegetation categories were prepared for 198 BBMP wards. A total of 730 GT sample points were also collected along with geo-tagged field photographs, which covered diverse niche areas with different vegetation components and density classes, as well as non-vegetated urban and other areas. Recommendations have been given to sustain and improve existing vegetation cover.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 induced lockdown on the changes of air quality and land surface temperature in Kolkata city, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown reduced the pollution level in the major megacities worldwide. The air pollution level of the city directly influences the air temperature and also land surface temperature (LST). In this paper, authors analyzed the impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic on the pollution level of the city and resulted LST. Single channel algorithm has been used to retrieve LST from Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite data. Pre-lockdown and post-lockdown satellite data has been used to show the changes in LST due to lockdown. The air quality index of pre-lockdown and post-lockdown period of the city estimated based on seven pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, NH3, SO2, CO and Ozone. The pollution level of the city and LST significantly decreased after lockdown is enforced. The pollution level of the major portion of the city before lockdown is moderately polluted (95-153 mu m) and after lockdown the satisfactory level of pollution level observed (33-45 mu m). The mean LST before lockdown is 28.76 degrees C (13 March, 2020) and it decreased down to 26.56 degrees C after lockdown (30 April, 2020). There is a sharp decrease of low value of LST observed (23.6-17.35 degrees C) in the city.

TI  - Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) impact on health pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic using IoT in India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERVASIVE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a deadly virus named after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; it affects the respiratory system of the human and sometimes leads to death. The COVID-19 mainly attacks the person with previous lung diseases; the major cause of lung diseases is the exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for a longer duration. NO2 is a gaseous air pollutant caused as an outcome of the vehicles, industrial smoke and other combustion processes. Exposure of NO2 for long-term leads to the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and sometimes leads to fatality. This paper aims to analyze the NO2 level impact in India during pre- and post-COVID-19 lockdown. The study also examines the relationship between the fatality rate of humans because of exposure to NO2 and COVID-19.Design/methodology/approach - Spatial analysis has been conducted in India based on the mortality rate caused by the COVID-19 using the data obtained through Internet of Medical things. Meanwhile, the mortality rate because of the exposure of NO2 has been conducted in India to analyze the relationship. Further, NO2 level assessment is carried out using Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite data. Moreover, aerosol optical depth analysis has been carried out based on NASA's Earth Observing System data.Findings - The results indicate that NO2 level has dropped 20-year low because of the COVID-19 lockdown. The results also determine that the mortality rate because of long-time exposure to NO2 is higher than COVID-19 and the mortality rate because of COVID-19 may be a circumlocutory effect owing to the inhalation of NO2.Originality/value - Using the proposed approach, the COVID-19 spread can be identified by knowing the air pollution in major cities. The research also identifies that COVID-19 may have an effect because of the inhalation of NO2, which can severe the COVID-19 in the human body.

TI  - Light-time effect detected in fourteen eclipsing binaries
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The available minima timings of 14 selected eclipsing binaries (V1297 Cas, HD 24105, KU Aur, GU CMa, GH Mon, AZ Vel, DI Lyn, DK Her, GQ Dra, V624 Her, V1134 Her, KIC 6187893, V1928 Aql, V2486 Cyg) were collected and analyzed. Using the automatic telescopes, surveys, and satellite data, we derived more than 2500 times of eclipses, accompanied with our own ground-based observations. These data were used to detect the period variations in these multiple systems. The eclipse timing variations were described using the third-body hypothesis and the light-time effect. Their respective periods were derived as 2.5, 16.2, 27, 20, 64, 5.6, 22, 115, 27, 42, 6.9, 11.2, 4.1, and 8.4 years for these systems, respectively. The predicted minimal mass of the third body was calculated for each of the systems, and we discuss here their prospective detectability. The light curves of HD 24105, GH Mon, DK Her, V1134 Her, KIC 6187893, V1928 Aql, and V2486 Cyg were analyzed using the PHOEBE program, resulting in physical parameters of the components. Significant fractions of the third light were detected during the light-curve analysis, supporting our hypothesis of the triple-star nature of all these systems. The majority of these systems (nine out of 14) were already known as visual doubles. Our study shifts them to possible quadruples, what makes them even more interesting.

TI  - When does agriculture enter into conflict with wildlife? A global assessment of parrot-agriculture conflicts and their conservation effects
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim No human activity has changed natural habitat availability and ecosystem functioning more than agriculture. As a consequence, species may be forced to use croplands as foraging habitat, resulting in potential conflicts with farmers. To assess the causes and consequences of wildlife-agriculture interactions, we investigated the underlying associations among species traits, climate and landscapes factors that determine parrot species to use croplands, and related them to their conservation status.Location Global.Methods We used parrots as a model due to their global distribution, high behavioural plasticity, high proportion of species using croplands (43%) and threatened species (26%). Within the distribution range of the 398 extant parrot species, we calculated annual averages and seasonality of ecosystem productivity, climate conditions and land-use patterns from satellite data. We then categorized species conservation status using information provided by IUCN.Results We found that habitat degradation, where biodiversity is low and primary productivity is low and intermittent, together with the plasticity of species to use different habitats, is key interrelated conditions that increase the likelihood of species to use croplands worldwide. The persecution of parrots as crop pests varied among regions, being higher for large-bodied species, those with small distributions, and in highly human-impacted areas. Moreover, persecution is contributing to the global population decline and extinction risk of parrots, especially in those species with small distribution ranges.Main conclusions Parrot-agriculture conflicts may affect both the conservation of parrot species and their key ecological functions. Our results highlight the importance of using multi-specific and multi-source information to understand and predict where and why human-wildlife conflicts may arise, as their main drivers interact and are heterogeneous at large spatial scales. Further studies should evaluate the actual extent and economic impact of crop losses caused by wild species to help solve agriculture-wildlife conflicts.

TI  - Hydrodynamic modelling and vulnerability analysis to assess flood risk in a dense Indian city using geospatial techniques
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flooding and waterlogging are causing menace in many cities around the world from the perspective of day-to-day functioning, health and hygiene, communication, and the consequent damages they cause to urban environment. The present study is an attempt to understand the urban flood risks in parts of Bhubaneswar City, India, based on its hydrodynamic set-up and level of urbanisation. The Storm Water Management Model is used for peak flow analysis, and the flooding extent has been assessed while taking into consideration the elevation, slope, land use/land cover (LULC) and design Storm Water Drain (SWD) infrastructure of the city. The micro-watersheds for each SWD are delineated using digital surface model derived from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data (1 m), and the LULC information is obtained from high-resolution optical remote sensing data. After the model simulation, it is estimated that peak runoff is relatively higher, i.e. 0.1-0.5 cumecs for a large number of micro-watersheds, even rising to more than 1.5 cumecs for some, indicating the severity of urban floods in the city. After integrating the simulated flooding pattern with the vulnerability associated with socio-economic characteristics of urban dwellers, the flood risk has been assessed. The study suggests that capacity of design SWD systems needs augmentation according to present and predicted flooding conditions for the city.

M3  - Article
AB  - The world is advancing at a great pace in space related activities. Space use has expanded, pushing more and more countries and private commercial operations towards launching different projects. Space agencies across the world are playing a progressively vital role in different activities such as environmental management, meteorology, communications, navigation, resource surveying, global positioning and disaster monitoring etc. Space science and research has tremendous potential and can be developed for solutions of problems. Remote sensing, a satellite and aircraft-based sensor technology used to spot and categorize objects on Earth, can be used in Earth Science disciplines such as geography, ecology, and land surveying etc. Based on these useful applications of remote sensing, we propose that this technology may be used for dispute resolution of the land demarcations and fragmentation issues. Many countries have already entered into all the five space treaties and are taking further steps to consolidate their respective space law and policy. It is required that the government of Pakistan together with the national space agency work on formulating an effective space legislation for e country.

TI  - Parameterizing anisotropic reflectance of snow surfaces from airborne digital camera observations in Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface reflection of solar radiation comprises an important boundary condition for solar radiative transfer simulations. In polar regions above snow surfaces, the surface reflection is particularly anisotropic due to low Sun elevations and the highly anisotropic scattering phase function of the snow crystals. The characterization of this surface reflection anisotropy is essential for satellite remote sensing over both the Arctic and Antarctica. To quantify the angular snow reflection properties, the hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF) of snow surfaces was derived from airborne measurements in Antarctica during austral summer in 2013/14. For this purpose, a digital 180 degrees fisheye camera (green channel, 490-585 nm wavelength band) was used. The HDRF was measured for different surface roughness conditions, optical-equivalent snow grain sizes, and solar zenith angles. The airborne observations covered an area of around 1000 km x 1000 km in the vicinity of Kohnen Station (75 degrees 0' S, 0 degrees 4' E) at the outer part of the East Antarctic Plateau. The observations include regions with higher (coastal areas) and lower (inner Antarctica) precipitation amounts and frequencies. The digital camera provided upward, angular-dependent radiance measurements from the lower hemisphere. The comparison of the measured HDRF derived for smooth and rough snow surfaces (sastrugi) showed significant differences, which are superimposed on the diurnal cycle. By inverting a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model, the measured HDRF of snow surfaces was parameterized as a function of solar zenith angle, surface roughness, and optical-equivalent snow grain size. This allows a direct comparison of the HDRF measurements with the BRDF derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite product MCD43. For the analyzed cases, MODIS observations (545-565 nm wavelength band) generally underestimated the anisotropy of the surface reflection. The largest deviations were found for the volumetric model weight fvol (average underestimation by a factor of 10). These deviations are likely linked to short-term changes in snow properties.

TI  - Integrated crop growth and radiometric modeling to support Sentinel synthetic aperture radar observations of agricultural fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop monitoring using synthetic aperture radar requires an understanding of how dynamic crop features influence radar response. We use crop parameters from the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) model, a dynamic crop growth model, as inputs to the Michigan microwave canopy scattering (MIMICS) model, a radiometric model, to simulate radar scattering from selected wheat, rice, and corn fields in Yolo County, California, during 2015. We compared DSSAT-MIMICS modeled backscatter to Sentinel-1A backscatter and conducted sensitivity analyses to examine crop features that influence backscatter. For each crop, DSSAT-MIMICS modeled VV (vertically transmitted and received) backscatter was correlated to Sentinel-1A sigma(0)(VV) (mean R-value = 0.76, p < 0.05), root-mean-square error <2 dB, and a model bias between -0.23 and 0.99 dB. However, there were not sufficient Sentinel-1A VH (vertically transmitted and horizontally received) backscatter observations to robustly evaluate DSSAT-MIMICS modeled VH performance. The sensitivity analyses revealed modeled backscatter was most responsive to wheat and rice stems, and corn leaves. Using the analyses, we developed a crop growth index that normalizes Sentinel-1A backscatter to modeled backscatter and mapped corn, rice, and wheat variability, identifying high and low crop growth in fields. This research contributes to the potential application of Sentinel-1A for crop monitoring. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Estimation of particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>) concentration and its variation over urban sites in Bangladesh
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth essentially provides an economical option for regular monitoring of particulate matter (PM) concentration; however, the constrains and challenges come in terms of estimation accuracy. In the present study, we estimated PM2.5 and PM10 (PM of aerodynamic diameter lesser than 2.5, 10 mu m, respectively) for 11 sites in Bangladesh using different methods. Univariate model showed destitute performance (R-2<0.1), whereas integrating MODIS-AOD with surface meteorology, multivariate models enhanced accuracy (R-2>0.6); meanwhile, radial kernel-based 'eps'-type support vector regression model outperformed rest (R-2>0.8). Furthermore, we investigated variations in ground concentration of PM2.5, PM10 during 2013-2018 and found annual mean concentration of 76.34 +/- 34.12 mu g m(-3) and 136.25 +/- 68.94 mu g m(-3), respectively. Predominant anthropogenic contribution to elevated pollution is well remarked by PM2.5/PM10 ratio, highest during January (0.65 +/- 0.06) and lowest during July (0.48 +/- 0.11). Grievous pollution found in Narayanganj (PM2.5: 100.35 +/- 56.76 mu g m(-3), PM10: 200.25 +/- 91.79 mu g m(-3)) and slightest in Sylhet (PM2.5: 56.13 +/- 26.99 mu g m(-3), PM10: 103.94 +/- 49.37 mu g m(-3)). Intra-annual pattern asserts winter as sternly befouled and least pollution during monsoon, which may indicate significant influence of meteorology on PM pollution. We found that PM divulged negative correlation with air temperature (PM2.5: -0.78, PM10: -0.73), relative humidity (PM2.5: -0.66, PM10: -0.73) and rainfall (PM2.5: -0.59, PM10: -0.61). This study showed outrageous situation of PM pollution in urban areas in Bangladesh and proposed modest pathway for regular monitoring of PM that will help to combat pollution.

TI  - Machine learning and multispectral data-based detection of soil salinity in an arid region, Central Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, indirect methods have been used to estimate soil salinity in agricultural lands. In this research, the electrical conductivity of 93 soil samples from 0 to 30 cm and 0 to 100 cm was measured using the hypercube technique at Sharifabad-Saveh Plain, Iran. Land area parameters such as TWI, TCI, STP, DEM, and LS were used as topographic variables and spatial indices of salinity and vegetation were derived from Landsat 8 images. Soil salinity off crops and gardens was determined at 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm. The data were divided into two series: the training set (70%) and the test set (30%). In order to model and predict salinity, models such as an artificial neural network (ANN), integration of neural network and genetic algorithm (ANN-GA), PLSR, and decision tree (DT) were used. The results of the models' evaluation based on MSE and R-2 indices showed that the ANN-GA model has the highest accuracy in predicting soil properties. This model improved the accuracy of soil salinity prediction by 28%, 42%, and 23% in 0-30 cm and by 20%, 28%, and 25% at 100 cm than ANN, PLSR, and DT. The result showed the 2 dS/m EC at alfalfa and cucurbits farmlands while pistachio orchards have low salinity and bare lands have moderate and high salinity.

TI  - Calibration of Satellite Imagery with Multispectral UAV Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral remote sensing has shown a tremendous potential normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for precision agriculture. In this study, data captured from a UAV equipped with a Multispectral Mica Sense Red Edge camera used as ground-truth information to calibrate Sentinel-2 imagery. UAV-based NDVI allowed crop estimation at 10-cm pixel resolution by discriminating no-green vegetation pixels. The reflectance value and NDVI of the crops at different stages were derived from both UAV and Sentinel-2 images. The UAV Multispectral mapping method used in this study provided advanced information about the physical conditions of the study area (Roorkee) and improved land feature delineation. The result shows that UAV data produced more accurate reflectance values than Sentinel-2 imagery. However, the accuracy of the vegetation index is not wholly dependent on the accuracy of the reflectance. The UAV-derived NDVI has relatively low sensitivity to the vegetation coverage and insignificantly affected by environmental factors compared to NDVI derived from Sentinel-2 image.

TI  - An empirical use of organizational habitus and ethnography to explore how sport cultures are negotiated
T2  - SPORT IN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we analyse cultural processes through an alternative and combined theoretical and methodological framework. We use the distinctive theoretical lens of organizational habitus to explore the negotiation of culture within a sports charity. Our contribution here is to provide analysis borne both out of theoretical novelty and by adopting a practical application of this in context. Ethnographic data collection drew upon several tools which upon a retrospective analysis took place. Findings suggest that the cultural and expressive elements prioritized by the collective of individuals enhance practices which are deemed important, while resisting practices that are deemed to be incompatible with a perceived worldview concerning the operations of the charity. This novel lens, considered from our emic perspective has the potential to enhance our understanding of organizational culture, leading to practical, context-appropriate findings that reveal how sometimes innocuous aspects of organizational life can influence collective action.

TI  - The door to Dor: Tracing unseen anthropogenic impact in an ancient port
T2  - GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - An on-land frequency domain electromagnetic geophysical survey was conducted across a tombolo delimiting the southern bay of Tel Dor (northern Israel) to the south. It was accompanied by a marine archaeological survey adjacent to its northern edge. Results indicate a deep channel connecting the bay and the Tantura Lagoon to the south. At its northern exit, an NW-SE trending square anomaly is visible in the geophysical data, buried underneath centuries of sand accumulation. It is parallel and similar in shape and scale to a Hellenistic feature observed in satellite data and excavated during the underwater archaeological survey. It seems that during the beginning/Middle Bronze Age, a natural or manmade channel was utilized as an entrance to the bay. As sea levels rose and sand began to accumulate, the channel was periodically filled in and would have needed to have been cleared. Eventually, it became too expensive or inconvenient to maintain, probably during the Byzantine period. The southern anchorage was abandoned for more favorable conditions to the north of the Tel. The sequence of events shows how ancient builders first utilized a natural channel, maintained it as sea levels rose, and abandoned it when it became too problematic to maintain.

T2  - ZooKeys
M3  - Article
AB  - Apodemus peninsulae, a dominant rodent species in temperature forests of northeastern China, is a model animal to explore the ecological functions of reciprocal coevolution of animals and plants. From August to October 2016, 24 infra-red cameras were installed to study the feeding behavior and activity patterns of A. peninsulae in its natural environment. By analyzing 5618 video records, we found that feeding behavior, followed by motor and sentinel behaviors, was their main activity. In the behavior spectra, motor behavior (creep, walk, and skip), feeding behavior (forage, feeding, transport, hoarding, and clean), and sentinel behavior (alert, flee, banishment, and coexistence) accounted for 57.96%, 40.36%, and 1.68% of their behavior, respectively. The peak of feeding behavior occurred between 18:00 and 23:00, and feeding behavior frequency, duration, and activity rhythms differ among August to October. Furthermore, activity was the greatest after sunset and before sunrise, indicating a nocturnal lifestyle; however, from August to October, the start time of the activity was earlier, and the end time was later than usual. On average, mice spent 21.6 [plus or minus] 11.6 times/night feeding, with a duration of 63.58 [plus or minus] 98.36 s; while they spent less time in foraging, 39.05 [plus or minus] 51.63 s. We found a significant difference in feeding and foraging frequency, with mice spending on average 10.84 [plus or minus] 9.85 times/ night and 9.23 [plus or minus] 11.17 times/night, respectively. Our results show that feeding and foraging behavior is also influenced by light intensity, suggesting a preference for crepuscular periods of the day. Infra-red cameras are very useful in detecting activity patterns of animals that are not easily observable; these cameras are able to capture a large amount of valuable information for research into ecological functions.

TI  - Mapping the risk zoning of storm flood disaster based on heterogeneous data and a machine learning algorithm in Xinjiang, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping flood risk zone is an essential task in the arid region for sustainable water resources management. Due to the lack of hydrological and meteorological information and disaster event inventory in Xinjiang, China, storm flood disaster (SFD) risk zoning is an effective technique in investigating the potential impact of SFD. In this study, the statistics about natural, social, and risk related to SFD are collated. With the help of the compiled inventory data, a disaster risk assessment model for storm flood is proposed for the Xinjiang region based on the random forest (RF) algorithm. Randomly selected negative and positive samples from the historical SFD locations are composed of five different total samples. The overall prediction accuracy of the five sample groups attained 83.48%, indicating that the proposed RF model can well capture the spatial distribution of SFD in Xinjiang. It should also be noted that the spatial heterogeneity and complexity of SFD had a significant effect on its spatial distribution in Xinjiang. There are spatial distribution characteristics of lowland plains and high plateaus; the main mountainous regions, plains in the middle-lower reaches of major rivers, and areas surrounding major lakes are prone to flooding. The variable importance RF indicates that the disaster risk is mainly affected by the following factors, including hazard factors, catastrophic intensity, population density, as well as economic development in the affected area. Besides, latitude, longitude, agricultural acreage, road density, distance from rivers, and the maximum monthly precipitation account for most of the increase in storm flooding disasters, and they are the main triggering point for SFD in Xinjiang. The proposed model provides some insight into the disaster in the mountainous region, and gives useful guidance for the national macro-control of flood prevention and disaster reduction.

TI  - Histopathologic Validation of the Sentinel Node Technique for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy may be an alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy in early cervical cancer. The SLN biopsy is less morbid and has been shown to have high sensitivity for metastasis detection. However, the sensitivity of the SLN technique might be overevaluated because SLNs are examined with ultra-staging, and non-sentinel nodes usually are examined only with routine techniques. This study aimed to validate the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SLN technique by the ultra-staging of SLNs and non-sentinel nodes (NSLNs).Methods. The SENTICOL 1 study data published in 2011 were used. All nodes (i.e., SLNs and NSLNs) were secondarily subjected to ultra-staging. The ultra-staging consisted of sectioning every 200 mu m, in addition to immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the positive slides and 10% of the negative slides were reviewed.Results. The study enrolled 139 patients, and SLNs were detected in 136 (97.8%) of these patiets. Bilateral SLNs were detected in 104 (76.5%) of the 136 patients. A total of 2056 NSLNs were identified (median, 13 NSLNs per patient; range 1-54). Of the 136 patients with SLNs, 23 were shown to have positive SLNs after serial sectioning and immunohistochemical staining. The NSLNs were metastatic in six patients. In the case of bilateral SLN detection, the NPV was 100%, with no false-negatives (FNs).Conclusions. The pelvic SLN technique is safe and trustworthy for determining the nodal status of patients with early-stage cervical cancer. In the case of optimal mapping with bilateral detection, the NPV was found to be 100%.

AB  - Geological evaluation and groundwater assessment, especially in arid areas, are considerable targets for constructing recent and sustainable development communities. The current work aims to apply an integrated approach to acquire geologic structures and groundwater potentiality at highly deformed area. As a case study, remote sensing (RS), aeromagnetic, and geoelectrical data are conducted to delineate the subsurface structures and hydrogeological regime at Aswan City. Initially, remote sensing data with GIS software are utilized to delineate the surface structures and watershed configuration. Moreover, the reduced to magnetic pole (RTP) aeromagnetic data is processed and interpreted using appropriate filters. In an attempt to demonstrate the subsurface structures and basement relief maps, the RTP map was analyzed considering the RS data which was stated in previous stage. In the light of RTP aeromagnetic results and well logging data, the direct current resistivity (DCR) sounding is executed particularly along paleochannel and flood plain portion. Due to the inversion process problem of DCR field data, advanced solutions and algorithms are applied to improve the property of the results. Based upon overall results mentioned above, the correlation between subsurface structures and aquifer formation can be monitored. The present approach can be applied for groundwater exploration in this and other similar geological and hydrogeological environments around the world.

T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the preliminary observations about the recession and resultant lake formation of the Kokthang glacier in Sikkim, India. We have analyzed time-series satellite imagery from Corona and Landsat satellites over a span of 55 years to delineate the uncharacteristic recession and its control on the proglacial lake formation. It is seen that the eastern tributary of the glacier has melted and receded at similar to 37 m/yr between 1989 and 2000, which is twice as fast as its western counterpart (similar to 18 m/yr). The water spread of the proglacial lake has increased from similar to 11.8 ha to similar to 38.5 ha between 1962 and 2017 with commensurate volume change. The underlying topographic slope possibly controls the differential recession of the tributaries, wherein the eastern slope is significantly steeper (similar to 44 degrees) than the western slope (similar to 20 degrees). The variation of the slope may have resulted in the differential thickness of ice accumulation (estimated by empirical slope thickness relationship). The eastern tributary is estimated to be less thick than its western counterpart and thus has receded faster.

TI  - Forest Degradation Assessment Using UAV Optical Photogrammetry and SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sequestration of carbon in the forest is very high after soil and ocean; this is one of the major factors which makes monitoring of forests very much essential. The traditional inventory techniques were very much exhaustive and needed encroachment into the inaccessible forest area, which create lot of difficulties to foresters and other researchers, that is why, most of the areas of intense forests are untouched for monitoring purposes. The degradation of the forest area is highly prominent in the hilly terrain; activities such as lopping and forest fire are very common in these areas. In this research, UAV optical photogrammetric technique is used for the extraction of canopy metrics as well as for the generation of DSM and DTM, which is further used for the validation of the results obtained with the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1A data. The Sentinel-1A of C-band data is used for the generation of backscatter image, texture images. Sentinel-2 is used for the calculation of various vegetation-based indices for the evaluation of the proficiency of the degradation in the forest area. On the basis of various vegetation indices and texture images calculated, the degradation of the forest can be quantified. The random forest classifier is used for the classification of the forest into degraded and non-degraded classes. The classification accuracy obtained for three classes, i.e. degraded, non-degraded, non-forest is 0.86 and precision is 0.75. The correlation is 0.72 for the classes, whereas error rate is found to be 0.13. Hence, the integration of UAV optical photogrammetry and SAR data can give much appreciated results; also, this technique is very much helpful in monitoring and management of inaccessible forest areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - A cross-sectional survey to investigate relationships between coronavirus anxiety, individual death attitudes, and personal worldview was conducted among 202 German-speaking adults in Central Europe. Results indicated that death anxiety significantly predicts coronavirus anxiety beyond sociodemographic variables. Women reported higher coronavirus anxiety than men. Against expectations, dimensions of personal worldview were hardly related to coronavirus anxiety. In contrast, we found evidence for a curvilinear relationship between religiosity as well as atheism and negative death attitudes. Our study contributes to recent discussions about death anxiety as a transdiagnostic factor in psychopathology and yields important implications for psychosocial support in the current pandemic.

TI  - Mapping groundwater abstractions from irrigated agriculture: big data, inverse modeling, and a satellite-model fusion approach
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia has witnessed rapid growth in both production and area under cultivation over the last few decades. This has prompted some concern over the state and future availability of fossil groundwater resources, which have been used to drive this expansion. Large-scale studies using satellite gravimetric data show a declining trend over this region. However, water management agencies require much more detailed information on both the spatial distribution of agricultural fields and their varying levels of water exploitation through time than coarse gravimetric data can provide. Relying on self-reporting from farm operators or sporadic data collection campaigns to obtain needed information are not feasible options, nor do they allow for retrospective assessments. In this work, a water accounting framework that combines satellite data, meteorological output from weather prediction models, and a modified land surface hydrology model was developed to provide information on both irrigated crop water use and groundwater abstraction rates. Results from the local scale, comprising several thousand individual center-pivot fields, were then used to quantify the regional-scale response. To do this, a semi-automated approach for the delineation of center-pivot fields using a multi-temporal statistical analysis of Landsat 8 data was developed. Next, actual crop evaporation rates were estimated using a two-source energy balance (TSEB) model driven by leaf area index, land surface temperature, and albedo, all of which were derived from Landsat 8. The Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CA-BLE) model was then adapted to use satellite-based vegetation and related surface variables and forced with a 3 km reanalysis dataset from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Groundwater abstraction rates were then inferred by estimating the irrigation supplied to each individual center pivot, which was determined via an optimization approach that considered CABLE-based estimates of evaporation and TSEB-based satellite estimates. The framework was applied over two study regions in Saudi Arabia: a small-scale experimental facility of around 40 center pivots in Al Kharj that was used for an initial evaluation and a much larger agricultural region in Al Jawf province comprising more than 5000 individual fields across an area exceeding 2500 km(2). Total groundwater abstraction for the year 2015 in Al Jawf was estimated at approximately 5.5 billion cubic meters, far exceeding any recharge to the groundwater system and further highlighting the need for a comprehensive water management strategy. Overall, this novel data-model fusion approach facilitates the compilation of national-scale groundwater abstractions while also detailing field-scale information that allows both farmers and water management agencies to make informed water accounting decisions across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Post-event surface deformation of Amyntaio slide (Greece) by complementary analysis of Remotely Piloted Airborne System imagery and SAR interferometry
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of structure from motion photogrammetry and SAR interferometry as complementary techniques for measuring ground deformation induced by the massive open-pit landslide in Amyntaio, Greece (June 10, 2017), is presented in this paper. This unexpected slide damaged the entire westernmost marginal area of the pit, significant number of buildings, and infrastructures of the nearby village of Anargiri. The described methodology includes the generation of a multi-temporal dataset (from Sept. 2017 to Sept. 2018) of very high-resolution surface topography (at 10 cm), based on the analysis of imagery collected by Remotely Piloted Airborne Systems (RPASs). Satellite observations involved interferometric processing of TerraSAR-X data for a complementary estimation of ground displacement rates. Height differences from consecutive aerial photography campaigns as well as space-borne measurements provided valuable information on the evolution of the deformation and its spatial characteristics during the post-event period, an important aspect for future hazard and risk considerations.

TI  - Absolute radiometric calibration of Fengyun-3D Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II and radiation characteristics analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the response changes of the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-II), which is an optical instrument on the Fengyun-3D satellite, during different periods since liftoff. The study was based on the Dunhuang radiometric calibration site. The solar reflective channels, assessed using the reflectance-based method, showed a degradation of MERSI-II. The degradation rate of change was found to be higher in the beginning of the mission and to be decreasing with time. The latest calibration results show that the decrease in instrument response between 440 and 900 nm in the near-infrared band was relatively small compared to the previous official calibration coefficient, with an average attenuation rate of similar to 5.3%. It was observed that the MERSI-II shortwave channel had a large attenuation of 21%, especially in the 412 nm band. The calibration method and parameter processing of the reflectance-based method are introduced in detail. The accuracy of the calibration process was tested using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, an internationally recognized high-precision satellite instrument, which determined the calibration error to be <4%. The experimental results contribute to the improvement in the accuracy of satellite observation and the design of subsequent equipment.

TI  - Branching Algorithm to Identify Bottom Habitat in the Optically Complex Coastal Waters of Atlantic Canada Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellite imagery has been successfully used to map submerged seagrasses in clear waters, and surface-canopy forming seaweed habitats in a range of water types. We examined the ability to use Sentinel-2 remote sensing reflectance to classify fully submerged seagrass and seaweed habitats in optically complex, temperate waters within a high priority management region in Atlantic Canada. To do so, we determined the "best" Sentinel-2 image available between 2015 and 2019 based on tidal height, absence of sun glint and clouds, and water transparency. Using the full Sentinel-2 tile, we atmospherically corrected the image using ACOLITE's dark spectrum fitting method. Our classification goal was a two-class prediction of vegetation presence and absence. Using information obtained from drop-camera surveys, the image was first partially classified using simple band thresholds based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), red/green ratio and the blue band. A random forest model was built to classify the remaining areas to a maximum depth of 10 m, the maximum depth at which field surveys were performed. The resulting habitat map had an overall accuracy of 79% and similar to 231 km(2) of vegetated habitat were predicted to occur (total area 345.15 km(2)). As expected, the classification performed best in regions dominated by bright sandy bare substrate, and dense dark vegetated beds. The classification performed less well in regions dominated by dark bare muddy substrate, whose spectra were similar to vegetated habitat, in pixels where vegetation density was low and mixed with other substrates, and in regions impacted by freshwater input. The maximum depth that bottom habitat was detectable also varied across the image. Leveraging the full capacity of the freely available Sentinel-2 satellite series with its high spatial resolution and resampling frequency, provides a new opportunity to generate large scale vegetation habitat maps, and examine how vegetation extent changes over time in Atlantic Canada, providing essential data layers to inform monitoring and management of macrophyte dominated habitats and the resulting ecosystem functions and services.

TI  - Use of remote sensing to track postindustrial vegetation development
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of natural processes on deposited mineral material of postindustrial sites is underestimated. Natural vegetation development on mineral material substratum is an unappreciated way of site management. Due to the classification-based approach to assembly of plant community diversity, remote sensing methods have limited application. We aimed to assess whether remotely sensed data allow for building predictive models, able to recognise vegetation variability along the main gradients of species composition. We assessed vegetation in 321 study plots on four coal-mine spoil heaps in Silesia (S Poland). We determined the main gradients of species composition using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and we identified how DCA scores describe vegetation variability. DCA axes explained 38.5%, 35.4%, 31.4%, and 20.1% of species composition variability. We built machine learning models of DCA scores using multispectral satellite images and airborne laser scanning data as predictors. We obtained good predictive power of models for the first two DCA axes (R-2 = 0.393 and 0.443, root mean square errors, RMSE = 0.571 and 0.526) and low power for the third and fourth DCA axes (R-2 = 0.216 and 0.064, RMSE = 0.513 and 0.361). These scores allowed us to prepare a vegetation map based on DCA scores, and distinguish meadow-like from forest-edge-like vegetation, and to identify thermophilous and highly productive vegetation patches. Our approach allowed us to account for species composition gradients, which improved remote sensing-based vegetation surveys. This method may be used for planning future management.

TI  - Melanoma Diagnosis and Treatment in the Elderly
T2  - CURRENT GERIATRICS REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review While the overall incidence of melanoma has remained stable in younger populations, the rate of diagnosis in the elderly is rising. Diagnosis and treatment of melanoma presents a major public health challenge for providers, patients, and caretakers. In this paper, we address unique considerations for diagnosis and management of melanoma in the elderly population. Recent Findings There are clinically significant differences in the presentation of melanoma in the elderly. Diagnosis is often delayed, thus screening is crucial and should focus on the atypical presentation of melanoma in this population. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may provide useful prognostic information, although nodal involvement is less likely in the elderly due to age-related changes in lymphatic flow. Several clinical trials have supported the efficacy and better side effect profile of targeted melanoma therapies compared with chemotherapy. Additionally, topical and local treatment, including imiquimod and talimogene laherparepvec, are useful for older patients who cannot tolerate systemic therapy or surgical excision. With a limited number of clinical trials in the elderly, and a steady increase in the incidence of disease, there is a need for development of better diagnostic and management strategies for older patients with melanoma. Elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, and trial outcomes from younger patients may not be directly applicable to an older population. This population requires personalized care and consideration of toxic adverse effects on quality of life.

TI  - Experimental evidence for stabilizing selection on virulence in a bacterial pathogen
T2  - EVOLUTION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The virulence-transmission trade-off hypothesis has provided a dominant theoretical basis for predicting pathogen virulence evolution, but empirical tests are rare, particularly at pathogen emergence. The central prediction of this hypothesis is that pathogen fitness is maximized at intermediate virulence due to a trade-off between infection duration and transmission rate. However, obtaining sufficient numbers of pathogen isolates of contrasting virulence to test the shape of relationships between key pathogen traits, and doing so without the confounds of evolved host protective immunity (as expected at emergence), is challenging. Here, we inoculated 55 isolates of the bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, into non-resistant house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) from populations that have never been exposed to the disease. Isolates were collected over a 20-year period from outbreak in disease-exposed populations of house finches and vary markedly in virulence. We found a positive linear relationship between pathogen virulence and transmission rate to an uninfected sentinel, supporting the core assumption of the trade-off hypothesis. Further, in support of the key prediction, there was no evidence for directional selection on a quantitative proxy of pathogen virulence and, instead, isolates of intermediate virulence were fittest. Surprisingly, however, the positive relationship between virulence and transmission rate was not underpinned by variation in pathogen load or replication rate as is commonly assumed. Our results indicate that selection favors pathogens of intermediate virulence at disease emergence in a novel host species, even when virulence and transmission are not linked to pathogen load.

TI  - When Payment for Ecosystem Services Meets Culture: A Culture Theory Perspective
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholarship on payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs have often overlooked the role of culture to explain important variations in local PES governance. This paper is a first stab at introducing Cultural Theory to analyze how different cultural worldviews for natural resource management (NRM) influence PROSAPIX, a local PES program, in Mexico. We show that the government's hierarchical worldview coexists with local historically-forged egalitarian worldviews. SENDAS, the PES intermediary NGO, advocates for a PES governance that empowers ejidos (communally-owned lands) for bottom-up decision making and depart from the government's hierarchist culture. SENDAS also tries to balance conflicting worldviews about the commons and nature that arise between ejidos and PES neoliberal culture. We argue that variations in PES governance are never simply the effect of individual values and behavior but are closely linked to how social groups culturally understand natural resource management and the clash and cooperation that emerge among them.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy vs Lymphadenectomy for Intermediate- and High-Grade Endometrial Cancer Staging
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Question What is the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) compared with lymphadenectomy in women with intermediate- and high-grade endometrial cancer? Findings In this cohort study of 156 patients with endometrial cancer (126 with high-grade histologic subtypes), SLNB had a sensitivity of 96% and a negative predictive value of 99% for the detection of nodal metastasis. A total of 26% of patients with node-positive cancer were identified outside lymphadenectomy boundaries or required immunohistochemistry for diagnosis. Meaning In this study, SLNB had similar diagnostic accuracy and prognostic ability as lymphadenectomy in patients with high-grade endometrial cancer at greatest risk for nodal metastasis.This cohort study examines the diagnostic accuracy, performance characteristics, and morbidity associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with intermediate- and high-grade endometrial cancer.Importance Whether sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can replace lymphadenectomy for surgical staging in patients with high-grade endometrial cancer (EC) is unclear. Objective To examine the diagnostic accuracy of, performance characteristics of, and morbidity associated with SLNB using indocyanine green in patients with intermediate- and high-grade EC. Design, Setting, and Participants In this prospective, multicenter cohort study (Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy vs Lymphadenectomy for Intermediate- and High-Grade Endometrial Cancer Staging [SENTOR] study), accrual occurred from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2019, with early stoppage because of prespecified accuracy criteria. The study included patients with clinical stage I grade 2 endometrioid or high-grade EC scheduled to undergo laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy with an intent to complete staging at 3 designated cancer centers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Exposures All patients underwent SLNB followed by lymphadenectomy as the reference standard. Patients with grade 2 endometrioid EC underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) alone, and patients with high-grade EC underwent PLND and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PALND). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was sensitivity of the SLNB algorithm. Secondary outcomes were additional measures of diagnostic accuracy, sentinel lymph node detection rates, and adverse events. Results The study enrolled 156 patients (median age, 65.5 years; range, 40-86 years; median body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 27.5; range, 17.6-49.3), including 126 with high-grade EC. All patients underwent SLNB and PLND, and 101 patients (80%) with high-grade EC also underwent PALND. Sentinel lymph node detection rates were 97.4% per patient (95% CI, 93.6%-99.3%), 87.5% per hemipelvis (95% CI, 83.3%-91.0%), and 77.6% bilaterally (95% CI, 70.2%-83.8%). Of 27 patients (17%) with nodal metastases, 26 patients were correctly identified by the SLNB algorithm, yielding a sensitivity of 96% (95% CI, 81%-100%), a false-negative rate of 4% (95% CI, 0%-19%), and a negative predictive value of 99% (95% CI, 96%-100%). Only 1 patient (0.6%) was misclassified by the SLNB algorithm. Seven of 27 patients with node-positive cancer (26%) were identified outside traditional PLND boundaries or required immunohistochemistry for diagnosis. Conclusions and Relevance In this prospective cohort study, SLNB had acceptable diagnostic accuracy for patients with high-grade EC at increased risk of nodal metastases and improved the detection of node-positive cases compared with lymphadenectomy. The findings suggest that SLNB is a viable option for the surgical staging of EC.

TI  - GrSMBMIP: intercomparison of the modelled 1980-2012 surface mass balance over the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations and models agree that the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface mass balance (SMB) has decreased since the end of the 1990s due to an increase in meltwater runoff and that this trend will accelerate in the future. However, large uncertainties remain, partly due to different approaches for modelling the GrIS SMB, which have to weigh physical complexity or low computing time, different spatial and temporal resolutions, different forcing fields, and different ice sheet topographies and extents, which collectively make an inter-comparison difficult. Our GrIS SMB model intercomparison project (GrSMBMIP) aims to refine these uncertainties by intercomparing 13 models of four types which were forced with the same ERA-Interim reanalysis forcing fields, except for two global models. We interpolate all modelled SMB fields onto a common ice sheet mask at 1 km horizontal resolution for the period 1980-2012 and score the outputs against (1) SMB estimates from a combination of gravimetric remote sensing data from GRACE and measured ice discharge; (2) ice cores, snow pits and in situ SMB observations; and (3) remotely sensed bare ice extent from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Spatially, the largest spread among models can be found around the margins of the ice sheet, highlighting model deficiencies in an accurate representation of the GrIS ablation zone extent and processes related to surface melt and runoff. Overall, polar regional climate models (RCMs) perform the best compared to observations, in particular for simulating precipitation patterns. However, other simpler and faster models have biases of the same order as RCMs compared with observations and therefore remain useful tools for long-term simulations or coupling with ice sheet models. Finally, it is interesting to note that the ensemble mean of the 13 models produces the best estimate of the present-day SMB relative to observations, suggesting that biases are not systematic among models and that this ensemble estimate can be used as a reference for current climate when carrying out future model developments. However, a higher density of in situ SMB observations is required, especially in the south-east accumulation zone, where the model spread can reach 2 m w.e. yr(-1) due to large discrepancies in modelled snowfall accumulation.

AB  - Purpose Using real-world data to support regulatory decision has become a global movement. However, a robust platform for active surveillance of medical product safety has not been established in Taiwan.Methods Following the common data model structure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System, we built the Taiwan Sentinel Data Model (TSDM) using the National Health Insurance Research Database with longitudinal claims data from 23 million individuals, linked death and cause of death data from a national registry, and linked electronic health record data from a delivery system. We examined the conversion of the TSDM using the Sentinel Data Quality Review and Characterization Programs in a sample of sex- and age-stratified cohort of 3 million individuals.Results The TSDM fulfilled the requirements of data quality assurance. Only about 6% of sex and 0.0007% of birth year were missing, and <0.001% of date data had illogical values.Conclusions The TSDM-converted database could be a valuable data resource for domestic pharmacovigilance analysis in Taiwan and cross-country evaluation.

TI  - Inflammatory breast cancer associated with amyopathic dermatomyositis: a case report
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Dermatomyositis is associated with malignant tumors including breast cancer, and inflammatory breast cancer is considered to have a poorer prognosis than most breast cancers. Case presentation A 74-year-old Asian woman, developed erythema on her face, back, and the back of her hands, 3 weeks before attending our department. At the same time, she had noticed a right breast mass and redness of the skin of the breast. The clinical findings and vacuum aspiration biopsy diagnosed inflammatory breast cancer and neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed. The mass and enlarged axillary lymph nodes had shrunk, therefore a total mastectomy was performed. The sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative. She was discharged 7 days after surgery without any complications. She has received a postoperative aromatase inhibitor and is alive without recurrence. The dermatomyositis also began to improve with the start of her chemotherapy and has not recurred since the surgery. Conclusions Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed for inflammatory breast cancer with dermatomyositis, and tumor shrinkage was confirmed. A total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection was performed. Dermatomyositis and breast cancer have not recurred. Dermatomyositis may have been a paraneoplastic syndrome due to breast cancer.

TI  - Generating high spatial and temporal soil moisture data by disaggregation of SMAP product and its assessment in different land covers
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is an important parameter for many applications. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission provides an SSM map at global scale. But its spatial resolution (36 km) is a big restriction for agricultural and hydrological studies at the catchment scale. Therefore, the present study was conducted to disaggregate the passive SMAP soil moisture data using the retrieved Soil Evaporative Efficiency (SEE) at 1-km spatial and daily temporal resolution from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and to assess the effectiveness of the method for generating data for different land covers. For this purpose, SMAP data were disaggregated using the SEE retrieved from daily MODIS data located at the southwest part of the United States. The accuracy of spatial and temporal variability of the disaggregated SMAP data was evaluated against the recorded in-situ soil moisture data in 202 stations of the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) for a period of 1 year. Results indicate that the disaggregated SMAP data have a moderate correlation with in-situ soil moisture data, but it is strongly affected by land cover. The highest accuracy was observed in the pasture/hay land cover class with Correlation Coefficient (R) value of 0.683 and 0.632, Mean Difference (MD) of -0.004 and -0.001, Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.049 and 0.056, and unbiased Root-Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) of 0.039 and 0.045 for the disaggregated and original SSM data with the unit of (m(3), m(-3)), respectively. The lowest accuracy was found in the barren land (rock/sand/clay) for the disaggregated and original SSM data with R of 0.0278 and 0.155, MD of -0:081 and -0.052, RMSE of 0.134 and 0.116, and ubRMSE of 0.106 and 0.103, respectively. Results indicate that in overall disaggregation of SMAP data using Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) algorithm and MODIS products has a good potential for generating high spatial and temporal resolution of SSM at the catchment scale. But it is strongly affected by the land cover class type, because the calculation of the SEE is based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Therefore, it can be recommended to retrieve the SEE with the attention to land cover class type and employ the other vegetation indices or methods.

TI  - Reconstructed Aeolian Surface Erosion in Southern Mongolia by Multi-Temporal InSAR Phase Coherence Analyses
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia has been identified as the strongest dust storm hot spot threatening public health and socio-economic activities in East Asian countries. Despite its significance, the complete mapping of the aeolian surface erosion in southern Mongolia remains unresolved because of extensive region of interest cannot be interpreted easily by conventional approaches. Therefore, in this study, we built a mapping scheme to define on going aeolian erosion and applied it over the southern Gobi Desert. The remote sensing approach applied here was based on an interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) time series technique. A number of Sentinel-1 InSAR pairs that generate phase coherences for a certain period were synthesized via the means of principle component analysis to extract the topographic persistence indicative of surface erosion rates. Validation analyses performed through inter-comparisons of phase coherence signals over landmark areas and residuals between global digital elevation models confirmed the reliability of outputs. The results revealed geological lineaments in southern Mongolia confining sandy deposits and the sediment transportation pathways. Apparently, such bounded eolian deposits and transportation mechanisms within geological structures have significantly contributed to dust generation in the Gobi Desert over southern Mongolia. In addition, this study demonstrated that the newly developed InSAR time series technique has great potential for identifying intensified land erosion and dust sources.

TI  - Evaluation of camera-based freehand SPECT in preoperative sentinel lymph node mapping for melanoma patients
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Assessment of lymphatic status via sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an integral and crucial part of melanoma surgical oncology. The most common technique for sentinel node mapping is preoperative planar scintigraphy of an injected gamma-emitting lymphatic tracer followed by intraoperative node localization using a non-imaging gamma probe with auditory feedback. In recent years, intraoperative visualization of SLNs in 3D has become possible by coupling the probe to an external system capable of tracking its location and orientation as it is read out, thereby enabling computation of the 3D distribution of the tracer (freehand SPECT). In this project, the non-imaging probe of the fhSPECT system was replaced by a unique handheld gamma camera containing an array of sodium iodide crystals optically coupled to an array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). A feasibility study was performed in which preoperative SLN mapping was performed using camera fhSPECT and the number of detected nodes was compared to that visualized by lymphoscintigraphy, probe fhSPECT, and to the number ultimately excised under non-imaging probe guidance. Results Among five subjects, SLNs were detected in nine lymphatic basins, with one to five SLNs detected per basin. A basin-by-basin comparison showed that the number of SLNs detected using camera fhSPECT exceeded that using lymphoscintigraphy and probe fhSPECT in seven of nine basins and five of five basins, respectively. (Probe fhSPECT scans were not performed for four basins.) It exceeded the number excised under non-imaging probe guidance for seven of nine basins and equaled the number excised for the other two basins. Conclusions Freehand SPECT using a prototype SiPM-based gamma camera demonstrates high sensitivity for detection of SLNs in a preoperative setting. Camera fhSPECT is a potential means for efficiently obtaining real-time 3D activity distribution maps in applications such as image-guided percutaneous biopsy, and surgical SLN biopsy or radioguided tumor excision.

TI  - COVID-19 testing acceptability and uptake amongst the Rohingya and host community in Camp 21, Teknaf, Bangladesh
T2  - CONFLICT AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Facility-based sentinel testing for COVID-19 was implemented in May 2020 to monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 amongst the Rohingya and host community in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. In response both to low uptake of testing across all camps, and rumours of an outbreak of an influenza-like illness in May/June 2020, the International Organization for Migration (in partnership with ACAPS) undertook a qualitative study to collect accounts from the Rohingya relating to testing and treatment, and to explore the possibility that what was thought to be an outbreak of influenza may have been COVID-19. The report provided rich descriptions of the apprehension around testing and offered some clear recommendations for addressing these. We developed a testing 'script' in response to these recommendations, deploying it alongside a survey to determine reasons for declining a test. We compared testing uptake before deploying the testing script, and after (controlling for the total number of consultations), to generate a crude measure of the impact of the script on testing uptake. We coded reasons for declining a test thematically, disaggregated by status (Rohingya and host community) and sex. Despite the small sample size our results suggest an increase in testing uptake following the implementation of the script. Reasons provided by patients for declining a test included: 1) fear, 2) the belief that COVID-19 does not exist, that Allah will prevent them from contracting it, or that their symptoms are not caused by COVID-19, 3) no permission from husband/family, and 4) a preference to return at a later time for a test. Our findings largely mirror the qualitative accounts in the International Organization for Migration/ACAPS report and suggest that further testing amongst both populations will be complicated by fear, and a lack of clarity around testing. Our data lend force to the recommendations in the International Organization for Migration/ACAPS report and emphasise that contextual factors play a key role and must be considered in designing and implementing a health response to a novel disease.

TI  - Assessing the accuracy of conventional gadolinium-enhanced breast MRI in measuring the nodal response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of the axilla in the era of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is evolving. The aim of this study is to determine if conventional gadolinium-enhanced breast MRI can aid in evaluation of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the axilla. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer was performed. Pre and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy MRI reports for node-positive patients were examined in conjunction with demographic data, treatment type, and final histopathology reports. One-hundred and fourteen patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included in the study. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting nodal response post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 33.93% and the specificity was 82.76%. Magnetic resonance imaging had a positive predictive value of 65.52% and a negative predictive value of 56.47%. MRI was found to be most specific in the detection of triple-negative cancer response. Specificity was 100% in this group and sensitivity was 75%. Magnetic resonance imaging has a relatively high specificity in detecting nodal response post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy but has a low sensitivity. Alone it cannot be relied upon to identify active axillary malignancy post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, given its increased specificity among certain subgroups, it may have a role in super-selecting patients suitable for sentinel lymph node biopsy post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Risk factors for lymph node metastasis in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: a long-term retrospective study of Japanese patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is one of the most common skin cancers. Prognosis is favorable following surgical resection of early-stage disease, but the management of the metastatic disease is challenging. Several prognostic risk factors have been described in the American Joint Committee on Cancer/the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 8th edition staging and the Brigham and Women's Hospital T classification system. However, their clinical validity in Asian populations is unclear because of racial differences in the clinical characteristics of CSCC. This study aimed to identify factors that could predict lymph node metastasis in Asian patients. Methods This retrospective single-center study evaluated 540 patients with primary CSCC between 1989 and 2013. Five factors were evaluated for their ability to predict lymph node metastasis: maximum tumor diameter, tumor thickness, depth of invasion, degree of differentiation, and infiltrative growth pattern (INF). Results Tumor diameter > 2 cm (p < 0.0001), tumor thickness > 6 mm (p < 0.0001), invasion beyond the subcutaneous fat (p < 0.0001), poor differentiation (p = 0.042), and INFc infiltration (p < 0.0001) were associated with lymph node metastasis in the univariate analyses. In the multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis was independently associated with tumor size > 2 cm [hazard ratio (HR) 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-6.2; p = 0.006], tumor thickness > 6.0 mm (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.4; p = 0.007), and invasion beyond the subcutaneous fat (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.1; p = 0.045). Conclusion Larger tumor diameter, greater tumor thickness, and deeper invasion included in the UICC T classification system are associated with increased risks of lymph node metastasis from CSCC in Japanese patients.

TI  - Modeling and Assessment of Land Degradation Vulnerability in Semi-arid Ecosystem of Southern India Using Temporal Satellite Data, AHP and GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, land degradation becomes a serious environmental issue in the context of anthropogenic pressure and climate change in the twenty-first century. Modeling and assessment of land degradation vulnerability assume a greater importance especially in the semi-arid ecosystems for sustainable land resource management. Consistent and reliable earth observation satellite datasets, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Geographic Information System (GIS) are the powerful tools to model and assess the land degradation vulnerability. The present study was aimed to model and assess the land degradation vulnerability through analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), rainfall, terrain characteristics, and pedological parameters by using AHP and GIS in the semi-arid ecosystem of Rayalaseema region of southern India. The NDVI and LST products derived from time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets, rainfall products from Tropical Precipitation Measuring Mission (TRMM), terrain characteristics from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (30 m), and pedological parameters derived from legacy soil datasets were used in the study. The AHP- and GIS-based modeling shows that about 25.3 and 9.9% of the study area were under high and very high vulnerability to land degradation, respectively. Inadequate rainfall and vegetative cover, high temperature, problematic soils, and lack of adequate conservation measures were found to be the main causative environmental factors for land degradation in the study area. The study clearly demonstrates the potential of AHP- and GIS-based modeling in the assessment of land degradation vulnerability by using the time-series MODIS NDVI- and TRMM-based rainfall products, terrain characteristics, and pedological parameters.

TI  - Climate warming benefits alpine vegetation growth in Three-River Headwater Region, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental factors that drive vegetation change in the Three River Headwater Region (TRHR) on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are largely unknown. In particular, the response of alpine grasslands in the TRHR to changing climate and ecological compensations is still poorly understood. Here, we present data on vegetation trends of the TRHR from 1982 to 2015 by employing multiple high-resolution satellite data to determine the mean annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, spatio-temporal changes in climate were monitored by long-term climate data collection and by using the distributed modeling system. It emerged that: 1) there was a weak increasing trend, albeit not significant, in overall TRHR NDVI, ranging between 0.23 and 0.27; whereas, grassland NDVI ranged between 0.43 and 0.50, and displayed a significant (r(adj)(2) = 0.46; P - 0.004) linear increase with year; 2) annual average temperature was below 0 degrees C and increased linearly (r(adj)(2) = 0.60; P - 0.01) at a rate of 0.06 degrees Clyr from 2000 to 2015, which was almost four times faster than the rate of global warming; and 3) average rainfall was 493 mm/yr, with no significant yearly trend. In conclusion, climate warming enhanced vegetation growth and recovery in the TRHR since 2000; whereas, rainfall did not show a trend. However, vegetation changes on the spatial scale demonstrated zoning and segmentation effects. Consequently, for restoration of degraded lands in the TRHR, effective one-to-one ecological conservation projects, which are particular to an eco-fragile area, should be implemented. In addition, these results are important for regional planning of livestock stocking rates and animal husbandry systems, which can have great impact on the livelihood of the people in the area.

TI  - Mechanisms of change in drinking following an alcohol-related injury: A qualitative examination of the sentinel event effect
T2  - SUBSTANCE ABUSE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel events are negative health-related events that trigger change in risky health behaviors. Despite its presumed major role in behavior change, the sentinel event effect has received little empirical attention. Through analysis of qualitative interviews, we explored how sentinel events trigger behavior change. Methods: Thematic analysis and concept mapping were used to develop a preliminary model of the sentinel event effect among a sample of 24 adult heavy drinking Mexican-origin men previously admitted to a hospital due to injury. The model was checked against cases that did versus did not report change in alcohol use following an alcohol-related negative event. Results: Findings suggest that sentinel events may arouse negative emotional reactions, encourage reflection on the negative consequences of drinking, and cause reevaluation of the severity and significance of drinking. These processes may increase motivation to change. Conclusions: Findings support the concept of the sentinel event as a natural intervention, and identifies potential social-cognitive and motivational mechanisms through which it influences change. Findings stand to inform research on mechanisms underlying brief intervention effects, and research that seeks to identify treatment targets.

TI  - Soil thawing regulates the spring growth onset in tundra and alpine biomes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil temperature remains isothermal at 0 degrees C and water shifts to a liquid phase during soil thawing. Vegetation may receive this process as a signal and a key to restore physiological activity. We aimed to show the relationship between the timing of soil thawing and the spring growth onset. We estimated the delay between the soil thawing and the spring growth onset in 78 sites of the FLUXNET network. We built a soil thawing map derived from modeling for the northern hemisphere and related it to the greenness onset estimated with satellite imagery. Spring onset estimated with GPP time series occurred shortly after soil surface thawing in tundra (1.1 +/- 3.5 days) and alpine grasslands (16.6 +/- 5.8 days). The association was weaker for deciduous forests (40.3 +/- 4.2 days), especially where soils freeze infrequently. Needleleaved forests tended to start the growing season before the end of thawing (-17.4 +/- 3.6 days), although observations from remote sensing (MODIS Land Cover Dynamics) indicated that the onset of greenness started after the thawing period (26.8 +/- 32 days). This study highlights the role of soil temperature at the spring growth onset at high latitudes. Soil thawing becomes less relevant in temperate forests, where soil is occasionally frozen and other climate factors become more important. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human land use activities have resulted in large changes to the biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the Earth's surface, with consequences for climate and other ecosystem services. In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon-climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015-2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) over a longer time domain (850-2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated management practices) using more input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package. The new LUH2 products contain > 50 times the information content of the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable new and improved estimates of the combined effects of land use on the global carbon-climate system.

TI  - Contribution of SAR-driven displacement measurement in assessing the triggering factors of rainfall-induced landslides
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of landslides by computing the displacements gain importance in recent studies due to the accuracy in its measurements. Kerala-Karnataka landslides of August 2018, has led to severe loss of life and damages to both states. The study emphasizes the contribution of three major landslide-driving factors viz., rainfall intensity, land-use/land-cover and slope, towards the occurrence of land-subsidence, thereby to figure the crucial bounds of each causative factor that have induced landslides in the Idukki and Kodagu districts. The results identify and enunciate the vulnerable land-cover as the plantations and fallow/barren lands; the crucial rainfall intensity as 600 mm in Idukki and 1200 mm in Kodagu; and the critical slope angle as 20 degrees to 35 degrees, that are highly liable in triggering landslides. Identification of the crucial bounds in each causative factor of landslides aid in supporting the city planners and disaster management authorities to decide proper mitigation measures.

TI  - Integration of remotely sensed and seismicity data for geo-natural hazard assessment along the Red Sea Coast, Egypt
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The flooding and seismic activity analysis clearly shows the urgent need for an evaluation planning program to mitigate hazard for the vital areas. The Red Sea coastal area is always exposed to the risk of flash floods and earthquakes; therefore, the management and determination of geo-hazard in these areas are critically important. A risk map was produced for the study area by integrated flash flooding and seismicity data. Several valuable data have been applied to accomplish this work which include ALOS-PALSAR, satellite images, and earthquake data. Seismic hazard assessment was performed using probabilistic earthquake hazard assessment; Results of the iso-acceleration maps and hazard curves for a return period of 475 years showed that the seismic hazard values increase from southern to northern parts. The morphometric parameter interpretations illustrate that 6 sub-basins (40% of total sub-basins) are of high-flooding hazardous, 5 sub-basins of moderate hazard (33.33%), and 4 of low hazard (26.66%). Finally, geo-hazard map results markedly increase from south to north in the study area. So, we recommend that some dams and channels should be constructed in vital sites along and at the end of the channel Wadi to protect it against flood hazards along the Red Sea Coast for long-term sustainable development without problems. These findings can be a potential guide for decision-makers in disaster geo-hazard reduction in this interest coastal area.

TI  - Influence of locoregional lymph node aspiration cytology vs sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy on disease stage assignment in dogs with integumentary mast cell tumors
T2  - VETERINARY SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To compare the effect of sentinel lymph node (SLN) histology vs locoregional lymph node (LRLN) fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology on assigned disease stage and adjunctive treatment recommendations and describe the incidence of anatomic disparity between the LRLN and SLN.Study design A pre-post study refers to a study design type in which subjects are compared pre and post the intervention of interest.Animals Seventeen dogs undergoing primary excision of 20 cutaneous and subcutaneous mast cell tumors (MCT).Methods Client-owned dogs presenting to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals for surgical removal of a cytologically confirmed cutaneous or subcutaneous MCT >1 cm in diameter were enrolled. Cytological examination of FNA from the LRLN was compared with histology of the SLN. The SLN was identified by indirect computed tomographic lymphangiography (ICTL) after peritumoral injection of iopamidol and scanning at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes. Histopathologic node score > 1 was considered metastatic. After case review by an oncologist, LRLN FNA cytology was compared with SLN histology for effect on changes in stage assignment and adjunctive treatment recommendations.Results Mast cell tumors were graded as 2 low (n = 11), 2 high (n = 2), and subcutaneous (n = 7). Optimal scan timing was 10 minutes after injection of iopamidol. Sentinel lymph node differed anatomically from LRLN in 5 of 18 scans. Metastases were detected by histology in 9 of 20 SLN compared with in 1 of 20 FNA of LRLN (P = .001), changing stage and adjunctive treatment recommendations 8 of 20 tumors. Only 6 of 19 LRLN FNA samples were diagnostic.Conclusion Sentinel lymph nodes were consistently identified with ICTL and differed from LRLN in one-quarter of tumors. Histopathological examination of SLN altered recommendations in half of the dogs compared with the previous standard of care.Clinical significance Indirect computed tomographic lymphangiography and SLN excision should be considered as a new standard for dogs with MCT.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the relationship between new-type drug use and high risk behavior in men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shandong province. Methods: Cross-sectional surveys was conducted to collect the information about demographics, sexual and drug use behaviors of MSM and HIV-related services in MSM in three sentinel surveillance sites in Shandong from April to July in 2019. Blood samples were taken from the MSM for serological tests of HIV antibody and syphilis antibody. Results: A total of 1 203 MSM were included in this study. The average age of the MSM was 30.2±8.9 years. Among these MSM, 67.7% (815) were unmarried; 66.9% (805) had education level of college or above; 62.2% (721/1 160) had unprotected sex behaviors and 16.3% (189/1 160) had group sex behavior in the past six months and 54.2% (652/1 203) ever used new-type drugs. HIV infection and syphilis prevalence rates were 3.1% (37/1 203) and 4.7% (56/1 203), respectively. Multivariable logistic analysis indicated that MSM who had unprotected anal sex in the past six months were more likely to be from Qingdao (aOR=1.59, 95%CI:1.13-2.23), with education level of high school or below (aOR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.20-2.16), with male sex partners from bars/dance halls or other venues (aOR=1.69, 95%CI: 1.06-2.69), with HIV knowledge awareness score <6 (aOR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.01-2.37), with ≥2 sex partner in the past week (aOR=1.48, 95%CI: 1.12-1.95), to have group sex behaviors in the past six months (aOR=2.43, 95%CI:1.61-3.67) and to use new-type drugs (aOR=1.46, 95%CI: 1.11-1.91). MSM who had group sex were more likely to have following features: being from Qingdao (aOR=2.21, 95%CI: 1.45-3.38), non-Shandong residents (aOR=2.13, 95%CI: 1.28-3.55), HIV knowledge awareness score ≥6 (aOR=3.11, 95%CI: 1.55-6.25), ever having unprotected anal sex behaviors (aOR=2.60, 95%CI: 1.71-3.96) and ever having male commercial sex (aOR=3.38, 95%CI: 1.92-5.95) in the past six months, ever using new-type drugs (aOR=2.71, 95%CI: 1.82-4.04), and never having HIV testing in the past year (aOR=2.66, 95%CI: 1.59-4.43). Conclusion: New-type drug use is common in MSM in Shandong. The use of new-type drugs promotes unprotected sex and group sex in MSM. Surveillance and intervention measures targeting this population should be strengthened.

TI  - Using composite fingerprints to quantify the potential dust source contributions in northwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms have a profound impact on the atmospheric environment, global climate change, and human health, so it is of great importance to strengthen related research. The main areas of occurrence and frequency of dust storms in northwestern China were distinguished by measuring the concentration of geochemical elements in the topsoil and atmospheric dust samples, combined with the HYSPLIT backward trajectory model, MODIS true-color satellite images, and PM10 real-time monitoring data. On this basis, the composite fingerprints method was used to establish an end-member model between the concentration of dust storm samples and topsoil samples, and then to trace the sand and dust sources in northwest China and quantify their source contributions. The results showed that the main potential source areas causing sandstorms were located in the Kumtag Desert, Hexi area, and the Gobi Desert in the central and western parts of Inner Mongolia. Overall, the contributions from natural sources were greater than those from anthropogenic sources, especially at Alxa League. In addition to natural sources, anthropogenic dust sources contributed highly to dust storms, with a contribution rate of approximately 40% in cities. The main dust source in Zhangye City was from agriculture areas. The contribution of the potential dust sources in the west of the study area showed a decreasing trend from west to east because of the distance effect. Because of the influence of the prevailing westerly winds in the east, the sources of dust were relatively extensive. The Badain Jaran Desert and Tengger Desert were not the main dust sources in the study area because of artificial sand control measures and the low amounts of fine-grained components in sandy deserts. These methods and results are of great importance for sustainable development in northwest China. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Managing an existential threat: how a global crisis contaminates organizational decision-making
T2  - MANAGEMENT DECISION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The paper introduces a new model, the evolutionary-existential model of organizational decision-making. The purpose of the model is to provide an empirical framework for understanding the context for decision-making under conditions of existential threat to organizations, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic during the year 2020. Design/methodology/approach The model is built on an extensive interdisciplinary literature review, drawing from research in social psychology, management, behavioral economics, evolutionary psychology and consumer behavior. In general, the authors follow Bargal's (2006) call for action research in the spirit of Lewin (1951). Findings According to the model, organizational decision-making during the pandemic threat is influenced by (1) existential threat and (2) an unprecedented macroenvironmental context for decision-making. The authors argue that these psychological and macroenvironmental forces may lead to suboptimal decision-making, based on (1) their basic cognitive architecture and (2) specific evolutionary triggers activated by the pandemic. The authors highlight how the interaction between these inputs and the decision context manifest in various social psychological phenomena that are known to impact judgments and decisions. Practical implications Simply put, the magnitude and the urgency of the global pandemic call for new and integrative ways of understanding organizational decision-making. Originality/value The model is new. Although the authors draw on prior research and theory, the model is uniquely interdisciplinary; further, the authors are able to make specific and unique predictions about the inputs, decision context and their social-psychological consequences for decision-making.

TI  - Glacier mass loss in the Alaknanda basin, Garhwal Himalaya on a decadal scale
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan glaciers significantly contribute to the largest river systems like the Indus, Ganga, and the Brahmaputra. The change in glacial area and mass can affect the mountain community and people living in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The present study adopted the geodetic method to estimate the elevation change and mass budget of 61 glaciers in the Alaknanda Basin, using the satellite data of Cartosat-1 (2011, 2014, 2017) and SRTM (2000). Besides, the DEM of 1962 (SOI Toposheet) and 2000 (SRTM) is used to estimate the mass budget of Satopanth (SPG) and Bhagirath Kharak glaciers (BKG). The field debris thickness of SPG (2015-2017) is compared with the elevation change (2000-2017). Further, we have compared the mass loss of the glaciers with their volume. The results suggest the sustained mass loss of 1.85 +/- 0.10 Gt out of 33.9 +/- 8.8 Gt for 61 glaciers in the basin from 2000-2017. The mass loss of SPG and BKG during 2000-2017 is 0.20 +/- 0.02 Gt and 0.24 +/- 0.03 Gt, whereas from 1962 to 2000, is 0.083 +/- 0.03 Gt and 0.091 +/- 0.04 Gt, respectively. The analysis facilitates a better understanding of glacier mass changes in the Alaknanda basin on a multi-decadal scale.

TI  - Mapping forest age using National Forest Inventory, airborne laser scanning, and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The age of forest stands is critical information for forest management and conservation, for example for growth modelling, timing of management activities and harvesting, or decisions about protection areas. However, area-wide information about forest stand age often does not exist. In this study, we developed regression models for large-scale area-wide prediction of age in Norwegian forests. For model development we used more than 4800 plots of the Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI) distributed over Norway between latitudes 58 degrees and 65 degrees N in an 18.2 Mha study area. Predictor variables were based on airborne laser scanning (ALS), Sentinel-2, and existing public map data. We performed model validation on an independent data set consisting of 63 spruce stands with known age. Results The best modelling strategy was to fit independent linear regression models to each observed site index (SI) level and using a SI prediction map in the application of the models. The most important predictor variable was an upper percentile of the ALS heights, and root mean squared errors (RMSEs) ranged between 3 and 31 years (6% to 26%) for SI-specific models, and 21 years (25%) on average. Mean deviance (MD) ranged between - 1 and 3 years. The models improved with increasing SI and the RMSEs were largest for low SI stands older than 100 years. Using a mapped SI, which is required for practical applications, RMSE and MD on plot level ranged from 19 to 56 years (29% to 53%), and 5 to 37 years (5% to 31%), respectively. For the validation stands, the RMSE and MD were 12 (22%) and 2 years (3%), respectively. Conclusions Tree height estimated from airborne laser scanning and predicted site index were the most important variables in the models describing age. Overall, we obtained good results, especially for stands with high SI. The models could be considered for practical applications, although we see considerable potential for improvements if better SI maps were available.

TI  - Study of temporal response (1976-2019) and associated mass movement event (during 2017) of Meru glacier, Bhagirathi valley, Garhwal Himalaya, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact of climate change on glaciers brings the favorable conditions of lakes formation within glacier moraines. These lakes may produce outburst floods and transport the huge amount of debris (debris flow) in downstream settlements. The present study addresses the current knowledge on mass movement activity occurred in the Gangotri glacier area, Garhwal Himalaya Uttarakhand. Temporal response (terminus retreat and frontal area loss) of Meru glacier during 1976-2019 using the images of Landsat (MSS, 1976; TM, 1990, 2011; ETM+, 2001; OLI, 2019) and event of intense mass movement occurred along Meru glacier during 2017 is assessed. Our estimations clearly reveals that the Meru glacier is retreating continuously since 1976 with inconsistent rate. Considering the time span 1976-1990, 1990-2001, 2001-2011, 2011-2019 the terminus receded with 12.42 m y(-1), 7.72 m y(-1), 6.00 m y(-1), 11.50 m y(-1) and vacated the frontal area at the rate of 2330.70 m(2) y(-1), 2185.88 m(2) y(-1), 1425.18 m(2) y(-1), 1452.66 m(2) y(-1) respectively. Field observations and high resolution imagery of LISS IV suggest that the lower area of Meru glacier experienced the event of intense mass movement in July, 2017. This event breached the continuity of left morainic wall of Bhagirathi valley. This mass movement event influenced the initial course of Bhagirathi River (similar to 1559 m length) and also modified the morphology of the Gaumukh region. The precipitation data from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and satellite images of different years suggest that the multiple factors such as intense precipitation, large amount of sediment transport from the upper reaches to lower area, slope failure, collapse of frontal part of Meru glacier were the main causative factors for this event.

TI  - Identification of submarine groundwater discharge using thermal infrared observations in the Arabian Ocean near Okha coast, Gujarat, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we identify a region of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) near Okha coast, Gujarat, India using thermal infrared remote sensing technique. Observations of brightness temperature (BT) in the thermal infrared spectral region (10.6-11.19 mu m) from Landsat-8 satellite in the coastal region showed unique localized cooling in the Arabian Sea during winter. We observed lowering of BT in the range 0.6 degrees-2.3 degrees C in the coastal region associated with SGD in comparison to sea surface temperature of the ocean during low-tide conditions. Consistent geographical pattern of thermal contrast was observed near the same location (lat. 22 degrees 26'54.43 '' N, long. 69 degrees 00'41.67 '' E) when multi date (11 datasets) thermal data were analysed between 2015 and 2019 in winter. Generally, low-tide conditions show more cooling of ocean surface at the SGD site compared to high-tide conditions, which indicates the process of SGD. Satellite-based assessment was further validated using field- and ship-based measurements.

TI  - Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Ductal Carcinoma <i>In Situ</i> Diagnosed by Preoperative Core Needle Biopsy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe positivity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis is relatively low in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with SLN metastasis and build a model to predict the potential risk of SLN metastasis in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS.Patients and MethodsCore needle biopsy-proved DCIS patients who underwent SLN biopsy and breast surgery were retrospectively reviewed and selected. Univariate analysis was used to identify the variables correlated with SLN metastasis. A model to predict SLN metastasis was developed using a multivariate logistic regression in the training set and then validated in an internal set.ResultsA total of 407 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS were included. Upstaging to invasive/microinvasive cancer occurred in 225 patients after surgery. SLN metastasis was found in 42 patients, including 32 patients upstaging to invasive disease, 8 to microinvasive disease, and 2 pure DCIS. Tumor size based on US examination, axillary ultrasound finding, multifocality, surgery, upstaging, and Ki-67 expression were significantly related to SLN metastasis. The model incorporating tumor size, axillary ultrasound finding and multifocality yielded an AUC of 0.805 (95% CI: 0.715-0.895, p<0.001) in the training set, and 0.729 (95% CI: 0.547-0.911, p=0.013) in the testing set.ConclusionA simple model was developed to predict SLN metastasis in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS. With good discriminatory power, this model should be helpful for surgeons to decide if SLN biopsy could be safely avoided in certain patients.

TI  - Omitting radiotherapy is safe in breast cancer patients≥70 years old after breast-conserving surgery without axillary lymph node operation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To verify whether omitting radiotherapy from breast cancer treatment for patients >= 70 years old following breast-conserving surgery (BCS) without axillary lymph node dissection is safe. Previous studies have shown that omitting breast radiotherapy after BCS and axillary lymph node dissection is safe for elderly breast cancer patients. We aimed to evaluate the safety of BCS without axillary surgery or breast radiotherapy (BCSNR) in elderly patients with breast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. We performed a retrospective analysis of 481 patients with breast cancer, aged >= 70 years, between 2010 and 2016. Of these, 302 patients underwent BCSNR and 179 underwent other, larger scope operations. Local recurrence rate, ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) rate, distant metastasis rate, breast-related death, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups. After a median follow-up of 60 months, no significant differences in local recurrence, distant metastasis rate, breast-related death, and DFS were noted. The OS was similar (P=0.56) between the BCSNR group (91.7%) and other operations group (93.0%). The IBTR rate was considered low in both groups, however resulted greater (P=0.005) in the BCSNR group (5.3%) than in other operations group (1.6%). BCSNR did not affect the survival of elderly patients with breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. IBTR was infrequent in both groups; however, there was a significant difference between the two groups. BCSNR is a feasible treatment modality for patients with breast cancer >= 70 years old with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes.

TI  - Spatial and temporal representativeness of point measurements for nitrogen dioxide pollution levels in cities
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In many cities around the world the overall air quality is improving, but at the same time nitrogen dioxide (NO2) trends show stagnating values and in many cases could not be reduced below air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Many large cities have built monitoring stations to continuously measure different air pollutants. While most stations follow defined rules in terms of measurement height and distance to traffic emissions, the question remains of how representative are those point measurements for the city-wide air quality. The question of the spatial coverage of a point measurement is important because it defines the area of influence and coverage of monitoring networks, determines how to assimilate monitoring data into model simulations or compare to satellite data with a coarser resolution, and is essential to assess the impact of the acquired data on public health.In order to answer this question, we combined different measurement data sets consisting of path-averaging remote sensing data and in situ point measurements in stationary and mobile setups from a measurement campaign that took place in Munich, Germany, in June and July 2016. We developed an algorithm to strip temporal from spatial patterns in order to construct a consistent NO2 pollution map for Munich. Continuous long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP DOAS) measurements were complemented with mobile cavity-enhanced (CE) DOAS, chemiluminescence (CL) and cavity attenuated phase shift (CAPS) instruments and were compared to monitoring stations and satellite data. In order to generate a consistent composite map, the LP DOAS diurnal cycle has been used to normalize for the time of the day dependency of the source patterns, so that spatial and temporal patterns can be analyzed separately. The resulting concentration map visualizes pollution hot spots at traffic junctions and tunnel exits in Munich, providing insights into the strong spatial variations. On the other hand, this database is beneficial to the urban planning and the design of control measures of environment pollution. Directly comparing on-street mobile measurements in the vicinity of monitoring stations resulted in a difference of 48 %. For the extrapolation of the monitoring station data to street level, we determined the influence of the measuring height and distance to the street. We found that a measuring height of 4 m, at which the Munich monitoring stations measure, results in 16 % lower average concentrations than a measuring height of 1.5 m, which is the height of the inlet of our mobile measurements and a typical pedestrian breathing height. The horizontal distance of most stations to the center of the street of about 6 m also results in an average reduction of 13 % compared to street level concentration. A difference of 21 % in the NO2 concentrations remained, which could be an indication that city-wide measurements are needed for capturing the full range and variability of concentrations for assessing pollutant exposure and air quality in cities.

TI  - UAV-based evaluation of morphological changes induced by extreme rainfall events in meandering rivers
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphological changes, caused by the erosion and deposition processes due to water discharge and sediment flux occur, in the banks along the river channels and in the estuaries. Flow rate is one of the most important factors that can change river morphology. The geometric shapes of the meanders and the river flow parameters are crucial components in the areas where erosion or deposition occurs in the meandering rivers. Extreme precipitation triggers erosion on the slopes, which causes significant morphological changes in large areas during and after the event. The flow and sediment amount observed in a river basin with extreme precipitation increases and exceeds the long-term average value. Hereby, erosion severity can be determined by performing spatial analyses on remotely sensed imagery acquired before and after an extreme precipitation event. Changes of erosion and deposition along the river channels and overspill channels can be examined by comparing multi-temporal Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. In this study, morphological changes in the Buyuk Menderes River located in the western Turkey, were monitored with pre-flood (June 2018), during flood (January 2019), and post-flood (September 2019) UAV surveys, and the spatial and volumetric changes of eroded/deposited sediment were quantified. For this purpose, the DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) method and the DEM of Difference (DoD) method were used to determine the changes on the riverbank and to compare the periodic volumetric morphological changes. Hereby, Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry technique was exploited to a low-cost UAV derived imagery to achieve riverbank, areal and volumetric changes following the extreme rainfall events extracted from the time series of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data. The change analyses were performed to figure out the periodic morphodynamic variations and the impact of the flood on the selected meandering structures. In conclusion, although the river water level increased by 0.4-5.9 meters with the flood occurred in January 2019, the sediment deposition areas reformed after the flood event, as the water level decreased. Two-year monitoring revealed that the sinuosity index (SI) values changed during the flood approached the pre-flood values over time. Moreover, it was observed that the amount of the deposited sediments in September 2019 approached that of June 2018.

TI  - Use of optical absorption indices to assess seasonal variability of dissolved organic matter in Amazon floodplain lakes
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the carbon cycling of aquatic ecosystems, information on its seasonal variability is crucial. In this study we assess the use of optical absorption indices available in the literature based on in situ data to both characterize the seasonal variability of DOM in a highly complex environment and for application in large-scale studies using remote sensing data. The study area comprises four lakes located in the Mamiraud Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR). Samples for the determination of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and measurements of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) were acquired in situ. The R-rs was used to simulate the response of the visible bands of the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), which was used in the proposed models. Differences between lakes were tested using the CDOM indices. The results highlight the role of the flood pulse in the DOM dynamics at the floodplain lakes. The validation results show that the use of the absorption coefficient of CDOM (a(CDOM)) as a proxy of the spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm (S275-295) during rising water is worthwhile, demonstrating its potential application to Sentinel-2 MSI imagery data for studying DOM dynamics on the large scale.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with node-positive breast cancer: guiding a more selective axillary approach
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains controversial. This study aims to investigate if axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) could be safely omitted after a negative SLNB in cN1/2 patients who become cN0 after NAC. Methods We retrospectively assessed T1-4, cN1/2 patients who were submitted to NAC between 2010 and 2016. T1-T3 patients who achieved complete axillary clinical response underwent SLNB. Those whose SLNs were negative were not subjected to additional ALND. The oncological outcomes of the patients were analyzed. Results Fifty-nine T1-T3 patients (45.0%) achieved a complete axillary response (cN0), and were selected to undergo SLNB. SLNs were detected in 55 of them (93.2%). Seventeen of those patients (30.9%) had SLN metastases detected and subsequently underwent ALND. In contrast, 38 patients (69.1%) had no nodal metastases detected and were managed without complementary ALND. After a mean follow-up of 55.8 months, only one patient (2.6%) submitted to SLNB without a complementary ALND had axillary recurrence as compared with three patients (3.2%) in the ALND group (p = 0.71). Distant recurrence occurred more frequently among patients submitted to ALND (92.1%) than among those only submitted to SLNB (7.9%) (p < 0.0006). Overall survival and disease-free survival were significantly better in patients who were not submitted to ALND. Conclusion SLNB could be successfully used in guiding a more selective axillary approach in cN+ patients that became cN0 after NAC. Omitting ALND in CN0 patients with negative SLNs did not seem to compromise disease control and oncological outcomes.

TI  - Automated Processing of Declassified KH-9 Hexagon Satellite Images for Global Elevation Change Analysis Since the 1970s
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing changes in Earth surface topography is crucial for many Earth science disciplines. Documenting these changes over several decades at regional to global scale remains a challenge due to the limited availability of suitable satellite data before the year 2000. Declassified analog satellite images from the American reconnaissance program Hexagon (KH-9), which surveyed nearly all land surfaces from 1972 to 1986 at meter to sub-meter resolutions, provide a unique opportunity to fill the gap in observations. However, large-scale processing of analog imagery remains challenging. We developed an automated workflow to generate Digital Elevation Models and orthophotos from scanned KH-9 mapping camera stereo images. The workflow includes a preprocessing step to correct for film and scanning distortions and crop the scanned images, and a stereo reconstruction step using the open-source NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline. The processing of several hundreds of image pairs enabled us to estimate reliable camera parameters for each KH-9 mission, thereby correcting elevation biases of several tens of meters. The resulting DEMs were validated against various reference elevation data, including snow-covered glaciers with limited image texture. Pixel-scale elevation uncertainty was estimated as 5 m at the 68% confidence level, and less than 15 m at the 95% level. We evaluated the uncertainty of spatially averaged elevation change and volume change, both from an empirical and analytical approach, and we raise particular attention to large-scale correlated biases that may impact volume change estimates from such DEMs. Finally, we present a case study of long-term glacier elevation change in the European Alps. Our results show the suitability of these historical images to quantitatively study global surface change over the past 40-50 years.

TI  - Ecological environment quality evaluation and evolution analysis of a rare earth mining area under different disturbance conditions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative impacts of the overexploitation of resources on regional environments have become increasingly obvious. The contradiction between the environment and development and the management of the ecological environment in mining areas are urgent problems to be solved. This paper uses Landsat images from four temporal phases from 1991 to 2018 in the Lingbei mining area of Dingnan County, China, to construct a rare earth remote sensing-based ecological index (RE-RSEI) suitable for rare earth mining areas and to analyze the impacts of different rare earth mining methods, mining scales and environmental management measures on the mining area environment over the past 27 years. The results show that since 1991, due to the mining techniques of "pond leaching" and "heap leaching" and the soil condition, mining has caused severe damage to the land and vegetation, and the ecological environment quality of the entire mining area has been seriously reduced with its RE-RSEI value dropping from 0.744 to 0.675. After 2010, through the optimization of mining technology and the government's attention to ecological environmental governance, the quality of the ecological environment was slowly restored, and the recovery effect at some mine sites was remarkable. The RE-RSEI model has good applicability to rare earth mining areas, can intuitively reflect the destruction and restoration of the ecological environment of rare earth mining areas under different mining modes, and provides scientific guidance for promoting the coordination of the development and utilization of rare earth resources and mine ecological environmental protection and sustainable development.

TI  - Geolocator tagging links distributions in the non-breeding season to population genetic structure in a sentinel North Pacific seabird.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that segregation in wintering areas is associated with population differentiation in a sentinel North Pacific seabird, the rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata). We collected tissue samples for genetic analyses on five breeding colonies in the western Pacific Ocean (Japan) and on 13 colonies in the eastern Pacific Ocean (California to Alaska), and deployed light-level geolocator tags on 12 eastern Pacific colonies to delineate wintering areas. Geolocator tags were deployed previously on one colony in Japan. There was strong genetic differentiation between populations in the eastern vs. western Pacific Ocean, likely due to two factors. First, glaciation over the North Pacific in the late Pleistocene might have forced a southward range shift that historically isolated the eastern and western populations. And second, deep-ocean habitat along the northern continental shelf appears to act as a barrier to movement; abundant on both sides of the North Pacific, the rhinoceros auklet is virtually absent as a breeder in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and no tagged birds crossed the North Pacific in the non-breeding season. While genetic differentiation was strongest between the eastern vs. western Pacific, there was also extensive differentiation within both regional groups. In pairwise comparisons among the eastern Pacific colonies, the standardized measure of genetic differentiation (FꞌST) was negatively correlated with the extent of spatial overlap in wintering areas. That result supports the hypothesis that segregation in the non-breeding season is linked to genetic structure. Philopatry and a neritic foraging habit probably also contribute to the structuring. Widely distributed, vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, and exhibiting extensive genetic structure, the rhinoceros auklet is fully indicative of the scope of the conservation challenges posed by seabirds.

And second, deep-ocean habitat along the northern continental shelf appears to act as a barrier to movement; abundant on both sides of the North Pacific, the rhinoceros auklet is virtually absent as a breeder in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and no tagged birds crossed the North Pacific in the non-breeding season. While genetic differentiation was strongest between the eastern vs. western Pacific, there was also extensive differentiation within both regional groups. In pairwise comparisons among the eastern Pacific colonies, the standardized measure of genetic differentiation (F-ST) was negatively correlated with the extent of spatial overlap in wintering areas. That result supports the hypothesis that segregation in the non-breeding season is linked to genetic structure. Philopatry and a neritic foraging habit probably also contribute to the structuring. Widely distributed, vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, and exhibiting extensive genetic structure, the rhinoceros auklet is fully indicative of the scope of the conservation challenges posed by seabirds.

TI  - Probabilistic retrieval of volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> layer height and partial column density using the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - During most volcanic eruptions and many periods of volcanic unrest, detectable quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO2) are injected into the atmosphere at a wide range of altitudes, from ground level to the lower stratosphere. Because the fine ash fraction of a volcanic plume is, at times, colocated with SO2 emissions, global tracking of volcanic SO2 is useful in tracking the hazard long after ash detection becomes dominated by noise. Typically, retrievals of SO2 vertical column density (VCD) have relied heavily on hyperspectral ultraviolet measurements. More recently, infrared sounders have provided additional VCD measurements and estimates of the SO2 layer altitude, adding significant value to real-time monitoring of volcanic emissions and climatological analyses. These methods can provide fast and accurate physics-based retrievals of VCD and altitude without regard to solar irradiance, meaning that they are effective day and night and can observe high-latitude SO2 even in the winter.In this study, we detail a probabilistic enhancement of an infrared SO2 retrieval method, based on a modified trace gas retrieval, to estimate SO2 VCD and altitude probabilistically using the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) series of satellites. The methodology requires the characterization of real SO2-free spectra aggregated seasonally and spatially. The probabilistic approach replaces altitude and VCD estimates with probability density functions for the layer height and the partial VCD at multiple heights, fully quantifying the retrieval uncertainty and allowing the estimation of SO2 partitioning by layer. This framework adds significant value over basic VCD and altitude retrieval because it can be used to assign probabilities of SO2 occurrence to different atmospheric intervals.We highlight analyses of several recent significant eruptions, including the 22 June 2019 eruption of Raikoke volcano, in the Kuril Islands; the mid-December 2016 eruption of Bogoslof volcano, in the Aleutian Islands; and the 26 June 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra volcano, in the Galapagos Islands. This retrieval method is currently being implemented in the VOLcanic Cloud Analysis Toolkit (VOL-CAT), where it will be used to generate additional cloud object properties for real-time detection, probabilistic characterization, and tracking of volcanic clouds in support of aviation safety.

TI  - Influence of intraseasonal eastern boundary circulation variability on hydrography and biogeochemistry off Peru
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The intraseasonal evolution of physical and biogeochemical properties during a coastal trapped wave event off central Peru is analysed using data from an extensive shipboard observational programme conducted between April and June 2017, and remote sensing data. The poleward velocities in the Peru-Chile Undercurrent were highly variable and strongly intensified to above 0.5 m s(-1) between the middle and end of May. This intensification was likely caused by a first-baroclinic-mode downwelling coastal trapped wave, excited by a westerly wind anomaly at the Equator and originating at about 95 degrees W. Local winds along the South American coast did not impact the wave. Although there is general agreement between the observed cross-shore-depth velocity structure of the coastal trapped wave and the velocity structure of first vertical mode solution of a linear wave model, there are differences in the details of the two flow distributions. The enhanced poleward flow increased water mass advection from the equatorial current system to the study site. The resulting shorter alongshore transit times between the Equator and the coast off central Peru led to a strong increase in nitrate concentrations, less anoxic water, likely less fixed nitrogen loss to N-2 and a decrease of the nitrogen deficit compared to the situation before the poleward flow intensification. This study highlights the role of changes in the alongshore advection due to coastal trapped waves for the nutrient budget and the cumulative strength of N cycling in the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone. Enhanced availability of nitrate may impact a range of pelagic and benthic elemental cycles, as it represents a major electron acceptor for organic carbon degradation during denitrification and is involved in sulfide oxidation in sediments.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of urban landscape in Asansol municipal corporation, West Bengal, India: a geospatial analysis
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of regional land use have a pivotal role in suitable and sustainable urban development. In this study various multi-temporal satellite imageries i.e. LANDSAT TM (1991, 2008) and OLI (2018) were used to analyse the land use/land cover (LULC) change, land transformation, urban expansion, growth direction, and urban sprawl to understand the nature of built-up area growth in Asansol Municipal Corporation (AMC), West Bengal. Seven categories of land class have been categorized using the Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier algorithm and resulted in values putting into the transitional probability matrix to show the change detection of each land class. The annual built-up area intensity index and directional expansion of the built-up area during 1991-2018 have been calculated to show the changing rate of the built-up area with direction. The result indicates that the built-up area has drastically increased from 12.54 to 33.87% from 1991 to 2018 expanding towards the southwest direction and other land classes have a decreasing trend. Finally, this study concludes that the least amount of vegetation cover and industry-based urban expansion of this urban area might be a threat to become an urban heat island in the future. So, urban planners and researchers should have to take proper planning for urban expansion and try to increase urban green infrastructure for a sustainable urban future.

TI  - Climate sensitivity of water use by riparian woodlands at landscape scales
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-arid riparian woodlands face threats from increasing extractive water demand and climate change in dryland landscapes worldwide. Improved landscape-scale understanding of riparian woodland water use (evapotranspiration, ET) and its sensitivity to climate variables is needed to strategically manage water resources, as well as to create successful ecosystem conservation and restoration plans for potential climate futures. In this work, we assess the spatial and temporal variability of Cottonwood (Populus fremontii)-Willow (Salix gooddingii) riparian gallery woodland ET and its relationships to vegetation structure and climate variables for 80 km of the San Pedro River corridor in southeastern Arizona, USA, between 2014 and 2019. We use a novel combination of publicly available remote sensing, climate and hydrological datasets: cloud-based Landsat thermal remote sensing data products for ET (Google Earth Engine EEFlux), Landsat multispectral imagery and field data-based calibrations to vegetation structure (leaf-area index, LAI), and open-source climate and hydrological data. We show that at landscape scales, daily ET rates (6-10 mm day(-1)) and growing season ET totals (400-1,400 mm) matched rates of published field data, and modelled reach-scale average LAI (0.80-1.70) matched lower ranges of published field data. Over 6 years, the spatial variability of total growing season ET (CV = 0.18) exceeded that of temporal variability (CV = 0.10), indicating the importance of reach-scale vegetation and hydrological conditions for controlling ET dynamics. Responses of ET to climate differed between perennial and intermittent-flow stream reaches. At perennial-flow reaches, ET correlated significantly with temperature, whilst at intermittent-flow sites ET correlated significantly with rainfall and stream discharge. Amongst reaches studied in detail, we found positive but differing logarithmic relationships between LAI and ET. By documenting patterns of high spatial variability of ET at basin scales, these results underscore the importance of accurately accounting for differences in woodland vegetation structure and hydrological conditions for assessing water-use requirements. Results also suggest that the climate sensitivity of ET may be used as a remote indicator of subsurface water resources relative to vegetation demand, and an indicator for informing conservation management priorities.

TI  - Axillary surgery for breast cancer: past, present, and future
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - In breast cancer surgery, there has been a major shift toward less invasive local treatment. Although axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was an integral part of surgical treatment for breast cancer, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy was developed as an accurate method for axillary staging. ALND can be avoided not only in patients with negative SLNs but also in those with one or two positive SLNs receiving breast and/or axillary radiation. On the other hand, ALND has remained the standard treatment for patients with clinically positive nodes. However, axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was developed to map and preserve arm lymphatic drainage during ALND and/or SLN biopsy. This procedure allowed reduction of the rate of arm lymphedema without increasing axillary recurrence, although patients receive postoperative chemotherapy and high-risk patients undergo axillary radiation. Standard ALND may not be necessary even for patients with clinically positive nodes who receive axillary radiation and systemic therapy. Thus, the extent of axillary surgery in breast cancer has been decreased with increased use of systemic and radiation therapy.

TI  - Retraction of invasive <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> and its effect on the habitat loss of endangered migratory bird species and their decline in YNNR using remote sensing technology
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland environment and habitat loss increase the rate of biodiversity decline and affect our ecosystems. Yancheng National Nature Reserve (YNNR) is a protected area dedicated to endangered migratory bird species to overwinter. However, it currently has a record low influx of migrating birds and might therefore be losing its founding purpose. We used remote sensing technology to assess and quantify the impacts and effects of invasive halophytes Spartina alterniflora in the habitat loss and shrinkage of endangered bird wintering habitat from 2003 to 2018. We also attempted to ascertain the causes and triggers of avian population decline and its relationship with habitat loss, as these phenomena threaten and endanger species both locally and globally. Our study shows how YNNR has lost about 80% of migratory bird habitat to invasive S. alterniflora and Phragmites australis, a native halophyte plant in the reserve. Furthermore, shoreline erosion triggered the retraction of S. alterniflora and its backward growth toward Suaeda Salsa, the preferred foraging habitat for migratory birds in the zone, which is a possible cause of their decline.

TI  - Impacts of global NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> inversions on NO<sub>2</sub> and ozone simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric NO2 and ozone simulations have large uncertainties, but their biases, seasonality, and trends can be improved with NO2 assimilations. We perform global top-down estimates of monthly NOx emissions using two Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 retrievals (NASAv3 and DOMINOv2) from 2005 to 2016 through a hybrid 4D-Var/mass balance inversion. Discrepancy in NO2 retrieval products is a major source of uncertainties in the top-down NOx emission estimates. The different vertical sensitivities in the two NO2 retrievals affect both magnitude and seasonal variations of top-down NOx emissions. The 12-year averages of regional NOx budgets from the NASA posterior emissions are 37% to 53% smaller than the DOMINO posterior emissions. Consequently, the DOMINO posterior surface NO2 simulations greatly reduced the negative biases in China (by 15 %) and the US (by 22 %) compared to surface NO2 measurements. Posterior NOx emissions show consistent trends over China, the US, India, and Mexico constrained by the two retrievals. Emission trends are less robust over South America, Australia, western Europe, and Africa, where the two retrievals show less consistency. NO2 trends have more consistent decreases (by 26 %) with the measurements (by 32 %) in the US from 2006 to 2016 when using the NASA posterior emissions. The performance of posterior ozone simulations has spatial heterogeneities from region to region. On a global scale, ozone simulations using NASA-based emissions alleviate the double peak in the prior simulation of global ozone seasonality. The higher abundances of NO2 from the DOMINO posterior simulations increase the global background ozone concentrations and therefore reduce the negative biases more than the NASA posterior simulations using GEOS-Chem v12 at remote sites. Compared to surface ozone measurements, posterior simulations have more consistent magnitude and interannual variations than the prior estimates, but the performance from the NASA-based and DOMINO-based emissions varies across ozone metrics. The limited availability of remote-sensing data and the use of prior NOx diurnal variations hinder improvement of ozone diurnal variations from the assimilation, and therefore have mixed performance on improving different ozone metrics. Additional improvements in posterior NO2 and ozone simulations require more precise and consistent NO2 retrieval products, more accurate diurnal variations of NOx and VOC emissions, and improved simulations of ozone chemistry and depositions.

TI  - Analysis of three decades of land cover changes in the Maputaland Coastal Plain, South Africa
T2  - KOEDOE
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern half of the Maputaland Coastal Plain (MCP) of South Africa has undergone significant change in land-use over the last five decades, including afforestation, agriculture and rural settlements. To understand the extent of land-use changes that took place in the northern half of the MCP from 1986 to 2019 and its efficacy, various Landsat satellite images that are freely available were processed, analysed and interpreted. The cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to determine the land-use changes. The random forest classification algorithm available within GEE was used to classify the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager images for 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2019. The development of plantations was tracked, which indicated that forestry increased by more than 100% between 1986 and 2019. Over the same period, surface water bodies and wetlands decreased by 36.1% and 49.1%, respectively. In addition to forestry, climate had a major impact on water resources in the MCP. Given that the MCP is a predominately groundwater-driven system, the impact of increased plantations on groundwater is an area that requires more investigation. This will improve the understanding of water resources in the area.Conservation implications: The management, protection and conservation of water resources within protected areas are entwined with land-use decisions and planning outside of its boundaries. The rapid change in land-use experienced outside of protected areas and its impact on water resources disregard boundaries and may transgress on protected areas.

TI  - Measuring ethical judgement on ethical choice in an ethical system: a confirmatory study on Islamic banks in UAE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to examine the influence of ethical judgement on decision-making behaviour related to ethical issues of Islamic banking practitioners in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted a confirmatory approach in which validated/established "normative ethical standards" are taken into the consideration as theoretical underpinning. In total, 262 samples are collected from Islamic banking practitioners in the UAE and data analysis is conducted using structural equation modelling.FindingsThe empirical findings indicate that the decision-making behaviour related to ethical issues of Islamic banking practitioners in UAE does not adhere to any set of normative ethical standards and respondents are pragmatic in nature when it comes to the decision-making behaviour related to ethical matters.Practical implicationsThe study elucidates to what extent Islamic banking practitioners have encountered themselves with situations that demand the proper attention to the ethical aspects, which affecting decision-making behaviour related to ethical issues. According to the findings, those situations considerably demand the attention of ethical judgement in the decision-making behaviour of Islamic banking practitioners. Hence, it is recommended for Islamic banks in UAE to contain or intensify the training on the importance of ethics, Islamic thought and worldview to enhance corporate decision-making and banking profitability within the purview of Islamic principles.Originality/valueWhile ample emphasis has been given to the juristic (fiqh) aspects of ShariMODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RINGah-compliant in Islamic banking and finance, relatively little has been attempted to explore its ethical dimensions (akhlaq) in the compliance parameters. Further, ShariMODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RINGah-compliant has been product-centric rather than people-centric. While there is numerous literature documented that links ethics and Islamic banking and finance, ethical framework and practice in Islamic finance institutions, studies focusing on the "people" and their "ethical decision-making behaviour" in Islamic financial institutions found missing in the literature. These gaps serve as justification for undertaking this research.

TI  - Improving GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals using an empirical bias correction algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) series enables retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from geostationary satellites using a multiband algorithm similar to those of polar-orbiting satellites' sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). However, this work demonstrates that the current version of GOES-16 (GOES-East) ABI AOD has diurnally varying biases due to limitations in the land surface reflectance relationships between the 0.47 mu m band and the 2.2 mu m band and between the 0.64 mu m band and 2.2 mu m band used in the ABI AOD retrieval algorithm, which vary with the Sun-satellite geometry and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). To reduce these biases, an empirical bias correction algorithm has been developed based on the lowest observed ABI AOD of an adjacent 30 d period and the background AOD at each time step and at each pixel. The bias correction algorithm improves the performance of ABI AOD compared to AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD, especially for the high and medium (top 2) quality ABI AOD. AOD data for the period 6 August to 31 December 2018 are used to evaluate the bias correction algorithm. After bias correction, the correlation between the top 2 quality ABI AOD and AERONET AOD improves from 0.87 to 0.91, the mean bias improves from 0.04 to 0.00, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) improves from 0.09 to 0.05. These results for the bias-corrected top 2 qualities ABI AOD are comparable to those of the corrected high-quality ABI AOD. By using the top 2 qualities of ABI AOD in conjunction with the bias correction algorithm, the areal coverage of ABI AOD is increased by about 100 % without loss of data accuracy.

TI  - Recent changes in pan-Antarctic region surface snowmelt detected by AMSR-E and AMSR2
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface snowmelt in the pan-Antarctic region, including the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) and sea ice, is crucial to the mass and energy balance in polar regions and can serve as an indicator of climate change. In this study, we investigate the spatial and temporal variations in surface snowmelt over the entire pan-Antarctic region from 2002 to 2017 by using passive microwave remote sensing data. The stable orbits and appropriate acquisition times of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) enable us to take full advantage of daily brightness temperature (T-b) variations to detect surface snowmelt. The difference between AMSR-E/2 ascending and descending 36.5 GHz Tb values in vertical polarization (DAV36) was utilized to map the pan-Antarctic region snowmelt, as this method is unaffected by snow metamorphism. We evaluated the DAV36 algorithm against ground-based measurements and further improved the method over the marginal sea ice zone by excluding the effect of open water. Snowmelt detected by AMSR-E/2 data was more extensive and persistent than that detected by the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data. Continuous melt onset (CMO) ranged from August in the marginal sea ice zone to January in the Antarctic inland, and the early transient melt events occurred several days to more than 2 months earlier. The pan-Antarctic region CMO was significantly correlated (R = 0.54, p < 0.05) with the summer Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The decreased AIS melt extent was very likely linked (R = 0.82, p < 0.01) with the enhanced summer SAM.

TI  - Potential of Solar UV Radiation for Inactivation of Coronaviridae Family Estimated from Satellite Data
T2  - PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 disease affects people dramatically overall the globe by illness and death. Several strategies are applied to restrict the spread of this disease such as lockdown, adequate social distance in different activities, hand disinfection and the use of masks. Potential hazard outdoors comes from released viruses, which may remain in the air for a while and settle down afterward and contaminating surfaces. Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is known to act as a natural environmental virucide. The virucidal effectivity of UVR depends on a first order on the sensitivity of the virus against UVR as well as on the amount of incoming UVR. Here, we present estimates of the potential of solar UVR in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. This is done by combining DNA-damaging surface solar UVR retrieved by satellites and the available information on fluence for inactivation of Coronaviridae. Our results show that solar UVR has a high potential to inactivate these viruses, but the degree depends strongly on location and season. In the subtropics (Sao Paulo, 23.5 degrees S), the daily survival fraction is lower than 10(-4) during the whole year, while close at norther latitudes (Reykjavik, 64 degrees N), such a reduction can be found in June and July only.

TI  - Evaluation of natural radioactivity and radiological hazards in basement rocks from Gabel Abu El-Hassan in the North Eastern Desert of Egypt by multivariate statistical approach with remote sensing data
T2  - RADIATION DETECTION TECHNOLOGY AND METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The present work deals with the natural radioactivity levels of basement rocks from Gabel Abu El-Hassan in the North Eastern Desert of Egypt. Methods The activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in rock samples were measured using a gamma-ray spectrometry with an HPGe detector. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were processed and interpreted to create rock forming radioactive map. Results and conclusion The activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 varied from 28.2 +/- 9.4 to 259.6 +/- 38.6 Bq/kg, 37.9 +/- 9.9 to 297.4 +/- 54.6 Bq/kg and 487.0 +/- 73.4 to 5514.6 +/- 786.0 Bq/kg, respectively. The radiological hazard indices (gamma index), the annual effective dose rate and excess life-time cancer risk were estimated to assess the radiological hazards due to the use of rock samples as building material. Remote sensing data were also used to integrate between radioactive analysis and Landsat-7 (ETM+) data processing to detect radioactive anomalies and to identify the uraniferous alteration zones in Abu El-Hassan area.

TI  - PRAME expression in 155 cases of metastatic melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) is a promising immunohistochemical marker in distinguishing benign from malignant primary cutaneous melanocytic lesions and lymph node deposits. We hypothesize that PRAME may also reliably identify melanoma metastases that are clinically detected in skin, lymph nodes, or small intestine.Methods A total of 155 cases of metastatic melanoma to lymph node (N = 54) and non-lymph node (N = 101) sites were stained with an antibody against PRAME. Nuclear expression was scored in tumor cells as negative, 1% to 25% (1+), 26% to 50% (2+), 51% to 75% (3+), or 76% to 100% (4+).Results PRAME expression was seen in 151/155 (97.4%) cases, with 4+ expression in 64 cases (41.3%), 3+ expression in 46 cases (29.7%), 2+ expression in 18 cases (11.6%), and 1+ expression in 23 cases (14.8%). Lymph node metastases were more likely to show lower expression as compared to metastases to other anatomic sites (P = 0.003).Conclusions A high level of PRAME immunoreactivity was identified in this cohort of metastatic melanoma. Lymph node metastases showed more focal or absent PRAME expression as compared to metastases to other sites. Overall, PRAME is a useful tool for confirming the diagnosis of melanoma in a metastatic setting, in both nodal and visceral deposits.

TI  - The effectiveness of fuel reduction burning for wildfire mitigation in sclerophyll forests
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The wildfires in south-eastern Australia in the 2019-20 fire season were some of the worst in recent memory. The effectiveness of fuel-reduction burning as a risk mitigation strategy is, once again, being scrutinised. Some argue that more fuel-reduction burning is needed, while others suggest that it is of limited use in such extreme fires. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of fuel-reduction burning at a landscape scale in terms of its ability to reduce the severity of subsequent wildfire. To achieve this, we selected all the recent (2015-2019) fuel-reduction burns undertaken in New South Wales and Victoria that intersected with the extent of the 2019-20 wildfires and evaluated whether the fire severity was significantly different in the recently treated areas to that of similar untreated areas in the vicinity. To determine fire severity, Sentinel 2 satellite imagery and the change in normalised burn ratio (a common metric used for rapid and broadscale fire severity mapping) was used. Our results showed that 48% of the 307 recent fuel-reduction burns resulted in statistically significant decreased fire severity. Our results also indicated that more recent fuel-reduction burns had a greater impact, with 66% of burns undertaken in 2019 significantly reducing severity, compared with 42% from 2015. We also analysed each fuel-reduction burn in the context of a range of metrics, including location, elevation, slope, aspect and forest heterogeneity, to assess whether these factors influenced the likelihood that a burn would be effective. Location and, to a lesser degree, forest heterogeneity were found to be significant factors. Our results support the view that recent fuel-reduction burns reduce fire severity. It is unclear, however, whether the differences would be operationally significant under extreme conditions, when wildfires are driven largely by weather, irrespective of fuel loads.

TI  - Complementary Use of US FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System and Sentinel System to Characterize Direct Oral Anticoagulants-Associated Cutaneous Small Vessel Vasculitis
T2  - PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV) has been reported after exposure to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.Objective We used the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to describe clinical characteristics associated with CSVV among DOAC-exposed patients. Furthermore, we characterized this signal in the Sentinel System to relate the clinical data from the individual FAERS cases to population-based electronic healthcare data.Methods We queried FAERS for all cases of CSVV associated with DOACs from U.S. approval date of each DOAC through March 16, 2018. Within the Sentinel System, we identified incident CSVV cases using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes among adults aged >= 30 years who received a DOAC in the prior 90 days between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2018. We excluded patients with evidence of select autoimmune diagnoses in the 183 days prior to their CSVV diagnoses and reported patient characteristics in the 183-day period prior to CSVV diagnoses.Results In FAERS, we identified 50 cases of CSVV reported with rivaroxaban (n=26), apixaban (n=14), dabigatran (n=9), and edoxaban (n=1). Approximately 50% of the cases reported time to onset within 10 days after DOAC exposure. When specified, the predominant type of CSVV reported was leukocytoclastic vasculitis (n=31), followed by Henoch-Schonlein purpura (n=4). Hospitalization occurred in most of the cases (n=37). Switching of the offending agent after the development of CSVV was reported (n=26). Three rivaroxaban (n=3) cases and one dabigatran case (n=1) reported positive rechallenge. In the Sentinel system, we identified 3659 CSVV cases with prior DOAC exposure, with 85% of events occurring within 10 days.Conclusions The assessment of FAERS cases, combined with the temporal clustering of the Sentinel System cases suggest a possible causal relationship of DOACs and CSVV. Future efforts should characterize the risk of CSVV among the various DOAC users.

TI  - Use of Local Climate Zones to investigate surface urban heat islands in Texas
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) are a key topic in urban climate studies. However, systematic criteria for UHI comparisons were lacking prior to 2012, when the concept of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) was introduced. By relating remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) to LCZs, we explored the applicability of LCZs in surface urban heat island (SUHI) investigations and compared the LST variation within and among LCZs for the Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan areas in Texas, United States. Landsat 8 images from one summer and one winter day in 2015 were used to obtain LSTs to measure and model SUHIs. LCZs that were characterized by different land covers had the greatest LST variations, and LCZs that were further characterized by various urban morphological properties (including building density and height of roughness) also showed significant LST differences. Moreover, LCZ 9 (sparsely built), LCZ 10 (heavy industry), LCZ D (low plants), LCZ E (bare rock or paved), and LCZ F (bare soil or sand) tended to contribute to contradictory heating/cooling effects in different metropolitan areas, primarily due to the spatial arrangement and geographic locations of LCZs. The close association between LCZs and LST demonstrates that LCZs are valuable for comparative analysis of the SUHI phenomenon between different cities and can be helpful for examination of the evolution of SUHIs over time. Our findings further suggest that understanding the spatial distribution of LCZs can benefit the development of mitigation strategies for SUHIs.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Supervised Image Classification Using UAV Images for Forest Areas Classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based remote sensing is increasing rapidly due to their advanced accessibility, capability for fast and easy deployment, capability for miniaturization of sensors and efficient collection of remotely-sensed data from relatively low altitudes. Recently, UAV data sets have been found to be quite useful for forest feature identification due to their relatively high spatial resolution. Several machine learning algorithms have been broadly used for remotely-sensed image classification. In remote sensing image classification, deep learning based methods can be considered quite effective techniques as they have achieved promising results. In this study, we have used deep learning based supervised image classification algorithm and images collected using UAV for classification of forest areas. The deep learning algorithm stacked Auto-encoder has been found to have tremendous potential regarding image classification and the assessment of forest coverage area. Our experimental results show that deep learning method provides better accuracy compared to other machine learning algorithms. Cross-validation showed that the overall accuracy of the deep learning method is about 93%. This study highlights the essential role that UAV observations and deep learning could play in the planning and management of forest areas which are often under the threat of deforestation and forest encroachment.

TI  - Quantifying sources of Brazil's CH<sub>4</sub> emissions between 2010 and 2018 from satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's CH4 emissions over the period 2010-2018 were derived for the three main sectors of activity: anthropogenic, wetland and biomass burning. Our inverse modelling estimates were derived from GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) satellite measurements of XCH4 combined with surface data from Ragged Point, Barbados, and the high-resolution regional atmospheric transport model NAME (Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment). We find that Brazil's mean emissions over 2010-2018 are 33.6 +/- 3.6Tgyr(-1), which are comprised of 19.0 +/- 2.6Tgyr(-1) from anthropogenic (primarily related to agriculture and waste), 13.0 +/- 1.9Tgyr(-1) from wetlands and 1.7 +/- 0.3Tgyr(-1) from biomass burning sources. In addition, between the 2011-2013 and 2014-2018 periods, Brazil's mean emissions rose by 6.9 +/- 5.3Tgyr(-1) and this increase may have contributed to the accelerated global methane growth rate observed during the latter period. We find that wetland emissions from the western Amazon increased during the start of the 2015-2016 El Nino by 3.7 +/- 2.7Tgyr(-1) and this is likely driven by increased surface temperatures. We also find that our estimates of anthropogenic emissions are consistent with those reported by Brazil to the United Framework Convention on Climate Change. We show that satellite data are beneficial for constraining national-scale CH4 emissions, and, through a series of sensitivity studies and validation experiments using data not assimilated in the inversion, we demonstrate that (a) calibrated ground-based data are important to include alongside satellite data in a regional inversion and that (b) inversions must account for any offsets between the two data streams and their representations by models.

TI  - Modeling the effects of multiple exposures with unknown group memberships: a Bayesian latent variable approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a Bayesian latent variable model to allow estimation of the covariate-adjusted relationships between an outcome and a small number of latent exposure variables, using data from multiple observed exposures. Each latent variable is assumed to be represented by multiple exposures, where membership of the observed exposures to latent groups is unknown. Our model assumes that one measured exposure variable can be considered as a sentinel marker for each latent variable, while membership of the other measured exposures is estimated using MCMC sampling based on a classical measurement error model framework. We illustrate our model using data on multiple cytokines and birth weight from the Seychelles Child Development Study, and evaluate the performance of our model in a simulation study. Classification of cytokines into Th1 and Th2 cytokine classes in the Seychelles study revealed some differences from standard Th1/Th2 classifications. In simulations, our model correctly classified measured exposures into latent groups, and estimated model parameters with little bias and with coverage that was similar to the oracle model.

TI  - Regional Nodal Recurrence after Treatment for Breast Cancer
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Regional nodal recurrence (RNR) after breast cancer treatment is historically rare but associated with worse survival outcomes. The management of primary breast cancer has changed significantly, with less completion axillary dissection (ALND) and increased use of genomic testing, neoadjuvant therapy, and regional nodal irradiation. This review examines the incidence, risk factors, presentation, treatment, and prognosis of RNR in the context of modern breast cancer treatment. Recent Findings The rate of RNR recurrence is low (< 3%) in modern studies. Tumor biology and nodal burden play an important role in both risk of RNR and outcome. Combined locoregional and systemic therapy appears to provide the best outcome in the absence of systemic recurrence. Chemotherapy provides a survival benefit in estrogen receptor-negative patients only. RNR remains rare despite decreased ALND for node-positive disease. Treatment planning should be individualized based on tumor biology, prior treatment, and site and extent of recurrence.

TI  - Aerosol properties in the atmosphere of Natal/Brazil measured by an AERONET Sun-photometer
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed data measured by a Sun-photometer of the RIMA-AERONET network with the purpose to characterize the aerosol properties in the atmosphere over Natal, state capital of Rio Grande do Norte, at the coast of Northeast Brazil. Aerosol Optical Depth, Angstrom Exponent, Volume Size Distribution, Single Scattering Albedo, Complex Refractive Index, Asymmetry Factor, and Precipitable Water were analyzed from August 2017 to March 2018. In addition, MODIS and CALIOP observations, local Lidar measurements, and modeled backward trajectories were analyzed in a case study on February 9, 2018, that consistently confirmed the identification of a persistent aerosol layer below 4 km agl. Aerosols present in the atmosphere of Natal showed monthly mean Aerosol Optical Depth at 500 nm below 0.15 (similar to 75%), monthly means of the Angstrom Exponent at 440-670 nm between 0.30 and 0.70 (similar to 69%), bimodal Volume Size Distribution is dominantly coarse mode, Single Scattering Albedo at 440 nm is 0.80, Refractive Index - Real Part around 1.50, Refractive Index - Imaginary Part ranging from 0.01 to 0.04, and the Asymmetry Factor ranged from 0.73 to 0.80. The aerosol typing during the measurement period showed that atmospheric aerosol over Natal is mostly composed of mixed aerosol (58.10%), marine aerosol (34.80%), mineral dust (6.30%), and biomass burning aerosols (0.80%). Backward trajectories identified that 51% of the analyzed air masses over Natal originated from the African continent.

TI  - Proposal for modified inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy derived from investigation of anatomic distribution of sentinel and metastatic nodes in vulvar cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We aimed to develop a less invasive inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) approach for vulvar cancer based on the investigation of the anatomic distribution of sentinel and metastatic nodes.Methods Patients with vulvar cancer treated by surgery between 1995 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. A seven-field method was adopted to assign the anatomic locations for lymph nodes removed via IFL or sentinel node biopsy. Only patients with nodal metastasis or sentinel nodes were included.Results A total of 102 patients with eligible data were analyzed. Nodal metastasis was confirmed in 118 groins undergoing IFL; sentinel node detection succeeded in 46 groins. The medial-inguinal field had the highest rate of nodal metastasis involvement (59.3%, 70/118) and sentinel nodes present (73.9%, 34/46). The inferior-femoral field was involved only in one groin with quadruple-field metastases. The lateral-inguinal field was not involved in any groin. Neither the lateral-inguinal nor the inferior-femoral field presented sentinel nodes.Conclusion The lateral-inguinal and inferior-femoral fields of the groins have a low risk of developing nodal metastasis. Therefore, a modified IFL preserving these fields can be established to reduce surgical morbidity without sacrificing its therapeutic effect.

TI  - Formation of the Wahiba Sand Sea in the Sultanate of Oman: implications of change in wind energy
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wahiba Sand Sea is a north-south aeolian field that occupies the northeast corner of the Sultanate of Oman. Two main phases of sand dunes are conspicuous in this dune field as revealed by satellite data, namely High Sands in the north and Low Sands in the south. They are completely different in grain color and dune morphology. Granulometric and mineralogical analyses of sediments reveal more than a single source of sand supply for the two regions. Linear dune belts cover the northern dune field and complex transverse ridges predominate at the southern area. Hourly wind data from two meteorological stations at Ibra and Masirah in the north and south of the sand sea, respectively, were collected for 11 years (Jan. 2000 to Dec. 2010) in order to calculate the seasonal and annual sand drift potential along the sides of the sand sea. Results showed that wind energy is extremely high at Masirah due to the SW summer and fall monsoons, whereas at Ibra, wind energy is very low. The drop of sand drift potential (DP) from south to north is clearly observed from analyzing sand moving winds by empirical equations. The morphology of dunes and the direction of sand drift potential suggest two dune fields in the sand sea. The current pattern of wind regime in the north is presumably different from the prevailing wind during dune formation, whereas the dunes in the south were significantly formed by the recent wind regimes. This observation implies that two connected dune fields constitute the Wahiba Sand Sea.

TI  - Groundwater recharge and water table levels modelling using remotely sensed data and cloud-computing
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological modeling is still a challenge for better management of water resources since most of the established models are based on point data. The advent, improvement and popularization of remote sensing has brought new perspectives to modelers, allowing access to reliable and representative data over vast areas. However, several tools are still under-explored and actually used in the water resources planning and decision-making process, especially groundwater, which is a hidden resource. The objective of this work was to contribute to groundwater dynamics comprehension assessing the suitability of using remote sensing data in the water-budget equation for estimating groundwater recharge (GWR) and its impact at water table depths (WTD) in a representative Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) outcrop area. The GAS is the largest transboundary groundwater reservoir in South America, yet recharge in the GAS outcrop zones is one of the least known hydrological variables. The remotely sensed WTD model was adapted from the Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) method. We used Google Earth Engine to extract time series of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and surface runoff from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) dataset for the Angatuba Ecological Station (EEcA), Sao Paulo State, Brazil, over 2014-2017 period. GWR and WTD were modeled in eight groundwater monitoring wells. Bias analysis of precipitation data from FLDAS were perfomed using rain gauge data (2000-2018). Two GWR scenarios (S1 and S2) were assessed as well as the impact of the specific yield values (Sy\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${S}_{\mathrm{y}}$$\end{document}) in the model outputs. In C1 GWR ranged from 10.8% to 19.69% of rain gauge, although in C2 GWR ranged from 0.9 to 13%. The WTD model showed RMSE values ranging from 0.36 to 1.12 m, showing better results in the shallow wells than the deeper ones. These results are useful for future studies on assessing groundwater recharge in the GAS outcrop zones. This remotely sensed approach can be reproduced in regions where data are scarce or nonexistent.

TI  - Meta-analysis Comparing Fluorescence Imaging with Radioisotope and Blue Dye-Guided Sentinel Node Identification for Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Conventional methods for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are fraught with complications such as allergic reactions, skin tattooing, radiation, and limitations on infrastructure. A novel technique has been developed for lymphatic mapping utilizing fluorescence imaging. This meta-analysis aims to compare the gold standard blue dye and radioisotope (BD-RI) technique with fluorescence-guided SLNB using indocyanine green (ICG). Methods This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019129224). The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched using the Medical Subject Heading (MESH) terms 'Surgery' AND 'Lymph node' AND 'Near infrared fluorescence' AND 'Indocyanine green'. Studies containing raw data on the sentinel node identification rate in breast cancer surgery were included. A heterogeneity test (using Cochran's Q) determined the use of fixed- or random-effects models for pooled odds ratios (OR). Results Overall, 1748 studies were screened, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. ICG was equivalent to radioisotope (RI) at sentinel node identification (OR 2.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-19.08, p 0.05) but superior to blue dye (BD) (OR 9.07, 95% CI 6.73-12.23, p 0.05). Furthermore, ICG was superior to the gold standard BD-RI technique (OR 4.22, 95% CI 2.17-8.20, p 0.001). Conclusion Fluorescence imaging for axillary sentinel node identification with ICG is equivalent to the single technique using RI, and superior to the dual technique (RI-BD) and single technique with BD. Hospitals using RI and/or BD could consider changing their practice to ICG given the comparable efficacy and improved safety profile, as well as the lesser burden on hospital infrastructure.

TI  - Explaining the Limitations of Agricultural Intensification Initiatives in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines why cacao intensification initiatives have failed to significantly increase smallholder yields, improve livelihoods, or slow the pace of land use and cover change in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. I first draw on land use surveys, household surveys, and remotely sensed data (1972-2015) to show how most households across four study villages are transitioning away from cacao amid sustained declines in yields and accelerating forest cover loss for non-cacao commodities. I then combine secondary data and in-depth interviews to show how cacao intensification initiatives have remained disconnected from the power and resource access relations necessitating smallholder livelihood movement away from cacao. Such relations include the dynamics of supply chain concentration, land control, and inequitable access to land and land-based livelihood opportunity that are deteriorating the economics of cacao production and informing smallholders' growing reliance on off-farm, extra-local work. Findings presented here illustrate the tensions between these ongoing livelihood shifts and the full-time farming focus required to successfully enhance yields. They also reiterate the limitations of any approach to agricultural sustainability that remains narrowly production or commodity-centric.

TI  - Application of Polarimetric-SAR Decompositions on RADARSAT-2 Fine Quad-Pol Images to Enhance the Performances of Ships Detection Algorithms
T2  - SENSING AND IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of vessels is an important tool for ship safety and security at sea. In this work, we are interested in improving ships detection using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To develop the appropriate method, different processing techniques are applied on Pol-SAR images such as fusion and polarimetric decompositions and we use adaptive threshold detectors to assess the performances of the processing techniques. The data exploited in this work were acquired on a port area of the city of Vancouver by using RADARSAT-2 satellite. In this paper it is shown first that when exploiting single polarization, the HH channel provides the highest score of detection probability (PD) of 87.2% for a false alarm probability (PFA) of 0.05%, and this while using the cell averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector. The result is obtained comparatively with other polarizations (HV, VV) and detection algorithms. Second, the fusion of polarimetric channels achieves its best performances with the CA-CFAR detector, comparatively with the two parameters (2P)-CFAR and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Third, we find that among the conventional polarimetric techniques, the singular value decomposition (SVD) combined with CA-CFAR detector gives the best results and achieves a detection probability of 91% for a false alarm of 0.05%. This result was obtained by comparing the performances of other combinations of decompositions (Pauli, Freeman, Yamaguchi), fusion and ships detection algorithms. In this paper, we obtain with the proposed approach an increase of 3.8% in detection probability for false alarm probability of 0.05%.

TI  - A new map of glacigenic features and glacial landsystems in central mainland Nunavut, Canada
T2  - BOREAS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new digital map of glacial geomorphic features and interpreted glacial landsystems was produced for an area covering similar to 415 000 km(2) in the Keewatin Sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) in Nunavut. The map integrates information from previous surficial geology maps and >14 000 field stations, and is significantly improved by the detailed inventory of similar to 152 000 glacigenic features using high-resolution ArcticDEM data and Landsat 8 imagery. From this, we identify and map coherent patterns of landform development (landsystems) between the Manitoba border and the Arctic coast, many of which are entirely new and others that are significantly modified or updated. In particular, we recognize six separate ice streams, including one probable remnant ice stream, and we delineate numerous palimpsest streamlined landscapes with associated ice-flow trends and relative ages. A continuum of relict terrains with varying basal ice thermal conditions is mapped for the first time in the ice divide migration zone between Baker Lake and Wager Bay. In addition, deglacial cold-based retreat terrains and preserved warm-based landscapes unaffected by younger glacial events have been identified. These new georeferenced, multi-scale data sets and interpreted glacial landsystems provide a comprehensive framework to strengthen reconstructions of the glacial history and dynamics of one of the largest ice domes of the LIS, identify distinct glacial sediment transport paths for applications to mineral exploration, and test numerical modelling of the LIS in support of climate change studies and long-term evolution of modern ice sheets.

TI  - Hydrological and archaeological studies to detect the deterioration of Edfu temple in Upper Egypt due to environmental changes during the last five decades
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeological sites in Upper Egypt, especially Edfu Temple, are considered a wealth of human civilization and are irreplaceable. Deterioration of archaeological sites due to environmental changes in Edfu city include disintegration and exfoliation of stones, dissolution of building materials, loss of moral paintings, crystallization of salts in walls and columns, stone bleeding, destruction of wall paintings and texts, decreasing of durability of monumental stones, and discolouring. Recently, the archaeological field has received a lot of interest from Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users to observe the impact of environmental changes on archaeological sites during long periods. CORONA, LANDSAT, and SENTINEL-2A satellite images are our tools in detecting the changes around the study area and creating innovative solutions. Results from the analysis conducted suggest that most of the environmental changes in the study area are caused by uncontrolled urban sprawling and rising groundwater levels due to agricultural and urban expansion.The proximity of agricultural lands to archaeological areas has also affected the rise in groundwater levels. This has also played an important role in the transfer of chemical contaminants with the leaking water of soil to these archaeological sites, resulting in the growth of salt crystals. In this research, the environmental hazards and their effects are being observed for the archaeological sites of Edfu city (Upper Egypt). A comprehensive analysis has been conducted for the Horus Temple considering its building material, soil characteristics and environmental setting. Finally, we have created some models to protect the archaeological sites from environmental changes by the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques.

TI  - Epidemiology of human adenovirus associated with respiratory infection in southern Brazil
T2  - REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are associated with respiratory infection in the human population worldwide, but HAdV is underreported and less studied than other respiratory viruses. We investigated HAdV in patients with respiratory infection in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, between 2004 and 2018. The frequency and seasonality of HAdV, clinical symptoms and underlying diseases were analysed. Respiratory samples from outpatients with acute respiratory illness (ARI) who attended sentinel units and from inpatients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) were collected for HAdV detection by immunofluorescence assay; demographic and clinical data were analysed. In total, 43,514 cases of respiratory infection were analysed, of which 8,901 were ARI (20.5%), and 34,613 (79.5%) were SARI. Respiratory viruses were detected in 35.8% of the cases. The frequency of HAdV in relation to respiratory viruses was 2.8%. HAdV circulated year-round, with higher frequency during winter and early spring; increases in the average monthly temperature were associated with decreases in HAdV infections (p = 0.013). Most hospitalized patients with HAdV were male (p = 0.003). HAdV infection showed association with age (p < 0.001), and children between 1 and 5 years old accounted for 30.8% of the outpatients, whereas among cases of SARI, 88.2% were paediatric patients. Among inpatients with HAdV, 3% died, and of these, the majority had at least one underlying condition, such as cardiopathy and immunosuppression. HAdV infection of the respiratory tract causes morbidity and mortality, and individuals with heart diseases and the immunocompromised are at higher risk of fatality.

TI  - Remote sensing enabled essential biodiversity variables for biodiversity assessment and monitoring: technological advancement and potentials
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The strong contribution of remote sensing has led to the development of the concept of the Remote Sensing enabled Essential Biodiversity Variables which represents a set of variables that can be monitored from space. This work synthesizes current state of research and technological development in use of remote sensing enabled essential biodiversity variables. The issue of scale, satellite observation requirements and status of remote sensing have been discussed in the context of monitoring of community composition, plant functional types, vegetation structure, canopy diversity, targeted animal groups, fragmentation, disturbances and as an input for biodiversity modelling, and Earth Observations based variables. This work highlighted existing approaches for addressing community level biodiversity and discusses in the context of Earth Observations as which are key components for biodiversity monitoring strategy. Biodiversity monitoring could be improved by using new satellite sensors and the synergy of remotely sensed data from multiple sensors which are providing hyperspatial, hyperspectral and hypertemporal observations. The use of remote sensing for operational monitoring of biodiversity is still under development as existing approaches and techniques have not holistically addressed the metrics of essential biodiversity variables.

TI  - Assessment of Coringa Mangrove shoreline migration using geospatial techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coringa Mangroves in the Kakinada Bay have evolved as the second-largest mangroves in the East Coast of India over the last century. The Coringa Mangrove shoreline has accreted considerably in the past decades as observed from the satellite imageries, adding value to the natural biodiversity of flora and fauna. This study is focused on quantifying the long term changes of Coringa mangrove shoreline using the Landsat imageries for years 1977, 1988, 2000, and 2013 using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. For a mangrove shoreline length of 20.5 km, 41 transects were cast at an interval of 500 m for calculating the change and their migration distance using three statistical methods, namely End Point Rate (EPR), Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR). Results showed that there was considerable growth of mangroves in the bay leading to the seaward migration of the mangrove shoreline from the year 1977-2013. The study observed the difference in the mangrove shoreline migration dynamics in the South-eastern (near the bottom of the spit) and the western part of the Kakinada Bay. The calculated average degradation rate due to erosion is -5.19 m.yr(-1) and the average accretion rate leading to their growth is 14.83 m.yr(-1) for all transects of the 20.5 km mangrove shoreline stretch during this period. The results hold importance as they help in identifying the regions prone to mangrove degradation and enable management planning for the protection of the eroding stretch of the mangrove shoreline.

TI  - Improvements of on-orbit characterization of Terra MODIS short-wave infrared spectral bands out-of-band responses
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands (5 to 7, 26) of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which are colocated with the midwave infrared bands (20 to 25) on the short- and mid-wave infrared focal plane assembly, have a known issue related to 5.3-mu m out-of-band (OOB) thermal leak and electronic crosstalk that was identified prelaunch. As a result, a crosstalk correction algorithm was designed and implemented in the MODIS level 1B (L1B) calibration. Shortly after the Terra launch, extensive efforts were undertaken to help characterize and mitigate the impact due to the OOB response and crosstalk on the SWIR on-orbit calibration and, consequently, the associated L1B data products. In addition, special night-time-day-mode operations have been regularly scheduled to derive the crosstalk correction coefficients. Since MODIS does not have a spectral band centered at 5.3 mu m, its band 28 (7.325 pm) was chosen as the surrogate sending band to simulate the OOB radiances at 5.3 mu m. This was largely based on the measurements from the MODIS Airborne Simulator spectrometer field campaigns in the early months after the Terra launch. In the case of Aqua MODIS, the magnitude of the SWIR crosstalk was much smaller and band 25 (4.52 mu m) was found to be more effective as the sending band for the crosstalk correction. In recent years, the Terra MODIS photovoltaic (PV) long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands (27 to 30) electronic crosstalk has increased considerably, especially after the spacecraft safe-mode event occurred in February 2016. This accentuated degradation in the PV LWIR performance has also impacted the performance of the SWIR crosstalk correction and thus its calibration and data quality. We examine the use of band 25 as the sending band for the Terra MODIS SWIR crosstalk correction and compare its performance with that based on band 28 as the sending band. Results indicate an improvement of on-orbit gain stability for the SWIR calibration and reduced detector to detector and subframe to subframe striping in the calibrated L1B imagery, especially during the period when the PV LWIR electronic crosstalk has become more severe. This approach has been implemented in the forward production of Terra MODIS Collection 6 and Collection 6.1, starting from July 2019, and is planned to be used for the future reprocessing of MODIS L1B and to help improve the mission-long reflectance calibration and trending stability of the SWIR bands.

TI  - Characterizing the spatial and temporal variation of the land surface temperature hotspots in Wuhan from a local scale
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from space-borne Thermal-infrared (TIR) sensors is a key parameter of urban climate studies. Current studies are inefficient to capture the spatial and temporal variations of LST for only one snapshot adopted at one time. Focusing on the characterization of the spatial and temporal of LST variations at local scales, the latent patterns, and morphological characteristics are extracted in this study. Technically, sixteen MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) eight-day synthesized LST products (MYD11A2) in 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017 are employed. First, the non-parametric Multi-Task Gaussian Process Model (MTGP) is used to extract the smooth and continuous Latent LST (LLST) patterns using one LST subset and its temporally adjacent images. Second, the Multi-Scale Shape Index (MSSI) is then applied to quantify the morphological characteristics at the optimal scale. Then, the LLST patterns and MSSI maps are clustered into multiple spatial categories. The specific clusters with the highest LLST and MSSI values are considered as local LLST hotspots. The Hotspots Weighted Mean Center (HSWMC) and standard deviation ellipse are adopted to further investigate the spatiotemporal change of hotspots orientation, direction, and trajectories. Results revealed that Impervious Surfaces (IS) composition is the most significant external forcing of local LST anomalies. The configuration factors (e.g., shape index, aggregation index) also have a noticeable local warming effect. This study represents a latent pattern and morphology-based framework for LST hotspots spatial and temporal variations characterization, catering to the zoning and grading strategies in urban planning.

TI  - Clinical, inflammatory, and immune differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: The World Health Organization announce that novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is pandemic worldwide on March 11, 2020. In this pandemic, cancer patients are prone to become critically ill after being infected with COVID-19 due to special immune conditions, and cannot effectively benefit from the treatment plan designed for normal people. However, only a few literatures report the differences between cancer patients and normal people after being infected with COVID-19. There is no systematic review to evaluate the clinical, inflammatory, and immune differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. The systematic review aims to summarize and analyze the clinical, inflammatory, and immune differences between them. Methods and analysis: We plan to conduct a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Several databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, VIP, WanFang) were searched for relevant eligible observational studies on COVID-19 patients with cancer published from December 2019 to September 2020. Two researchers (Y.ZY and W.PP) will independently complete search strategy formulation, literature selecting, Information extraction, data collation, and quality assessment. The primary outcome will be the clinical characteristics differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. Secondary outcomes will include immune function regulation characteristics such as T cell subset status, inflammation and other factors for COVID-19 patients with cancer. We intend to perform a meta-analysis of studies calculating odds ratio differences (Hedge g) for comparison in Forest plots and subgroup analysis after assessment of heterogeneity using I-2 statistics based on compatibility on the basis of population and outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: We will use the information from published researches with no need for ethical assessment. Our findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal according to the PRISMA guidelines. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020204417

A thermal sharpening method was employed to map the high-resolution intra-SUHI intensity (SUHII) and magnitude (SUHIM) by integrating the cokriging interpolation of Landsat 8 thermal band 10 and Quickbird datasets. Together with three area proportions (area proportion of the cooling surface/CoolAP, area proportion of the buildings/BuildAP, and area proportion of the other impervious surface/OtherAP), the mean distance between the nearest neighboring buildings (BuildDist) and the building average story number (BuildSN) were used to characterize the land parcel features. The results showed that both the composition and the design attributes of land parcels were significantly related to the intra-SUHI indicators (SUHII and SUHIM). Additionally, remarkable seasonal variations existed in the intra-SUHI indicators. The results of the partial least square regression models explained 64.6-65.2% of the variance of the SUHIIs and 63.0-63.9% of the variance of the SUHIMs on hot days and 11.70-18.90% of the variance of the SUHIIs and 11.10-15.90% of the variance of the SUHIMs on cool and chilly days, respectively. This study provided compelling evidence that for a given land parcel, when fixing the effects of BuildAP or OtherAP, high levels of CoolAP, BuildSN, and BuildDist will help create a cooling microclimate on hot days. In contrast, high-density land parcels with sparse cooling surface exhibit much higher SUHII and SUHIM levels than do low-density parcels with dominant cooling surface.

T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) pose a serious risk to patient safety and quality of care. The Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) conducts national surveillance of HAIs at sentinel acute-care hospitals across Canada. This report provides an overview of 10 years of Canadian data on the epidemiology of select device-associated HAIs.METHODS: Over 40 hospitals submitted data between 2009 and 2018 for hip and knee surgical site infections (SSIs), cerebrospinal fluid shunt SSIs, paediatric cardiac SSIs and/or central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Counts, rates, patient and hospital characteristics, as well as pathogen distributions and antimicrobial susceptibilities are presented.RESULTS: A total of 4,300 device-associated infections were reported. Central line-associated bloodstream infections were the most common device-associated HAI reported (n=2,973, 69%) and hip and knee arthroplasty infections were the most common SSIs reported (66% of SSIs). Our findings show decreasing CLABSI rates in neonatal intensive care units (4.2 to 1.9 per 1,000 line-days, p<0.0001) and decreasing knee SSI rates (0.69 to 0.30 infections per 100 surgeries, p=0.007). Rates of device-associated HAIs have remained relatively consistent over the 10-year surveillance period. Overall, 4,599 pathogens were identified from device-associated HAI; 70% of these were related to CLABSIs. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (29%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14%) were the most frequently reported pathogens. Gram-positive pathogens represented 68% of identified pathogens, gram-negative pathogens represented 22% and fungi represented 9%.CONCLUSION: Understanding the national burden of device-associated HAIs is essential for developing and maintaining benchmark rates for informing infection and prevention control and antimicrobial stewardship policies and programs.

TI  - An updated survey on the use of geospatial technologies in New Zealand's plantation forestry sector
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Geospatial technologies have developed rapidly in recent decades and can provide detailed, accurate data to support forest management. Knowledge of the uptake of geospatial technologies, as well as barriers to adoption, in New Zealand's plantation forest management sector is limited and would be beneficial to the industry. This study provides an update to the 2013 benchmark study by Morgenroth and Visser.Methods: An online survey was sent to 29 companies that own or manage plantation forests in New Zealand. The survey was split into seven sections, composed of multiple-choice and open-ended questions, on the topics of: demographic information, data portals and datasets, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, and four remote-sensing technologies. These included aerial imagery, multispectral imagery, hyperspectral imagery, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Each section included questions relating to the acquisition, application and products created from each remote-sensing technology. Questions were also included that related to the barriers preventing the uptake of technologies. To determine the progression in the uptake of these technologies the results were compared to Morgenroth and Visser's study conducted five years earlier.Results: Twenty-three companies responded to the survey and together, those companies managed approximately 1,172,000 ha (or 69% of New Zealand's 1.706 million ha plantation forest estate (NZFOA, 2018)). The size of the estates managed by individual companies ranged from 1,000 ha to 177,000 ha (quartile 1 = 19,000 ha, median = 33,000 ha, quartile 3 = 63,150 ha). All companies used GNSS receivers and acquired three-band, Red-Green-Blue, aerial imagery. Multispectral imagery, hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR data were acquired by 48%, 9% and 70% of companies, respectively. Common applications for the products derived from these technologies were forest mapping and description, harvest planning, and cutover mapping. The main barrier preventing companies from acquiring most remotely-sensed data was the lack of staff knowledge and training, though cost was the main barrier to LiDAR acquisition. The uptake of all remote-sensing technologies has increased since 2013. LiDAR had the largest progression in uptake, increasing from 17% to 70%. There has also been a change in the way companies acquired the data. Many of the companies used unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAV) to acquire aerial and multispectral imagery in 2018, while in 2013 no companies were using UAVs. ESRI ArcGIS continues to be the dominant geographic information system used by New Zealand's forest management companies (91%), though 22% of companies now use free GIS software, like QGIS or GRASS. The use of specialised software (e.g. FUSION, LAStools) for LiDAR or photogrammetric point cloud analysis increased since 2013, but most forestry companies who are processing .las files into various products (e.g. digital terrain model) are using ArcGIS.Conclusions; This study showed that there had been a progression in the uptake of geospatial technologies in the New Zealand plantation forest management sector. However, there are still barriers preventing the full utilisation of these technologies. The results suggest that the industry could benefit from investing in more training relating to geospatial technologies.

TI  - Small fires, frequent clouds, rugged terrain and no training data: a methodology to reconstruct fire history in complex landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - An automated burned area extraction routine that attempts to overcome the particular difficulties of remote sensing applications in complex landscapes is presented and tested in the mountainous region of northwest Yunnan, China. In particular, the lack of burned samples to use for training and testing, the rugged relief, the small size of fires and the constant presence of clouds during the rainy season heavily affecting the number of usable scenes within a year are addressed. The algorithm flows through five phases: creation of standardised difference vegetation indices time series; automatic extraction of multiclass training areas using adaptive z-score thresholds; Random Forests classification; Seeded Region Growing; and spatiotemporal clustering to form polygons representing fire events. A final database spanning the period 1987-2018 was created. Accuracy assessment of location and number of fire polygons using a stratified random sampling design showed satisfactory results with reduced omission and commission errors compared with global fire products in the same region (20 and 22% respectively). Mapping accuracy of single burned areas showed higher omission (27%) but reduced commission (13%) errors. This methodology takes a step forward towards the inclusion of regions characterised by small fires that are often poorly represented in impact assessments at the global scale.

TI  - Assessing spatiotemporal characteristics of native and invasive species with multi-temporal remote sensing images in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the main invasive plant species in the Yellow River Delta, Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) has been a great threat to local ecosystems, but there are few studies on the growth scale, habitat structural changes, and expansion pattern of S. alterniflora. In this study, the native and invasive species in the Yellow River Delta were examined for their spatiotemporal characteristics and succession patterns. First, multi-temporal SENTINEL-2 and LANDSAT-8 images from 2018 were selected. A random forest algorithm was used to verify the image spectral band's significance and separability to determine the native and invasive species. Then, the spatiotemporal variation of habitat structure of the species was discussed in depth from the perspective of landscape ecology. Finally, the expansion direction and expansion mode of S. alterniflora were further analyzed. The main results obtained were as follows: (a) SENTINEL-2 images with red-edge bands had obvious advantages in vegetation community extraction as compared to LANDSAT-8 images (SENTINEL-2, OA = 82.86%, kappa coefficient = 0.79; LANDSAT-8, OA = 78.77%, kappa coefficient = 0.74). (b) The expansion pattern of the S. alterniflora community became spatially continuous, more regularized, and aggregated over time. (c) The expansion in the north shore mainly faced toward the sea, and the south bank mainly faced toward the land, and this phenomenon was closely related to the sedimentation of the Yellow River Delta. Marginal and external expansion both occurred, but marginal expansion predominated. The results have important theoretical and scientific value for the environmental protection and sustainable development of the entire Yellow River Delta.

TI  - Current asymmetry and its implications for morphological changes in Vembanad Lake, the second largest wetland ecosystem in India
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flow dynamics are a key part of the physical processes that drive the sediment transport in an aquatic system, affecting depositional processes and leading to landform evolution. The current asymmetry (CA) noted in Vembanad Lake (VL), India, have a particularly strong influence on the sediment budget and thus shape its geomorphology. In the present study the Coastal Ocean Model - Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) was used to compute the lateral current asymmetries and their implications for the long-term morphological changes in VL during different tidal phases. Model results were utilised to calculate the CA using two criteria: (1) Peak flood/ebb velocities with duration, and (2) Asymmetry Index (AIDV). AIDV values suggest the prevalence of ebb dominance over the entire system except at Cherai and Vallarpadam. However, several isolated pockets were noted on the right/eastern bank (shallow depth) of the system where the peak flood velocity exceeded the ebb, favouring accretion.Contrary to the concept of ebb asymmetry, mean velocity and duration asymmetries were prevalent in the asymmetry index (AIDV); hence we adopted peak flood/ebb velocity and its duration asymmetries to improve our understanding of the sediment transport dynamics. Typical flood asymmetry was identified on the right bank and at many of the lateral stations in VL, which switched to the modified ebb asymmetry during substantial river discharge. Analysis of CA enables understanding of the process that influences selective morphological changes, as explained by the model results. This conclusion was well corroborated by results obtained over the past three decades (1973-2008) from analysis of Landsat satellite imagery. Flood/ebb dominance in VL is explicitly substantiated with regions of accretion/erosion derived from satellite imageries. A holistic approach encompassing modelling, observations, remote sensing, and GIS techniques were used to address the erosion-accretion process in VL.

TI  - The pulse of a montane ecosystem: coupling between daily cycles in solar flux, snowmelt, transpiration, groundwater, and streamflow at Sagehen Creek and Independence Creek, Sierra Nevada, USA
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water levels in streams and aquifers often exhibit daily cycles during rainless periods, reflecting daytime extraction of shallow groundwater by evapotranspiration (ET) and, during snowmelt, daytime additions of meltwater. These cycles can aid in understanding the mechanisms that couple solar forcing of ET and snowmelt to changes in streamflow. Here we analyze 3 years of 30 min solar flux, sap flow, stream stage, and groundwater level measurements at Sagehen Creek and Independence Creek, two snow-dominated headwater catchments in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Despite their sharply contrasting geological settings (most of the Independence basin is glacially scoured granodiorite, whereas Sagehen is underlain by hundreds of meters of volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits that host an extensive groundwater aquifer), both streams respond similarly to snowmelt and ET forcing. During snow-free summer periods, daily cycles in solar flux are tightly correlated with variations in sap flow, and with the rates of water level rise and fall in streams and riparian aquifers. During these periods, stream stages and riparian groundwater levels decline during the day and rebound at night. These cycles are reversed during snowmelt, with stream stages and riparian groundwater levels rising during the day in response to snowmelt inputs and falling at night as the riparian aquifer drains.Streamflow and groundwater maxima and minima (during snowmelt- and ET-dominated periods, respectively) lag the midday peak in solar flux by several hours. A simple conceptual model explains this lag: streamflows depend on riparian aquifer water levels, which integrate snowmelt inputs and ET losses over time, and thus will be phase-shifted relative to the peaks in snowmelt and evapotranspiration rates. Thus, although the lag between solar forcing and water level cycles is often interpreted as a travel-time lag, our analysis shows that it is mostly a dynamical phase lag, at least in small catchments. Furthermore, although daily cycles in streamflow have often been used to estimate ET fluxes, our simple conceptual model demonstrates that this is infeasible unless the response time of the riparian aquifer can be determined.As the snowmelt season progresses, snowmelt forcing of groundwater and streamflow weakens and evapotranspiration forcing strengthens. The relative dominance of snowmelt vs. ET can be quantified by the diel cycle index, which measures the correlation between the solar flux and the rate of rise or fall in streamflow or groundwater. When the snowpack melts out at an individual location, the local groundwater shifts abruptly from snowmelt-dominated cycles to ET-dominated cycles. Melt-out and the corresponding shift in the diel cycle index occur earlier at lower altitudes and on south-facing slopes, and streamflow integrates these transitions over the drainage network. Thus the diel cycle index in streamflow shifts gradually, beginning when the snowpack melts out near the gauging station and ending, months later, when the snowpack melts out at the top of the basin and the entire drainage network becomes dominated by ET cycles. During this long transition, snowmelt signals generated in the upper basin are gradually overprinted by ET signals generated lower down in the basin.The gradual springtime transition in the diel cycle index is mirrored in sequences of Landsat images showing the spring-time retreat of the snowpack to higher elevations and the corresponding advance of photosynthetic activity across the basin. Trends in the catchment-averaged MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) also correlate closely with the late springtime shift from snowmelt to ET cycles and with the autumn shift back toward snowmelt cycles. Seasonal changes in streamflow cycles therefore reflect catchment-scale shifts in snowpack and vegetation activity that can be seen from Earth orbit. The data and analyses presented here illustrate how streams can act as mirrors of the landscape, integrating physical and ecohydrological signals across their contributing drainage networks.

TI  - Mapping spatial variability in shoreline change hotspots from satellite data; a case study in southeast Australia
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates how a large-scale satellite-derived dataset can be used to investigate statistically robust trends in shoreline position over a 31-year period from 1987 to 2017, at a regional scale. Regional patterns of shoreline behaviour are important for resolving consistent or, alternatively, dissimilar patterns of past shoreline change. Such patterns are best explored using temporally frequent and spatially extensive datasets. Here we analyse satellite-derived shorelines to identify spatial patterns of hotspots of coastline change on the wave-exposed coast of Victoria in south-east Australia where rates of change exceed 0.5 m yr(-1). Analysis of shore-line position changes at a 50 m alongshore interval along 900 km of the 1230 km coastline reveals a number of distinct behaviours related to coastal type (rock vs sand coast), landform, shoreline orientation and/or anthropogenic drivers of change. Overall the results show that statistically significant change in shoreline position has affected only a relatively small proportion of the study region over the last 31 years; that the proportion and rate of progradational and recessional change is similar; and that change is localised but dispersed widely along the Victorian coast. Coasts located at the entrances to large tidal inlets have shown the greatest change. The association of hotspots with embayed sandy beaches and adjacent to headlands points to the importance of geological control on shoreline behaviour. Consistent with other regional scale studies of shoreline change, this study found little regional coherence in shoreline behaviour. Instead change is predominately attributed to local factors such as the geological framework of the coast, localised hydrodynamic conditions and anthropogenic influences. Collectively, these results indicate that there is strong geologic control on shoreline erosion in Victoria due to the high diversity of landforms along the coastline; and that further analysis is required to tease out the seasonal to interannual sensitivities to changes in the historical wave climate and the secondary interaction of sediment supply for headlands and hydrodynamics for tidal inlets.

TI  - DeepBedMap: a deep neural network for resolving the bed topography of Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - To resolve the bed elevation of Antarctica, we present DeepBedMap - a novel machine learning method that can produce Antarctic bed topography with adequate surface roughness from multiple remote sensing data inputs. The super-resolution deep convolutional neural network model is trained on scattered regions in Antarctica where high-resolution (250 m) ground-truth bed elevation grids are available. This model is then used to generate high-resolution bed topography in less surveyed areas. DeepBedMap improves on previous interpolation methods by not restricting itself to a low-spatial-resolution (1000 m) BEDMAP2 raster image as its prior image. It takes in additional high-spatial-resolution datasets, such as ice surface elevation, velocity and snow accumulation, to better inform the bed topography even in the absence of ice thickness data from direct ice-penetrating-radar surveys. The DeepBedMap model is based on an adapted architecture of the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network, chosen to minimize perpixel elevation errors while producing realistic topography. The final product is a four-times-upsampled (250 m) bed elevation model of Antarctica that can be used by glaciologists interested in the subglacial terrain and by ice sheet modellers wanting to run catchment- or continent-scale ice sheet model simulations. We show that DeepBedMap offers a rougher topographic profile compared to the standard bicubically interpolated BEDMAP2 and BedMachine Antarctica and envision it being used where a high-resolution bed elevation model is required.

TI  - Change-mapping of estuarine intertidal seagrass (<i>Zostera muelleri</i>) using multispectral imagery flown by remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) at Wharekawa Harbour, New Zealand
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research assesses a survey method for measuring the change in density of intertidal estuarine seagrass (Zostera muelleri) at Wharekawa Harbour, New Zealand, using an autonomous remotely piloted aircraft fitted with a narrowband multispectral camera. Image classification was modelled using the random forest classifier trained with ground observation data sourced from 63 photographed quadrat stations upon three parallel transect lines. Seagrass coverage in the georeferenced and rectified ground photography was estimated by visual interpretation on a three-tier (low, medium and high) density scale, then exact leaf area additionally calculated from digitised seagrass leaf coverage visible in rectified ground photography. Three replicate aerial surveys across four months were conducted to compare predicted change in seagrass density with actual measured change, during austral summer growth and autumn decline. Classification of the resulting image mosaic (2.5 cm pixel size) achieved up to 90-93% overall accuracy across multiple surveys when attributing density class, 93-96% accuracy for prediction of seagrass presence, and 81-91% in terms of detection of seagrass on the ground. Change-maps allow regions of growth and decline to be visualised. Correlation (r) between actual and predicted change for 48 independent test grid squares was 0.89 and 0.61 for the summer and autumn change periods respectively. Rapid visual interpretation of classification end-member classes yielded change measure-ment equivalent to that of accurately measured seagrass leaf area. The research demonstrates that RPA survey using a multispectral camera is viable for monitoring change in seagrass condition.

TI  - Photovoltaic power potential in West Africa using long-term satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses long-term historical changes in solar irradiance in West Africa (3 to 20 degrees N and 20 degrees W to 16 degrees E) and the implications for photovoltaic systems. Here, we use satellite irradiance (Surface Solar Radiation Data Set - Heliosat, Edition 2.1 - SARAH-2.1) and temperature data from a reanalysis (ERA5) to derive photovoltaic yields. Based on 35 years of data (1983-2017), the temporal and regional variability as well as long-term trends in global and direct horizontal irradiance are analyzed. Furthermore, a detailed time series analysis is undertaken at four locations. According to the high spatial resolution SARAH-2.1 data record (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees), solar irradiance is largest (up to a 300Wm(-2) daily average) in the Sahara and the Sahel zone with a positive trend (up to 5 W m(-2) per decade) and a lower temporal variability (< 75 W m(-2) between 1983 and 2017 for daily averages). In contrast, the solar irradiance is lower in southern West Africa (between 200 W m-(2) and 250 W m(-2)) with a negative trend (up to 5 W m 2 per decade) and a higher temporal variability (up to 150 W m(-2)). The positive trend in the north is mostly connected to the dry season, whereas the negative trend in the south occurs during the wet season. Both trends show 95% significance. Photovoltaic (PV) yields show a strong meridional gradient with the lowest values of around 4 kWh kWp(-1) in southern West Africa and values of more than 5.5 kWh kWp(-1) in the Sahara and Sahel zone.

TI  - An evaluation of apparent color of seawater based on the in-situ and satellite-derived Forel-Ule color scale
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Apparent color of seawater is a key variable that can be used to describe the optical properties of seawater and plays a crucial role in understanding surface marine ecosystems and processes. The apparent color of seawater traditionally determined from a hand-held Forel-Ule color comparator scale can now be derived from satellite ocean color end-product water leaving radiance or remote sensing reflectance. However, this retrieval algorithm has not been verified in China's offshore waters, which are some of the most turbid waters in the world. Thus, the precision of the satellite-derived Forel-Ule index (FUIsatellite) is unknown in this area. In this paper, FUIsatellite values is evaluated using in-situ FUI (FUIinsitu) observations obtained in the first large-scale systematic survey on the marine environment in China, and the results show that there is a generally good agreement (r = 0.75, N = 2390, p = 0.00, MAD = 2.61, MUPD = 35.02%) between them. Uncertainties of satellite derivation along the coast of the East China Sea (ECS) and the Beibu Gulf are identified. Moreover, the probability of uncertainties of FUIsatellite as a function of FUIinsitu can be well fitted by Gaussian function (r(2) = 0.99). Our study also demon-strates that the radial basis function, which uses linear function as the basis function, is the optimal method on the spatial interpolation of FUIinsitu. The FUIsatellite is still in good agreement with the interpolated FUIinsitu field (r = 0.77, N = 265302, p = 0.00, MAD = 1.73, MUPD = 36.06%), which reveals that remote sensing techniques could be an integral tool for operational environmental monitoring of water quality in China's offshore waters.

TI  - Tracing devastating fires in Portugal to a snow archive in the Swiss Alps: a case study
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent large wildfires, such as those in Portugal in 2017, have devastating impacts on societies, economy, ecosystems and environments. However, wildfires are a natural phenomenon, which has been exacerbated by land use during the past millennia. Ice cores are one of the archives preserving information on fire occurrences over these timescales. A difficulty is that emission sensitivity of ice cores is often unknown, which constitutes a source of uncertainty in the interpretation of such archives. Information from specific and well-documented case studies is therefore useful to better understand the spatial representation of ice-core burning records. The wildfires near Pedrogao Grande in central Portugal in 2017 provided a test bed to link a fire event to its footprint left in a high-alpine snowpack considered a surrogate for high-alpine ice-core sites. Here, we (1) analysed black carbon (BC) and microscopic charcoal particles deposited in the snowpack close to the high-alpine research station Jungfraujoch in the Swiss Alps; (2) calculated backward trajectories based on ERA-Interim reanalysis data and simulated the transport of these carbonaceous particles using a global aerosol-climate model; and (3) analysed the fire spread, its spatial and temporal extent, and its intensity with remote-sensing (e.g. MODIS) Active Fire and Burned Area products. According to modelled emissions of the FINN v1.6 database, the fire emitted a total amount of 203.5 t BC from a total burned area of 501 km(2) as observed on the basis of satellite fire products. Backward trajectories unambiguously linked a peak of atmospheric-equivalent BC observed at the Jungfraujoch research station on 22 June - with elevated levels until 25 June - with the highly intensive fires in Portugal. The atmospheric signal is in correspondence with an outstanding peak in microscopic charcoal observed in the snow layer, depositing nearly as many charcoal particles as during an average year in other ice archives. In contrast to charcoal, the amount of atmospheric BC deposited during the fire episode was minor due to a lack of precipitation. Simulations with a global aerosol-climate model suggest that the observed microscopic charcoal particles originated from the fires in Portugal and that their contribution to the BC signal in snow was negligible. Our study revealed that microscopic charcoal can be transported over long distances (1500 km) and that snow and ice archives are much more sensitive to distant events than sedimentary archives, for which the signal is dominated by local fires. The findings are important for future ice-core studies as they document that, for BC as a fire tracer, the signal preservation depends on precipitation. Single events, like this example, might not be preserved due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.

TI  - Superpixel-based time-series reconstruction for optical images incorporating SAR data using autoencoder networks
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series reconstruction for cloud/shadow-covered optical satellite images has great significance for enhancing the data availability and temporal change analysis. In this study, we proposed a superpixel-based prediction transformation-fusion (SPTF) time-series reconstruction method for cloud/shadow-covered optical images. Central to this approach is the incorporation between intrinsic tendency from multi-temporal optical images and sequential transformation information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, through autoencoder networks (AE). First, a modified superpixel algorithm was applied on multi-temporal optical images with their manually delineated cloud/shadow masks to generate superpixels. Second, multi-temporal optical images and SAR data were overlaid onto superpixels to produce superpixel-wise time-series curves with missing values. Third, these superpixel-wise time series were clustered by an AE-LSTM (long short-term memory) unsupervised method into multiple clusters (searching similar superpixels). Four, for each superpixel-wise cluster, a prediction-transformation-based reconstruction model was established to restore missing values in optical time series. Finally, reconstructed data were merged with cloud-free regions to produce cloud-free time-series images. The proposed method was verified on two datasets of multi-temporal cloud/shadow-covered Landsat OLI images and Sentinel-1A SAR data. The reconstruction results, showing an improvement of greater than 20% in normalized mean square error compared to three state-of-the-art methods (including a spatially and temporally weighted regression method, a spectral-temporal patch-based method, and a patch-based contextualized AE method), demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in time-series reconstruction for multi-temporal optical images.

TI  - Plastics waste identification in river ecosystems by multispectral proximal sensing: a preliminary methodology study
T2  - WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A considerable amount of the plastics produced around the world is now dispersed throughout the environment, and in particular in aquatic ecosystems. This can have damaging consequences for plants, animals and human beings. This study investigates some approaches for detection and monitoring of plastics waste in river habitats through multispectral image classification. The data are acquired using a proximity sensor in the electromagnetic spectrum range that includes the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared bands, as for the WorldView-2 satellite. The in-depth analysis of the spectral signatures obtained shows typical plastics trends and reflectance values in the near infrared bands. Different classification methods were compared to test their effectiveness for the isolation of plastics samples dispersed in a river habitat. This project represents the first step within a wider research programme, with the aim to define a new approach for future river pollution monitoring.

TI  - Role of Unmanned Aerial Systems for Natural Resource Management
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Natural resources management (NRM) is an important application of satellite remote sensing. The need for cost-effective, accurate, demand-based high-resolution data for natural resources management is growing in developing countries. However, the higher cost of satellite data, limitations of temporal and spatial resolution are the biggest hurdle for continuous monitoring of the dynamics of natural resources, i.e. agriculture, forest, water and land resources. Due to these limitations, unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based remote sensing studies for natural resource management are rapidly growing, as it offers several advantages, i.e. flexibility, efficiency, easy operation, higher spatial resolution, multispectral resolution and cost-effectiveness over high-resolution satellite data. The role of UAS is optimal in remote areas for mapping and monitoring. The constantly improving technology of UAS has led to several advantages over satellite data, however; some challenges remain the same as the main focus of UAS developers is to reduce the cost and payload weight. The challenges include poor radiometric and geometric performance, small payload, large dataset, data processing, regulation and restrictions. The application of UAS is still in its initial phase; however, its ability to produce application-specific data at relatively lower cost has proved that UAS has a great potential for natural resources management. Based on the existing literature, this study is an attempt to evaluate the current status of the use of UAS for NRM along with its major strength, opportunity, weakness, threats and future perspective.

TI  - Mapping the permafrost stability on the Tibetan Plateau for 2005-2015
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Data scarcity is a major obstacle for high-resolution mapping of permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study produces a new permafrost stability distribution map for the 2010s (2005-2015) derived from the predicted mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at a depth of zero annual amplitude (10-25 m) by integrating remotely sensed freezing degree-days and thawing degree-days, snow cover days, leaf area index, soil bulk density, high-accuracy soil moisture data, and in situ MAGT measurements from 237 boreholes on the TP by using an ensemble learning method that employs a support vector regression model based on distance-blocked resampled training data with 200 repetitions. Validation of the new permafrost map indicates that it is probably the most accurate of all currently available maps. This map shows that the total area of permafrost on the TP, excluding glaciers and lakes, is approximately 115.02 (105.47-129.59)x10(4) km(2). The areas corresponding to the very stable, stable, semi-stable, transitional, and unstable types are 0.86x10(4), 9.62x10(4), 38.45x10(4), 42.29x10(4), and 23.80x10(4) km(2), respectively. This new map is of fundamental importance for engineering planning and design, ecosystem management, and evaluation of the permafrost change in the future on the TP as a baseline.

TI  - On Time-Series InSAR by SA-SVR Algorithm: Prediction and Analysis of Mining Subsidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the increasingly serious geological disasters caused by underground mining in the Hancheng mining area in China and the existing problems with mining subsidence prediction models, this article uses the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology to process 109 Sentinel-1A images of this mining area from December 2015 to February 2020. The results show that there are three subsidences: one in Donganshang, one in south of Zhuyuan village, and one in Shandizhaizi village. In the basin, the maximum annual average subsidence rate is 300 mm/a, and the maximum cumulative subsidence is 1000 mm. The SBAS-InSAR results are compared with Global Positioning System (GPS) observation results, and the correlation coefficient is 74%. Finally, a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is used to estimate the optimal parameters of a support vector regression (SVR) prediction model, which is applied for mining subsidence prediction. The prediction results are compared with the results of SVR and the GM (1, 1). The minimum value of the coefficient of determination for prediction with SA-SVR model is 0.57, which is significantly better than that those of the other two prediction methods. The results indicate that the proposed prediction model offers high subsidence prediction accuracy and fully meets the requirements of engineering applications.

TI  - Measuring Urban Land Use Change and Sprawl Using Geospatial Techniques: A Study on Purulia Municipality, West Bengal, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth, desire for more income, transportation facilities and rural to urban migration have increased the rate of urbanisation and complicated its pattern over Purulia district, West Bengal, India. This situation obstructs the organised and planned urban development provoking the sprawl like phenomenon within the urban locality. As the district belongs to a socio-economic deprived region, most of the researchers mainly concentrate on the physical and socio-economic problems of the district neglecting the scenario of urbanisation over the district. So, the present study is an attempt to assess the urban growth modelling over the Purulia Municipality which is a dominating city in terms of population and urban functions in the district. Images from Landsat-5 Thematic mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were used to prepare land use land cover (LULC) maps of 1998, 2008 and 2018. Supervised classification with maximum likelihood classifier was applied. Direction-based relative Shannon's entropy model has been used for quantification of urban expansion in the last 20 years. The LULC changing condition shows that 65.41% vegetation coverage, 47.63% water body, 31.55% bare land and 10.79% agricultural land have been diminished within this time due to increasing demand for artificial man-made land. Besides, the built-up area has grown by 122% within the 20 years which proved that urban physical expansion is going on over the municipality. The results show that the pattern of urban growth of this municipality is a compact one, and the built-up areas are mostly oriented towards North, North-east, East, South-east and South directions than the other quadrants. Besides, the percentage of built-up area has been rapidly decreasing from CBD to periphery area due to increasing distance. For the planning purpose of balance development in a socio-economic deprived region like Purulia district, the outcomes of this study can best be utilised by the local planners and administrators.

TI  - Clinical characteristics associated with sentinel headache in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms
T2  - INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveSentinel headache (SH) is considered as a signal of the impending rupture of an aneurysm. However, it is difficult to diagnose whether the headaches of patients are associated with unstable aneurysms. Therefore, there is some doubt about the importance of headaches in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). This study was performed to explore the existence and clinical characteristics of SH associated with aneurysms.MethodsThirty-six patients with a single UIA were collected in this study. Patients were symptomatically categorized into two groups: SH and non-SH. The PHASES scores and patient and aneurysm characteristics were analyzed. Two independent MRI experts who were blinded to the patients' clinical history conducted the analysis of the SWI results.ResultsThere were 15 patients with sentinel headache. No significant difference was found in patient's basic information and history. The SH group had a higher PHASES score than the non-SH group (P < 0.05). In univariable analysis, abnormal SWI signals were significantly more frequent in the SH group (P < 0.01) and the inflow angle was significantly lower in the non-SH group (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, abnormal signals in SWI were an independent factor associated with SH (P < 0.01).ConclusionsSH exists in patients with UIAs and may indicate a high risk of aneurysm rupture. Abnormal signals on SWI may serve as a clinical feature to identify aneurysm-related SH and be helpful for the formulation of therapeutic strategy. Aneurysm geometry may also be related to SH but need further studies in the future.

TI  - Penguins and Seals Transport Limiting Nutrients Between Offshore Pelagic and Coastal Regions of Antarctica Under Changing Sea Ice
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large animals such as sea birds and marine mammals can transport limiting nutrients between different regions of the ocean, thereby stimulating and enhancing productivity. In Antarctica this process is influenced by formation and breakup of sea ice and its influence on the feeding behaviour of predators and their prey. We used analyses of bioactive metals (for example, Fe, Co, Mn), macronutrients (for example, N) and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in the excreta of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) as well as Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) from multiple sites, among multiple years (2012-2014) to resolve how changes in sea ice dynamics, as indicated by MODIS satellite images, were coincident with prey switching and likely changes in nutrient fluxes between the offshore pelagic and coastal zones. We also sampled excreta of the south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), which preys on penguins and scavenges the remains of both penguins and seals. We found strong coincidence of isotopic evidence for prey switching, between euphausiids (Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias) and pelagic/cryopelagic fishes (for example, Pleuragramma antarcticum) in penguins, and between pelagic/cryopelagic fishes and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in Weddell seals, with changes in sea ice cover among years. Further, prey switching was strongly linked to changes in the concentrations of nutrients (Fe and N) deposited in coastal environments by both penguins and seals. Our findings have important implications for understanding how the roles of large animals in supporting coastal productivity may shift with environmental conditions in polar ecosystems.

TI  - Feasibility and safety of breast-conserving surgery via a periareolar incision for cancers located far from the nipple-areolar complex: a retrospective study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We performed breast-conserving surgery (BCS) using periareolar incisions for cancers located far from the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) and examined if BCS via a periareolar incision maximized cosmesis and maintained oncologic safety. One of the most important goals of BCS is to improve cosmesis after surgery and quality of life, but the skin incision can affect cosmesis based on the tumor location. Methods Fifty-five patients with breast cancers located far from the NAC underwent BCS via periareolar incisions between January 2017 and April 2018. If a sentinel lymph node biopsy was required, another skin incision was created in the axilla using the conventional technique. Medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. Results The mean patient age was 48.1 +/- 10.6 years. The mean tumor size was 1.8 +/- 1.0 cm (range 0.2-4.5 cm) on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); the mean distance from the NAC to the tumor was 5.9 +/- 1.9 cm (range 4.0-12.3 cm). Patients with cancers in the subareolar area were excluded even though the distance from the nipple was > 4 cm on MRI. Negative microscopic margins were obtained in all patients. There was no surgical complication such as seroma, bleeding, or infection. Re-operation was not needed. All patients received whole breast radiation therapy. After surgery and radiation therapy, periareolar incision scars were nearly invisible. Conclusion For cancers located far from the NAC, BCS via periareolar incisions is feasible and leads to superior cosmesis in selective patients. Moreover, BCS seems oncologically safe, although long-term outcomes need to be evaluated.

TI  - Source model for the <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.0 earthquake in Jiashi, China on 19 January 2020 from Sentinel-1A InSAR data
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - On January 19, 2020, an M-w 6.0 earthquake occurred in Jiashi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. The epicenter was located at the basin-mountain boundary between the southern Tian Shan and the Tarim Basin. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is used to obtain the coseismic deformation field from both ascending and descending Sentinel-1A satellite images of the European Space Agency. The results showed that the coseismic deformation is distributed between the Kalping fault and the Ozgertaou fault. The earthquake produced significant deformation over an area of approximately 40 km by 30 km. The maximum and minimal displacements along the line of sight (LOS) are 5.3 cm and -4.2 cm for the ascending interferogram and are 7.2 cm and -3.0 cm for the descending interferogram, respectively. The fault geometry from the Multi peak Particle Swarm Optimization computation indicates that the seismogenic fault is a shallow low-dipping planar fault that is 4.58 km depth underground. The finite slip model inverted by the Steepest Descent Method implies that the rupture is dominated by a thrust fault. The slips are concentrated in a depth of 5-7 km with a maximum slip of 0.29 m. The estimated total seismic moment is 1.688x10(18) Nm, corresponding to a magnitude of M-w 6.1. The seismogenic fault is the Kalping fault which has a listric structure. The coseismic deformation only occurred on the decollement layer and did not involve the ramp segment. The coseismic Coulomb stress changes have enhanced the stress on the deep margin of the Jiashi earthquake rupture area, indicating that there is still the possibility of strong earthquakes in this region in the future.

TI  - Improved inversion of aerosol components in the atmospheric column from remote sensing data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the composition of atmospheric aerosols is important for reducing uncertainty in climate assessment. In this study, an improved algorithm is developed for the retrieval of atmospheric columnar aerosol components from optical remote sensing data. This is achieved by using the complex refractive index (CRI) of a multicomponent liquid system in the forward model and minimizing the differences with the observations. The aerosol components in this algorithm comprise five species, combining eight sub-components including black carbon (BC), water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) and water-insoluble organic matter (WIOM), ammonium nitrate (AN), sodium chloride (SC), dust-like content (DU), and aerosol water content in the fine and coarse modes (AW(f) and AW(c)). The calculation of the CRI in the multicomponent liquid system allows for the separation of the water-soluble components (AN, WSOM and AW(f)) in the fine mode and SC and AW(c) in the coarse mode. The uncertainty in the retrieval results is analyzed based on the simulation of typical models, showing that the complex refractive index obtained from instantaneous optical-physical inversion compares well with that obtained from chemical estimation. The algorithm was used to retrieve the columnar aerosol components over China using the ground-based remote sensing measurements from the Sun-sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) in the period from 2010 to 2016. The results were used to analyze the regional distribution and interannual variation. The analysis shows that the atmospheric columnar DU component is dominant in the northern region of China, whereas the AW is higher in the southern coastal region. The SC component retrieved over the desert in northwest China originates from a pale-omarine source. The AN significantly decreased from 2011 to 2016, by 21.9 mg m(-2), which is inseparable from China's environmental control policies.

TI  - Monitoring surface subsidence in the Binchang mining area using small baseline subset differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar with Sentinel-1A data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface subsidence caused by mining is difficult to monitor. Traditional field measurements are time-consuming and labor intensive. Small baseline subset (SBAS) technique is a long-term sequence method based on the principles of radar interferometry that can be used to effectively survey small ground surface deformations. This technique has been successfully applied to urban subsidence in previous studies, but it has rarely been used to study subsidence in mining areas. A total of 62 Sentinel-1A images taken from March 2017 to March 2019 were used to analyze the surface subsidence of the Binchang mining area in Shaanxi Province, China. The accuracy was evaluated using the measured field data from six ground control points for eight different months. The root-mean-square-error and correlation coefficient (r) for the data obtained using SBAS and field measurements were 2.27 cm and 0.944, respectively. We examined 12 main subsidence areas with a mean subsidence rate of -11.88 cm/year, where the maximum cumulative subsidence of a single deformation point reached 83.46 cm. The subsidence areas also had differences in spatial distribution and subsidence formation processes. The geological and groundwater conditions were the same for all areas of the study, and mining in the surrounding coal mines was the main cause of surface subsidence. We demonstrate that SBAS differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique can be used as an effective method for the long-term monitoring of mining deformation.

TI  - Regional development gap assessment method based on remote sensing images and weighted Theil index
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quickly and accurately identifying development gaps between regions is critical to maintaining sustainable development in each region. The efficiency of the regional development gap assessment method based on traditional statistics is insufficient to meet the needs of rapid global economic development. This paper uses the nighttime light remote sensing data provided by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite as an economic parameter to measure the development gap. The noise in the nighttime light images was filtered by the mask method, and the development gap of Jiangxi Province from 2013 to 2018 was analyzed in combination with the weighted Theil index. The results indicate that: (1) the mask method used in this paper can significantly remove the background noise in the images, and the nighttime light after denoising shows a higher correlation with GDP. (2) From 2013 to 2018, the overall development gap in Jiangxi Province increased first and then decreased, reaching a peak in 2014, and the within-city gap was the main factor affecting the overall gap. (3) The overall accuracy of the regional development gap evaluation using weighted nighttime light data is 89.23%, and it has higher accuracy and robustness than the unweighted calculation results. The results of this study can provide a multi-scale reference for the investigation of the regional development gap.

TI  - Development and validation of a Brazilian nomogram to assess sentinel node biopsy positivity in melanoma
T2  - TUMORI JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although well-established, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for melanoma is not free from controversies and sometimes it can be questionable if SNB should be considered even for patients who meet the criteria for the procedure. Mathematical tools such as nomograms can be helpful and give more precise answers for both clinicians and patients. We present a nomogram for SNB positivity that has been internally validated. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent SNB from 2000 to 2015 in a single institution. Single logistic regressions were used to identify variables that were associated to SNB positivity. All variables with a p value < 0.05 were included in the final model. Overall performance, calibration, and discriminatory power of the final multiple logistic regression model were all assessed. Internal validation of the multiple logistic regression model was performed via bootstrap analysis based on 1000 replications. Results: Site of primary lesion, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, histologic regression, lymphatic invasion, and Clark level were statistically related to SNB positivity. After internal validation, a good performance was observed as well as an adequate power of discrimination (area under the curve 0.751). Conclusions: We have presented a nomogram that can be helpful and easily used in daily practice for assessing SNB positivity.

TI  - Early warning system for the detection of unexpected bridge displacements from radar satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CIVIL STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several hundred satellites are monitoring our planet every day, some of which are able to measure subtle ground movement. Satellites that carry synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are capable of providing high-resolution weather-independent imagery of the Earth. By taking several images of an area of interest at different times and analyzing them with advanced processing techniques such as interferometric SAR (InSAR), millimeter-level motion on ground structures can be detected and measured. Ground motion maps have been validated for several scenarios over the past 20 years utilizing Earth Observation (EO) technology. This paper presents InSAR basics and the methodology to apply this mature EO technology to bridges with a focus on the interpretation and validation of satellite data and their use for 3D visualization and early warning of unexpected bridge displacements. The concept of thermal sensitivity and its use to monitor bridge behavior is introduced. Two case studies are provided to illustrate and validate the application, and specific calculation methods are proposed to determine the extent of thermal movement for given types of bridges. Finally, a new 3D visualization tool that incorporates processed satellite data is briefly presented, which will serve in future development phases as a platform for bridge movement assessment and early warning to identify and flag abnormal bridge displacements, and to help avoid failures.

TI  - Predicting land surface temperature with geographically weighed regression and deep learning
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - For prediction of urban remote sensing surface temperature, cloud, cloud shadow and snow contamination lead to the failure of surface temperature inversion and vegetation-related index calculation. A time series prediction framework of urban surface temperature under cloud interference is proposed in this paper. This is helpful to solve the problem of the impact of data loss on surface temperature prediction. Spatial and temporal variation trends of surface temperature and vegetation index are analyzed using Landsat 7/8 remote sensing data of 2010 to 2019 from Beijing. The geographically weighed regression (GWR) method is used to realize the simulation of surface temperature based on the current date. The deep learning prediction network based on convolution and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks was constructed to predict the spatial distribution of surface temperature on the next observation date. The time series analysis shows that the NDBI is less than -0.2, which indicates that there may be cloud contamination. The land surface temperature (LST) modeling results show that the precision of estimation using GWR method on impervious surface and water bodies is superior compared to the vegetation area. For LST prediction using deep learning methods, the result of the prediction on surface temperature space distribution was relatively good. The purpose of this study is to make up for the missing data affected by cloud, snow, and other interference factors, and to be applied to the prediction of the spatial and temporal distributions of LST.This article is categorized under:Technologies > Machine Learning

T2  - AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThis study focuses on pre-disposing factors associated with sensory experiences of the deceased (SED), also called bereavement hallucinations. Even though SED are common among older widowed adults, our knowledge of these experiences is still limited.MethodSurvey responses were obtained from 310 older widowed participants (M = 70.05 +/- 8.39), complemented with data from Danish national registers.ResultsHierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed four significant pre-disposing factors: prior experiences of SED in the context of previous significant bereavements (OR = 6.47), a history of interpersonal trauma (OR = 3.22), high pre-death relationship closeness (OR = 2.76) and stronger religious/spiritual worldview (OR = 1.11). No association to registered mental health diagnosis was identified.ConclusionSED may be considered an interpersonal experience, which may be more likely to occur if the pre-death relationship is described as very close and if the bereaved has previously experienced interpersonal trauma. We argue that SED should not necessarily be considered an indication of neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimates of Wet Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) Deposition Fluxes Across China during 2011-2016 Using a Space-Time Ensemble Model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wet NH4-N deposition plays a significant role in the ecosystem safety in China, and thus it is highly imperative to estimate the national wet NH4-N deposition flux accurately. In this study, a new methodology named space-time ensemble machine-learning model was first applied to constrain the high-resolution NH4-N deposition fluxes over China based on the satellite data, assimilated meteorology, and various geographical covariates. A small gap between site-based cross-validation (CV) R-2 value (0.73) and 10-fold CV R-2 value (0.76), along with remarkable improvement in predictive accuracy (0.76) compared with previous studies (0.61), demonstrated the strong prediction capability of the space-time ensemble model in data mining. The higher wet NH4-N deposition fluxes mainly occurred in North China Plain (NCP), Sichuan Basin, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, whereas other regions retained the lower values. In addition, the wet NH4-N deposition fluxes, removing the precipitation effect in some major developed regions (e.g., Beijing and Shanghai) of China, displayed gradual increases from 2011 to 2014, while they suffered from dramatic decreases during 2014-2016, which was due to the strict implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP). The high-quality NH4-N deposition data sets are greatly useful to assess the potential ecological risks.

TI  - Satellite Estimation of Dissolved Carbon Dioxide Concentrations in China's Lake Taihu
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes play an important role in the global carbon cycle; however, there are still large uncertainties in the estimation of global lake carbon emission due to the limitations in conducting field surveys at large geographic scales. Using long-term Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and field observation data in eutrophic Lake Taihu, we developed a novel approach to estimate the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide (cCO(2)) in lakes. Based on the MODIS-derived chlorophyll-a concentration, lake surface temperature, diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation, and photosynthetically active radiation, a spatially explicit cCO(2) model was developed using multivariate quadratic polynomial regression (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.84, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 11.81 mu mol L-1, unbiased percent difference (UPD) = 22.46%). Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the model is stable with relatively small deviations in cCO(2) estimates caused by input variables (UPD = 26.14%). MODIS data from 2003 to 2018 showed a significant declining trend (0.42 mu mol L-1 yr(-1), p < 0.05) in the annual mean cCO(2). This was associated with a complex balance between the increasing algae biomass and decreasing external inputs of inorganic carbon, nutrients, and organic matter. The high spatiotemporal variabilities in cCO(2) were attributed to river inputs and seasonal changes in temperature and algae biomass. The study shows that satellite remote sensing can play an important role in the field of inland water carbon cycling, providing timely much-needed insights into the drivers of the spatial and temporal changes in dissolved CO2 concentrations in inland waters.

TI  - Identification of flash-floods-prone river reaches in Beas river basin using GIS-based multi-criteria technique: validation using field and satellite observations
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of an exponential increase in the negative impacts of flash-floods globally, the present work aims at the identification of flash-floods-prone river reaches in the Beas river basin, Himachal Pradesh, India using a multi-criteria indexing technique. The flood hazard index (FHI) was computed by implementing analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model on 6 hydrologic parameters influencing flood hazard, namely rainfall intensity, curve number (CN) grid, time of travel, slope, Manning's roughness coefficient and drainage density. The CN grid (empirical parameter to estimate direct surface runoff) was used as one of the parameters which depend upon the land use, hydrologic soil group and hydrologic conditions. It is imperative to mention that remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques played a crucial role in the preparation of these 6 parameter layers. The AHP model calculates the normalized weights for each parameter using pair-wise comparison matrices. The rainfall intensity and curve number were the factors having the highest normalized weight of 34.52 each. Subsequently, the estimated weights of the parameters and hazard level-wise rating scores were used in a GIS environment to generate FHI. The generated FHI raster was masked using floodplain layer within geomorphology map and river buffer to identify flash-floods-affected river reaches. The generated flash-floods map was validated by historical flash-floods ground points, field observations and remote sensing data. The results depicted that the river reaches in the north and east of the Beas basin are susceptible to flash-floods which are mainly governed by heavy rainfall intensity and high runoff characteristics. The river stretches namely Bahang-Manali (Beas), Kullu-Bhuntar (Beas) and Manikaran-Kheer-Ganga (Parvati) have been categorized into very high and high flash-floods zones. Decreasing trend of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) was observed for river reaches falling within the very high and high zones indicating the vegetation loss post successive flash-floods events. The river order 2 lies in the very high and high flash-floods zones, indicating the fact that the contribution of tributaries is significant to flood events. Flash-floods map will serve as catastrophic product, which will help policymakers to take suitable measures to reduce the risk of flash-floods.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The geothermal energy does not pollute the environment and atmosphere during production and consumption. Akarcay basin (Afyonkarahisar) has significant geothermal potential in Turkey. Geothermal waters in the basin are used for tourism, residential heating, greenhouse, and balneological applications. Hydrothermal alteration zones are essential indicators for the exploration of geothermal fields. In the feasibility studies of geothermal exploratory studies, outcrops of alteration contribute significantly to the exploration studies in investigation of target areas. The use of remote-sensing techniques in the detection of hydrothermal alteration minerals spread over large areas enables large areas to be evaluated holistically, saving both time and economically and achieving effective results. In this study, the Crosta and Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) techniques were applied to determine the hydrothermal alteration zones by using ASTER satellite data. In this context, samples from hydrothermal alteration zones were collected from the study area. The mineralogical compositions of studied samples were determined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. Alteration zones were also distinguished in similar locations in mapping techniques and XRD method. The results were combined, and the final alteration zones were formed. The alteration zones masked with volcanic and metamorphic rocks in order to be a geothermal indicator of hydrothermal alterations. The existing alteration zones are almost on the existing geothermal fields. As a result of the study, alteration zones were proposed different from the existing alteration zones. It is expected that these zones will be a reference in future geothermal explorations.

TI  - Thawing permafrost and methane emission in Siberia: Synthesis of observations, reanalysis, and predictive modeling
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost has been warming in the last decade at rates up to 0.39 degrees C 10 year(-1), raising public concerns about the local and global impacts, such as methane emission. We used satellite data on atmospheric methane concentrations to retrieve information about methane emission in permafrost and non-permafrost environments in Siberia with different biogeochemical conditions in river valleys, thermokarst lakes, wetlands, and lowlands. We evaluated the statistical links with air temperature, precipitation, depth of seasonal thawing, and freezing and developed a statistical model. We demonstrated that by the mid-21st century methane emission in Siberian permafrost regions will increase by less than 20 Tg year(-1), which is at the lower end of other estimates. Such changes will lead to less than 0.02 degrees C global temperature rise. These findings do not support the "methane bomb" concept. They demonstrate that the feedback between thawing Siberian wetlands and the global climate has been significantly overestimated.

TI  - Diversity in recognition and function of human γδ T cells
T2  - IMMUNOLOGICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - As interest increases in harnessing the potential power of tissue-resident cells for human health and disease, gamma delta T cells have been thrust into the limelight due to their prevalence in peripheral tissues, their sentinel-like phenotypes, and their unique antigen recognition capabilities. This review focuses primarily on human gamma delta T cells, highlighting their distinctive characteristics including antigen recognition, function, and development, with an emphasis on where they differ from their alpha beta T cell comparators, as well as from gamma delta T cell populations in the mouse. We review the antigens that have been identified thus far to regulate members of the human V delta 1 population and discuss what players are involved in transducing phosphoantigen-mediated signals to human V gamma 9V delta 2 T cells. We also briefly review distinguishing features of these cells in terms of TCR signaling, use of coreceptor and costimulatory molecules and their development. These cells have great potential to be harnessed in a clinical setting, but caution must be taken to understand their unique capabilities and how they differ from the populations to which they are commonly compared.

TI  - Near-real time aboveground carbon emissions in Peru
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring aboveground carbon stocks and fluxes from tropical deforestation and forest degradation is important for mitigating climate change and improving forest management. However, high temporal and spatial resolution analyses are rare. This study presents the most detailed tracking of aboveground carbon over time, with yearly, quarterly and monthly estimations of emissions using the stock-difference approach and masked by the forest loss layer of Global Forest Watch. We generated high spatial resolution (1-ha) monitoring of aboveground carbon density (ACD) and emissions (ACE) in Peru by incorporating hundreds of thousands of Planet Dove satellite images, Sentinel-1 radar, topography and airborne LiDAR, embedded into a deep learning regression workflow using high-performance computing. Consistent ACD results were obtained for all quarters and months analyzed, with R-2 values of 0.75-0.78, and root mean square errors (RMSE) between 20.6 and 22.0 Mg C ha(-1). A total of 7.138 Pg C was estimated for Peru with annual ACE of 20.08 Tg C between the third quarters of 2017 and 2018, respectively, or 23.4% higher than estimates from the FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment. Analyzed quarterly, the spatial evolution of ACE revealed 11.5 Tg C, 6.6 Tg C, 8.6 Tg C, and 10.1 Tg C lost between the third quarters of 2017 and 2018. Moreover, our monthly analysis for the dry season reveals the evolution of ACE at unprecedented temporal detail. We discuss environmental controls over ACE and provide a spatially explicit tool for enhanced forest carbon management at scale.

TI  - Improved Sentinel Method for Surveillance and Collection of Filth Fly Parasitoids
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasitoids are important natural enemies of house flies and other muscoid flies. The two most commonly used methods for collecting fly parasitoids from the field have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Collections of wild puparia depend on the ability to find puparia in sufficient numbers and are prone to localized distortions in relative species abundance because of the overrepresentation of samples from hot spots of fly larval activity. Placement and retrieval of sentinel puparia is convenient and allows consistent sampling over time but is strongly biased in favor of Muscidifurax spp. over Spalangia spp. An improved sentinel method is described that combines some of the advantages of these two methods. Fly medium containing larvae is placed in containers, topped with a screen mesh bag of puparia, and placed in vertebrate-proof wire cages. Cages are placed at sites of actual or potential fly breeding and retrieved 3-7 d later. The modified method collected species profiles that more closely resembled those of collections of wild puparia than those from sentinel pupal bags. A method is also described for isolating puparia individually in 96-well tissue culture plates for parasitoid emergence. Use of the plate method provided a substantial saving of time and labor over the use of individual gelatin capsules for pupal isolation. Puparia from the collections that were housed individually in the wells of tissue culture plates had a higher proportion of emerged Spalangia species than puparia that were held in groups.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of soil salinity using remote sensing data based on the artificial neural network, case study: Sharif Abad Plain, Central Iran
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land salinization is one of the most important factors in reducing the soil quality of agricultural land. Accordingly, these regions affected agricultural production and ecological development. Therefore, it is important to assess soil salinity driving factors. However, it is difficult to characterize soil salinity using single-factor and linear models. This research was carried out for soil digital mapping using remote sensing to classify saline lands and their spatial distribution in SharifAbad plain. The methodology is based on the differentiation of saline soils by combining the Landsat 8 data, fieldwork, and neural network model for prediction of soil salinity. The Latin hypercube method is based on the stratified sampling method. Based on this technique, 63 samples were selected from 0 to 30 cm of the soil surface. In the ANN model, considered 30% of the soil EC as the validation set and the rest (70%) for the testing set. To model soil salinity, auxiliary variables such as Landsat 8 satellite image of 2016 including 2-5 main bands and band 7, topographic auxiliary data includes DEM, TWI, TCI, and spectral parameters were extracted. The result revealed that the GFF algorithm which, according to R-2 and MSE statistics, the best way to prepare a soil salinity map in Sharif Abad plain. The ANN model in most cases satisfies the EC amount less than the real value. We found that the average values of SI5, TCI, and TWI values in the non-saline, the class were lower than the saline class, and the average values of DEM and NDVI indices in the non-saline class were higher than the saline class and showed a statistically significant difference.

TI  - Multi-mission satellite remote sensing data for improving land hydrological models via data assimilation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing offers valuable tools to study Earth and hydrological processes and improve land surface models. This is essential to improve the quality of model predictions, which are affected by various factors such as erroneous input data, the uncertainty of model forcings, and parameter uncertainties. Abundant datasets from multi-mission satellite remote sensing during recent years have provided an opportunity to improve not only the model estimates but also model parameters through a parameter estimation process. This study utilises multiple datasets from satellite remote sensing including soil moisture from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Mission and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System, terrestrial water storage from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment, and leaf area index from Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer to estimate model parameters. This is done using the recently proposed assimilation method, unsupervised weak constrained ensemble Kalman filter (UWCEnKF). UWCEnKF applies a dual scheme to separately update the state and parameters using two interactive EnKF filters followed by a water balance constraint enforcement. The performance of multivariate data assimilation is evaluated against various independent data over different time periods over two different basins including the Murray-Darling and Mississippi basins. Results indicate that simultaneous assimilation of multiple satellite products combined with parameter estimation strongly improves model predictions compared with single satellite products and/or state estimation alone. This improvement is achieved not only during the parameter estimation period (similar to 32% groundwater RMSE reduction and soil moisture correlation increase from similar to 0.66 to similar to 0.85) but also during the forecast period (similar to 14% groundwater RMSE reduction and soil moisture correlation increase from similar to 0.69 to similar to 0.78) due to the effective impacts of the approach on both state and parameters.

TI  - Mapping the grounding zone of Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica, from ICESat-2 laser altimetry
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new, fully automated method of mapping the Antarctic Ice Sheet's grounding zone using a repeat-track analysis and crossover analysis of newly acquired ICESat-2 laser altimeter data. We map the position of the landward limit of tidal flexure and the inshore limit of hydrostatic equilibrium, as demonstrated over the mountainous and hitherto difficult to survey grounding zone of Larsen C Ice Shelf. Since the start of data acquisition in 2018, our method has already achieved a near 9-fold increase in the number of grounding zone observations compared with ICESat, which operated between 2003 and 2009. We have improved coverage in particular over the previously poorly mapped the Bawden and Gipps ice rises and Hearst Island. Acting as a reliable proxy for the grounding line, which cannot be directly imaged by satellites, our ICESat-2-derived landward limit of tidal flexure locations agrees well with independently obtained measurements, with a mean absolute difference and standard deviation of 0.39 and 0.32 km, respectively, compared to interferometric synthetic-aperture-radar-based observations. Our results demonstrate the efficiency, density, and high spatial accuracy with which ICESat-2 can image complex grounding zones and its clear potential for future mapping of the pan-ice sheet grounding zone.

TI  - Validation of a clinicopathological and gene expression profile model for sentinel lymph node metastasis in primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Clinicopathological and Gene Expression Profile (CP-GEP) model was developed to accurately identify patients with T1-T3 primary cutaneous melanoma at low risk for nodal metastasis.Objectives To validate the CP-GEP model in an independent Dutch cohort of patients with melanoma.Methods Patients (aged >= 18 years) with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 2007 and 2017 at the Erasmus Medical Centre Cancer Institute were eligible. The CP-GEP model combines clinicopathological features (age and Breslow thickness) with the expression of eight target genes involved in melanoma metastasis (ITGB3, PLAT, SERPINE2, GDF15, TGFBR1, LOXL4, CXCL8 and MLANA). Using the pathology result of SLNB as the gold standard, performance measures of the CP-GEP model were calculated, resulting in CP-GEP high risk or low risk for nodal metastasis.Results In total, 210 patients were included in the study. Most patients presented with T2 (n = 94, 45%) or T3 (n = 70, 33%) melanoma. Of all patients, 27% (n = 56) had a positive SLNB, with nodal metastasis in 0%, 30%, 54% and 16% of patients with T1, T2, T3 and T4 melanoma, respectively. Overall, the CP-GEP model had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90 center dot 5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 77 center dot 9-96.2], with an NPV of 100% (95% CI 72 center dot 2-100) in T1, 89 center dot 3% (95% CI 72 center dot 8-96 center dot 3) in T2 and 75 center dot 0% (95% CI 30 center dot 1-95 center dot 4) in T3 melanomas. The CP-GEP indicated high risk in all T4 melanomas.Conclusions The CP-GEP model is a noninvasive and validated tool that accurately identified patients with primary cutaneous melanoma at low risk for nodal metastasis. In this validation cohort, the CP-GEP model has shown the potential to reduce SLNB procedures in patients with melanoma.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Forecasting High-Risk Freshwater Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms in Florida
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the occurrence of more frequent and widespread toxic cyanobacteria events, the ability to predict freshwater cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB) is of critical importance for the management of drinking and recreational waters. Lake system specific geographic variation of cyanoHABs has been reported, but regional and state level variation is infrequently examined. A spatio-temporal modeling approach can be applied, via the computationally efficient Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), to high-risk cyanoHAB exceedance rates to explore spatio-temporal variations across statewide geographic scales. We explore the potential for using satellite-derived data and environmental determinants to develop a short-term forecasting tool for cyanobacteria presence at varying space-time domains for the state of Florida. Weekly cyanobacteria abundance data were obtained using Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Color Imagery (OLCI), for a period of May 2016-June 2019. Time and space varying covariates include surface water temperature, ambient temperature, precipitation, and lake geomorphology. The hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling approach in R-INLA represents a potential forecasting tool useful for water managers and associated public health applications for predicting near future high-risk cyanoHAB occurrence given the spatio-temporal characteristics of these events in the recent past. This method is robust to missing data and unbalanced sampling between waterbodies, both common issues in water quality datasets.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This pilot project sought to seed citizen engagement processes for sustainable futures visioning with ideas, perspectives, and processes informed by Indigenous ways of knowing.Methods Five circle dialogues were convened with students, faculty, and members of the public, in the spring of 2019, using Indigenous talking circle methodology and intentionally seeded with "disruptive" ideas to encourage reflexivity and open space for "out-of-the-box" thinking. These were complemented by a series of one-on-one dialogues with members of the pan-Canadian research team. Pre- and post-dialogue surveys, notes taken by participants, team members, and co-facilitators, as well as notes from one-on-one interviews, constituted the data drawn upon for this paper.Results Participants were overwhelmingly positive about their experience, noting they were able to go further and deeper in their thinking and listening, and that they valued the Indigenous talking circle methodology, even if they stopped short of claiming the experience had transformed their way of seeing the world. Key points raised in the dialogues included the need for a more relational worldview, the need to repair severed relations with the land and nature, the importance of Indigenous ways of knowing, the importance of community building, and the need to question the fundamental assumptions undergirding contemporary Western societies.Conclusions While caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions and extrapolating from this modest pilot project, our experience underscores the value of processes that intentionally catalyze critical reflexivity and openness to other ways of seeing, informed by Indigenous ways of knowing and talking circle methodology.

TI  - Expression of IMP3 in a retrospective cohort of melanomas with selective lymph node biopsy
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP-3), which is a member of the insulin-like growth factor mRNA-binding protein family, is expressed at high levels in many types of cancer, where it plays an important role in cell proliferation, as well as in the processes of invasion, migration, and metastasis. Its expression has also been demonstrated in malignant melanoma, but not in other benign skin lesions, which has raised the possibility of using it as a predictive and prognosis marker. Its relationship with sentinel lymph node biopsy, however, has not been explored yet. A retrospective study including 120 histological samples of patients diagnosed with malignant cutaneous melanoma in Granada, between 2012 and 2018, was developed. All patients had had a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) performed at Hospital Universitario San Cecilio. IMP3 immunostaining was simultaneously carried out in the cutaneous lesion. We observed a significant difference regarding the percentage of cells expressing IMP3 (29.73 +/- 3.81 for negative SLNB vs 44.86 +/- 5.91 for positive SLNB, P = .020). Our endpoint calculated according to the ROC curve of 35% was significant with P = .007. H (P = .013) and AR (P = .016) indexes, created by the percentage of positive tumor cells and the intensity of the IMP3 expression, were also statistically significant. The most optimal cut-off points to predict the positivity of the SLNB were 35 for the percentage of positive tumor cells and 70 for the H score. We found a significant association between the expression of IMP3 and the regional nodal status defined by the SLNB on malignant melanomas in our series.

M3  - Review
AB  - Background: In order to offer optimal treatment approaches based on available evidence, the Commission Breast of the Working Group Gynecologic Oncology (AGO) of the German Cancer Society developed therapy algorithms for eight complex treatment situations in primary and advanced breast cancer. Summary: Therapy algorithms for the following complex treatment situations are outlined in this paper: (neo)adjuvant therapy of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer; axillary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy; adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients; adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients; hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer: strategies; HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer: endocrine-based first-line treatment; HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: first to third-line; metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Key Messages: The therapy options shown in these algorithms are based on the current AGO recommendations updated in January 2020 but cannot represent all evidence-based treatment options. Prior therapies, performance status, comorbidities, patient preference, etc. must be taken into account for the actual treatment choice. Therefore, in individual cases, other evidence-based treatment options not listed here may also be appropriate and justified.

TI  - Sea ice drift and arch evolution in the Robeson Channel using the daily coverage of Sentinel-1 SAR data for the 2016-2017 freezing season
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Robeson Channel is a narrow sea water passage between Greenland and Ellesmere Island in the Arctic. It is a pathway of sea ice from the central Arctic and out to Baffin Bay. In this study, we used a set of daily synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1A/1B satellites, acquired between September 2016 and April 2017, to study the kinematics of individual ice floes as they approach and then drift through the Robeson Channel. The tracking of 39 selected ice floes was visually performed in the image sequence, and their speed was calculated and linked to the reanalysis 10m wind from ERA5. The results show that the drift of ice floes is very slow in the compact ice regime upstream of the Robeson Channel, unless the ice floe is surrounded by water or thin ice. In this case, the wind has more influence on the drift. On the other hand, the ice floe drift is found to be about 4-5 times faster in the open-drift regime within the Robeson Channel and is clearly influenced by wind. A linear trend is found between the change in wind and the change in ice drift speed components, along the length of the channel. Case studies are presented to reveal the role of wind in ice floe drift. This paper also addresses the development of the ice arch at the entry of the Robeson Channel, which started development on 24 January and matured on 1 February 2017. Details of the development, obtained using the sequential SAR images, are presented. It is found that the arch's shape continued to adjust by rupturing ice pieces at the locations of cracks under the influence of the southward wind (and hence the contour kept displacing northward). The findings of this study highlight the advantage of using the high-resolution daily SAR coverage in monitoring aspects of sea ice cover in narrow water passages where the ice cover is highly dynamic. The information will be particularly interesting for the possible applications of SAR constellation systems.

TI  - The Drought Resilience Impact Platform (DRIP): Improving Water Security Through Actionable Water Management Insights
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Millions of people living in the drought-prone Horn of Africa face an increasing threat from a lack of safe, reliable, and affordable water year-round as droughts become more severe and frequent. Drought emergencies emerge when reduced rainfall conspires with limited community water service capacity to cause dramatic reductions in access to water for people, livestock and agriculture. Drought-driven humanitarian emergencies can be prevented if groundwater is reliably made available at strategic locations during cycles of water stress. The Drought Resilience Impact Platform (DRIP) is an initiative combining early detection and planning with proactive groundwater management to ensure water availability, thus enabling drought-prone communities to become effective managers in the prevention of these humanitarian crises. It replaces reactive and expensive short-term assistance measures, like water trucking, with a framework for drought resilience. DRIP links in situ sensors deployed in East Africa with remote sensing data to improve estimates for rainfall and groundwater availability, and it will also develop a localized model for water demand forecasting. These indicators support the operation and maintenance of strategically selected groundwater borehole systems, thereby helping to support water delivery during dry and drought seasons. DRIP can be used to support pay-for-performance contracting, ensuring that water asset management is incentivized. DRIP is presently monitoring the water supplies of about 3 million people in East Africa. This paper presents DRIP's current web-based functionality, which uses several custom and commercial tools, and its applications, including rainfall-adjusted indicators of water pump functionality in Kenya and Ethiopia. Future work includes experimental and statistical characterization of the impact of these capabilities on water security, and the development of forecasting capabilities.

TI  - A Tissue Digestion Protocol for Measuring <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i> (Astigmata: Sarcoptidae) Density in Skin Biopsies
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sarcoptic mange is a parasitic skin disease caused by the burrowing mite Sarcoptes scabiei that affects a diversity of mammals, including humans, worldwide. In North America, the most commonly affected wildlife includes wild canids, such as coyotes and red foxes, and more recently American black bears in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast United States. Currently, surveillance for sarcoptic mange in wildlife is syndromic, relying on detection of clinical signs and lesions, such as alopecia and crusting of skin. When possible, skin scrapes are used to identify the causative mite. While skin scrapes are a valuable diagnostic tool to identify mites, this approach has significant limitations when used for quantification of mite burden. To further investigate mite burden in cases of sarcoptic mange, 6-mm punch biopsies were collected from affected skin of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes Linnaeus [Carnivore: Canidae]), a species historically affected by sarcoptic mange, frequently with high mite burdens and severe skin disease, and validated on skin tissue from mange-affected American black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas [Carnivore: Ursidae]) and coyotes (Canis latrans Say [Carnivore: Canidae]). Biopsies were digested by incubating the tissue in potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 55 degrees C.The greatest tissue clearance and lowest mite degradation resulted after 12 h of tissue digestion.The purpose of this manuscript is to describe a methodology for host tissue digestion and mite quantification in cases of sarcoptic mange.This method will provide a valuable surveillance and research tool to better understand sarcoptic mange in wild and domestic animals, with applications to a diversity of other ectoparasitic diseases.

TI  - Effects of seasonality and land use on the diversity, relative abundance, and distribution of mosquitoes on St. Kitts, West Indies
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mosquito surveys that collect local data on mosquito species' abundances provide baseline data to help understand potential host-pathogen-mosquito relationships, predict disease transmission, and target mosquito control efforts.Methods: We conducted an adult mosquito survey from November 2017 to March 2019 on St. Kitts, using Biogents Sentinel 2 traps, set monthly and run for 48-h intervals. We collected mosquitoes from a total of 30 sites distributed across agricultural, mangrove, rainforest, scrub and urban land covers. We investigated spatial variation in mosquito species richness across the island using a hierarchical Bayesian multi-species occupancy model. We developed a mixed effects negative binomial regression model to predict the effects of spatial variation in land cover, and seasonal variation in precipitation on observed counts of the most abundant mosquito species observed.Results: There was high variation among sites in mosquito community structure, and variation in site level richness that correlated with scrub forest, agricultural, and urban land covers. The four most abundant species were Aedes taeniorhynchus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegpyti and Deinocerites magnus, and their relative abundance varied with season and land cover. Aedes aegypti was the most commonly occurring mosquito on the island, with a 90% probability of occurring at between 24 and 30 (median = 26) sites. Mangroves yielded the most mosquitoes, with Ae. taeniorhynchus, Cx. quinquefasciatus and De. magnus predominating. Psorophora pygmaea and Toxorhynchites guadeloupensis were only captured in scrub habitat. Capture rates in rainforests were low. Our count models also suggested the extent to which monthly average precipitation influenced counts varied according to species.Conclusions: There is high seasonality in mosquito abundances, and land cover influences the diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of species on St. Kitts. Further, human-adapted mosquito species (e.g. Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus) that are known vectors for many human relevant pathogens (e.g. chikungunya, dengue and Zika viruses in the case of Ae. aegypti; West Nile, Spondweni, Oropouche virus, and equine encephalitic viruses in the case of Cx. quinqefasciatus) are the most wide-spread (across land covers) and the least responsive to seasonal variation in precipitation.

TI  - Nostalgia, Entitlement and Victimhood: The Synergy of White Genocide and Misogyny
T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Western countries are experiencing a wave of violent attacks against places of worship, stores, schools and other crowded locations. The perpetrators of these attacks explain their actions as necessary to stem an "invasion" of immigrants which threatens the very existence of the white race. At the same time, many of the same countries have experienced very similar attacks motivated by a particularly contemporary form of misogyny. Known as incels, an abbreviation of involuntary celibate, young men in this community believe they are denied sexual partners by feminism and societal norms of male attractiveness. These two series of attacks are generally understood to be separate (if overlapping) forms of extremism. In this article I contend that the concept of white genocide central to white nationalism and misogynistic incelism are more intertwined than it appears. Misogyny and the notion of white genocide are mutually escalatory. Rather than separate and complementary forms of extremism, the two ideologies converge to create a single more volatile worldview, one which makes its proponents more prone to the use of violence. Misogyny and white genocide are synergistic, their effect greater than the sum of their parts.

TI  - Nipple-sparing mastectomy: A review of outcomes at a single institution
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) offers patients who are not candidates for breast-conserving treatment an aesthetically pleasing alternative to traditional mastectomy. Some studies have demonstrated its oncologic safety while others have demonstrated residual occult tumor cells at the nipple-areolar complex (NAC). These data prompt further review of oncologic outcomes after NSM.A single institution retrospective chart review was performed of all NSMs performed by 4 breast surgeons at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital over a span of 2012-2019. In this cohort, we review the reconstruction performed, axillary lymph node status, surgical margins, final pathology, loss of the NAC, recurrence rates, and follow-up. In our cohort, we reviewed 170 NSMs performed on 105 patients. All patients were female, and the average age was 46.9 years. Prophylactic procedures were performed on 43% of patients with 17.1% of patients being BRCA positive. Of those undergoing NSM for cancer (n = 94), the associated pathology was 28.8% DCIS, 32.9% IDC, and 3.5% ILC (this accounts for some patients with multiple diagnoses on final pathology). Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed in 52.9% of cases with 10.6% of cases being positive for axillary disease. Margins were positive in 10.6% (n = 10) of cases performed for cancer with 8.5% (n = 8) of cases having positive margin at the NAC and the remainder being at the deep margin. Based on margin positivity, 2.4% (n = 4) of patients underwent redo surgery with 1 patient requiring re-resection at the NAC margin and 3 patients having total NAC resection. Total loss of NAC occurred in 5.9% (n = 10) of cases due to positive margins (n = 3) and necrosis (n = 7). Recurrence occurred in 7.2% (n = 7) of cases who underwent NSM for cancer. Locoregional recurrence in breast tissue, skin, or axilla occurred in 4.1% (n = 4) of cases with 0 recurrences at the NAC. Distant recurrence occurred in 4.1% (n = 4) of cases at both liver and bone. Average time to recurrence was 27.3 months. Of the 170 NSM performed, 98% had immediate tissue expander placement with 60% converting to permanent subpectoral implant reconstruction, 14% latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction, 0.6% delayed deep inferior epigastric artery perforator free-flap reconstruction, and 5.2% undergoing delayed free transversus abdominus muscle flap reconstruction. Of all the cases reviewed, there was only 1 death. Our average follow-up was 26.7 months. We demonstrate similar numbers in our analysis as other studies that have looked at oncologic outcomes after NSM. Although we demonstrate evidence of occult disease at the NAC margin when performing NSM, there was no evidence of recurrence at the NAC demonstrating its efficacy and safety. With proper patient selection, this procedure can be safely offered as an esthetically appealing alternative to traditional mastectomy.

TI  - Coordinated Ground-Based and Space-Borne Observations of Ionospheric Response to the Annular Solar Eclipse on 26 December 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the ionosphere's response to the annular solar eclipse on 26 December 2019, utilizing the following ground-based and space-borne measurements: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) total electron content (TEC) data, spectral radiance data from the Sentinel-5P satellite, in situ electron density and/or temperature measurements from DMSP and Swarm satellites, and local magnetometer data. Analysis concentrated on ionospheric effects over low-latitude regions with respect to obscuration, local time, latitude, and altitude. The main results are as follows: (1) a local TEC reduction of similar to 4-6 TECU (30-50%) was identified along the annular eclipse path, with larger depletion and longer recovery periods in the morning eclipse compared to midday. (2) The equatorial electrojet current was significantly weakened when the eclipse trajectory crossed the magnetic equator in the morning (India) sector, which contributed to large and prolonged TEC depletion therein. (3) At midday, equatorial ionization anomaly exhibited enhancements of 20-40% as well as poleward shifting of 3-4 degrees, likely triggered by modified neutral wind and electrodynamics patterns. (4) The behavior of equatorial ionospheric electron density showed considerable altitudinal differences in the topside, exhibiting similar to 30% reduction around 500 km and similar to 30% enhancement with 300-500 K Te reduction around 850 km, before the arrival of maximum eclipse. This may have been caused by the enhanced eastward electric field and equatorward neutral wind, and other possible factors are also discussed.

TI  - An Algorithm to Retrieve Total Precipitable Water Vapor in the Atmosphere from FengYun 3D Medium Resolution Spectral Imager 2 (FY-3D MERSI-2) Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmosphere has substantial effects on optical remote sensing imagery of the Earth's surface from space. These effects come through the functioning of atmospheric particles on the radiometric transfer from the Earth's surface through the atmosphere to the sensor in space. Precipitable water vapor (PWV), CO2, ozone, and aerosol in the atmosphere are very important among the particles through their functioning. This study presented an algorithm to retrieve total PWV from the Chinese second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite FengYun 3D Medium Resolution Spectral Imager 2 (FY-3D MERSI-2) data, which have three near-infrared (NIR) water vapor absorbing channels, i.e., channel 16, 17, and 18. The algorithm was improved from the radiance ratio technique initially developed for Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. MODTRAN 5 was used to simulate the process of radiant transfer from the ground surfaces to the sensor at various atmospheric conditions for estimation of the coefficients of ratio technique, which was achieved through statistical regression analysis between the simulated radiance and transmittance values for FY-3D MERSI-2 NIR channels. The algorithm was then constructed as a linear combination of the three-water vapor absorbing channels of FY-3D MERSI-2. Measurements from two ground-based reference datasets were used to validate the algorithm: the sun photometer measurements of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the microwave radiometer measurements of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARMP). The validation results showed that the algorithm performs very well when compared with the ground-based reference datasets. The estimated PWV values come with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.28 g/cm(2) for the ARMP and 0.26 g/cm(2) for the AERONET datasets, with bias of 0.072 g/cm(2) and 0.096 g/cm(2) for the two reference datasets, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm revealed a better consistency with ground-based reference datasets. Thus, the proposed algorithm could be used as an alternative to retrieve PWV from FY-3D MERSI-2 data for various remote sensing applications such as agricultural monitoring, climate change, hydrologic cycle, and so on at various regional and global scales.

TI  - Prospecting genomic regions associated with milk production traits in Egyptian buffalo
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of the current study were to detect putative genomic loci and to identify candidate genes associated with milk production traits in Egyptian buffalo. A total number of 161 479 daily milk yield (DMY) records and 60 318 monthly measures for fat and protein percentages (FP and PP, respectively), along with fat and protein yields (FY and PY, respectively) from 1670 animals were used. Genotyping was performed using Axiom(R) Buffalo Genotyping 90 K array. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) for each trait was performed using PLINK. After Bonferroni correction, 47 SNPs were associated with one or more milk production traits. These SNPs were distributed over 36 quantitative trait loci (QTL) and located on 20 buffalo chromosomes (BBU). For the 47 SNPs, one was overlapped for three traits (DMY, FY, and PY), six were associated with two traits (one for PP and PY and five for FY and PY) while the rest were associated with only one trait. Out of 36 identified QTL, eleven were overlapped with previously reported loci in buffalo and/or cattle populations. Some of these SNPs are placed within or close to potential candidate genes, for example: TPD52, ZBTB10, RALYL and SNX16 on BBU15, ADGRD1 on BBU17, ESRRG on BBU5 and GRIP1 on BBU4. This is the first reported study between genome-wide markers and milk components in Egyptian buffalo. Our findings provide useful information to explore the genetic mechanisms and relevant genes contributing to the variation in milk production traits. Further confirmation studies with larger population size are necessary to validate the findings and detect the causal genetic variants.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Human Settlement Growth Differentiation with Symbolic Machine Learning for Verifying Spatial Policy Targets: Assiut Governorate, Egypt as a Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2005, Egypt has a new land-use development policy to control unplanned human settlement growth and prevent outlying growth. This study assesses the impact of this policy shift on settlement growth in Assiut Governorate, Egypt, between 1999 and 2020. With symbolic machine learning, we extract built-up areas from Landsat images of 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 and a Landscape Expansion Index with a new QGIS plugin tool (Growth Classifier) developed to classify settlement growth types. The base year, 1999, was produced by the national remote sensing agency. After extracting the built-up areas from the Landsat images, eight settlement growth types (infill, expansion, edge-ribbon, linear branch, isolated cluster, proximate cluster, isolated scattered, and proximate scattered) were identified for four periods (1999:2005, 2005:2010, 2010:2015, and 2015:2020). The results show that prior to the policy shift of 2005, the growth rate for 1999-2005 was 11% p.a. In all subsequent periods, the growth rate exceeded the target rate of 1% p.a., though by varying amounts. The observed settlement growth rates were 5% (2005:2010), 7.4% (2010:2015), and 5.3% (2015:2020). Although the settlements in Assiut grew primarily through expansion and infill, with the latter growing in importance during the last two later periods, outlying growth is also evident. Using four class metrics (number of patches, patch density, mean patch area, and largest patch index) for the eight growth types, all types showed a fluctuated trend between all periods, except for expansion, which always tends to increase. To date, the policy to control human settlement expansion and outlying growth has been unsuccessful.

TI  - Integrated Methodology for Urban Flood Risk Mapping at the Microscale in Ungauged Regions: A Case Study of Hurghada, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood risk mapping forms the basis for disaster risk management and the associated decision-making systems. The effectiveness of this process is highly dependent on the quality of the input data of both hazard and vulnerability maps and the method utilized. On the one hand, for higher-quality hazard maps, the use of 2D models is generally suggested. However, in ungauged regions, such usage becomes a difficult task, especially at the microscale. On the other hand, vulnerability mapping at the microscale suffers limitations as a result of the failure to consider vulnerability components, the low spatial resolution of the input data, and the omission of urban planning aspects that have crucial impacts on the resulting quality. This paper aims to enhance the quality of both hazard and vulnerability maps at the urban microscale in ungauged regions. The proposed methodology integrates remote sensing data and high-quality city strategic plans (CSPs) using geographic information systems (GISs), a 2D rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) simulation model, and multicriteria decision-making analysis (MCDA, i.e., the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)). This method was implemented in Hurghada, Egypt, which from 1996 to 2019 was prone to several urban flood events. Current and future physical, social, and economic vulnerability maps were produced based on seven indicators (land use, building height, building conditions, building materials, total population, population density, and land value). The total vulnerability maps were combined with the hazard maps based on the Kron equation for three different return periods (REPs) 50, 10, and 5 years to create the corresponding flood risk maps. In general, this integrated methodology proved to be an economical tool to overcome the scarcity of data, to fill the gap between urban planning and flood risk management (FRM), and to produce comprehensive and high-quality flood risk maps that aid decision-making systems.

TI  - Solar Radiation Estimation Using Data Mining Techniques for Remote Areas-A Case Study in Ethiopia
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - High quality of solar radiation data is essential for solar resource assessment. For remote areas this is a challenge, as often only satellite data with low spatial resolution are available. This paper presents an interpolation method based on topographic data in digital elevation model format to improve the resolution of solar radiation maps. The refinement is performed with a data mining method based on first-order Sugeno type Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System. The training set contains topographic characteristics such as terrain aspect, slope and elevation which may influence the solar radiation distribution. An efficient sampling method is proposed to obtain representative training sets from digital elevation model data. The proposed geographic information system based approach makes this method reproducible and adaptable for any region. A case study is presented on the remote Amhara region in North Shewa, Ethiopia. Results are shown for interpolation of solar radiation data from 10 km x 10 km to a resolution of 1 km x 1 km and are validated with data from the PVGIS and SWERA projects.

AB  - This year, at the UNESCO level, the 1150th anniversary of Abu Nasir al-Farabi (870-950), a world famous figure in all fields of science born in Otyrar, is the center of science and education, culture in the Middle Ages. The idea of the great scientist, who at one time was able to analyze at a high level the works of Aristotle and Plato, who became the great philosopher of their time, has not lost its relevance to this day, having formed a new system of thinking through his scientific works and raise the intellectual level of the scientific worldview.He knew that one of the main goals of science was to serve the good of mankind and bring real benefits to the development of civilization. His works have been translated into several languages and recognized throughout Europe Thanks to the Kazakh intelligentsia, the heritage of the scientist was returned to our country in the 60-70s of the 20th century. Since then, a lot of work has been done to study the works of the great scientist, namely: from 1978 to 1993, he published about four hundred works in various areas of pharabology in the Kazakh and Russian languages, and from 1991 to 2012, including 85 monographs from 1998 to 2012, materials of 38 scientific and practical conferences from 2000 to 2009, from 1992 to 2012 published 225 scientific articles. And this year it is expected to further increase the research of the scientist's work. In the works of the great thinker, questions of mathematics and the teaching of mathematics also occupy a special place. According to Iraqi scientist Omar Farrukh, al-Farabi is the author of about 70 works on geometry, astronomy, music, calendars and measuring instruments. According to Farabi, mathematics deepens human knowledge and has a direct impact on the development of other sciences, and physics is the science of nature, its basic principles and parts, chances involving natural bodies, the interaction of natural data and elements that have a direct impact on the development of science. Therefore, these two sciences, which are the core of natural science education, require continuous addition and development.The most important methodological problems of physics and mathematics are considered in "The Essence of the Problem" by al-Farabi, Aristotle's commentary "Category" and other philosophical works, the idea of the universal application of mathematics in astronomy, mechanics, music, various applications (arithmetic and geometry). shows the close connection of mathematical concepts and methods with the real world.Also, from the pedagogical works of the scientist, one can notice that the problems of education and upbringing should be closely related. He said that "a person must first be given upbringing, not education, education without upbringing is the worst enemy of mankind It will harm his life in the future".Enriching and revising the scientific and philosophical works of the scientist, we see that he was one of the greatest personalities in the history of pedagogy. Therefore, this article provides an overview of a number of Al-Farabi's works in this area and describes the methodological aspects of interdisciplinary communication in teaching physics and mathematics.

TI  - Machine Learning to Estimate Surface Soil Moisture from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an integral quantity parameter in hydrology and agriculture practices. Satellite remote sensing has been widely applied to estimate surface soil moisture. However, it is still a challenge to retrieve surface soil moisture content (SMC) data in the heterogeneous catchment at high spatial resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the retrieval of SMC from remote sensing data, which is important in the planning and efficient use of land resources. Many methods based on satellite-derived vegetation indices have already been developed to estimate SMC in various climatic and geographic conditions. Soil moisture retrievals were performed using statistical and machine learning methods as well as physical modeling techniques. In this study, an important experiment of soil moisture retrieval for investigating the capability of the machine learning methods was conducted in the early spring season in a semi-arid region of Iran. We applied random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and elastic net regression (EN) algorithms to soil moisture retrieval by optical and thermal sensors of Landsat 8 and knowledge of land-use types on previously untested conditions in a semi-arid region of Iran. The statistical comparisons show that RF method provided the highest Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value (0.73) for soil moisture retrieval covered by the different land-use types. Combinations of surface reflectance and auxiliary geospatial data can provide more valuable information for SMC estimation, which shows promise for precision agriculture applications.

TI  - Leveraging the Capabilities of the FDA's Sentinel System To Improve Kidney Care
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The Sentinel System is a national electronic postmarketing resource established by the US Food and Drug Administration to support assessment of the safety and effectiveness of marketed medical products. It has built a large, multi-institutional, distributed data network that contains comprehensive electronic health data, covering about 700 million person-years of longitudinal observation time nationwide. With its sophisticated infrastructure and a large selection of flexible analytic tools, the Sentinel System permits rapid and secure analyses, while preserving patient privacy and health-system autonomy. The Sentinel System also offers enhanced capabilities, including accessing full-text medical records, supporting randomized clinical trials embedded in healthcare delivery systems, and facilitating effective collection of patient-reported data using mobile devices, among many other research programs. The nephrology research community can use the infrastructure, tools, and data that this national resource offers for evidence generation. This review summarizes the Sentinel System and its ability to rapidly generate high-quality, real-world evidence; discusses the program's experience in, and potential for, addressing gaps in kidney care; and outlines avenues for conducting research, leveraging this national resource in collaboration with Sentinel investigators.

TI  - Damage Proxy Map of the Beirut Explosion on 4th of August 2020 as Observed from the Copernicus Sensors
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - On the 4th of August 2020, a massive explosion occurred in the harbor area of Beirut, Lebanon, killing more than 100 people and damaging numerous buildings in its proximity. The current article aims to showcase how open access and freely distributed satellite data, such as those of the Copernicus radar and optical sensors, can deliver a damage proxy map of this devastating event. Sentinel-1 radar images acquired just prior (the 24th of July 2020) and after the event (5th of August 2020) were processed and analyzed, indicating areas with significant changes of the VV (vertical transmit, vertical receive) and VH (vertical transmit, horizontal receive) backscattering signal. In addition, an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) analysis was performed for both descending (31st of July 2020 and 6th of August 2020) and ascending (29th of July 2020 and 10th of August 2020) orbits of Sentinel-1 images, indicating relative small ground displacements in the area near the harbor. Moreover, low coherence for these images is mapped around the blast zone. The current study uses the Hybrid Pluggable Processing Pipeline (HyP3) cloud-based system provided by the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) for the processing of the radar datasets. In addition, medium-resolution Sentinel-2 optical data were used to support thorough visual inspection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) the damage in the area. While the overall findings are well aligned with other official reports found on the World Wide Web, which were mainly delivered by international space agencies, those reports were generated after the processing of either optical or radar datasets. In contrast, the current communication showcases how both optical and radar satellite data can be parallel used to map other devastating events. The use of open access and freely distributed Sentinel mission data was found very promising for delivering damage proxies maps after devastating events worldwide.

TI  - Temporal role of crop residue burning (CRB) in Delhi's air pollution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Capital Region of Delhi in India is one of the most polluted urban areas in the world, and its intense pollution episodes are attributed to crop residue burning (CRB). However, existing studies are limited in time and pollutant type, and do not often control for non-biophysical factors. We used ground-measured pollutant levels and aerosol optical depth (AOD) data to understand the role of CRB in Delhi's air pollution from 2015 to 2018. While the CRB peak in October-November is associated with pollution episodes, biophysical conditions in the April-May CRB period allow the pollutants to disperse. Elevation in SO2 and ozone is associated with CRB from more distant source areas than elevations in PM2.5 and PM10: gaseous molecules such as SO2 may travel further than particulate matter; and NO2 may convert to ozone during long-range transport. Pollution levels are very high in December-January despite low CRB in this period. Given the high contribution of biomass burning in this period in source apportionment studies, it is unclear whether the sharp elevation in pollutant levels with temperature drop in this period can be explained only with meteorological conditions, or whether there are unquantified sources contributing to pollutant load in December-January, such as small-scale CRB that is undetected by the MODIS active fire product or local burning for heat. There are limitations to the substitution of ground-measured pollutants with AOD in analyzing drivers of pollution since AOD, unlike ground-measured pollutants, is unable to identify fine-scale drivers such as construction. Further studies that use seasonal emissions inventories, particularly for waste and household burning for heat, are required to understand their contribution to pollution in December-January as they may have a disproportionate impact on pollution and human health.

TI  - Remote sensing-based framework to predict and assess the interannual variability of maize yields in Pakistan using Landsat imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting crop yields and their spatio-temporal variability under a changing climate is a challenging but essential undertaking for crop management and policymaking purposes. The availability of information on risks associated with effects of climatic variability on agricultural activity outcomes is critical for stakeholders ranging from individual landowners to national economists alike. This research was conducted as a pilot study to (1) develop satellite remote sensing based estimates of maize acreage in a typical Maize growing region in Pakistan, (2) to develop a statistical-empirical model for prediction of maize yields, and finally, (3) to assess the influence of temperature on inter-annual variability in maize yields across a decade. A total of eight machine learning algorithms were tested for identifying maize growing operations in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan using Landsat 8 imagery. Classification models were evaluated via 200 randomly selected ground-verified points across the study region. Results of the maize mapping exercise were used to estimate interannual maize yields using Landsat-derived multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data as predictors. Predictors for the yield forecasting model were selected via principal component screening and were fed into a least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO) regression model. The yield model thus developed was applied to 10 years of past data (2006-2017) and validated against data recorded by government sources. Finally, predictions spanning the ten years were tested for effects of temperature variability to find evidence of influence of ambient temperature on maize yields. Results indicate that support vector machine classifiers work the best in this landscape (accuracies 90%) and reveal that maize cropping area may be underestimated in government sources by as much as 14%. The LASSO regression models also showed very good fits (validation R-2 = 0.95) and were fairly accurate in tracking interannual variations in maize yields (R-2 = 0.78.) Results also indicate that the maximum temperature has significant negative influence (R-2 = 0.76, P < 0.0001) on maize yields in Faisalabad district. Methods presented in this study should be of use to policymakers for better formulating export-import policies and decisions governing food security issues in the larger region.

TI  - A novel model for storage dynamics simulation and inundation mapping in the prairies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian prairies are dominated by numerous depressions, which can modify the lateral transfer of water to prairie streams. Few studies were conducted to simulate the pothole dynamics using their actual spatial distributions. This study proposes a computationally efficient Prairie Region Inundation MApping (PRIMA) model as a hydrologic routing model, for a more accurate and comprehensive storage dynamics simulation and inundation mapping in the prairies. PRIMA shows potential for simulating the potholes' extents when comparing its results with remote sensing data of pothole areas with an accuracy of 85% averaged over two prairie basins in Saskatchewan, Canada. PRIMA is three similar to eight times as computationally efficient as the recently developed Wetland DEM Ponding Model (WDPM). Due to its computational efficiency and ability to provide a good simulation of inundation extents, PRIMA shows strengths as a possible tool for pothole inundation mapping and storage dynamics simulations.

TI  - Underuse of oral anticoagulants in privately insured patients with atrial fibrillation: A population being targeted by the IMplementation of a randomized controlled trial to imProve treatment with oral AntiCoagulanTs in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (IMPACT-AFib)
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Many studies showing underuse of oral anticoagulants (OACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) predated the advent of the non-vitamin K antagonist OACs. We retrospectively examined use of OACs in a large commercially insured population.Methods Administrative claims data from 4 research partners participating in FDA-Catalyst, a program of the Sentinel Initiative, were queried in September 2017. Patients were included if they were >= 30 years old with >= 365 days of medical/pharmacy coverage, and had >= 2 diagnosis codes for AF, a CHA2DS2-VASc score >= 2, absence of contraindications to OAC use, and no evidence of OAC use in the 365 days before the index AF diagnosis. The main outcome measures of the current analysis were rates of OAC use in the prior 12 months of cohort identification and factors associated with non-use.Results A total of 197,806 AF patients met the eligibility criteria prior to assessment of OAC treatment. Of these, 179,580 (91%) patients were >= 65 years old and 73,286 (37%) patients were >= 80 years old. Half of the patients (98,903) were randomized to the early intervention arm in the IMPACT-AFib trial and constitute the cohort for this analysis. Of these, 32,295 (33%) had no evidence of OAC use in the prior 12 months. Compared with patients with evidence of OAC use in the prior 12 months, patients without OAC use were more likely to be >= 80 years old, women, and have a history of anemia (51% vs 47%) and less likely to have diabetes (41% vs 44%), history of stroke or TIA (15% vs 19%), and history of heart failure (39% vs 48%).Conclusions Despite a high risk of stroke, one-third of privately insured patients with AF and no obvious contraindications to an OAC were not treated with an OAC. There is an unmet need for evidence-based interventions that could lead to greater use of OACs in patients with AF at risk for stroke.

TI  - Spectral signatures for the identification of dry forest using Sentinel-2 images over the Lower Basin of the Chira river, Piura region
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino phenomenon, droughts and the warm climate directly influence the good ecological state of the forests in the Piura Region. The objective is to relate the spectral signatures evaluated in the Sentinel-2 satellite images with the spectral signatures measured with the FieldSpec4 spectroradiometer, for the identification of dry forest in the lower basin of the Chira River, Piura regiOn. The Sentinel-2 images corresponding to the 17MNR, 17MPR, 17MMQ, 17MNQ and 17MPQ tiles are pre-processed, mosaicked, resampled and cut with the SNAP software. Stacking of bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 generates a raster whose pixel reflectance values are related to their wavelengths. The classification of dry forest areas is done with the spectral signature measured with the FieldSpec4 spectroradiometer. The validation of the results is carried out by applying the non-parametric ANOVA and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests at four sampling points. The surface area of dry forest in the lower basin of the Chira River is 129 113.06 ha, which represents 3.8% of the total area of dry forest in northern Peru.

TI  - A Combined Machine Learning and Residual Analysis Approach for Improved Retrieval of Shallow Bathymetry from Hyperspectral Imagery and Sparse Ground Truth Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping shallow bathymetry by means of optical remote sensing has been a challenging task of growing interest in recent years. Particularly, many studies exploit earlier empirical models together with the latest multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel 2, Landsat 8). However, in these studies, the accuracy of resulting bathymetry is (a) limited for deeper waters (>15 m) and/or (b) is being influenced by seafloor type albedo. This study explores further the capabilities of hyperspectral satellite imagery (Hyperion), which provides several spectral bands in the visible spectrum, along with existing reference bathymetry. Bathymetry predictors are created by applying the semi-empirical approach of band ratios on hyperspectral imagery. Then, these predictors are fed to machine learning regression algorithms for predicting bathymetry. Algorithm performance is being further compared to bathymetry predictions from multiple linear regression analysis. Following the initial predictions, the residual bathymetry values are interpolated by applying the Ordinary Kriging method. Then, the predicted bathymetry from all three algorithms along with their associated residual grids is used as predictors at a second processing stage. Validation results show that by using a second stage of processing, the root-mean-square error values of predicted bathymetry is being improved by approximate to 1 m even for deeper water (up to 25 m). It is suggested that this approach is suitable for (a) contributing wide-scale, high-resolution shallow bathymetry toward the goals of the Seabed 2030 program and (b) as a coarse resolution alternative to effort-consuming single-beam sonar or costly airborne bathymetric laser surveying.

TI  - Remote sensing of 10 years changes in the vegetation cover of the northwestern coastal land of Red Sea, Saudi Arabia
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up to date land use and land cover (LU/LC) changes information is the main source to understanding and assessing the environmental outcomes of such changes and is important for development plans. Thus, this study quantified the outlines of land cover variation of 10-years in the northwestern costal land of the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia. Two different supervised classification algorithms are visualized and evaluated to preparing a policy recommendation for the proper improvements towards better determining the tendency and the proportion of the vegetation cover changes. Firstly, to determine present vegetation structure of study area, 78 stands with a size of 50 x 50 m were analysed. Secondly, to obtain the vegetation dynamics in this area, two satellite images of temporal data sets were used; therefore, SPOT-5 images were obtained in 2004 and 2013. For each data set, four SPOT-5 scenes were placed into approximately 250-km intervals to cover the northwestern coastal land of the Red Sea. Both supervised and non-supervised cataloguing methods were attained towards organise the study area in 4-major land cover classes through using 5 various organizations algorithms. Approximately 900 points were evenly distributed within each SPOT-5 image and used for assessment accuracy. The floristic composition exhibits high diversity with 142 species and seven vegetation types were identified after multivariate analysis (VG I: Acacia tortilis-Acacia ehrenbergiana, VG II: Acacia tortilis-Stipagrostis plumosa, VG III: Zygophyllum coccineum-Zygophyllum simplex, VG IV: Acacia raddiana-Lycium shawii-Anabasis setifera, VG V: Tamarix aucheriana-Juncus rigidus, VG VI: Capparis decidua-Zygophyllum simplex and VG VII: Ayicennia marinaAristida adscensionis) and ranged between halophytic vegetation on the coast to xerophytic vegetation with scattered Acacia trees inland. The dynamic results showed rapid, imbalanced variations arises between 3-land cover classes (areas as urban, vegetation and desert). However, these findings shall serve as the baseline data for the design of rehabilitation programs that conserve biodiversity in arid regions and form treasured resources for an urban planner and decision makers to device bearable usage of land and environmental planning.

TI  - COVID-19 and its impact on environment: Improved pollution levels during the lockdown period - A case from Ahmedabad, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) hit the world severely in the first half of 2020 which forced several nations to impose severe restrictions on all sorts of activities involving human population. People were mainly advised to remain home quarantined to curb the virus spread. Industrial and vehicular movements were ceased as a result of lockdown, and therefore the rate of pollutants entering the ecosystem was also reduced in many places. Water and air pollution remained a major concern in the last few decades as these were gradually deteriorating in many spheres including the hydrosphere and atmosphere. As the nation-wide lockdown period in India completed more than two months, this study attempted to analyze the impact of lockdown on water and air quality to understand the short-term environmental changes. Using remote sensing data, this study demonstrated the improvements in ambient water quality in terms of decreased turbidity levels for a section of the Sabarmati River in the Ahmedabad region of India. The Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentrations are evaluated to underline the turbidity levels in the study area before and during the lockdown period using the Landsat 8 OLI images. We noticed that the average SPM has significantly decreased by about 36.48% when compared with the pre-lockdown period; and a drop of 16.79% was observed from the previous year's average SPM. Overall, the average SPM concentration during the lockdown period (8.08 mg/l), was the lowest when compared with pre-lockdown average and long-term (2015-2019) April month average. The atmospheric pollution level (NO2, PM2.5, and PM10) data obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board for Ahmedabad city also shows a significant improvement during the study period, implying a positive response of COVID-19 imposed lockdown on the environmental fronts.

M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of the Canadian agriculture sector to make better decisions and manage its operations more competitively in the long term is only as good as the information available to inform decision-making. At all levels of Government, a reliable flow of information between scientists, practitioners, policy-makers, and commodity groups is critical for developing and supporting agricultural policies and programs. Given the vastness and complexity of Canada's agricultural regions, space-based remote sensing is one of the most reliable approaches to get detailed information describing the evolving state of the country's environment. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC)-the Canadian federal department responsible for agriculture-produces the Annual Space-Based Crop Inventory (ACI) maps for Canada. These maps are valuable operational space-based remote sensing products which cover the agricultural land use and non-agricultural land cover found within Canada's agricultural extent. Developing and implementing novel methods for improving these products are an ongoing priority of AAFC. Consequently, it is beneficial to implement advanced machine learning and big data processing methods along with open-access satellite imagery to effectively produce accurate ACI maps. In this study, for the first time, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform was used along with an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithm and Sentinel-1, -2 images to produce an object-based ACI map for 2018. Furthermore, different limitations of the proposed method were discussed, and several suggestions were provided for future studies. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) of the final 2018 ACI map using the proposed GEE cloud method were 77% and 0.74, respectively. Moreover, the average Producer Accuracy (PA) and User Accuracy (UA) for the 17 cropland classes were 79% and 77%, respectively. Although these levels of accuracies were slightly lower than those of the AAFC's ACI map, this study demonstrated that the proposed cloud computing method should be investigated further because it was more efficient in terms of cost, time, computation, and automation.

TI  - How Do Floods and Drought Impact Economic Growth and Human Development at the Sub-National Level in India?
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper tries to shift the focus of research on the impact of natural disasters on economic growth from global and national levels to sub-national levels. Inadequate sub-national level information is a significant lacuna for planning spatially targeted climate change adaptation investments. A fixed-effect panel regression analyses of 19 states from 2001 to 2015 assess the impacts of exposure to floods and droughts on the growth of gross state domestic product (GSDP) and human development index (HDI) in India. The flood and drought exposure are estimated using satellite data. The 19 states comprise 95% of the population and contribute 93% to the national GDP. The results show that floods indeed expose a large area, but droughts have the most significant impacts at the sub-national level. The most affected GSDPs are in the non-agriculture sectors, positively by the floods and negatively by droughts. No significant influence on human development may be due to substantial investment on mitigation of flood and drought impacts and their influence on better income, health, and education conditions. Because some Indian states still have a large geographical area, profiling disasters impacts at even smaller sub-national units such as districts can lead to effective targeted mitigation and adaptation activities, reduce shocks, and accelerate income growth and human development.

TI  - Building Skills for the Future: Teaching High School Students to Utilize Remote Sensing of Wildfires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A substantial proportion of Italian students are unaware of the connection between what they learn at school and their work opportunities .This proportion would most likely increase if data were collected today, given the generation of a broad range of new jobs that has arisen due to advancements in technology. This gap between students' understanding of what they learn at school and its application to the broader world-the society, the economy and the political sphere-suggests there needs to be a rethinking of how teaching and learning at school is conceived and positioned. To help students to approach ongoing social and economic transformations, the Italian Educational Ministry (MIUR) has endorsed a school-work interchange program which, aligned with the principle of open schools, aims to provide students with work experience. It is within the scope of this initiative that we have tested high school students with remote sensing (RS) from space projects. The experience-based approach aimed to verify students' openness to the use of satellite data as a means to learn new interdisciplinary skills, to familiarize themselves with methodological knowledge and, finally, to inspire them when choosing a university or areas of future work. We engaged three cohorts, from 2017, 2018 and 2019, for a total of 40 h each year, including contact and non-contact time. The framework of each project was the same for the three cohorts and focused on the observation of Earth from space with a specific focus on wildfires. However, the initiative went beyond this, with diverse activities and tasks being assigned. This paper reports the pedagogical methods utilized with the three cohorts and how these methods were transformed and adapted in order to improve and enhance the learning outcomes. It also explores the outcomes for the students, teachers and family members, with respect to their learning and general appreciation.

TI  - PSI Clustering for the Assessment of Underground Infrastructure Deterioration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images find application in several different domains, such as land cover or land usage observation, environmental monitoring, and urbanization. This latter field has recently witnessed an interesting development with the use of remote sensing for infrastructural monitoring. In this work, we present an analysis of Sentinel-1 images, which were used to monitor the Italian provinces of Bologna and Modena located at the Emilia Region Apennines foothill. The goal of this study was the development of a machine learning-based detection system to monitor the deterioration of public aqueduct infrastructures based on Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI). We evaluated the land deformation over a temporal range of five years; these series feed a k-means clustering algorithm to separate the pixels of the region according to different deformation patterns. Furthermore, we defined the critical areas as those areas where different patterns collided or overlapped. The proposed approach provides an informative tool for the structural health monitoring of underground infrastructures.

TI  - How does the mitotic index impact patients with T1 melanoma? Comparison between the 7th and 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging system
T2  - ANAIS BRASILEIROS DE DERMATOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The mitotic index is no longer used to classify T1 melanoma patients into T1a and T1b, so it should not be used to indicate sentinel node biopsy in these patients.Objectives: To evaluate patients with T1 melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and to compare those who were classified as T1a with those classified T1b, according to the 7th and 8th Edition of the melanoma staging system, regarding a positive biopsy result. The authors also aimed to assess whether there is any difference in the results in both staging systems.Material and methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 1213 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma, from 2000 to 2015, in a single institution.Results: Of 399 patients with thin melanomas, 27 (6.7%) presented positive sentinel lymph nodes; there was no difference in positivity for sentinel node biopsy when comparing T1a vs. T1b in both staging systems. Furthermore, the clinical results were also similar between the two groups. However, in the complete cohort analysis, the mitotic index was associated with positivity for sentinel lymph node biopsy (p <0.0001), positivity for non-sentinel lymph node (p < 0.0001), recurrence-free survival (p < 0.0001), and specific melanoma survival (p=0.023).Study limitation: Unicentric study.Conclusion: The mitotic index was shown to be a very important prognostic factor in the present study, but it was not observed in patients classified as T1. The mitotic index should no longer be used as the only reason to refer sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with thin melanoma. (C) 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia.

TI  - Combination of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-1 SAR Time-Series Data for Mapping Paddy Fields in Parts of West and Central Java Provinces, Indonesia
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise of Google Earth Engine, a cloud computing platform for spatial data, has unlocked seamless integration for multi-sensor and multi-temporal analysis, which is useful for the identification of land-cover classes based on their temporal characteristics. Our study aims to employ temporal patterns from monthly-median Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band synthetic aperture radar data and cloud-filled monthly spectral indices, i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), from Landsat 8 (L8) OLI for mapping rice cropland areas in the northern part of Central Java Province, Indonesia. The harmonic function was used to fill the cloud and cloud-masked values in the spectral indices from Landsat 8 data, and smile Random Forests (RF) and Classification And Regression Trees (CART) algorithms were used to map rice cropland areas using a combination of monthly S1 and monthly harmonic L8 spectral indices. An additional terrain variable, Terrain Roughness Index (TRI) from the SRTM dataset, was also included in the analysis. Our results demonstrated that RF models with 50 (RF50) and 80 (RF80) trees yielded better accuracy for mapping the extent of paddy fields, with user accuracies of 85.65% (RF50) and 85.75% (RF80), and producer accuracies of 91.63% (RF80) and 93.48% (RF50) (overall accuracies of 92.10% (RF80) and 92.47% (RF50)), respectively, while CART yielded a user accuracy of only 84.83% and a producer accuracy of 80.86%. The model variable importance in both RF50 and RF80 models showed that vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) polarization and harmonic-fitted NDVI were identified as the top five important variables, and the variables representing February, April, June, and December contributed more to the RF model. The detection of VH and NDVI as the top variables which contributed up to 51% of the Random Forest model indicated the importance of the multi-sensor combination for the identification of paddy fields.

TI  - Developing a machine learning based cotton yield estimation framework using multi-temporal UAS data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research a machine learning framework was developed for cotton yield estimation using multi-temporal remote sensing data collected from unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The proposed machine learning model was based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and used three types of crop features derived from UAS data to predict the yield, namely; multi-temporal features including canopy cover, canopy height, canopy volume, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), excessive greenness index (ExG); non-temporal features including cotton boll count, boll size and boll volume, and irrigation status as a qualitative feature. The model provided low residual values with predicted yield values close to the observed yield values (R-2 similar to 0.9). ANN model performance was compared with support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR). Comparison results revealed that ANN model outperforms SVR and RFR. Additionally, redundant features were removed using correlation analysis, and an optimal subset of features was obtained that included canopy volume, ExG, boll count, boll volume and irrigation status. Moreover, the relative significance of each feature in the optimal input feature subset was determined using sensitivity analysis. It was found that canopy volume and ExG contributed around 50% towards the corresponding yield. Finally, further analysis was performed to investigate how early in the growing season the model can accurately predict yield. It was observed that even at 70 days after planting the model predicted yield with reasonable accuracy (R-2 of 0.72 over test set). This study revealed that UAS derived multi-temporal data along with non-temporal and qualitative data can be combined within a machine learning framework to provide a reliable estimation of crop yield and provide effective understanding for crop management.

TI  - Population exposure to particulate-matter and related mortality due to the Portuguese wildfires in October 2017 driven by storm Ophelia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In October 2017, hundreds of wildfires ravaged the forests of the north and centre of Portugal. The fires were fanned by strong winds as tropical storm Ophelia swept the Iberian coast, dragging up smoke (together with Saharan dust from north-western Africa) into higher western European latitudes. Here we analyse the long-range transport of particulate matter (PM10) and study associations between PM10 and short-term mortality in the Portuguese population exposed to PM10 due to the October 2017 wildfires, the worst fire sequence in the country over the last decades. We analysed space- and ground-level observations to track the smoke plume and dust trajectory over Portugal and Europe, and to access PM10 concentrations during the wildfires. The effects of PM10 on mortality were evaluated using satellite data for exposure and Poisson regression models. The smoke plume covered most western European countries (including Spain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands), and reached the United Kingdom, where the population was exposed in average to an additional PM10 level of 11.7 mu g/m(3) during seven smoky days (three with dust) in relation to the reference days (days without smoke or dust), revealing the impact of the wildfires on distant populations. In Portugal, the population was exposed in average to additional PM10 levels that varied from 16.2 to 120.6 mu g/m(3) in smoky days with dust and from 6.1 to 20.9 mu g/m(3) in dust-free smoky days. Results suggest that PM10 had a significant effect on the same day natural and cardiorespiratory mortalities during the month of October 2017. For every additional 10 mu g/m(3) of PM10, there was a 0.89% (95% confidence interval, CI, 0-1.77%) increase in the number of natural deaths and a 2.34% (95% CI, 0.99-3.66%) increase in the number of cardiorespiratory-related deaths. With rising temperatures and a higher frequency of storms due to climate change, PM from Iberian wildfires together with NW African dust will tend to be more often transported into Northern European countries, which may carry health threats to areas far from the ignition sites.

T2  - EPL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work we show that the second law of thermodynamics does not generally hold if the matter and gravitational fields are nonminimally coupled. We demonstrate this result by explicitly computing the evolution of the entropy of the matter fields in the case of a closed homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with dust and radiation, showing that, in this case, the sign of the entropy variation is determined by the evolution of the universe. The preservation of the second law of thermodynamics in these modified theories would require its generalization to account for a gravitational entropy contribution.

TI  - FIRED (Fire Events Delineation): An Open, Flexible Algorithm and Database of US Fire Events Derived from the MODIS Burned Area Product (2001-2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Harnessing the fire data revolution, i.e., the abundance of information from satellites, government records, social media, and human health sources, now requires complex and challenging data integration approaches. Defining fire events is key to that effort. In order to understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of fire, or the classic fire regime concept, we need to critically define fire events from remote sensing data. Events, fundamentally a geographic concept with delineated spatial and temporal boundaries around a specific phenomenon that is homogenous in some property, are key to understanding fire regimes and more importantly how they are changing. Here, we describe Fire Events Delineation (FIRED), an event-delineation algorithm, that has been used to derive fire events (N = 51,871) from the MODIS MCD64 burned area product for the coterminous US (CONUS) from January 2001 to May 2019. The optimized spatial and temporal parameters to cluster burned area pixels into events were an 11-day window and a 5-pixel (2315 m) distance, when optimized against 13,741 wildfire perimeters in the CONUS from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity record. The linear relationship between the size of individual FIRED and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) events for the CONUS was strong (R-2 = 0.92 for all events). Importantly, this algorithm is open-source and flexible, allowing the end user to modify the spatio-temporal threshold or even the underlying algorithm approach as they see fit. We expect the optimized criteria to vary across regions, based on regional distributions of fire event size and rate of spread. We describe the derived metrics provided in a new national database and how they can be used to better understand US fire regimes. The open, flexible FIRED algorithm could be utilized to derive events in any satellite product. We hope that this open science effort will help catalyze a community-driven, data-integration effort (termed OneFire) to build a more complete picture of fire.

TI  - Predicting impact of urbanization on water resources in megacity Delhi
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization to accommodate the migrating population towards urban centers in several regions of the world is burdening regional water resources. In order to efficiently manage the supply demand gap, which is getting worse with ongoing climate change, we must understand how urbanization is affecting the water availability. Urbanization is represented by an increase in impervious area, which when related to secular changes in water availability, can help us predict the future water stress. In this study we analyze the impact of urban land-use change on Delhi's water resources during time-period 2005-2016 and in future year 2031. Using Monte-Carlo simulations in Land Change Modeler (LCM), we predict the future LULC for year 2031 which exhibits similar pattern of LULC change as observed during 2005-2016. An increase of 36.49% in urban area is observed during time-period 2005-2016 and an increase of 14.05% is predicted during 2016-2031. Using in-situ groundwater measurements, the groundwater abstracted (18.75%) is found to be greater than the amount of total groundwater recharge (14.67%). Using statistical relationship, the groundwater recharge by rainwater, artificial recharge and total recharge are found to influence Delhi's groundwater availability. Also, it is estimated that a 1 km(2) increase in built-up area will decrease 0.3 million cubic meters of groundwater recharge by rainfall. This indicates an alarming future as an increase in urbanization is predicted for future in Delhi. A comparison of GRACE and in-situ data shows that both exhibit a positive correlation of 0.60 and the linear trend derived from GRACE is 2.24 cm/year and that from in-situ data is 2.68 cm/year. This indicates Delhi as water-stressed region. Such an analysis requires in-situ groundwater measurements and since, it is not readily available for every city; we have demonstrated that using GRACE satellite observed water storage change can be a viable option in in-situ data scarce regions. This study demonstrates and predicts impact of urbanization on water availability for Delhi and presents a road map to assess future water availability in various megacities across the globe.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Algae and Macrophyte Cover in Urban Lakes: A Remote Sensing Analysis of Bellandur and Varthur Wetlands in Bengaluru, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization processes and indiscriminate disposal of urban wastewaters are major causes for anthropogenic lake-sediment deposition and eutrophication. However, information about the spatial and temporal variation of macrophyte and phytoplankton distribution as indicators for water contamination is limited. To gain insights into the dynamics, we analyzed lake-cover changes of Bellandur and Varthur Lake in the S-Indian megacity of Bengaluru for the post-rainy seasons of the years 2002-2019. Supervised maximum likelihood classifications were conducted on 62 freely available, true-color satellite images in order to distinguish between macrophytes, algae, and free water surface. The image-derived results were verified by supervised classification and manual mapping of two simultaneously recorded multispectral satellite images (Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2). Seasonal interrelations between macrophytes and algae distribution were similar for both lakes. The increase in macrophyte cover during post-rainy season negatively correlated with algal abundance. Macrophyte expansion progressively suppressed algae development at both lakes, reflective of increasing eutrophication caused by on-going wastewater input. Seasonal variation in precipitation, wind direction, and temperature seemed to trigger intra-annual shifts of macrophytes and algae while similar macrophyte spread intensities during the post-monsoon season indicated independence of nutrient loads in the lake water.

TI  - Modeling Land Suitability for Rice Crop Using Remote Sensing and Soil Quality Indicators: The Case Study of the Nile Delta
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, the global food security is one of the most pressing issues for humanity, and, according to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the increasing demand for food is likely to grow by 70% until 2050. In this current condition and future scenario, the agricultural production is a critical factor for global food security and for facing the food security challenge, with specific reference to many African countries, where a large quantities of rice are imported from other continents. According to FAO, to face the Africa's inability to reach self-sufficiency in rice, it is urgent "to redress to stem the trend of over-reliance on imports and to satisfy the increasing demand for rice in areas where the potential of local production resources is exploited at very low levels" The present study was undertaken to design a new method for land evaluation based on soil quality indicators and remote sensing data, to assess and map soil suitability for rice crop. Results from the investigations, performed in some areas in the northern part of the Nile Delta, were compared with the most common approaches, two parametric (the square root, Storie methods) and two qualitative (ALES and MicrioLEIS) methods. From the qualitative point of view, the results showed that: (i) all the models provided partly similar outputs related to the soil quality assessments, so that the distinction using the crop productivity played an important role, and (ii) outputs from the soil suitability models were consistent with both the satellite Sentinel-2 Normalize Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) during the crop growth and the yield production. From the quantitative point of view, the comparison of the results from the diverse approaches well fit each other, and the model, herein proposed, provided the highest performance. As a whole, a significant increasing in R-2 values was provided by the model herein proposed, with R-2 equal to 0.92, followed by MicroLES, Storie, ALES and Root as R-2 with value equal to 0.87, 0.86, 0.84 and 0.84, respectively, with increasing percentage in R-2 equal to 5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed model illustrated that around (i) 44.44% of the total soils of the study area are highly suitable, (ii) 44% are moderately suitable, and (iii) approximately 11.56% are unsuitable for rice due to their adverse physical and chemical soil properties. The approach herein presented can be promptly re-applied in arid region and the quantitative results obtained can be used by decision makers and regional governments.

TI  - Distilling Before Refine: Spatio-Temporal Transfer Learning for Mapping Irrigated Areas Using Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes a deep learning model to deal with the spatial transfer challenge for the mapping of irrigated areas through the analysis of Sentinel-1 data. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model called "Teacher Model" is trained on a source geographical area characterized by a huge volume of samples. Then, this model is transferred from the source area to the target area characterized by a limited number of samples. The transfer learning framework is based on a distill and refine strategy, in which the teacher model is first distilled into a student model and, successively, refined by data samples coming from the target geographical area. The proposed strategy is compared with different approaches including a random forest (RF) classifier trained on the target data set and a CNN trained on the source data set and directly applied on the target area as well as several CNN classifiers trained on the target data set. The evaluation of the performed transfer strategy shows that the "distill and refine" framework obtains the best performance compared with other competing approaches. The obtained findings represent a first step toward the understanding of the spatial transferability of deep learning models in the Earth observation domain.

TI  - Intercomparison of Data-Driven and Learning-Based Interpolations of Along-Track Nadir and Wide-Swath SWOT Altimetry Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few years, a very active field of research has aimed at exploring new data-driven and learning-based methodologies to propose computationally efficient strategies able to benefit from the large amount of observational remote sensing and numerical simulations for the reconstruction, interpolation and prediction of high-resolution derived products of geophysical fields. In this paper, we investigate how they might help to solve for the oversmoothing of the state-of-the-art optimal interpolation (OI) techniques in the reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH) spatio-temporal fields. We focus on two small 10 degrees x10 degrees GULFSTREAM and 8 degrees x10 degrees OSMOSIS regions, part of the North Atlantic basin: the GULFSTREAM area is mainly driven by energetic mesoscale dynamics, while OSMOSIS is less energetic but with more noticeable small spatial patterns. Based on observation system simulation experiments (OSSE), we used a NATL60 high resolution deterministic ocean simulation of the North Atlantic to generate two types of pseudo-altimetric observational dataset: along-track nadir data for the current capabilities of the observation system and wide-swath SWOT data in the context of the upcoming SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography) mission. We briefly introduce the analog data assimilation (AnDA), an up-to-date version of the DINEOF algorithm, and a new neural networks-based end-to-end learning framework for the representation of spatio-temporal irregularly-sampled data. The main objective of this paper consists of providing a thorough intercomparison exercise with appropriate benchmarking metrics to assess whether these approaches help to improve the SSH altimetric interpolation problem and to identify which one performs best in this context. We demonstrate how the newly introduced NN method is a significant improvement with a plug-and-play implementation and its ability to catch up the small scales ranging up to 40 km, inaccessible by the conventional methods so far. A clear gain is also demonstrated when assimilating jointly wide-swath SWOT and (aggregated) along-track nadir observations.

TI  - K<sub>c</sub> and LAI Estimations Using Optical and SAR Remote Sensing Imagery for Vineyards Plots
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily or weekly irrigation monitoring conducted per sub-field or management zone is an important factor in vine irrigation decision-making. The objective is to determine the crop coefficient (Kc) and the leaf area index (LAI). Since the 1990s, optic satellite imagery has been utilized for this purpose, yet cloud-cover, as well as the desire to increase the temporal resolution, raise the need to integrate more imagery sources. The Sentinel-1 (a C-band synthetic aperture radar-SAR) can solve both issues, but its accuracy for LAI and Kc mapping needs to be determined. The goals of this study were as follows: (1) to test different methods for integrating SAR and optic sensors for increasing temporal resolution and creating seamless time-series of LAI and Kc estimations; and (2) to evaluate the ability of Sentinel-1 to estimate LAI and Kc in comparison to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. LAI values were collected at two vineyards, over three (north plot) and four (south plot) growing seasons. These values were converted to Kc, and both parameters were tested against optic and SAR indices. The results present the two Sentinel-1 indices that achieved the best accuracy in estimating the crop parameters and the best method for fusing the optic and the SAR data. Utilizing these achievements, the accuracy of the Kc and LAI estimations from Sentinel-1 were slightly better than the Sentinel-2 ' s and the Landsat-8 ' s accuracy. The integration of all three sensors into one seamless time-series not only increases the temporal resolution but also improves the overall accuracy.

TI  - InSAR-based detection method for mapping and monitoring slow-moving landslides in remote regions with steep and mountainous terrain: An application to Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring landslides in remote areas with steep and mountainous terrain is logistically challenging, expensive, and time consuming. Yet, in order to mitigate hazards and prevent loss of life in these areas, and to better understand landslide processes, high-resolution measurements of landslide activity are necessary. Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) provides millimeter-scale measurements of ground surface deformation that can be used to identify and monitor landslides in remote areas where ground based monitoring techniques are not feasible. Here we present a novel InSAR deformation detection approach, which uses double difference time-series with local and regional spatial filters and pixel clustering methods to identify and monitor slow-moving landslides without making a priori assumptions of the location of landslides. We apply our analysis to freely available Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data acquired between 2014 and 2017 centered on the Trishuli River drainage basin in Nepal. We found a minimum of 6 slow-moving landslides that all occur within the Ranimatta lithologic formation (phyllites, metasandstones, metabasics). These landslides have areas ranging from 0.39 to 1.66 km2 and long-term dry-season displacement rates ranging from 2.1 to 8.8 cm/yr. Due to periods of low coherence during the monsoon season (June - September) each year, and following the 25 April 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, our time series analysis is limited to the 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 dry seasons (September-May). We found that each of the landslides displayed slightly higher rates during the 2014 period, likely as a result of higher cumulative rainfall that fell during the 2014 monsoon season. Although we do not have high quality InSAR data to show the landslide evolution directly following the Gorkha earthquake, the similar rates of movement before (2014-2015) and after (2016-2017) Gorkha suggest the earthquake had negligible long-term impact on these landslides. Our findings highlight the potential for region-wide mapping of slow-moving landslides using freely available remote sensing data in remote areas such as Nepal and future work will benefit from expanding our methodology to other regions around the world.

AB  - We analyze the interrelation between the daily UV-B radiation and a number of factors determining the absorption of UV radiation in the atmosphere (total ozone content (TOC), cloud amount, and aerosol optical depth (AOD)). This is done using a homogeneous time series of measurements of UV-B radiation at the Tropospheric Ozone Research (TOR) station of the Institute of Atmospheric Optics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, from 2003 to 2016, satellite data on TOC, AOD data from the AERONET network, and data on cloud cover from the meteorological site of the Institute of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences. The regression equations are obtained, relating the increment of the diurnal intake of UV-B radiation as a function of the increment of TOC under different cloud conditions and atmospheric transparency.

TI  - Investigating the Long-Range Transport of Aerosol Plumes Following the Amazon Fires (August 2019): A Multi-Instrumental Approach from Ground-Based and Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite a number of studies on biomass burning (BB) emissions in the atmosphere, observation of the associated aerosols and pollutants requires continuous efforts. Brazil, and more broadly Latin America, is one of the most important seasonal sources of BB, particularly in the Amazon region. Uncertainty about aerosol loading in the source regions is a limiting factor in terms of understanding the role of aerosols in climate modelling. In the present work, we investigated the Amazon BB episode that occurred during August 2019 and made the international headlines, especially when the smoke plumes plunged distant cities such as Sao Paulo into darkness. Here, we used satellite and ground-based observations at different locations to investigate the long-range transport of aerosol plumes generated by the Amazon fires during the study period. The monitoring of BB activity was carried out using fire related pixel count from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua and Terra platforms, while the distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations and total columns were obtained from the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) onboard the METOP-A and METOP-B satellites. In addition, AERONET sun-photometers as well as the MODIS instrument made aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements over the study region. Our datasets are consistent with each other and highlight AOD and CO variations and long-range transport of the fire plume from the source regions in the Amazon basin. We used the Lagrangian transport model FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle) to simulate backward dispersion, which showed good agreement with satellite and ground measurements observed over the study area. The increase in Rossby wave activity during the 2019 austral winter the Southern Hemisphere may have contributed to increasing the efficiency of large-scale transport of aerosol plumes generated by the Amazon fires during the study period.

TI  - On the Use of Satellite Rainfall Data to Design a Dam in an Ungauged Site
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of the design peak discharge is crucial for the hydrological design of hydraulic structures. A commonly used approach is to estimate the design storm through the intensity-duration-area-frequency (IDAF) curves and then use it to generate the design discharge through a hydrological model. In ungauged areas, IDAF curves and design discharges are derived throughout regionalization studies, if any exist for the area of interest, or from using the hydrological information of the closest and most similar gauged place. However, many regions around the globe remain ungauged or are very poorly gauged. In this regard, a unique opportunity is provided by satellite precipitation products developed and improved in the last decades. In this paper, we show weaknesses and potentials of satellite data and, for the first time, we evaluate their applicability for design purposes. We employ CMORPH-Climate Prediction Center MORPHing technique satellite precipitation estimates to build IDAF curves and derive the design peak discharges for the Pietrarossa dam catchment in southern Italy. Results are compared with the corresponding one provided by a regionalization study, i.e., VAPI-VAlutazione delle Piene in Italia project, usually used in Italy in ungauged areas. Results show that CMORPH performed well for the estimation of low duration and small return periods storm events, while for high return period storms, further research is still needed.

TI  - Changes in the water resources, soil use and spatial dynamics of Caatinga vegetation cover over semiarid region of the Brazilian Northeast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian semiarid suffers from the reflex of high rainfall variability, with rainfall concentrated over time, with little spatial distribution. In this sense, presenting a highly dynamic vegetation cover, which requires constant monitoring of the changing conditions of different land uses and the utilization of water resources. The objective was to monitor and evaluate the spatial dynamics of vegetation cover of Caatinga and water availability through the vegetation index and the estimation of biophysical parameters of the energy balance, using remote sensing techniques with satellite images for a semiarid region of the Northeast Brazil. The study was developed from the digital processing of three images from the Landsat-8 satellite, with the implementation of the SEBAL algorithm. The analysis of the orbital data allowed the development of thematic maps of land cover and use, of the MNDWI vegetation index and the parameters of the water balance: evaporative fraction and relative humidity of the soil, these evaluated for their spatial variability. The main results showed a reduction of the areas covered by water bodies close to 50% (2156.18 ha), between the years 2013 to 2015. The semiarid region, in this period, also presented an annual growth of the agriculture and livestock sector in at least 3374.07 ha, followed by the reduction of the native forest of Caatinga. The conditions of changes in soil use have altered over time the spatial dynamics of the Caatinga vegetation, evidenced by changes in the response patterns obtained in the biophysical parameters of the energy balance of the Earth's surface.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of the cloud liquid water path (LWP) "land-sea" gradient retrieval from ground-based measurements of the downwelling microwave radiation near the Gulf of Finland coastline in the suburbs of Saint-Petersburg are presented. The measurements were carried out at the Department of Physics, St. Petersburg State University, by an RPG-HATPRO radiometer operating in the angular scanning mode. The inverse problem is solved by linear regression with the use of different statistical models of cloudiness for training the algorithm. Seven-year average values of the gradient of LWP for summer and winter have been obtained. The results demonstrate the presence of a positive "land-sea" gradient of LWP (larger values over the land and smaller values over the sea) in both periods, which qualitatively agrees with available satellite data.

TI  - A computationally efficient flash flood early warning system for a mountainous and transboundary river basin in Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A computationally efficient early warning technique is developed for forecasting flash floods during the pre-monsoon season that are associated with a complex topography and transboundary runoff in northeastern Bangladesh. Locally conditioned topographic and hydrometeorological observations are key forcings to the modeling system that simulate the hydrology and hydraulic processes. The hydrologic model is calibrated and validated using satellite-based observations to estimate the correct amount of transboundary and mountainous inflow into the flash flood-prone plains. Inflow is then forecasted using precipitation forecast from a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) system called the Global Forecasting System (GFS). The forecasted inflows serve as the upstream boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic model to forecast the water stage and inundation downstream in the floodplains. A real-time in-situ data-based error correction methodology is applied to maintain the skill of the system. The simulation grid size and time-step of the hydrodynamic model are also optimized for computational efficiency. Historical performance of the framework revealed at least 60% accuracy at 5-day lead-time in delineating flood inundation when compared against Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The study suggests that higher resolution topographic information and dynamically downscaled meteorological observations can lead to significant improvement in flash flood forecasting skills.

T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Drought risk quantifies the likelihood of environmental and socio-economic systems to suffer negative consequences due to drought. The analysis of drought risk is understood as the initial step to foster drought risk management at different scales and thematic foci. To communicate drought risk to stakeholders, a visualisation via risk maps is of preferable usage. Even though drought risk has been subject to investigations worldwide, a systematic review of current drought risk mapping practice is lacking.This work reviews recent practices of drought risk analysis with the aim of detangling issues of scale and focus of application, applied data, approaches to analyse risk, and drought risk mapping as generic visualisation technique. The review highlights a general lack of national and regional studies, especially in Central America as well as northern and south-eastern Asia. A majority of studies focuses specific topics, especially agriculture, but also general drought risk analyses are popular. From a methodological point of view, drought risk is based on different kinds of information: hazard, vulnerability and impact information; and combined in statistical or conceptual models. Hereby, a lack of statistical evidence for predictor selection as well as of verification of final results became evident. The majority of studies bases analysis on predictors on expert knowledge, whereas a proven suitability of the predictor to analyse the asset at risk remains questionable. The analysis of existing studies suggests that there is only little agreement on what a drought risk analysis entails. The variety of research aims and thematic foci results in a wide spectrum of drought hazard predictors and vulnerability factors applied as well as ways to analyse drought risk. Nevertheless, common paradigms of data application and combination practice were identified and resulted in the overall recommendation on considering the components of hazard predictors, vulnerability and impact information in the frame of a statistical model. Moreover, information on common practice of applied methodological approaches and data with regard to the location, spatial resolution and thematic focus of the study is provided. Furthermore, efforts to map drought risk differ widely with respect to purpose, intelligibility, and implementation details such as categorical visualisation. In order to increase intelligibility of prospective drought risk maps, basic standards have been recommended.

TI  - Alignment Technique and Quality Check of the Primary Mirror of the Siberian Lidar Station
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The techniques for alignment and quality checking of the primary 2.2-m diameter mirror of the Siberian lidar station (SLS) are suggested. The results of computer simulation of the field aberrations of the primary mirror are presented, and the area of the coma-free region is estimated. The spot diagram of the SLS primary mirror is measured based on the estimates of the image size of stars transiting through the zenith. Lidar signals are numerically simulated using ray tracing in the optical design program ZEMAX, accounting for the effect of the real spot diagram of the receiving optics. The shapes of the experimentally recorded and ray tracing simulated lidar signals are compared.

TI  - ENSO and Light-Absorbing Impurities and Their Impact on Snow Albedo in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow albedo is an important variable in the coupled atmosphere-earth system at the global level. Moreover, studying its behavior allows us to know the state of the cryosphere. The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM) is a glacier area and the northernmost tropical (10.82 degrees N, 73.75 degrees W) region in South America. It has a height of up to 5775 m.a.sl., which is the second highest mountain in the world near the marine coast. We analyzed variations in snow albedo related to snow cover, snowfall, temperature, light-absorbing impurities such as blank carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and dust, and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon through 20 years (2000-2020). We mainly use daily data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua NASA satellites. Results showed through correlations that snow albedo has decreased due to Land Surface Temperature (55%, p < 0.001), a positive phase of ENSO (42%, p < 0.001) and dust (37%, p < 0.01) in the SNSM. Additionally, a dust negative effect was more evident on the southern side (up to 49%, p < 0.001) of the SNSM. Backward trajectories by the NOAA HYSPLIT model suggest that dust sources would be soil erosion in the surrounding region. Results can help recognize the influence of ENSO and dust in the glacier decrease of the SNSM.

TI  - Increasing the classification efficiency of hyperspectral images due to multi-scale spatial processing
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of the land cover types from multi- and hyperspectral (HS) imagery is traditionally carried out on the basis of analysis of scatter plots of pixel values in a multidimensional feature space, which are used as brightness in individual channels. To increase the reliability of HS image classification, approaches are used based on simultaneously accounting for the characteristics of each pixel and the nearest-neighbor pixels, i.e., on the joint analysis of spectral and spatial features. The pixel neighborhood analysis is performed at various stages of the classification process.In this work, using a test hyperspectral image, the efficiency of spectral-spatial data classification methods that take into account spatial information at various stages of processing is studied. Special attention is paid to selecting the size of the spatial processing core. It is shown that the best results are obtained by combining pre-processing of raw data before performing the procedures of pixel-by-pixel spectral classification and post-processing of the resulting maps. Prospects of multiscale smoothing of initial images, with the increase of the number of spectral-spatial features being multiple of the number of the scales, are shown.

TI  - Assessing the effect of water scarcity on crop selection and spatial pattern of croplands in central Iran
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Farming and food production for the increasing world's population require proper preparation of a diverse range of environmental parameters especially water availability and accessibility. This study investigated the effect of water scarcity on crop selection and spatial pattern of croplands in an agricultural landscape in central Iran. Towards this aim, the main crops including wheat, alfalfa, potato, fruit trees, rice and vegetables were mapped using a combination of decision tree and object-based classifiers and four Landsat 8 images acquired from March 2015 to June 2015 with Kappa Coefficient and Overall Accuracy of 80.16 and 85.37 percent, respectively. Groundwater depth as an indicator of water availability was mapped by interpolating over 13 thousand wells and, according to the ability of farmers and available technologies to extract water, classified into four groundwater level areas (GLA). Finally, spatial pattern of crops in each GLA was investigated using four landscape-level metrics including Mean Patch Size (MPS), Mean Nearest-Neighbor distance (MNN), Contagion index (CONTAG) and Shannon's diversity (SHDI). The results of this study showed that cropping system in drier areas has shifted towards monoculture (crops with fewer water requirements such as wheat) and led to a fragmented and homogeneous landscape with large and low dispersed agricultural units. It was finally concluded that changes in crop selection and spatial pattern of croplands could be considered and applied as a precise and fast indicator of determining water availability and accessibility over large geographical regions in Iran.

TI  - Biological and anthropogenic predictors of metal concentration in the Eurasian otter, a sentinel of freshwater ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxic metals have been linked to a range of adverse health effects in freshwater organisms. However, for higher vertebrates, there is little understanding of the large-scale drivers of exposure. We quantified toxic metal/semi-metal concentrations in a sentinel freshwater top predator, the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), across England and Wales, and determined how this varied with key natural and anthropogenic factors. We related liver concentrations in 278 otters that died between 2006 and 2017 to habitat biogeochemistry, proximity to point source contamination and to biological characteristics (length, sex, condition). Evidence for any positive association with putative anthropogenic sources (mining, human population, known discharges) was weak or lacking in nearly all cases, with the exception of a positive association between lead and human population density. Despite concerns that burgeoning use of nanosilver in consumer products might increase silver concentrations in waste waters, there was no increase over time. Spatial variation in soil/sediment pH, precipitation, and soil calcium oxide are indicated as significant predictors of metal concentrations in otters (higher cadmium and silver in areas with lower pH and higher rainfall, and higher chromium and lead in areas of lower calcium oxide). Liver chromium and nickel concentrations declined significantly over time (Cr 0.030 +/- 1.2 to 0.015 +/- 1.3 mu g/g dry weight, Ni 0.0038 +/- 1.2 to 0.00068 +/- 1.5 mu g/g, between 2006-2009 and 2014-2017), but other metals showed no temporal change. Biotic associations were important, with age related accumulation indicated for mercury and cadmium (as well as interactions with body condition). Our results suggest that larger-scale geochemical and hydrological processes are important in determining metal exposure in otters, and we provide an indication of risk factors that may be of relevance for freshwater vertebrates in other countries with well-developed water pollution management.

TI  - Monitoring irrigation using landsat observations and climate data over regional scales in the Murray-Darling Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated agriculture has been identified as using approximately 72% of water globally. Australia, like many places in the world, is subject to water sharing plans that cross government boarders and are subject to a mixture of management policies. There is a pressing need to develop a method to monitor irrigation water use to aid in water resource assessments and monitoring. This paper aims to test a method previously developed which monitors irrigation water use using remotely sensed observations over the catchment scale, without the need for in-situ observations, ground data or in-depth knowledge of crops and their planting dates. Using conservative assumptions about agricultural land management practice, irrigation is calculated as Irr = AET - P. The method uses three vegetation indices derived from Landsat images to calculate crop coefficients (K-c) based on multiple published relationships. These are combined through the FAO56 methodology using gridded rainfall and two reference evapotranspiration (ETo) products to find actual evapotranspiration as AET = ETo x K-c, providing six ETo-K-c combinations. Results indicate this study method can effectively assess irrigation water use over a range of catchment sizes from similar to 6000 to similar to 600,000 ha, although issues arise when regions have a designated low allocation volume for that season (less than40%). Comparisons with the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) show that the proposed method is robust to the rapid onset and short-term droughts, However, its performance was poor during the long term droughts with low water allocation years. The study results during these years has been predominately attributed to water stress in certain crops being undetected, agricultural managers skipping annual crop commodities as well as stock and domestic water use making up larger portions of total water use. This is a limitation of this approach, although when only comparing results in years with greater than 40% allocations, the results improved significantly showing it can monitor water use effectively. When adequate water is available, this approach is able to accurately predict irrigation water use for the sites examined.

TI  - Constraining Remote River Discharge Estimation Using Reach-Scale Geomorphology
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing and the upcoming launch of the joint NASA/CNES/CSA/UKSA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite point toward improved river discharge estimates in ungauged basins. Existing discharge methods rely on "prior river knowledge" to infer parameters not directly measured from space. Here, we show that discharge estimation is improved by classifying and parameterizing rivers based on their unique geomorphology and hydraulics. Using over 370,000 in situ hydraulic observations as training data, we test unsupervised learning and an "expert" method to assign these hydraulics and geomorphology to rivers via remote sensing. This intervention, along with updates to model physics, constitutes a new method we term "geoBAM," an update of the Bayesian At-many-stations hydraulic geometry-Manning's (BAM) algorithm. We tested geoBAM on Landsat imagery over more than 7,500 rivers (108 are gauged) in Canada's Mackenzie River basin and on simulated hydraulic data for 19 rivers that mimic SWOT observations without measurement error. geoBAM yielded considerable improvement over BAM, improving the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the Mackenzie River from -0.05 to 0.26 and from 0.16 to 0.46 for the SWOT rivers. Further, NSE improved by at least 0.10 in 78/108 gauged Mackenzie rivers and 8/19 SWOT rivers. We attribute geoBAM improvement to parameterizing rivers by type rather than globally, but prediction accuracy worsens if parameters are misassigned. This method is easily mapped to rivers at the global scale and paves the way for improving future discharge estimates, especially when coupled with hydrologic models.

TI  - We Drew a Swastika of Grain: Vernacular Religion in the Tibetan Songs of Nubri, Nepal
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The academic study of Tibetan Buddhism has long emphasized the textual, philological, and monastic, and sometimes tended to ignore, dismiss, or undervalue the everyday practices and beliefs of ordinary people. In this article, I show that traditional folk songs, especially changlu, are windows into the vernacular religion of ethnically Tibetan Himalayans from the Nubri valley of Gorkha District, Nepal. While changlu literally means "beer song", and they are often sung while celebrating, they usually have deeply religious subject matter, and function to transmit Buddhist values, reinforce social or religious hierarchies, and to emplace the community in relation to the landscape and to greater Tibet and Nepal. They do this mainly through three different tropes: (1) exhortations to practice and to remember such things as impermanence and death; (2) explications of hierarchy; and (3) employment of spatialized language that evokes the man?ala. They also sometimes carry opaque references to vernacular rituals, such as "drawing a swastika of grain" after storing the harvest. In the song texts translated here, I will point out elements that reproduce a Buddhist worldview, such as references to deities, sacred landscape, and Buddhist values, and argue that they impart vernacular religious knowledge intergenerationally in an implicit, natural, and sonic way, ensuring that younger generations internalize community values organically.

TI  - Multi-source data fusion of optical satellite imagery to characterize habitat selection from wildlife tracking data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife tracking data allow monitoring of how organisms respond to spatio-temporal changes in resource availability. Remote sensing data can be used to quantify and qualify these variations to understand how movement is related to these changes. The use of remote sensing data with concurrent high levels of spatial and temporal detail may hold potential to improve our understanding of habitat selection. However, no current orbital sensor produces data with simultaneous high temporal and high spatial resolution, therefore alternative methods are required to generate remote sensing data that matches the high spatial-temporal resolution of modern wildlife tracking data. We present an analytical framework, not yet used in movement ecology, for data fusion of optical remote sensing data from multiple satellites and wildlife tracking data to study the impact of seasonal vegetation patterns on the movement of maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus). We use multi-source data fusion to combine MODIS data with higher spatial resolution data (ASTER, Landsat 4-5-7-8, CBERS 2-2B) and create a synthetic NDVI product with a 15 m spatial detail and daily temporal resolution. We also use the higher spatial resolution data to create a multi-source NDVI product with same level of spatial detail but coarser temporal resolution and data from MODIS to create a single-source NDVI product with high temporal resolution but coarse spatial resolution. We combine the three different spatial-temporal resolution NDVI products with GPS tracking data of maned wolves to create step-selection functions (SSF), which are models used in ecology to investigate and predict habitat selection by animals. The SSF model based on multi-source NDVI had the best performance predicting the probability of use of visited locations given its NDVI value. The SSF based on the raw MODIS NDVI product, one which is commonly employed by ecologists, had the poorest performance for our study species. These findings indicate that, in contrast with current practice in movement ecology, a detailed spatial resolution of contextual environmental variable may be more important than a detailed temporal resolution, when investigating wildlife habitat selection regarding vegetation, although this result will be highly dependent on species. The choice of data set should therefore take into account not only the scale of movement but also the spatial and temporal scales at which dynamic environmental variables are changing.

TI  - A cost-effectiveness analysis of sentinel lymph node detection in vulvar cancer by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy versus intraoperative detection alone
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To determine cost-effectiveness of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) for detection of inguinofemoral sentinel lymph nodes (SLN).Method. We compared the use of preoperative LSG prior to SLN excision versus omission of preoperative LSG. The two outcomes were death or survival. Costs associated with the procedure were determined by CPT code and published estimates. Cost analysis was performed using Treeage software, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. The measure of effectiveness was incremental survival benefit. ICER thresholds for considering LSG to be cost-effective were based on the value of a statistical life (VSL).Results. Using a baseline probability of 0.93 for finding SLN with LSG, our model estimated LSG costs were $2783.84 with 84.7% survival. Our model then estimated the cost and survival without LSG by varying the SLN detection rate. Survival was equivalent when probability of SLN detection without LSG was 0.93. If detection without LSG was >0.93, not performing LSG was the dominant strategy. Costs were equal when probability of finding SLN without LSG was 0.6. For any SLN detection without LSG below 0.6, performing LSG was the dominant strategy. Formal cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using ICERs for probabilities from 0.60 to 0.93. In this range, costs were higher with LSG, but survival was improved. As long as the incremental detection with LSG was at least 1.05% to 1.47% higher, LSG was cost-effective with ICERs below the VSL.Conclusion. In our model, LSG is cost-effective as long as it increases detection of SLN by at least 1.05-1.47%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of low-volume metastasis on disease-free survival of women with early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We aimed to assess the impact of low-volume metastasis (micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells) on disease-free survival (DFS) of women with early-stage cervical cancer. Methods Women with clinically suspected stage 1A-IB2 (FIGO 2018 classification) disease who underwent retroperitoneal nodal staging between October 2010 and April 2018, were retrospectively analyzed. The group of women who had undergone lymphadenectomy and standard node pathologic analysis (H&E group), were compared to the group undergoing sentinel node mapping (SLN) and ultrastaging with or without lymphadenectomy (ultrastaging group). At a median follow-up of 45 months, the DFS curves were analyzed. Results Overall, 573 patients were revised (272 in the H&E group and 302 in the ultrastaging group). Eighty-five patients presented lymph node metastasis (32 in H&E, 53 in ultrastaging). Ultrastaging protocol increased the rate of low-volume metastasis by 5.6%. Twenty patients showed exclusive micrometastasis or ITC's. Seventy-three recurrences occurred (35 in H&E, 38 in ultrastaging). Only 1 out of 53 patients in the ultrastaging group (1.9%) presented with micrometastasis recurred. The 3-year disease-free survival was 89% for the H&E group, and 88% for the ultrastaging group, respectively (p = 0.175). Conclusion Ultrastaging analysis allowed increasing the detection of low volume metastasis in women with early-stage cervical cancer. However, the type of nodal staging did not have an impact on patients' 3-year disease-free survival.

TI  - Evaluation of HF Radar Wave Measurements in Iberian Peninsula by Comparison with Satellite Altimetry and in Situ Wave Buoy Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The skills of CODAR SeaSonde coastal high-frequency radars (HFR) located in the West Iberian Peninsula on measuring wave parameters are compared to in situ (buoy) and satellite altimeters (SA) wave observations. Significant wave heights (SWH), wave periods, and wave directions are compared over a time window of 36-months, from January 2017 to December 2019. The ability of HFR systems to capture extreme wave events is also assessed by comparing SWH measurements during the Emma storm, which hit the Iberian Peninsula in March 2018. The analysis presented in this study shows a slight overestimation of the SWH by the HFR systems. Comparisons with in situ observations revealed correlation coefficients (R) of the order of 0.69-0.87, biases below 0.60 m, root-mean-squared errors (RMSE) between 0.89 m to 1.18 m, and a slope regression between 1.01 and 1.26. Using buoy observations as reference ground truth, the comparisons with SA revealed Rs higher than 0.94, biases under 0.19 m, and RMSEs between 0.17 m and 0.42 m. Since in situ observations do not overlap all the HFR range cells (RC), and its correlation coefficients with SA have shown good agreement (R > 0.94), Sentinel-3 SA (SRAL) SWH measurements are further used for the validation of the HFR systems SWH observations. The comparison between the HFR and the SA collocated SWH observations allowed the evaluation of the ability of the radars to retrieve wave data as a function of the distance to the coast, particularly during extreme wave events. The comparison of the lower frequency (4.86 MHz) HFR coastal radars with the SA measurements showed an R of 0.94-0.99, a negative but reduced bias (-0.37), and an RMSE of 0.53 m. The higher frequency HFR systems (12-13.5 MHz) showed R between 0.53 and 0.82, and a clear overestimation of the SWH by the HFR sites.

TI  - A Remote Sensing-Based Approach to Management Zone Delineation in Small Scale Farming Systems
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-scale farms represent about 80% of the farming area of China, in a context where they need to produce economic and environmentally sustainable food. The objective of this work was to define management zone (MZs) for a village by comparing the use of crop yield proxies derived from historical satellite images with soil information derived from remote sensing, and the integration of these two data sources. The village chosen for the study was Wangzhuang village in Quzhou County in the North China Plain (NCP) (30 degrees 51 ' 55 '' N; 115 degrees 02 ' 06 '' E). The village was comprised of 540 fields covering approximately 177 ha. The subdivision of the village into three or four zones was considered to be the most practical for the NCP villages because it is easier to manage many fields within a few zones rather than individually in situations where low mechanization is the norm. Management zones defined using Landsat satellite data for estimation of the Green Normalized Vegetation Index (GNDVI) was a reasonable predictor (up to 45%) of measured variation in soil nitrogen (N) and organic carbon (OC). The approach used in this study works reasonably well with minimum data but, in order to improve crop management (e.g., sowing dates, fertilization), a simple decision support system (DSS) should be developed in order to integrate MZs and agronomic prescriptions.

TI  - Drivers of plant species richness and structure in dry woodland of <i>Prosopis flexuosa</i>
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prosopis flexuosa (Fabaceae), a key species in desert environments, provides ecosystem services whereby it mitigates desertification and supports biodiversity conservation. To understand the relative importance of drivers of species diversity and structure of P. flexuosa-dominated woodland at different scales, we propose (1) to assess whether species richness is affected by predictors such as productivity, woodland structure, soil heterogeneity, mammal occurrence, and human activities; (2) to assess whether woodland structure is explained by productivity, soil heterogeneity, mammal occurrence and human activities; (3) to determine whether productivity and human activities affect mammal occurrence. We quantified drivers and indicators of composition and structure of P. flexuosa-dominated woodland in Ischigualasto Provincial Park and its area of impact, using both field- and remotely-based measurements. Plant species richness was positively explained by texture measures of the Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index at 3x3 (0.81 ha) and 5x5 (2.25 ha) moving-window scales, as a surrogate for productivity, and by abundance of trees in the woodland stand (0.15 ha). The structure of P. flexuosa-dominated woodland was positively accounted for by productivity at the 5x5 moving-window scale and by occurrence of exotic species (positively -Bos taurus- and negatively -Lepus europaeus-). Soil heterogeneity and human activities did not affect woodland richness or structure. Occurrence of native species was explained by productivity at the 5x5 moving-window scale (positively for Microcavia maenas and negatively for Dolichotis patagonum), whereas occurrence of native (Lama guanicoe) and exotic (Equus asinus) species was affected by human activities (positively for distance to nearest village and negatively for distance to mad, respectively). Understanding the relationships of dry woodland species richness and structure with different drivers is important to its conservation and management. We found that drivers such as productivity, abundance of trees and occurrence of exotic mammal species would affect richness and structure of P. flexuosa-dominated woodland.

TI  - Deep learning for agricultural land use classification from Sentinel-2
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of deep learning techniques for remote sensing applications has recently increased. These algorithms have proven to be successful in estimation of parameters and classification of images. However, little effort has been made to make them understandable, leading to their implementation as "black boxes". This work aims to evaluate the performance and clarify the operation of a deep learning algorithm, based on a bi-directional recurrent network of long short-term memory (2-BiLSTM). The land use classification in the Valencian Community based on Sentinel-2 image time series in the framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is used as an example. It is verified that the accuracy of the deep learning techniques is superior (98.6 % overall success) to that other algorithms such as decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF). The performance of the classifier has been studied as a function of time and of the predictors used. It is concluded that, in the study area, the most relevant information used by the network in the classification are the images corresponding to summer and the spectral and spatial information derived from the red and near infrared bands. These results open the door to new studies in the field of the explainable deep learning in remote sensing applications.

TI  - Drift path of green tide and the impact of typhoon "Chan-hom" in the Chinese Yellow Sea based on GOCI images in 2015
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2007, green tide disasters have occurred in Chinese Yellow Sea for 11 consecutive years. The continuous outbreak of green tides has caused various degrees of economic loss and ecological damage to coastal areas. In this study, we use GF1-WFV (GaoFen No.1-Wide Field of View) high resolution images and GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) images comprehensively. NDVI (Normalized vegetation index), linear decomposition model of mixed pixels (LDMMP) and artificially assisted interpretation methods were used to monitor the green tide eruptions in the Yellow Sea in 2015. The impact of the typhoon "Chan-hom" on the green tide growth process and drift path were analyzed for the first time. The results showed that: The accuracy of extracting green tide area by LDMMP method is higher than that of NDVI. Based on GOCI images, the distribution of green tides in the study area in 2015 was obtained using the LDMMP method; From May to August, the green tide in the Yellow Sea has undergone the process of "emergence-development-explosion-decline-disappearance"; Typhoon "Chan-hom" changed the path of the green tide continuing to the north to a certain extent and drifted to the southeast, causing the center of the green tide to move to Lianyungang Eastern waters.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatial and Temporal Variations in The Water Surface and Floating Algal Bloom Areas in Dongting Lake Using a Long-Term MODIS Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant water quality changes have been observed in the Dongting Lake region due to environmental changes and the strong influence of human activities. To protect and manage Dongting Lake, the long-term dynamics of the water surface and algal bloom areas were systematically analyzed and quantified for the first time based on 17 years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The traditional methods (index-based threshold algorithms) were optimized by a dynamic learning neural network (DL-NN) to extract and identify the water surface area and algal bloom area while reducing the extraction complexity and improving the extraction accuracy. The extraction accuracy exceeded 94.5% for the water and algal bloom areas, and the analysis showed decreases in the algal bloom and water surface areas from 2001-2017. Additionally, the variations in the water surface and algal bloom areas are greatly affected by human activities and climatic factors. The results of these analyses can help us better monitor human contamination in Dongting Lake and take measures to control the water quality during certain periods, which is crucial for future management. Moreover, the traditional methods optimized by the DL-NN used in this study can be extended to other inland lakes to assess and monitor long-term temporal and spatial variations in algal bloom areas and can also be used to acquire baseline information for future assessments of the water quality of lakes.

TI  - Thick cloud removal in Landsat images based on autoregression of Landsat time-series data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thick-cloud contamination causes serious missing data in Landsat images, which substantially limits applications of these images. To remove thick clouds from Landsat data, the most popular methods employ auxiliary data such as a cloud-free image of the same area acquired on another date (referred to as the "reference image"). However, the performance of most previous methods strongly depends on the usefulness of the specific reference image, but in some cases high-quality cloud-free reference images are rarely available. In addition, some of these methods ignore the use of partially cloud-contaminated reference images, but clear pixels in these images can be very useful. To address these issues, a new cloud-removal method (AutoRegression to Remove Clouds (ARRC)) has been developed in this study. The most important improvement of ARRC is that it considers autocorrelation of Landsat time-series data and employs multi-year Landsat images including partially cloud-contaminated images in the cloud-removing process. ARRC also addresses the cases in which autocorrelation of Landsat time series might be adversely affected by abrupt land cover changes over multiple years. We compared ARRC with the widely-used MNSPI (modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator) method at four challenging sites, including an urban area in Beijing and three croplands, in the North China Plain, northeastern Vietnam, and Iowa, USA. Results from the cloud-simulated images showed that ARRC performed better than MNSPI and achieved lower RMSE values (e.g., 0.02129 vs. 0.03005, 0.03293 vs. 0.04725, 0.02740 vs. 0.03556, and 0.03303 vs. 0.03973 in the near-infrared band at the four testing sites, respectively). Moreover, the experiments demonstrated improved performance when clear pixels in partially cloud-contaminated images were used by ARRC. Furthermore, cloud-free images reconstructed by ARRC were visually better than those reconstructed by MNSPI when both approaches were applied to actual cloud-contaminated Landsat images.

TI  - Assessment of Freeze-Thaw Hazards and Water Features along the China-Russia Crude Oil Pipeline in Permafrost Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-Russia crude oil pipeline (CRCOP) traverses rivers, forests, and mountains over permafrost regions in northeastern China. Water accumulates beside the pipe embankment, which disturbs the hydrothermal balance of permafrost underlying the pipeline. Ground surface flows along the pipeline erode the pipe embankment, which threatens the CRCOP's operational safety. Additionally, frost heave and thaw settlement can induce differential deformation of the pipes. Therefore, it is necessary to acquire the spatial distribution of water features along the CRCOP, and analyze the various hazard probabilities and their controlling factors. In this paper, information regarding the permafrost type, buried depth of the pipe, soil type, landforms, and vegetation were collected along the CRCOP every 2 km. Ponding and erosive damage caused by surface flows were measured via field investigations and remote sensing images. Two hundred and sixty-four pond sites were extracted from Landsat 8 images, in which the areas of 46.8% of the ponds were larger than 500 m(2). Several influential factors related to freeze-thaw hazards and erosive damage were selected and put into a logistic regression model to determine their corresponding risk probabilities. The results reflected the distributions, and forecasted the occurrences, of freeze-thaw hazards and erosive damage. The sections of pipe with the highest risks of freeze-thaw and erosive damage accounted for 2.4% and 6.7%, respectively, of the pipeline. Permafrost type and the position where runoff encounters the pipeline were the dominant influences on the freeze-thaw hazards, while the runoff-pipe position, buried depth of the pipe, and landform types played a dominant role in erosive damage along the CRCOP. Combined with the geographic information system (GIS), field surveys, image interpretation and model calculations are effective methods for assessing the various hazards along the CRCOP in permafrost regions.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to assess the image-based and physical atmospheric corrections of Landsat 8 images for geological mapping. This study was carried out in the central Jebilet inlier in Moroccan anti atlas, which is characterized by its geological diversity, its mining potential and an arid climate. Two physical atmospheric corrections FLAASH (Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes) and ATCOR (Atmospheric & Topographic Correction) were compared to the DOS1 (Dark Object Subtraction) image-based method. The assessment of the results was based on the ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices) spectroradiometric data as well as the SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifications issued from the atmospherically corrected images. The FLAASH provided the most accurate Bottom Of Atmosphere BOA reflectance estimation (R-2 = 0.95 and RMSE = 0.033) and slightly outperformed the DOS1 method (R-2 = 0.94 and RMSE = 0.034). For the SVM classification outputs, DOS1 gave results almost similar to those obtained by FLAASH and ATCOR. The similarity between the FLAASH and DOS1 SVM classifications was 97.77%. The results of this work demonstrate the effectiveness of the image-based method in atmospheric correction of multispectral data for geological and mineral mapping over the arid and semi-arid regions. The image-based atmospheric correction method is proved as an accurate, simple way and very straightforward to apply.

TI  - Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Sentinel Node Tracer Injection: Effects on Breast MRI Quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the MRI artifact rendered by the typical injection of a ferromagnetic tracer now being intermittently used for intraoperative sentinel node (SN) identification at our institution, and to explore its impact on postoperative imaging and management.Methods: This study was Institutional Review Board-approved and granted a waiver of consent. A database search tool was used to identify MRI exams performed on patients who had previously undergone breast-conserving surgery with use of a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) SN tracer between January 1, 2015, and May 1, 2020. MRI reports, images, and relevant demographic, oncologic, and surgical history were collected. The presence or absence of SPIO residue on breast MRI, as well as its impact on image quality, were extracted from the prospective reports.Results: A total of 21 MRI exams were identified in 16 patients who had undergone breast-conservation therapy for cancer with use of SPIO SN tracer. Mean time from particle injection to baseline postoperative MRI exam was 10.8 months. All reports (21/21) noted evidence of SPIO residue. Of these, 5/21 were assessed as non-diagnostic; the remainder were assessed as limited.Conclusion: Radiologists should be aware of the use of superparamagnetic tracers for SN identification and the impact on the quality of future MRI examinations. Alternative injection approaches are being developed and sequence parameters adjusted to minimize artifact.

TI  - Geographic Distribution of Desert Locusts in Africa, Asia and Europe Using Multiple Sources of Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In history, every occurrence of a desert locust plague has brought a devastating blow to local agriculture. Analyses of the potential geographic distribution and migration paths of desert locusts can be used to better monitor and provide early warnings about desert locust outbreaks. By using environmental data from multiple remote-sensing data sources, we simulate the potential habitats of desert locusts in Africa, Asia and Europe in this study using a logistic regression model that was developed based on desert locust monitoring records. The logistic regression model showed high accuracy, with an average training area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.84 and a kappa coefficient of 0.75. Our analysis indicated that the temperature and leaf area index (LAI) play important roles in shaping the spatial distribution of desert locusts. A model analysis based on data for six environmental variables over the past 15 years predicted that the potential habitats of desert locust present a periodic movement pattern between 40 degrees N and 30 degrees S latitude. The area of the potential desert locust habitat reached a maximum in July, with a suitable area exceeding 2.77 x 10(7) km(2) and located entirely between 0 degrees N and 40 degrees N in Asia-Europe and Africa. In December, the potential distribution of desert locusts reached its minimum area at 0.68 x 10(7) km(2) and was located between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S in Asia and Africa. According to the model estimates, desert locust-prone areas are distributed in northern Ethiopia, South Sudan, northwestern Kenya, the southern Arabian Peninsula, the border area between India and Pakistan, and the southern Indian Peninsula. In addition, desert locusts were predicted to migrate from east to west between these areas and in Africa between 10 degrees N and 17 degrees N. Countries in these areas should closely monitor desert locust populations and respond rapidly.

TI  - Biophysical impacts of Earth greening largely controlled by aerodynamic resistance
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations show widespread increasing trends of leaf area index (LAI), known as the Earth However, the biophysical impacts of this greening on land surface temperature (LST) remain unclear. Here, quantify the biophysical impacts of Earth greening on LST from 2000 to 2014 and disentangle the contributions of different factors using a physically based attribution model. We find that 93% of the global vegetated area shows negative sensitivity of LST to LAI increase at the annual scale, especially for semiarid woody vegetation. Further considering the LAI trends (P <= 0.1), 30% of the global vegetated area is cooled by these trends and 5% is warmed. Aerodynamic resistance is the dominant factor in controlling Earth greening's biophysical impacts: The increase in LAI produces a decrease in aerodynamic resistance, thereby favoring increased turbulent heat transfer between the land and the atmosphere, especially latent heat flux.

TI  - Characteristics of the Residual Surface Deformation of Multiple Abandoned Mined-Out Areas Based on a Field Investigation and SBAS-InSAR: A Case Study in Jilin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Residual surface deformation resulting from abandoned mined-out areas can lead to severe damage to ground structures (e.g., buildings and infrastructure in mining areas) and the local ecological environment. Long-term monitoring and analyses of surface deformation characteristics of abandoned mined-out areas are significant for preventing potential disasters. In this study, a detailed field investigation first was conducted in Ying'an and Baoshan coal mines located in Jilin Province, China, to survey mining-induced disasters in the mining areas. Based on the 40 Sentinel-1A images acquired from 14 February 2017 to 17 May 2020, small baseline subset interferometry synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology was employed to obtain the time-series residual surface deformation. Validation of the SBAS-derived results is performed by comparing with the results obtained via leveling measurements. The root mean square error (RMSE) between SBAS-derived and leveling measurements results was found to be 1.144 mm, reflecting a fairly good agreement. Furthermore, the ordinary Kriging interpolation approach was adopted to obtain information on the deformation across the entire area. The spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of the derived subsidence bowls in multiple mined-out areas were revealed. The deformation characteristics for the abandoned mined-out areas in different periods were not completely consistent. Finally, the potential mechanism underlying the inconsistency in the subsidence associated with underground coal exploitation is analyzed. The findings of this study can provide insights into local construction and ecological improvement as well as guidance for the prediction of deformation in abandoned mined-out areas.

TI  - Monitoring lake level changes in China using multi-altimeter data (2016-2019)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in lake levels are an important indicator of water balance and climate change. However, it is not feasible to perform continuous in situ measurements for a large number of lakes in China. Satellite altimetry has been used successfully to monitor water levels of inland lakes in recent years. In this study, through waveform retracking, lake level estimation, lake level time series construction, multi-altimeter time series fusion and outlier detection, changes in water level of 340 lakes (> 10 km(2)) in China between 2016 and 2019 were monitored using multi-altimeter data from Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-3, and Sentinel-3A. Overall, the water levels of these lakes showed a mean increasing trend of 0.343 m/yr. The water levels of 274 lakes have a mean increasing trend of 0.465 m/yr and those of 66 showed a mean decreasing trend of -0.164 m/yr. The annual rate of change of lake water levels increased from south to north and decreased from west to east in terms of spatial distribution. The changes in lake level varied among different basins owing to their high spatial heterogeneity: most lakes in the Songhua and Liao River Basin and Yellow River Basin showed an increasing trend; all lakes in the Huai River Basin were relatively steady; 14 of 19 lakes in the Yangtze River Basin showed a decreasing trend; the great majority of lakes in the Inland River Basin showed an increasing trend; and the lakes located in the southeastern Qiangtang Basin, near the Nyainqen Tanglha Mountain, showed a decreasing trend. In addition, some lakes in the western Qiangtang Basin also showed a decreasing trend. Factor analysis indicated that the factors driving changes in lake level varied among different areas. However, temperature changes in autumn and winter were significantly correlated with changes in lake level.

TI  - Estimation of anthropogenic heat emissions in China using Cubist with points-of-interest and multisource remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and industrialization in China stimulated the great increase of energy consumption, which leads to drastic rise in the emission of anthropogenic waste heat. Anthropogenic heat emission (AHE) is a crucial component of urban energy budget and has direct implications for investigating urban climate and environment. However, reliable and accurate representation of AHE across China is still lacking. This study presented a new machine learning-based top-down approach to generate a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) benchmark dataset at 1 km spatial resolution for China in 2010. Cubist models were constructed by fusing points-of-interest (POI) data of varying categories and multisource remote sensing data to explore the nonlinear relationships between various geographic predictors and AHE from different heat sources. The strategy of developing specific models for different components and exploiting the complementary features of POIs and remote sensing data generated a more reasonable distribution of AHF. Results showed that the AHF values in urban centers of metropolises over China range from 60 to 190 W m(-2). The highest AHF values were observed in some heavy industrial zones with value up to 415 W m(-2). Compared with previous studies, the spatial distribution of AHF from different heating components was effectively distinguished, which highlights the potential of POI data in improving the precision of AHF mapping. The gridded AHF dataset can serve as input of urban numerical models and can help decision makers in targeting extreme heat sources and polluters in cities and making differentiated and tailored strategies for emission mitigation.

TI  - Decision-level fusion of Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 OLI texture features for crop discrimination and classification: case of Masvingo, Zimbabwe
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar imagery have few polarization bands which can limit the ability to do traditional digital classification. Harmonization of Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 data despite having complementary texture information can be a challenge. The objectives of this paper are to explore texture features derived from Landsat 8 OLI and dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR speckle filtered and unfiltered backscatter, to aggregate classification results using Decision-Level Fusion (DLF), and to evaluate the performance of decision-level fused maps. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is employed to derive sets of seven texture features for Landsat 8 bands and VV + VH backscatter using 5 x 5, 7 x 7, 9 x 9, and 11 x 11 window sizes. Each texture feature is stacked with a respective source image and classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Classified maps from the best three performers from both speckle filtered and unfiltered are aggregated with classified maps from Landsat 8 using plurality voting algorithm and compared using Z-test. Results indicate an overall classification accuracy of 96.02% from DLF images of Landsat and non-speckle filtered maps, whereas Landsat and speckle filtered achieved 94.69%. The best texture information are derived from the blue band followed by the red band, whereas speckle unfiltered textures performed better than speckle filtered textures. We conclude that integration of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1, either speckle filtered or unfiltered, improves crop classification and speckles do not have statistically significant effects (p = 0.1208).

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring Method for Groundwater Level on Aeolian Desertification Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is one of the most important natural resources. Regional groundwater depth is an important parameter for understanding groundwater resources and maintaining sustainable development of water resources and environment. The middle reaches of the Tarim River in Xinjiang are the most primitive and well-preserved place in the world, which provides valuable resources in studying the response mechanism of surface vegetation to the groundwater level. The ecological environment of Tarim River Basin has been deteriorating, and Populuseuphratica forest has died, which is directly related to the decrease of water inflow and groundwater level around the Tarim River. To obtain the spatial distribution of the groundwater level, this study uses the MODIS satellite remote sensing image data and the remote sensing-mathematical-model of a fusion science research methods, based on the field investigation of the groundwater level, soil moisture, and other supporting information on Aeolian desertification area in the middle reaches of Tarim River in Xinjiang. Through the experimental equation of the soil moisture and groundwater level, a simple and effective remote sensing method was proposed. This method is used to evaluate the spatial distribution of groundwater level based on the MODIS image data when there is capillary supply in the soil. This model was field-proven on the desertification area in the middle reaches of Tarim River. The results indicate that the correlation coefficient between the inversion of groundwater depth and the measured groundwater level is 0.89, which are realistic with small errors. So it is feasible to monitor and assess the spatial distribution of groundwater table depth in desertification areas with a large groundwater depth of 6 m or less. This study is helpful to provide critical area for the ecological environment monitoring and restoration, and ultimately serve the sustainable development of water and environment.

TI  - A Conditional Probability Interpolation Method Based on a Space-Time Cube for MODIS Snow Cover Products Gap Filling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow cover is closely related to regional climate and hydrological processes. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover products from 2001 to 2018 were applied to analyze the snow cover variation in northern Xinjiang, China. As cloud obscuration causes significant spatiotemporal discontinuities in the binary snow cover extent (SCE), we propose a conditional probability interpolation method based on a space-time cube (STCPI) to remove clouds completely after combining Terra and Aqua data. First, the conditional probability that the central pixel and every neighboring pixel in a space-time cube of 5 x 5 x 5 with the same snow condition is counted. Then the snow probability of the cloud pixels reclassified as snow is calculated based on the space-time cube. Finally, the snow condition of the cloud pixels can be recovered by snow probability. The validation experiments with the cloud assumption indicate that STCPI can remove clouds completely and achieve an overall accuracy of 97.44% under different cloud fractions. The generated daily cloud-free MODIS SCE products have a high agreement with the Landsat-8 OLI image, for which the overall accuracy is 90.34%. The snow cover variation in northern Xinjiang, China, from 2001 to 2018 was investigated based on the snow cover area (SCA) and snow cover days (SCD). The results show that the interannual change of SCA gradually decreases as the elevation increases, and the SCD and elevation have a positive correlation. Furthermore, the interannual SCD variation shows that the area of increase is higher than that of decrease during the 18 years.

TI  - Joint retrieval of the aerosol fine mode fraction and optical depth using MODIS spectral reflectance over northern and eastern China: Artificial neural network method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) of atmospheric aerosol is very important for environment and climate studies. Attempts have been made to retrieve the FMF from satellite data with varying success. In this work, the development of an artificial Neural Network for AEROsol retrieval (NNAero) is presented. NNAero uses data from the NASA MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flying on the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites. The MODIS-derived spectral reflectances of solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface were used together with ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and FMF to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the joint retrieval of FMF and AOD. The NNAero results over northern and eastern China were validated against an independent reference AERONET dataset (i.e. not used in training the CNN). The results show that 68% of the NNAero AOD values are within the MODIS expected error (EE) envelope over land of +/-(0.05 + 15%), which is similar to the results from the MODIS Deep Blue (DB) algorithm (63% within EE), and both are better than the Dark Target (DT) algorithm (31% within EE). The validation of the NNAero FMF vs AERONET data shows a significant improvement with respect to the DT FMF, with Root Mean Squared Prediction Errors (RMSE) of 0.1567 (NNAero) and 0.34 (DT). The NNAero method shows the potential of improved retrieval of the FMF.

TI  - An Unsupervised Urban Extent Extraction Method from NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accelerating trend of global urbanization accompanying various environmental and urban issues makes frequently urban mapping. Nighttime light data (NTL) has shown great advantages in urban mapping at regional and global scales over long time series because of its appropriate spatial and temporal resolution, free access, and global coverage. However, the existing urban extent extraction methods based on nighttime light data rely on auxiliary data and training samples, which require labor and time for data preparation, leading to the difficulty to extract urban extent at a large scale. This study seeks to develop an unsupervised method to extract urban extent from nighttime light data rapidly and accurately without ancillary data. The clustering algorithm is applied to segment urban areas from the background and multi-scale spatial context constraints are utilized to reduce errors arising from the low brightness areas and increase detail information in urban edge district. Firstly, the urban edge district is detected using spatial context constrained clustering, and the NTL image is divided into urban interior district, urban edge district and non-urban interior district. Secondly, the urban edge pixels are classified by an adaptive direction filtering clustering. Finally, the full urban extent is obtained by merging the urban inner pixels and the urban pixels in urban edge district. The proposed method was validated using the urban extents of 25 Chinese cities, obtained by Landsat8 images and compared with two common methods, the local-optimized threshold method (LOT) and the integrated night light, normalized vegetation index, and surface temperature support vector machine classification method (INNL-SVM). The Kappa coefficient ranged from 0.687 to 0.829 with an average of 0.7686 (1.80% higher than LOT and 4.88% higher than INNL-SVM). The results in this study show that the proposed method is a reliable and efficient method for extracting urban extent with high accuracy and simple operation. These imply the significant potential for urban mapping and urban expansion research at regional and global scales automatically and accurately.

TI  - Characteristics of Fengyun-4A Satellite Atmospheric Motion Vectors and Their Impacts on Data Assimilation
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The high observation efficiency, scanning speed and observation frequency of the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite indicates the progress of Chinese geostationary meteorological satellites. The characteristics of FY-4A atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) derived from the high-level water vapor (WV-High) channel, mid-level water vapor (WV-Mid) channel, and infrared (IR) channel of FY-4A are analyzed, and their corresponding observation errors estimated. Then, the impacts of single-channel and multi-channel FY-4A AMVs on RMAPS-ST (the Rapid-refresh Multi-scale Analysis and Prediction System-Short Term) are evaluated based on one-month data assimilation cycling and forecasting experiments. Results show that the observation errors of FY-4A AMVs from the three channels have an explicit vertical structure. Results from the cycling experiments indicate that the assimilation of AMVs from WV-High produces more apparent improvement of the wind in the upper layer, while a more positive effect in the lower layer is achieved by the assimilation of AMVs from IR. Furthermore, the assimilation of AMVs from IR is more skillful for medium and moderate precipitation than from other channels owing to the good quality of data in the lower layer in the AMVs from IR. Assimilation of FY-4A AMVs from the three channels could combine the advantages of assimilation from each individual channel to improve the wind in the upper, middle and lower layers simultaneously.

TI  - DESTIN: A new method for delineating the boundaries of crop fields by fusing spatial and temporal information from WorldView and Planet satellite imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital boundaries of crop fields represent a prerequisite for designing parcel-based crop management platforms, implementing online site-specific agronomic practices and monitoring crop growth per field. Previous approaches on field boundary delineation were mostly developed with medium resolution imagery (e.g., Landsat) for the regions or countries with intensive agriculture and large-sized crop fields. However, suitable delineation methods are scarce for the regions in developing countries where the majority of arable land is cultivated by smallholder farmers and distributed in small and fragmented crop fields. This study proposed a comprehensive method, delineation by fusing spatial and temporal information (DESTIN), to derive the boundaries of crop fields from sub-meter WorldView-2/3 and 3-m Planet imagery. After extraction of spatial objects from very high resolution (VHR) WorldView imagery, this method performed recognition of crop field objects using high resolution (HR) Planet-derived temporal features specifically concerning soil preparation and harvesting stages for summer crops. The performance of DESTIN in crop field boundary delineation was evaluated with the reference polygons (0.4-1.0 ha in area on average) over four subset areas in eastern China's Jiangsu province, and further compared with a benchmark objection extraction approach.The results demonstrated that the integration of WorldView and Planet imagery as demanded by DESTIN yielded accurate recognition of crop fields with the classification overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 94.98% to 98.84%, which was remarkably improved over the use of WorldView or Planet imagery alone with increases in OA from 12% to 17%. The majority of crop field boudaries were successfully delineated with both methods, but DESTIN produced cleaner polygons than the benchmark appraoch and closer matches of field boundaries to the reference. DESTIN also yielded better one-to-one matches between delineations and reference (77% as opposed to 54%) and fewer one-to-many matches (1% as opposed to 33%) as a reflection of being less prone to over segmentation. The DESTIN method does not need subjective parameterization for image segmentation, and could be applicable to the areas with availability of bi-temporal VHR imagery over the soil preparation and harvesting stages and HR imagery over the peak growth stage of summer crops. It has great potential for delineating the crop field boundaries in smallholder farming systems with VHR imagery acquired from satellite, airborne or unmanned aerial vehicle platforms.

TI  - Using SPOT Data and FRAGSTAS to Analyze the Relationship between Plant Diversity and Green Space Landscape Patterns in the Tropical Coastal City of Zhanjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces provide a host of ecosystem services, the quantity and structure of which play an important role in human well-being. Rapid urbanization may modify urban green spaces, having various effects on plant diversity. Tropical coastal cities have urbanized rapidly in recent decades, but few studies have been conducted with a focus on their green spaces. We studied the responses of cultivated and spontaneous plants, both key components of urban flora, to the landscape structure of urban green spaces and possible social drivers. We analyzed existing relationships between plant diversity indices, urban green space landscape metrics (using Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) data,), and social factors, including the type, population density, construction age, and GPS coordinates of each Urban Functional Unit, or UFU. We found that UFUs with more green space patches had higher cultivated and spontaneous species richness than those with fewer green space patches. Spontaneous species richness decreased when green space patches became fragmented, and it increased when green space patches were more connected (e.g., via land bridges). Conversely, cultivated species richness increased with green space patch fragmentation. The phylogenetic diversity of both cultivated and spontaneous plants were weakly associated with green space structure, which was strongly driven by land use. Old UFUs and those with larger populations had more green space patches overall, although they tended to be small and fragmented. Green space patch density was found to increase as the UFU age increased. From the viewpoint of knowledge transfer, understanding the effects and drivers of landscape patterns of urban green spaces could inform the development of improved policies and management of urban green space areas.

TI  - Generating Time-Series LAI Estimates of Maize Using Combined Methods Based on Multispectral UAV Observations and WOFOST Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Green leaf area index (LAI) is an important variable related to crop growth. Accurate and timely information on LAI is essential for developing suitable field management strategies to mitigate risk and boost yield. Several remote sensing (RS) based methods have been recently developed to estimate LAI at the regional scale. However, the performance of these methods tends to be affected by the quality of RS data, especially when time-series LAI are required. For crop LAI estimation, supplementary growth information from crop model is helpful to address this issue. In this study, we focus on the regional-scale LAI estimations of spring maize for the entire growth season. Using time-series multispectral RS data acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the World Food Studies (WOFOST) crop model, three methods were applied at different crop growth stages: empirical method using vegetation index (VI), data assimilation method and hybrid method. The VI-based method and assimilation method were used to generate time-series LAI estimations for the whole crop growth season. Then, a hybrid method specially for the late-stage LAI retrieval was developed by integrating WOFOST model and data assimilation. Using field-collected LAI data in Hongxing Farm in 2014, the performances of these three methods were evaluated. At the early stage, the VI-based method (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.16, n = 36) achieved higher accuracy than the assimilation method (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.52, n = 36), whereas at the mid stage, the assimilation method (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.46, n = 28) showed higher accuracy than the VI-based method (R-2 = 0.41, RMSE = 0.51, n = 28). At the late stage, the hybrid method yielded the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.46, n = 29), compared with the VI-based method (R-2 = 0.19, RMSE = 0.43, n = 28) and the assimilation method (R-2 = 0.20, RMSE = 0.44, n = 29). Based on the results above, we considered a combination of the three methods, i.e., the VI-based method for the early stage, the assimilation method for the mid stage, and the hybrid method for the late stage, as an ideal strategy for spring-maize LAI estimation for the entire growth season of 2014 in Hongxing Farm, and the accuracy of the combined method over the whole growth season is higher than that of any single method.

TI  - Satellite-Based Study and Numerical Forecasting of Two Tornado Outbreaks in the Ural Region in June 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong tornadoes are common for the European part of Russia but happen rather rare east of the Urals. June 2017 became an exceptional month when two tornado outbreaks occurred in the Ural region of Russia, yielded $3 million damage, and resulted in 1 fatality and 14 injuries. In this study, we performed detailed analysis of these outbreaks with different data. Tornadoes and tornado-related environments were diagnosed with news and eyewitness reports, ground-based meteorological observations, sounding data, global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models data, synoptic charts, satellite images, and data of specially conducted aerial imaging. We also estimated the accuracy of short-term forecasting of outbreaks with the WRF-ARW mesoscale atmospheric model, which was run in convection-permitting mode. We determined the formation of 28 tornadoes during the first outbreak (3 June 2017) and 9 tornadoes during the second outbreak (18 June 2017). We estimated their intensity using three different approaches and confirmed that, based on the International Fujita scale (IF), one of the tornadoes had the IF4 intensity, being the first IF4 tornado in Russia in the 21st century and the first-ever IF4 tornado reported beyond the Ural Mountains. The synoptic-scale analysis revealed the similarity of two outbreaks, which both formed near the polar front in the warm part of deepening southern cyclones. Such synoptic conditions yield mostly weak tornadoes in European Russia; however, our analysis indicates that these conditions are likely favorable for strong tornadoes over the Ural region. Meso-scale analysis indicates that the environments were favorable for tornado formation in both cases, and most severe-weather indicators exceeded their critical values. Our analysis demonstrates that for the Ural region, like for other regions of the world, combined use of the global NWP model outputs indicating high values of severe-weather indices and the WRF model forecast outputs explicitly simulating tornadic storm formation could be used to predict the high probability of strong tornado formation. For both analyzed events, the availability of such tornado warning forecast could help local authorities to take early actions on population protection.

TI  - The White Sea: Available Data and Numerical Models
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The White Sea is a small shallow semi-closed sea in the North-West of Russia. It is strongly affected by induced tides, so the tidal motion dominates in the sea. Sea ice is seasonal and the water salinity is less than in the neighbouring Barents sea due to strong river discharge. We review the sources of in-situ and satellite data that are available for the sea, and describe those few numerical models, together with the challenges that are faced. We focus on the large-scale circulation and thermohaline fields, but also cover sea ice, river runoff, and pelagic biogeochemical data.

TI  - Handling Missing Data in Large-Scale MODIS AOD Products Using a Two-Step Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key parameter that reflects the characteristics of aerosols, and is of great help in predicting the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere. At present, remote sensing inversion has become an important method for obtaining the AOD on a large scale. However, AOD data acquired by satellites are often missing, and this has gradually become a popular topic. In recent years, a large number of AOD recovery algorithms have been proposed. Many AOD recovery methods are not application-oriented. These methods focus mainly on to the accuracy of AOD recovery and neglect the AOD recovery ratio. As a result, the AOD recovery accuracy and recovery ratio cannot be balanced. To solve these problems, a two-step model (TWS) that combines multisource AOD data and AOD spatiotemporal relationships is proposed. We used the light gradient boosting (LightGBM) model under the framework of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) to fit the multisource AOD data to fill in the missing AOD between data sources. Spatial interpolation and spatiotemporal interpolation methods are limited by buffer factors. We recovered the missing AOD in a moving window. We used TWS to recover AOD from Terra Satellite's 2018 AOD product (MOD AOD). The results show that the MOD AOD, after a 3 x 3 moving window TWS recovery, was closely related to the AOD of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) (R = 0.87, RMSE = 0.23). In addition, the MOD AOD missing rate after a 3 x 3 window TWS recovery was greatly reduced (from 0.88 to 0.1). In addition, the spatial distribution characteristics of the monthly and annual averages of the recovered MOD AOD were consistent with the original MOD AOD. The results show that TWS is reliable. This study provides a new method for the restoration of MOD AOD, and is of great significance for studying the spatial distribution of atmospheric pollutants.

TI  - An Indigenous Research Methodology That Employs Anishinaabek Elders, Language Speakers and Women's Knowledge for Sustainable Water Governance
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous research paradigms are congruent to Indigenous worldviews and have become more dominant in areas such as Indigenous policy and education. As Indigenous research paradigms continue to gain momentum, the historical legacy of unethical research is addressed as more Indigenous communities and organizations develop their own research protocols. There is a plethora of articles explaining Indigenous research methodologies, but few examine the inclusion of the knowledge from Elders, language speakers, and Indigenous women in sustainable water governance. My Indigenous research methodology draws on the works of Indigenous scholars Shawn Wilson, Linda Smith, and Margaret Kovach, with specific focus on Wendy Geniusz's Biskaabiiyang. My Indigenous research methodology is specific to the Anishinaabe territory of the Great Lakes region and includes Anishinaabek Elders, Anishinaabemowin (Ojibway language) speakers, and Anishinaabek women. This article seeks to contribute to Indigenous research paradigms and methods by elucidating the importance of engaging Anishinaabek Elders, Anishinaabemowin speakers, and Anishinaabek women in sustainable water governance.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer using blue dye, radioisotope, and indocyanine green: Prospective cohort study
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The breast cancer treatment paradigm has shifted to neoadjuvant treatment. There are many advantages to neoadjuvant treatment, such as tumor downsizing, in vivo tumor biology testing, treating micrometastasis, and achieving complete pathological response (a surrogate marker for overall survival). However, in the post neoadjuvant settings, sentinel lymph node biopsy can be done using a dual staining technique to decrease the false-negative rate (FNR) and increase the detection rate. However, many hospitals are not equipped to use radioisotopes. Here we investigate the detection rate and accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in post neoadjuvant treatment breast cancer, comparing radioisotope, isosulfan blue, and indocyanine green (ICG) approaches.Material and methods: This prospective study includes breast cancer patients (T2-4, N1-2) who had received neoadjuvant treatment. Carcinomas were confirmed by tissue pathology. Patients who had previous surgical biopsy or surgery involving the axillary regions, and those with a history of allergy to ICG, isosulfan blue, or radioisotope were excluded from the study.Result: The study was done between July 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. The mean age of participants was 53 years. Fourteen (60.87%) were post-menopause, two (8.7%) were perimenopause, and seven (30.43%) were premenopause. The clinical-stage distribution of the participants was: 2A (8.7%), 2B (34.78%), 3A (43.48%), and 3B (13.04%). The primary tumor size was 4.82 +/- 2.73 cm. The lymph node size was 1.8 +/- 0.96 cm. The detection rates at the individual level were 95.23% with ICG, 85.71% with isosulfan blue, and 85.71% with a radioisotope. The detection rate increased up to 100% when the ICG and blue dye methods were combined. The FNRs of sentinel lymph node biopsy at the individual level were: 10% using ICG, 30% using isosulfan blue, and 40% using radioisotope. At the lymph node level, the detection rates were 93.22% using ICG, 81.78% using isosulfan blue, and 53.87% using a radioisotope. The FNRs of sentinel lymph node biopsy at the lymph node level were 19.05% with ICG, 21.43% with isosulfan blue, and 18.03% with a radioisotope. However, the FNR was less than 10% when ICG, isosulfan blue, and a radioisotope were combined.Conclusion: We can perform sentinel lymph node biopsy by combining blue dye with ICG as an optional modality and achieve a comparable outcome with combine radioisotope in locally advanced breast cancer after neoadjuvant treatment.

TI  - Improvement of Cyber-Attack Detection Accuracy from Urban Water Systems Using Extreme Learning Machine
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a novel detection model for the detection of cyber-attacks using remote sensing data on water distribution systems (i.e., pipe flow sensor, nodal pressure sensor, tank water level sensor, and programmable logic controllers) by machine learning approaches. The most commonly used and well-known machine learning algorithms (i.e., k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and extreme learning machine) were compared to determine the one with the best detection performance. After identifying the best algorithm, several improved versions of the algorithm are compared and analyzed according to their characteristics. Their quantitative performances and abilities to correctly classify the state of the urban water system under cyber-attack were measured using various performance indices. Among the algorithms tested, the extreme learning machine (ELM) was found to exhibit the best performance. Moreover, this study not only has identified excellent algorithm among the compared algorithms but also has considered an improved version of the outstanding algorithm. Furthermore, the comparison was performed using various representative performance indices to quantitatively measure the prediction accuracy and select the most appropriate model. Therefore, this study provides a new perspective on the characteristics of various versions of machine learning algorithms and their application to different problems, and this study may be referenced as a case study for future cyber-attack detection fields.

TI  - Revisiting the particle-size constraint of the 10-μm silicate feature
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - We experimentally measure the mid-IR spectra of half-millimeter-sized olivine particles with very compact morphology and smooth surfaces. We find that the 10-mu m silicate feature is present in these large, irregularly shaped samples having surface roughness that is much smaller than optical wavelengths. Based on Mie theory, which assumes the particles are spherical, this feature should not exist for such large particles. As a consequence, its presence has been taken as an indicator that the particles or grains composing such particles were micronsized or smaller. The measurement of this feature in real, irregularly shaped particles, suggests that the assumption of sphericity may severely limit our interpretations of remote-sensing data.

TI  - Clustering on Laplacian-embedded latent manifolds when clusters overlap
T2  - MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of clustering is to identify groups in a dataset in the hope of revealing some unforeseen latent discrete variable. Clustering however, is known to be one of the most difficult tasks in practice for two main reasons: (i) high dimensionality of data which requires appropriate feature extraction; and (ii) computational complexity of the associated optimisation problems. Spectral clustering was designed as a joint embedding and clustering technique that first embeds the data into a low dimensional space and then delineates between the clusters by considering the sign of the components of (a linearly transformed version of) the second eigenvector of a similarity matrix. Hence, spectral clustering seemingly solves the two main challenges associated with clustering problems, at least when the clusters are well separated. In this paper, we address the question of clustering when clusters overlap. In this regime, one relevant approach to clustering is to consider the modes of the point cloud distribution and, in particular, how the modes of the distribution of the raw data are mapped to the modes of the embedded data via the Laplacian eigenmap. The main contribution of the present paper is to provide a simulation study of the (approximate) mode-preserving property of Laplacian eigenmaps and how relevant the mode chasing approach is to high dimensional clustering. As a consequence of the mode-preserving property of Laplacian eigenmaps, this method is as good as finding modes in the original high dimensional space but with much better computational efficiency. The method is illustrated on simulated data and on satellite data relating to ground movement.

TI  - Retrieval of Leaf Area Index Using Sentinel-2 Imagery in a Mixed Mediterranean Forest Area
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial biophysical indicator for assessing and monitoring the structure and functions of forest ecosystems. Improvements in remote sensing instrumental characteristics and the availability of more efficient statistical algorithms, elevate the potential for more accurate models of vegetation biophysical properties including LAI. The aim of this study was to assess the spectral information of Sentinel-2 MSI satellite imagery for the retrieval of LAI over a mixed forest ecosystem located in northwest Greece. Forty-eight field plots were visited for the collection of ground LAI measurements using an ACCUPAR LP-80: PAR & LAI Ceptometer. Spectral bands and spectral indices were used for LAI model development using the Gaussian processes regression (GPR) algorithm. A variable selection procedure was applied to improve the model's prediction accuracy, and variable importance was investigated for identifying the most informative variables. The model resulting from spectral indices' variables selection produced the most precise predictions of LAI with a coefficient of determination of 0.854. Shortwave infrared bands and the normalized canopy index (NCI) were identified as the most important features for LAI prediction.

TI  - Predicting Tree Species Diversity Using Geodiversity and Sentinel-2 Multi-Seasonal Spectral Information
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring and monitoring tree diversity is a prerequisite for altering biodiversity loss and the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. High temporal satellite remote sensing, recording difference in species phenology, can facilitate the extraction of timely, standardized and reliable information on tree diversity, complementing or replacing traditional field measurements. In this study, we used multispectral and multi-seasonal remotely sensed data from the Sentinel-2 satellite sensor along with geodiversity data for estimating local tree diversity in a Mediterranean forest area. One hundred plots were selected for in situ inventory of tree species and measurement of tree diversity using the Simpson's (D-1) and Shannon (H ') diversity indices. Four Sentinel-2 scenes and geodiversity variables, including elevation, aspect, moisture, and basement rock type, were exploited through a random forest regression algorithm for predicting the two diversity indices. The multi-seasonal models presented the highest accuracy for both indices with an R-2 up to 0.37. In regard to the single season, spectral-only models, mid-summer and mid-autumn model also demonstrated satisfactory accuracy (max R-2 = 0.28). On the other hand, the accuracy of the spectral-only early-spring and early-autumn models was significant lower (max R-2 = 0.16), although it was improved with the use of geodiversity information (max R-2 = 0.25).

TI  - A Framework for Unsupervised Wildfire Damage Assessment Using VHR Satellite Images with PlanetScope Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of remote sensing techniques for disaster management often requires rapid damage assessment to support decision-making for post-treatment activities. As the on-demand acquisition of pre-event very high-resolution (VHR) images is typically limited, PlanetScope (PS) offers daily images of global coverage, thereby providing favorable opportunities to obtain high-resolution pre-event images. In this study, we propose an unsupervised change detection framework that uses post-fire VHR images with pre-fire PS data to facilitate the assessment of wildfire damage. To minimize the time and cost of human intervention, the entire process was executed in an unsupervised manner from image selection to change detection. First, to select clear pre-fire PS images, a blur kernel was adopted for the blind and automatic evaluation of local image quality. Subsequently, pseudo-training data were automatically generated from contextual features regardless of the statistical distribution of the data, whereas spectral and textural features were employed in the change detection procedure to fully exploit the properties of different features. The proposed method was validated in a case study of the 2019 Gangwon wildfire in South Korea, using post-fire GeoEye-1 (GE-1) and pre-fire PS images. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed change detection method, achieving an overall accuracy of over 99% with low false alarm rate (FAR), which is comparable to the accuracy level of the supervised approach. The proposed unsupervised framework accomplished efficient wildfire damage assessment without any prior information by utilizing the multiple features from multi-sensor bi-temporal images.

TI  - Displacement Monitoring in Airport Runways by Persistent Scatterers SAR Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deformations monitoring in airport runways and the surrounding areas is crucial, especially in cases of low-bearing capacity subgrades, such as the clayey subgrade soils. An effective monitoring of the infrastructure asset allows to secure the highest necessary standards in terms of the operational and safety requirements. Amongst the emerging remote sensing techniques for transport infrastructures monitoring, the Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) technique has proven effective for the evaluation of the ground deformations. However, its use for certain demanding applications, such as the assessment of millimetric differential deformations in airport runways, is still considered as an open issue for future developments. In this study, a time-series analysis of COSMO-SkyMed satellite images acquired from January 2015 to April 2019 is carried out by employing the PSI technique. The aim is to retrieve the mean deformation velocity and time series of the surface deformations occurring in airport runways. The technique is applied to Runway 3 at the "Leonardo da Vinci" International Airport in Rome, Italy. The proposed PSI technique is then validated by way of comparison with the deformation outcomes obtained on the runway by traditional topographic levelling over the same time span. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the applied PSI technique for the assessment of deformations in airport runways.

TI  - <i>Eobania vermiculata</i> as a potential indicator of nitrate contamination in soil
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of nitrates were analysed on the land snail Eobania vermiculata, a good bioindicator to assess the effects of certain pollutants in soil. It is known that the molluscs are very sensitive to contamination substances and can be used as sentinel organism for environmental pollution assessment. The nitrates are present in fertilizers and in food additives and their excess can not only be harmful to the environment but also dangerous for the humans. Indeed, in the mammals the nitrates are converted into nitrites and can cause a series of complications as the formation of methaemoglobin and cancers. In this study, adult organisms of E. vermiculata were exposed to soil containing 2000 mg/L of nitrates for 30 days to evaluate the stool micmbiome and the histological changes at the level of the foot. Eggs of these snails were similarly treated to observe their hatching, survival and development. Histological changes were observed at level of the foot of adult snails exposed to nitrate and in their stools was evident an increase of bacteria, especially those that have a high ability to exploit nitrates and nitrogen as nutrients. Instead, the treated eggs showed changes in hatching, hypopigmentation of newborn snails and a decrease of their survival in time. The overall information obtained from these endpoints can provide important information regarding the quality of the environment. In addition, they also showed that the invertebrate organism E. vermiculata despite being a simple organism is very useful and efficient for eco-toxicological studies.

TI  - Estimation of the spatiotemporal dynamic of snow water equivalent at mountain range scale under data scarcity
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow dynamics in alpine systems play a significant role in the hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere interfaces of these regions. The storage of water resources as snow is essential for ecosystems, human consumption, tourism, and hydropower in many areas. However, snow data are usually scarce due to poor accessibility, difficulties to maintain monitoring system under harsh climatic conditions and limited economic funds. Most of the scientific studies aimed to quantify water stored as snow are carried out at small or medium spatial scales, but few analyses are done for the whole mountain ranges. The main goal of this work is to propose a general parsimonious methodology to estimate snow water equivalent under data scarcity for the Sierra Nevada mountain range (Spain). The methodology is easily transferable to any other study areas. It combines a dynamic regression approach of snow depth from punctual data, snow cover area data from the MODIS satellite and simulations of snow density from a coupled mass and energy balance model. The regression model includes two kinds of explanatory variables (steady and non-steady) to assess the snow depth dynamics. The dynamic of the snow density in the mountain range has been obtained using a physically based simulation driven by climate model data for the Iberian Peninsula. These three variables (snow depth, snow cover area and snow density) have been used to obtain spatially distributed series of snow water equivalent for the whole mountain range. The proposed solution allows studying the snow water equivalent distribution, duration of the snow cover and number of accumulation and melting days for different snow seasons. The mean accumulated snow water equivalent per season in the historical period is 330 Hm3 and the maximum of 480 Hm3, which is a significant amount of resources in an area characterized by limited water availability.

TI  - Associations between Household-Level Exposures and All-Cause Diarrhea and Pathogen-Specific Enteric Infections in Children Enrolled in Five Sentinel Surveillance Studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Diarrheal disease remains a major cause of childhood mortality and morbidity causing poor health and economic outcomes. In low-resource settings, young children are exposed to numerous risk factors for enteric pathogen transmission within their dwellings, though the relative importance of different transmission pathways varies by pathogen species. The objective of this analysis was to model associations between five household-level risk factors-water, sanitation, flooring, caregiver education, and crowding-and infection status for endemic enteric pathogens in children in five surveillance studies. Data were combined from 22 sites in which a total of 58,000 stool samples were tested for 16 specific enteropathogens using qPCR. Risk ratios for pathogen- and taxon-specific infection status were modeled using generalized linear models along with hazard ratios for all-cause diarrhea in proportional hazard models, with the five household-level variables as primary exposures adjusting for covariates. Improved drinking water sources conferred a 17% reduction in diarrhea risk; however, the direction of its association with particular pathogens was inconsistent. Improved sanitation was associated with a 9% reduction in diarrhea risk with protective effects across pathogen species and taxa of around 10-20% risk reduction. A 9% reduction in diarrhea risk was observed in subjects with covered floors, which were also associated with decreases in risk for zoonotic enteropathogens. Caregiver education and household crowding showed more modest, inconclusive results. Combining data from diverse sites, this analysis quantified associations between five household-level exposures on risk of specific enteric infections, effects which differed by pathogen species but were broadly consistent with hypothesized transmission mechanisms. Such estimates may be used within expanded water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs to target interventions to the particular pathogen profiles of individual communities and prioritize resources.

TI  - Extensive High-Resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data Analysis of Tropical Cyclones: Comparisons with SFMR Flights and Best Track
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - To produce more precise descriptions of air-sea exchanges under tropical cyclones (TCs), spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments provide unique capabilities to probe the ocean surface conditions, at very high spatial resolution, and on synoptic scales. Using highly resolved (3 km) wind fields, an extensive database is constructed from RadarSat-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions. Spanning 161 tropical cyclones, the database covers all TC intensity categories that have occurred in 5 different TC basins, and include 29 cases coincident with SFMR measurements. After locating the TC center, a specific methodology is applied to filter out areas contaminated by heavy precipitation to help extract, for each acquisition, the maximum wind speed (Vmax), its associated radius (Rmax), and corresponding outer wind radii (R34/50/64 kt). These parameters are then systematically compared with best track (BTK), and when available, SFMR airborne measurements. For collocated SFMR and SAR observations, comparisons yield root-mean-squares of 3.86 m s(-1) and 3 km for ocean surface wind speeds and TC Rmax, respectively. High correlations remain for category-5 cases, with Vmax exceeding 60 m s(-1). The largest discrepancies are found between BTK and SAR Rmax estimates, with Rmax fluctuations poorly captured by BTK, especially for rapidly evolving category-3, -4, and -5 TCs. In heavy precipitation (>35 mm h(-1)), the SAR C-band measurements may be impacted, with local ambiguities associated with rain features, as revealed by external rain measurements. Still, this large dataset demonstrates that SAR measurements have unique high-resolution capabilities, capturing the inner- and outer-core radial structure of the TC vortex, and provide independent and complementary measurements than those used for BTK estimates.

TI  - Assessment of Wind Direction Estimation Methods from SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind information on SAR images are essential to characterize a marine environment in offshore or coastal area. More and more applications require high resolution wind field estimation. In this article, classical wind wave direction estimation methods are reviewed as the spectral or gradient approaches. In addition, a way to enhance the spectral method with the Radon transform is proposed. The aim of this document is to determine which method provides greatest results when the resolution grid is finer. Therefore, the methods accuracy, fidelity and uncertainty are compared through a simulation study, a section with RadarSAT2 data in coastal area and another one with Sentinel-1 measurements in offshore area.

TI  - Human West Nile Meningo-Encephalitis in a Highly Endemic Country: A Complex Epidemiological Analysis on Biotic and Abiotic Risk Factors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viruses. Although the infection in humans is mostly asymptomatic, 15-20% of cases show flu-like symptoms with fever. In 1% of infections, humans develop severe nervous symptoms and even die, a condition known as West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of abiotic and biotic factors with the human WNND cases during the period 2015-2019. A database containing all the localities in Romania was developed. Abiotic and biotic predictors were included for each locality: geographic variables, climatic data, and biotic factors. Spatial distribution of the WNND infections was analyzed using directional distribution (DD). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was employed to assess the strength of association between the WNND infections and predictors. A model was generated using the random forest ensemble learning method. A total number of 535 human WNND cases were confirmed in 308 localities. The DD showed a south-eastern geographical distribution. Weak correlation was observed between the number of human WNND cases for each year and the predictors. The highest predicted probability was around urbanized patches in the south and southeast. Increased surveillance and control measures of vectors in risk areas should be implemented and educational campaigns should be made available for the general public in order to raise awareness of the disease and inform the population about prophylactic measures.

TI  - Mercury in Marine Mussels from the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf (Canada): A Mussel Watch Survey Revisited after 40 Years
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Various species of marine mussels have been used, in the last 50 years, as sentinel organisms for monitoring metal contamination along marine coasts. There are two main reasons for this: these mollusks concentrate metals in their soft tissue and they are geographically widespread. In practice, trace metal concentrations in mussel soft tissue reveal (after some correction for biotic effects) the contamination level of their surrounding environment. We present the results of a mercury (Hg) survey in Mytilus spp. collected in the summers of 2016, 2018, and 2019 at 51 stations distributed along the coasts of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Mercury concentrations ranged from 0.063 to 0.507 mu g g(-1) (dry weight, dw), with a grand mean of 0.173 +/- 0.076 mu g g(-1) dw (+/- 1 standard deviation), and a median of 0.156 mu g g(-1) dw for the 504 individuals analyzed. Mercury contents per individual mussel were significantly (p < 0.01) related to shell length and dry tissue weight, with the smaller individuals having the highest Hg concentrations. To take into account these biotic effects, we normalized Hg concentrations of the mussel soft tissue for constant shell length (L) and soft tissue weight (TW) based on the log-log relationships between Hg content and L or TW. The normalized Hg contents of mussels varied from 10.9 to 66.6 ng per virtual individual of 35 mm length and 0.17 g dry weight. A similar normalization procedure applied to 1977-1979 data, yielded a very similar range: 12 to 64 ng. This observation suggests that the Hg bioavailable to marine mussels in the study area did not change over a span of 40 years. Regional Hg distribution patterns indicate a gradual decrease of Hg content in mussels downstream from freshwater discharges to the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Baie des Chaleurs, suggesting that rivers constitute a significant Hg source in these estuarine systems. Atmospheric Hg deposition and concentration in marine waters of the Atlantic Ocean are known to have decreased in the last decades. However, in coastal environments, the response to these changes does not seem to be rapid, probably because of the long residence time of Hg in soils before being exported to coastal areas.

AB  - Duffy blood group phenotypes [Fy(a + b-), Fy(a-b+), Fy(a + b+), Fy(a-b-)], characterized by the expression of Fy(a), and Fy(b) antigens, are present in red blood cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that the non-hematopoietic expression of these antigens might influence cell invasion by T. gondii.576 consecutive patients from both genders were enrolled. The presumed OT clinical diagnosis was performed. Duffy phenotyping was performed by hemagglutination in gel columns and for the correct molecular characterization Fy(a-b-) phenotype, using PCR-RFLP. Anti -T. gondii IgG antibodies were detected by ELISA. Chi-square, Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the proportions.OT was present in 22.9% (n = 132) and absent in 77.1% (n = 444) of patients. The frequencies of anti -T. gondii IgG antibodies were higher in OT (127/132, 96.2%) than those without this disease (321/444, 72.3%) (p < .0001). None of the Duffy antigens or phenotypes were associated with T. gondii infection (chi 2: 2.222, GL: 3, p = .5276) as well as the risk of OT (chi 2: 0.771, GL: 3, p = .8566).Duffy blood group system phenotypes and their antigens do not constitute risk factors for infection by T. gondii infection and the development of OT.

TI  - Ingestion of anthropogenic debris by migratory barnacle geese <i>Branta leucopsis</i> on a remote north-eastern Atlantic island
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Although seabirds are frequently used as sentinel species for anthropogenic pollution, the extent and impacts of synthetic debris ingestion remains poorly studied for many water bird species. Here, we assess ingestion of synthetic particles (>= 0.5 mm) by barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, wintering on a remote island. Faecal samples were collected over a period of four wintering seasons. In total, 71 individual samples were assessed, with 79% of samples displaying at least one debris particle (maximum lengths 0.5-5 mm) from anthropogenic sources. The recovered synthetic debris were identified as micro-fibres (n = 166) and micro-fragments (n = 165). The number of synthetic particles detected per sample was generally low at 4.7 +/- 0.9, 43 (mean +/- SE, maximum): micro-fibres 2.3 +/- 0.3, 10; micro-fragments 2.3 +/- 0.8, 40. Particle numbers detected per gram of faecal sample differed amongst wintering seasons. Our results suggest that non-marine water birds can frequently ingest low quantities of synthetic particles in remote coastal habitats.

TI  - Individual Palm Tree Detection Using Deep Learning on RGB Imagery to Support Tree Inventory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phoenix palms cover more than 1.3 million hectares in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and North Africa regions and they represent highly valued assets for economic, environmental, and cultural purposes. Despite their importance, information on the number of palm trees and the palm distribution across different scenes is difficult to obtain and, therefore, limited. In this work, we present the first region-wide spatial inventory of Phoenix dactylifera (date palm) and Phoenix canariensis (canary palm) trees, based on remote imagery from the Alicante province in Spain. A deep learning architecture that was based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was implemented to generate a detection model able to locate and classify individual palms trees from aerial high-resolution RGB images. When considering that creating large labeled image datasets is a constraint in object detection applied to remote sensing data, as a strategy for pre-training detection models on a similar task, imagery and palm maps from the autonomous community of the Canary Islands were used. Subsequently, these models were transferred for re-training with imagery from Alicante. The best performing model was capable of mapping Phoenix palms in different scenes, with a changeable appearance, and with varied ages, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) value of 0.861. In total, 511,095 Phoenix palms with a probability score above 0.5 were detected over an area of 5816 km(2). The detection model, which was obtained from an out-of-the-box object detector, RetinaNet, provides a fast and straightforward method to map isolated and densely distributed date and canary palms-and other Phoenix palms. The inventory of palm trees established here provides quantitative information on Phoenix palms distribution, which could be used as a baseline for long-term monitoring of palms' conditions. In addition to boosting palm tree inventory across multiple landscapes at a large scale, the detection model demonstrates how image processing techniques that are based on deep learning leverage image understanding from remote sensing data.

TI  - Assuring Adequate Treatment for Persons Diagnosed With Gonorrhea in New York State
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background From November 2014 to May 2016, 57 local health departments in New York State (NYS) excluding New York City were offered a performance incentive (PI) to promote adherence to federally recommended treatment guidelines for gonorrhea. The rationale of the PI was to delay antibiotic resistance and disrupt transmission through attaining a high percentage of treatment adherence. Methods Surveillance data from the NYS Communicable Disease Electronic Surveillance System were used for analysis. We evaluated adherence per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines for persons 12 years and older reported with uncomplicated gonorrhea during 4 time frames: Pre-PI, PI One, PI Two, and Post-PI. We measured adherence per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines during each respective time frame and conducted chi(2)tests to test for the association between treatment adequacy and time frame. Results During the Pre-PI, treatment was adequate in 82.0% of persons diagnosed with gonorrhea. After program implementation, treatment adequacy increased significantly (92.1% of diagnosed persons during PI One, 90.4% during PI Two, and 90.5% during the Post-PI;P <= 0.0001). The most common reason for inadequate or missing treatment was patient lost to follow-up. Conclusions Public health intervention by the NYS Department of Health improved local health department adherence to federally recommended gonorrhea treatment guidelines, and improvements were maintained after the completion of the PI.

TI  - Methylene Blue-Current Knowledge, Fluorescent Properties, and Its Future Use
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Methylene blue is a fluorescent dye discovered in 1876 and has since been used in different scientific fields. Only recently has methylene blue been used for intraoperative fluorescent imaging. Here, the authors review the emerging role of methylene blue, not only as a dye used in clinical practice, but also as a fluorophore in a surgical setting. We discuss the promising potential of methylene blue together with the challenges and limitations among specific surgical techniques. A literature review of PubMed and Medline was conducted based on the historical, current and future usage of methylene blue within the field of medicine. We reviewed not only the current usage of methylene blue, but we also tried to grasp its' function as a fluorophore in five main domains. These domains include the near-infrared imaging visualization of ureters, parathyroid gland identification, pancreatic tumors imaging, detection of breast cancer tumor margins, as well as breast cancer sentinel node biopsy. Methylene blue is used in countless clinical procedures with a relatively low risk for patients. Usage of its fluorescent properties is still at an early stage and more pre-clinical, as well as clinical research, must be performed to fully understand its potentials and limitations.

TI  - Multiresolution Satellite-Derived Bathymetry in Shallow Coral Reefs: Improving Linear Algorithms with Geographical Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric maps are one of the first steps for most hydrological and ecological studies of the seascape, as depth is a determinant factor in the distribution of organisms, patterns of wave exposure, and coastal circulation. The coral reefs of Tamandare '-Brazil, located at Costa dos Corais marine protected area (MPA), encompass a mosaic of interconnected habitats of complex geomorphology, including coral reefs, algal, and seagrass beds. These coastal habitats are subjected to chronic impacts such as sedimentation, reef erosion, and increasing human use, leading to habitat loss. Despite their social and ecological importance and the conservationmeasures in place, bathymetric and habitat maps of this coast are lacking. Indeed, in situ surveys are not always feasible in shallow coral reef areas. The present study offers a detailed bathymetric mapping of the area using multiresolution satellite imagery. One Landsat-8 (December 2016) and one WorldView-03 (February 2017) imagery were used to derive medium (30-m) and high-resolution (2-m) bathymetry of the study area. Single-beam echo sounder surveys were performed to obtain field data to calibrate the depth-retrieving algorithms: linear model, ratio band model, principal component analyses of the transformed bands, and geographically weighted regressions (GWR). For both resolution datasets, results showed that the algorithms' RMS were significantly improved by theGWR technique (RMS. 0.9) because of adaptability to the bottom heterogeneity found in complex areas such as coral reefs. Specific geomorphological reef zones were recognizable in the resulting bathymetric maps, such as intrareef lagoon, reef crest, fore-reef, and reef flat. This research concluded that affordable methods such as single-beam data coupled with satellite imagery through GWR can provide the required inputs for mapping shallow areas with complex relief. Such results may be further used to habitat mapping, necessary to inform the multiple-use zonation foreseen in MPA management plans.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the analysis of multispectral satellite data, this work demonstrates the influence of coastal upwelling on the variability of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in the south-eastern Baltic (SEB) Sea and in the Curonian Lagoon. The analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua/Terra satellites, together with Chl-a maps from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard Envisat, shows a significant decrease of up to 40-50% in Chl-a concentration in the upwelling zone. This results from the offshore Ekman transport of more productive surface waters, which are replaced by cold and less-productive waters from deeper layers. Due to an active interaction between the Baltic Sea and the Curonian Lagoon which are connected through the Klaipeda Strait, coastal upwelling in the SEB also influences the hydrobiological conditions of the adjacent lagoon. During upwelling inflows, SST drops by approximately 2-8 degrees C, while Chl-a concentration becomes 2-4 times lower than in pre-upwelling conditions. The joint analysis of remotely sensed Chl-a and SST data reveals that the upwelling-driven reduction in Chl-a concentration leads to the temporary improvement of water quality in terms of Chl-a in the coastal zone and in the hyper-eutrophic Curonian Lagoon. This study demonstrates the benefits of multi-spectral satellite data for upscaling coastal processes and monitoring the environmental status of the Baltic Sea and its largest estuarine lagoon.

TI  - High-Resolution Soybean Yield Mapping Across the US Midwest Using Subfield Harvester Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud computing and freely available, high-resolution satellite data have enabled recent progress in crop yield mapping at fine scales. However, extensive validation data at a matching resolution remain uncommon or infeasible due to data availability. This has limited the ability to evaluate different yield estimation models and improve understanding of key features useful for yield estimation in both data-rich and data-poor contexts. Here, we assess machine learning models' capacity for soybean yield prediction using a unique ground-truth dataset of high-resolution (5 m) yield maps generated from combine harvester yield monitor data for over a million field-year observations across the Midwestern United States from 2008 to 2018. First, we compare random forest (RF) implementations, testing a range of feature engineering approaches using Sentinel-2 and Landsat spectral data for 20- and 30-m scale yield prediction. We find that Sentinel-2-based models can explain up to 45% of out-of-sample yield variability from 2017 to 2018 (r(2) = 0.45), while Landsat models explain up to 43% across the longer 2008-2018 period. Using discrete Fourier transforms, or harmonic regressions, to capture soybean phenology improved the Landsat-based model considerably. Second, we compare RF models trained using this ground-truth data to models trained on available county-level statistics. We find that county-level models rely more heavily on just a few predictors, namely August weather covariates (vapor pressure deficit, rainfall, temperature) and July and August near-infrared observations. As a result, county-scale models perform relatively poorly on field-scale validation (r(2) = 0.32), especially for high-yielding fields, but perform similarly to field-scale models when evaluated at the county scale (r(2) = 0.82). Finally, we test whether our findings on variable importance can inform a simple, generalizable framework for regions or time periods beyond ground data availability. To do so, we test improvements to a Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) approach that uses crop simulations to train statistical models for yield estimation. Based on findings from our RF models, we employ harmonic regressions to estimate peak vegetation index (VI) and a VI observation 30 days later, with August rainfall as the sole weather covariate in our new SCYM model. Modifications improved SCYM's explained variance (r(2) = 0.27 at the 30 m scale) and provide a new, parsimonious model.

TI  - Reducing the risk of patient suicide in Tuscany.
T2  - BJPsych international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Patient suicide is one of the most frequent incidents in healthcare facilities to be reported to the National Observatory of Sentinel Events in Italy. Despite national initiatives, in Tuscany potentially preventable patient suicides still occur in both acute and community care settings. We describe here an aggregated qualitative analysis of 14 patient suicides that took place in public health services between 2017 and 2018. We outline the methodology and results of an improvement action we enacted in the healthcare system that involved reviewing and reinforcing relevant managerial strategies and clinical activities, with the aim of reducing potentially preventable patient suicides.

TI  - Identification before-after Forest Fire and Prediction of Mangrove Forest Based on Markov-Cellular Automata in Part of Sembilang National Park, Banyuasin, South Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1997, the worst forest fire in Indonesia occurred and hit mangrove forest areas including in Sembilang National Park Banyuasin Regency, South Sumatra. Therefore, the Indonesian government keeps in trying to rehabilitate the mangrove forest in Sembilang National Park. This study aimed to identify the mangrove forest changing and to predict on the future year. The situations before and after forest fire were analyzed. This study applied an integrated Markov Chain and Cellular Automata model to identify mangrove forest change in the interval years of 1989-2015 and predict it in 2028. Remote sensing technology is used based on Landsat satellite imagery (1989, 1998, 2002, and 2015). The results showed mangrove forest has decreased around 9.6% from 1989 to 1998 due to forest fire, and has increased by 8.4% between 1998 and 2002, and 2.3% in 2002-2015. Other results show that mangroves area has continued to increase from 2015 to 2028 by 27.4% to 31% (7974.8 ha). It shows that the mangrove ecosystem is periodically changing due to good management by the Indonesian government.

TI  - Improving the Management of Atrial Fibrillation in General Practice: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the commonest arrhythmias observed in general practice. The thromboembolic complications of AF include transient ischemic attack, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Early recognition of AF can lead to early intervention with managing the risks of these complications.Objective: The primary aim of this study is to investigate if patients are managed in general practice according to current national guidelines. In addition, the study will evaluate the impact of direct oral anticoagulant use with respect to AF complications in a real-world dataset The secondary aims of the study are to develop a dashboard that will allow monitoring the management of AF in general practice and evaluate the usability of the dashboard.Methods: The study was conducted in 2 phases. The initial phase was a quantitative analysis of routinely collected primary care data from the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Center (RCGP RSC) sentinel network database. AF cases from 2009 to 2019 were identified. The study investigated the impact of the use of anticoagulants on complications of AF over this time period. We used this dataset to examine how AF was managed in primary care during the last decade. The second phase involved development of an online dashboard for monitoring management of AF in general practice. We conducted a usability evaluation for the dashboard to identify usability issues and performed enhancements to improve usability.Results: We received funding for both phases in January 2019 and received approval from the RCGP RSC research committee in March 2019. We completed data extraction for phase 1 in May 2019 and completed analysis in December 2019. We completed building the AF dashboard in May 2019. We started recruiting participants for phase 1 in May 2019 and concluded data collection in July 2019. We completed data analysis for phase 2 in October 2019. The results are expected to be published in the second half of 2020. As of October 2020, the publications reporting the results are under review.Conclusions: Results of this study will provide an insight into the current trends in management of AF using real-world data from the Oxford RCGP RSC database. We anticipate that the outcomes of this study will be used to guide the development and implementation of an audit-based intervention tool to assist practitioners in identifying and managing AF in primary care.

TI  - Disparities in the excess risk of mortality in the first wave of COVID-19: Cross sectional study of the English sentinel network
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Few studies report contributors to the excess mortality in England during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We report the absolute excess risk (AER) of mortality and excess mortality rate (EMR) from a nationally representative COVID-19 sentinel surveillance network including known COVID-19 risk factors in people aged 45 years and above.Methods: Pseudonymised, coded clinical data were uploaded from contributing primary care providers (N = 1,970,314, > 45years). We calculated the AER in mortality by comparing mortality for weeks 2 to 20 this year with mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from 2018 for the same weeks. We conducted univariate and multivariate analysis including preselected variables. We report AER and EMR, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: The AER of mortality was 197.8/10,000 person years (95%CI:194.30-201.40). The EMR for male gender, compared with female, was 1.4 (95%CI:1.35-1.44, p<0.00); for our oldest age band (>= 75 years) 10.09 (95%CI:9.46-10.75, p<0.00) compared to 45-64 year olds; Black ethnicity's EMR was 1.17 (95%CI: 1.03-1.33, p<0.02), reference white; and for dwellings with >= 9 occupants 8.01 (95%CI: 9.46-10.75, p<0.00). Presence of all included comorbidities significantly increased EMR. Ranked from lowest to highest these were: hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory and heart disease, and cancer or immunocompromised.Conclusions: The absolute excess mortality was approximately 2 deaths per 100 person years in the first wave of COVID-19. More personalised shielding advice for any second wave should include ethnicity, comorbidity and household size as predictors of risk. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Interannual Variability of Primary Production in the East Siberian Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interannual variability (2002-2018) of primary production, surface seawater temperature (T-0), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ice cover area in the East Siberian Sea (ESS) was studied based on the data of the MODIS-Aqua ocean color scanner. The annual total primary production (PPtot) decreased by 1.7 TgC over 17 years. The multi-year negative trend in PPtot was 0.1 TgC y(-1) (1.38% y(-1)). The decrease in PPtot was accompanied by the decrease in the area-specific primary production (IPP). Over the investigated period the annual mean IPP decreased by 13 mgC m(-2) d(-1). The multi-year negative trend in IPP was 0.76 mgC m(-2) d(-1) y(-1) (0.84% y(-1)). The decrease in PPtot and IPP was accompanied by statistically insignificant increase in T-0 (R-2 = 0.09) and statistically significant decline in PAR (R-2 = 0.29). Over the 17 years, T-0 in ESS increased by 0.68 degrees C (0.04 degrees C y(-1) or 3.2% y(-1)) and PAR declined by 3.4 Ein m(-2) d(-1) (0.2 Ein m(-2) d(-1) y(-1) or 1.9% y(-1)). The ice-free area slightly diminished during the study period (R-2 = 0.10) by 64.94x10(3) km(2). The statistically insignificant negative multi-year trend in the ESS ice-free area was 3.82 x 10(3) km(2) y(-1) (0.87% y(-1)). Long-term variability in PPtot in ESS from 2002 to 2018 depended not only on the decrease in the ice cover but also on PAR level and IPP.

TI  - Surgical treatment of a mandibular ameloblastic carcinoma with metastases to the mandibular lymph nodes in a pony
T2  - EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A 4-year-old Connemara filly was presented with a rapidly growing oral mass on the right rostrolateral mandible and a right mandibular lymphadenopathy. Radiographs of the rostral mandible revealed a lytic, infiltrative mass consistent with soft tissue and mineralised material, and displacement of tooth 403. A biopsy showed characteristic histopathological features of an ameloblastic carcinoma. Subsequent FNA of the right abnormally firm and enlarged mandibular lymph node confirmed the metastatic spread. Computed tomography of the head was performed for surgical planning, including sentinel lymph node mapping to rule out other lymph node involvement. An aggressive lesion, consistent with soft tissue of the rostral right mandible was identified with intralesional contrast injection showing drainage of contrast within the right mandibular lymph nodes (Sentinel node). Based on the infiltrative and destructive nature reported in ameloblastic carcinoma in humans, a rostral mandibulectomy was performed, along with complete mandibular lymphadenectomy. The horse recovered uneventfully from surgery. In the early post-operative period marked lymphoedema of the ventral mandibular region was observed, which resolved 4-5 days post-operatively. Optimal cosmesis was maintained post-operatively, and no recurrence has been observed to date - 12 months post-surgery.

TI  - Improved Estimates of Arctic Land Surface Phenology Using Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high spatial resolution and revisit time of Sentinel-2A/B tandem satellites allow a potentially improved retrieval of land surface phenology (LSP). The biome and regional characteristics, however, greatly constrain the design of the LSP algorithms. In the Arctic, such biome-specific characteristics include prolonged periods of snow cover, persistent cloud cover, and shortness of the growing season. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of Sentinel-2 for deriving high-resolution LSP maps of the Arctic. We extracted the timing of the start and end of season (SoS and EoS, respectively) for the years 2019 and 2020 with a simple implementation of the threshold method in Google Earth Engine (GEE). We found a high level of similarity between Sentinel-2 and PhenoCam metrics; the best results were observed with Sentinel-2 enhanced vegetation index (EVI) (root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean error (ME) of 3.0 d and -0.3 d for the SoS, and 6.5 d and -3.8 d for the EoS, respectively), although other vegetation indices presented similar performances. The phenological maps of Sentinel-2 EVI compared well with the same maps extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in homogeneous landscapes (RMSE and ME of 9.2 d and 2.9 d for the SoS, and 6.4 and -0.9 d for the EoS, respectively). Unreliable LSP estimates were filtered and a quality flag indicator was activated when the Sentinel-2 time series presented a long period (>40 d) of missing data; discontinuities were lower in spring and early summer (9.2%) than in late summer and autumn (39.4%). The Sentinel-2 high-resolution LSP maps and the GEE phenological extraction method will support vegetation monitoring and contribute to improving the representation of Artic vegetation phenology in land surface models.

TI  - Spiritual Reports from Long-Term HIV Survivors: Reclaiming Meaning While Confronting Mortality
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reports from Long-term HIV Survivors: Reclaiming Meaning while Confronting Mortality presents research completed by Kyle Desrosiers in conjunction with the Baylor University Institute for Oral History. Applying lifespan theory to spiritual development, it discusses the narratives of four American long-term HIV survivors from Latter-day Saints, Roman Catholic (2), and Conservative Jewish backgrounds. The fifth profile is from a Protestant pastor with an HIV ministry in a rural area. These profiles are five selected from among 10 interviews with HIV-positive people and caregivers across America now archived by the author at Baylor University. Questions directing this research were: how does HIV status affect participants' relationship to their religious communities, identities, and spiritualties?; what narratives emerge from lifespan perspectives of HIV-positive and queer participants?; and what spiritual practices, mythos, and beliefs evolve/remain as a product of living at the margins of religion and society, alongside coping with a deadly global epidemic? This project reports narratives of change, continuity, and meaning-making to discuss how several gay/queer men from a range of ethnic and faith backgrounds have used spirituality and worldview to navigate life.

TI  - Assessment of forest fragmentation in a traditional shifting agricultural landscape in Senapati District of Manipur, Northeast India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation is associated with the deterioration of the ecosystem's integrity, has negative impacts on biodiversity, degradation of forest, and spatial pattern of the landscape, and become a global conservative issue. Due to advancements in technology such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS), there is a wider possibility of studying, monitoring, and reporting of essential biodiversity variances. The aim of the present study is to assess and quantify the extend and pattern of forest fragmentation over the time series of 2013 and 2017 in the traditional landscape area of Senapati district of Manipur, Northeast India using multi-temporal Landsat data. The Landscape Fragmentation tool has been used to categorize the forest area into four categories: patch, edge, perforated, and core forest by assigning an edge width of 100 m. The result of the study shows that area covered by patch forest has increased by 5.54%, whereas the total core forest area has decreased by 318.5 km(2). The change matrix analysis showed the conversion of one category of the forest to another with the overall maximum changes is associated with degradation in the forest area. With the identification of such change using RS technology and GIS data, we could suggest immediate measures for reclamation and restoration of degraded forest areas to regain its original ecosystem integrity in terms of carbon storage, soil retention, water conservation, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Novel clustering schemes for full and compact polarimetric SAR data: An application for rice phenology characterization
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on rice phenological stages from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is of prime interest for in-season monitoring. Often, prior in-situ measurements of phenology are not available. In such situations, unsupervised clustering of SAR images might help in discriminating phenological stages of a crop throughout its growing period. Among the existing unsupervised clustering techniques using full-polarimetric (FP) SAR images, the eigenvalue-eigenvector based roll-invariant scattering-type parameter, and the scattering entropy parameter are widely used in the literature. In this study, we utilize a unique target scattering-type parameter, which jointly uses the Barakat degree of polarization and the elements of the polarimetric coherency matrix. Likewise, we also utilize an equivalent parameter proposed for compact-polarimetric (CP) SAR data. These scattering-type parameters are analogous to the Cloude-Pottier's parameter for FP SAR data and the ellipticity parameter for CP SAR data. Besides this, we also introduce new clustering schemes for both FP and CP SAR data for segmenting diverse scattering mechanisms across the phenological stages of rice. In this study, we use the RADARSAT-2 FP and simulated CP SAR data acquired over the Indian test site of Vijayawada under the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) initiative. The temporal analysis of the scattering-type parameters and the new clustering schemes help us to investigate detailed scattering characteristics from rice across its phenological stages.

TI  - Detection of recent infection of Japanese encephalitis virus in swine population using IgM ELISA: A suitable sentinel to predict infection in humans
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne flaviviral zoonotic disease and is one of the major causes of encephalitis in children. Swine, being an amplifier host of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), play an important role in its epidemiology. Therefore, early detection of either JEV or antibodies against JEV in swine is a feasible alternative for initiating necessary measures to prevent the spread of infection to humans. Since IgM antibodies appear early in swine sera, recombinant NS1 protein based indirect IgM ELISA was developed in the present study with the objective to know the recent infection of swine population with JEV. The relative diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the developed ELISA was 95.34% and 98.6%, respectively. The developed ELISA was found to have excellent reproducibility on inter-laboratory and inter-institutional validation studies. A total of 3,027 field swine sera samples were screened using the developed ELISA and 488 samples were found positive for IgM against JEV with an overall sero-positivity of 16.12% in swine population of India. The highest seropositivity was observed in swine population of Eastern zone of India which coincided with the maximum number of human JE cases reported from this zone during the same period. Further, antibody kinetics study revealed that the IgM antibodies against NS1 protein of JEV started appearing in swine sera at day 5 and disappeared completely by day 40. The IgG antibodies started appearing at day 7, and remained for more than 365 days indicating the suitability of IgM ELISA to know the recent infection of JEV. The developed IgM ELISA can be readily incorporated into surveillance programs for detection of JEV activity in swine population so that outbreaks in humans can be prevented by taking suitable preventive measures.

TI  - Effect of the Three Gorges Dam on Total Suspended Sediments from MODIS and Landsat Satellite Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) concentration is an extremely important parameter for water quality definition. The aim of this work is the evaluation of the effect of the Three Gorges Dam on total suspended sediments using remote sensing data at different temporal and spatial resolutions. TSM is estimated for the middle Yangtze river, China, before and after the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. The retrieved values are correlated to ground daily discharge values, finding relations between the physical quantities and discharge. Then, the application of the obtained relations to the discharge dataset provides continuous daily estimations of TSM values, also covering the days for which satellite scenes were lacking. This daily dataset will allow us to estimate the annual volume of river solid sediments. According to this work, both low spatial resolution MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and high-resolution. Landsat 5 and 7 are able to detect the changes in TSM distribution over space and time induced by the building of the Three Gorges Dam, with a variation of even 50 mg/L over summer season. The confrontation of solid discharge with daily estimated TSM values shows that the single band MODIS algorithm performs better for medium-low concentrations, while the dual-band algorithm for MODIS and the selected Landsat algorithm perform better with high concentrations.

TI  - Defining the Prognostic Role of MicroRNAs in Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breslow thickness (BT) is the most important histopathologic factor for primary melanoma staging. BT determines the margins for wide local excision whether sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed and subsequent melanoma staging, and patient management. The correct determination of a 0.8-mm cutoff in melanoma is important for pathologists because discrepancies leading to a change in stage can have significant clinical implications, including incorrect and/or inappropriate prognostic information, investigation, management, and follow-up. Difficulties in BT determination are mostly represented by the presence of regression or melanoma associated with a pre-existing nevus. This study aimed at investigating a molecular parameter, namely microRNA (miRNA) expression, in reference to BT assessment. Melanoma cell proliferation is influenced by miRNA dysregulation. Indeed, some miRNAs sustain and induce proliferative signals or repress growth-suppressive pathways, thereby promoting melanoma carcinogenesis. To identify the miRNAs correlating with BT, we analyzed our global miRNA expression data of 20 thin melanomas and identified two potential candidates, miR-21-5p and miR-146a-5p. We assessed the expression of these two specific miRNAs in 90 archive formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of superficially spreading melanomas (SSMs) and 25 nodular melanomas from two independent cohorts and correlated the individual and combined miRNA expression with BT and other tumor characteristics. The individually normalized expression of miR-21-5p and miR-146a-5p showed a highly significant and linear correlation with BT in SSM, and their combined expression value was more strongly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.799, 95% CI = 0.71-0.86) than their individual expressions. This correlation was not significant in nodular melanoma. In SSM, we observed that the combined miRNA expression above or below 1.5 was significantly associated with overall survival and successfully identified all patients with relapsing SSM. We concluded that the combined assessment of miR-21-5p and miR-146a-5p expression in superficially spreading melanoma, in association with BT measurement, could aid pathologists in SSM staging.

TI  - Hysteroscopic versus cervical injection for sentinel node detection in endometrial cancer: A multicenter prospective randomised controlled trial from the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer (MITO) study group
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: During the last years, the role of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) for endometrial cancer (EC) surgical treatment has increased in popularity. However, several controversies remain about different technical steps of SLNM. Thus, a randomised control trial was designed to compare cervical (CI) and hysteroscopic (HI) indocyanine green (ICG) injection for SLNM of newly diagnosed EC undergoing surgical staging. The primary endpoint of the study was to compare these two techniques in terms of para-aortic detection rate.Methods: Patients with apparent stage I or II histologically confirmed EC undergoing surgery were included in the study. This randomised trial distinguished patients in two study groups according to two different techniques of ICG SLNM: CI versus HI injection. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to CI or HI injection in a 1:1 ratio. The central randomisation system allocated patient randomisation numbers sequentially in the order in which the patients were enrolled. This randomised trial was not blinded for either patients or the surgeons.Results: From March 2017 until April 2019, a total of 165 patients were randomised in this study: 85 (51.5%) in the CI group and 80 (48.5%) in the HI group. After randomisation, 14 (8.5%) patients were excluded from the study. Finally, 151 patients were included in the analysis: 82 (54.3%) in the CI group and 69 (45.7%) in the HI group. Hysteroscopy injection shows an ability to detect Sentinel nodes (SNLs) in the para-aortic area of about 10% greater compared with CI injection, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. The HI technique was superior in detecting isolated para-aortic SLNs (5.8% Versus 0%). The CI injection was correlated with higher SLN detection rates at the pelvic level compared with HI injection. Pelvic and overall detection was higher in the CI group.Conclusions: The present study supports the adoption of CI instead of HI injection because the former allows better identification of sentinel nodes (especially in the pelvic area). Detection of SLN in the para-aortic area was slightly higher in patients receiving a HI injection, but the difference with the CI route was not statistically significant. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on associative verbal potential of the lexeme 'Rozhdestvo' ('Christmas') in contemporary Russian youth's linguistic worldview. The research is based on findings of an associative linguistic experiment. The experiment allowed explicating culture codes unconsciously reproduced by respondents, and produced easily calculable results. Each of the respondents had to write down five linguistic units associated with the stimulus word 'Rozhdestvo' ('Christmas'). Linguocul-turological approach is used to interpret the obtained data as it allows analysing how cultural phenomena are represented in linguistic consciousness. The authors discover certain mobility of the linguistic means that verbalise Christmas semantics, as well as certain heterogeneity of people's conceptions of the feast. The study reveals contemporary cultural context and discourses significant for the youth environment. The experiment's primary result can be considered our visualisation of the cultural syncretism reflected in the perception of the lexeme Rozhdestvo. The findings can help when developing projects in education, communications, advertising that exploit cultural images and/or elements of cultural context, and serve as basis for further studies.

TI  - Evaluation of the Built-Up Area Dynamics in the First Ring of Cluj-Napoca Metropolitan Area, Romania by Semi-Automatic GIS Analysis of Landsat Satellite Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accentuated dynamics of the real estate markets of the last 20 years, determined that a large part of the territories in the immediate vicinity of the big urban centers, to change their category of land use, in an accelerated rhythm. Most of the time, the land use changes according to the market requirements, the predominantly agricultural lands being occupied by constructions with residential or industrial functions. Identifying these changes is a difficult task due to the heterogeneity of spatial databases that come from different real estate development projects, so determining and implementing new methods to track land changes are currently highly required. This paper presents a methodologically innovative index-based approach for the rapid mapping of built-up areas, using Landsat-5, Landsat-7, and Landsat-8 satellite imagery. The approach described in this study differs from other conventional methods by the way the analysis was performed and also by the thematic indices used in the processes of built-up area delineation. The method, structured in a complex model, based on Remote Sensing and GIS techniques, can be divided into three distinct phases. The first stage is related to the pre-processing of the remote sensing data. The second stage involves the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and the bare soil index (BI) correlated with the extraction of all areas not covered by vegetation; respectively, the elimination from the result of all areas covered by water, bare land, or uncultivated arable land. The result of this stage is represented by a distinct thematic layer that contains only built-up areas and other associated territories. The last step of the model is represented by the validation of the results, which was performed based on statistical methods and also by direct comparison with field reality, obtaining a validation coefficient which is generally above 85% for any of the methods used. The validation process shows us that by applying this method, the fast mapping of the built-up areas is significantly enhanced and the model is suitable to be implemented on a larger scale in any practical and theoretical application that aims at the rapid mapping of the built-up areas and their evolutionary modeling.

TI  - Fuel Type Classification Using Airborne Laser Scanning and Sentinel 2 Data in Mediterranean Forest Affected by Wildfires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean forests are recurrently affected by fire. The recurrence of fire in such environments and the number and severity of previous fire events are directly related to fire risk. Fuel type classification is crucial for estimating ignition and fire propagation for sustainable forest management of these wildfire prone environments. The aim of this study is to classify fuel types according to Prometheus classification using low-density Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) data, Sentinel 2 data, and 136 field plots used as ground-truth. The study encompassed three different Mediterranean forests dominated by pines (Pinus halepensis, P. pinaster y P. nigra), oaks (Quercus ilex) and quercus (Q. faginea) in areas affected by wildfires in 1994 and their surroundings. Two metric selection approaches and two non-parametric classification methods with variants were compared to classify fuel types. The best-fitted classification model was obtained using Support Vector Machine method with radial kernel. The model includes three ALS and one Sentinel-2 metrics: the 25th percentile of returns height, the percentage of all returns above mean, rumple structural diversity index and NDVI. The overall accuracy of the model after validation was 59%. The combination of data from active and passive remote sensing sensors as well as the use of adapted structural diversity indices derived from ALS data improved accuracy classification. This approach demonstrates its value for mapping fuel type spatial patterns at a regional scale under different heterogeneous and topographically complex Mediterranean forests.

TI  - The Copernicus EMS Validation service as a vector for improving the emergency mapping based on Sentinel data
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) is coordinated by the European Commission and 'provides all actors involved in the management of natural disasters, man-made emergency situations, and humanitarian crises with timely and accurate geo-spatial information derived from satellite remote sensing and complemented by available in situ or open data sources'. It includes two components, Early Warning and Monitoring and Mapping. The latter provides on demand geo-spatial information derived from satellite imagery during all phases of the disaster management cycle. It includes 3 systems, Rapid Mapping (RM), Risk and Recovery Mapping (RRM), and a Validation Service. RM provides geospatial information immediately after a disaster to assess its impact; RRM in the prevention, preparation and reconstruction phases; and the Validation Service is in charge of validating and verifying the products generated by both, and of collecting and analyzing users' feedback. The wide spectrum of activities framed in the Validation Service has allowed it to become a vector to improve the Mapping component through the testing of new methodologies, data input type, or approach for the creation of emergency cartography in the frame of the GEMS. The present paper introduces the main investigation lines based on Sentinel-1 and 2 for flood and fire monitoring that could be implemented in the CEMS services taking into consideration the characteristics of the Mapping component in terms of products to create and time constraints. The applicability of Sentinel-1 for flood monitoring based on the backscattering, the MultiTemporal Coherence (MTC), and dual polarization; and for burnt area delineation based on MTC was studied, while Sentinel-2 was used for burnt area delineation based on vegetation indices. Results indicate that proposed methodologies might be appropriate for the creation of crisis information products in large areas, due to the relative easy and fast implementation compared to classic photo interpretation, although further applicability analyses should be carried out.

TI  - Global comparison of diverse scaling factors and regression models for downscaling Landsat-8 thermal data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical downscaling of land surface temperature (SDLST) algorithms with diverse scaling factors and regression models have been used to produce high spatial resolution LSTs based on Landsat-8 LST. However, the optimal choice of scaling factors and regression models and their associated combinations over various land surfaces, especially from a global perspective, remain unclear and even controversial. To cope with this issue, we compare 35 SDLST algorithms derived from a combination of seven scaling factors and five frequently used regression models over 32 geographical regions worldwide. The seven scaling factors, at varying degrees, make use of the LST-related information embedded within the visible and near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands of Landsat-8 data. The five regression models involved are multiple linear regression, partial least squares regression, artificial neural networks, support vector regression, and random forest (RF). Our main findings are: (1) The performance of the scaling factors and regression models are highly dependent on each other. Nevertheless, for most scaling factors, especially for high-dimension scaling factors with numerous LST-related variables, the downscaling algorithms that use RF as the regression model achieve the highest accuracy. (2) RFT21, a newly proposed SDLST algorithm based on the comparison results and further optimization, has high global operability and sufficiently high accuracy. RFT21 requires only Landsat-8 data as the inputs, and achieves the highest accuracy in comparison with the thermal sharpening (TsHARP) and high-resolution urban thermal sharpener (HUTS) algorithms, with the mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduced by more than 15%. These findings will facilitate the generation of high spatial resolution LSTs worldwide and associated applications.

TI  - Can we locate shrimp aquaculture areas from space? - A case study for Thailand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, shrimp aquaculture has undergone a rapid development in the last decades, as it can help to satisfy the increasing food demand of a growing population. However, shrimp production can be accompanied by environmental impacts, such as land cover changes associated with pond construction, or the degradation of coastal areas through pollution. Environmental footprinting, has proven to be a valuable tool for tracing environmental impacts from human consumption back to their location and sector of origin. Here, we focus on the land footprint, which quantifies the area of required land resources to satisfy human consumption (of shrimp production). However, today's footprinting tools often lack spatially explicit land cover information for land footprint assessments. In this study we developed a new method, which allows us to identify the land cover change caused by shrimp pond construction in Thailand without using sample shrimp pond shape polygons as input data. We use the global water surface explorer (using globally 3 million Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM and Landsat 8 OLI images, acquired between 1984 and 2015), aerial photographs and land cover maps in combination with known aquaculture locations, to identify water areas in Thailand that have a high likelihood to be a shrimp pond and to assess the corresponding land cover change. We estimated that in 2015 an area of 377 km(2) had a high likelihood of being shrimp pond water area. Further, we show that the construction of shrimp ponds in Thailand was responsible for the transformation of 552 km(2) primary habitat, such as mangrove areas. Our results support the environmental footprint assessment of shrimp ponds in Thailand, while our proposed method allows identifying possible shrimp pond areas on a global scale.

TI  - Prediction of Poor Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Based on Computed Tomography Markers
T2  - CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal type of stroke worldwide. Herein, we aim to develop a predictive model based on computed tomography (CT) markers in an ICH cohort and validate it in another cohort. Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in 3 medical centers in China. The values of CT markers, including hypodensities, hematoma density, blend sign, black hole sign, island sign, midline shift, baseline hematoma volume, and satellite sign, in predicting poor outcome were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. A nomogram was developed based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis in development cohort. Area under curve (AUC) and calibration plot were used to assess the accuracy of nomogram in this development cohort and validate in another cohort. Results: A total of 1,498 patients were included in this study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that hypodensities, black hole sign, island sign, midline shift, and baseline hematoma volume were independently associated with poor outcome in development cohort. The AUC was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.76) in the internal validation with development cohort and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.72-0.75) in the external validation with validation cohort. The calibration plot in development and validation cohort indicated that the nomogram was well calibrated. Conclusions: CT markers of hypodensities, black hole sign, and island sign might predict poor outcome of ICH patients within 90 days.

TI  - Multi-Temporal InSAR Parallel Processing for Sentinel-1 Large-Scale Surface Deformation Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has achieved great success in various geodetic applications, and its potential for ground deformation measurements on the large scale has attracted increasingly more attention in recent years. The increasing number of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite systems have steadily provided a large amount of SAR data. Among these systems, the Sentinel-1 mission can be considered a milestone in the development of InSAR techniques, offering new opportunities to monitor global surface deformation with high precision, due to its wide coverage, short revisit time, and free access. However, conventional InSAR techniques have encountered great challenges in large-scale InSAR processing over wide areas because of the large computational burden and complexity. In this work, we present a novel parallel computing-based coherent scatterer InSAR (P-CSInSAR) method for automatic and efficient generation of deformation results from Sentinel-1 raw data. To achieve high parallelization performance for the overall InSAR processing chain, parallelization strategies at different levels have been adopted in the P-CSInSAR method, which has been fully addressed in this work. To evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, P-CSInSAR has been tested on the North China Plain regions with three adjacent frames of Sentinel-1 images, and the deformation results have been validated by GPS measurements. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed parallel computing-based P-CSInSAR method. The proposed method can also play an important role in exploiting Sentinel-1 InSAR big data for disaster prevention and reduction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been especially devastating among nursing home residents, with both the health circumstances of individual residents as well as communal living settings contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Preventing the spread of COVID-19 infection requires a multipronged approach that includes early identification of infected residents and health care personnel, compliance with infection prevention and control measures, cohorting infected residents, and furlough of infected staff. Strategies to address COVID-19 infections among nursing home residents vary based on the availability for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests, the incorporation of tests into broader surveillance efforts, and using results to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. We review the tests available to diagnose COVID-19 infections, the implications of universal testing for nursing home staff and residents, interpretation of test results, issues around repeat testing, and incorporation of test results as part of a long-term response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a structured approach for facility-wide testing of residents and staff and provide alternatives if testing capacity is limited, emphasizing contact tracing. Nursing homes with strong screening protocols for residents and staff, that engage in contact tracing for new cases, and that continue to remain vigilant about infection prevent and control practices, may better serve their residents and staff by thoughtful use of symptom- and risk-based testing strategies.

TI  - Effect of restricted emissions during Covid-19 lockdown on air quality in Rabat - Morocco
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of restricted human activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Rabat city (Morocco) was studied, by analysing data of five criteria pollutants (NO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and O-3) to highlight the effectiveness of restricted emissions on air quality. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to -94%), NO2 (up to -51%), PM2.5 (up to -45%), and PM10 (up to -53%) concentrations were observed during lockdown period compared to the first period (before lockdown). Spaceborne NO2 column observations from TROPOMI on board Sentinel-5P, reveal unprecedented NO2 decreases (up to -60%). By contrast, an increase of approximately 20% in ozone mean concentrations was observed, probably related to the reduction of nitrogen oxides and also of fine particles (PM2.5) which leads to less scavenging of HO2 and as a result greater O-3 production.

TI  - Association Between Childhood Green Space, Genetic Liability, and the Incidence of Schizophrenia
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Childhood exposure to green space has previously been associated with lower risk of developing schizophrenia later in life. It is unclear whether this association is mediated by genetic liability or whether the 2 risk factors work additively. Here, we investigate possible gene-environment associations with the hazard ratio (HR) of schizophrenia by combining (1) an estimate of childhood exposure to residential-level green space based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat satellite images, with (2) genetic liability estimates based on polygenic risk scores for 19 746 genotyped individuals from the Danish iPSYCH sample. We used information from the Danish registers of health, residential address, and socioeconomic status to adjust HR estimates for established confounders, ie, parents' socioeconomic status, and family history of mental illness. The adjusted HRs show that growing up surrounded by the highest compared to the lowest decile of NDVI was associated with a 0.52-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40 to 0.66) lower schizophrenia risk, and children with the highest polygenic risk score had a 1.24-fold (95% CI: 1.18 to 1.30) higher schizophrenia risk. We found that NDVI explained 1.45% (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.90) of the variance on the liability scale, while polygenic risk score for schizophrenia explained 1.01% (95% CI: 0.77 to 1.46). Together they explained 2.40% (95% CI: 1.99 to 3.07) with no indication of a gene-environment interaction (P = .29). Our results suggest that risk of schizophrenia is associated additively with green space exposure and genetic liability, and provide no support for an environment-gene interaction between NDVI and schizophrenia.

TI  - An integrated lineament extraction from satellite imagery and gravity anomaly maps for groundwater exploration in the Gongola Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural trends in the earth's crust can be detected in the form of lineaments and may be useful in several environmental applications such as mineral exploration and hydrogeology. In this study, structural lineaments in the western sector of the Gongola Basin of northern Nigeria were mapped using two approaches - the analysis of gravity data and the processing of Landsat 8 imagery. In the analysis of gravity data, a convolution was done between the fourier kernel obtained from the second horizontal derivative of the truncated horizontal plate and the gravity anomaly. The lineaments were extracted as the sharp gradients in the second horizontal derivative map. The NE-SW and E-W trending lineaments were interpreted as fault (strike-slip wrench) systems. In the second approach, a 5 x 5 directional filter was applied to the Landsat imagery in the N-S, NE-SW, E-W and NW-SE directions. Next, edge detection, thresholding and curve detection were done to extract the lineaments. It was observed that the NW-SE and NE-SW lineaments correlated more with the lineaments/faults in the gravity maps. Comparison of rose diagrams of lineaments as obtained from the remote sensing method shows a high correlation with the major linear structures in the study area. High correlation exists between lineaments delineated from remote sensing and gravity data. Results from the lineament analysis show that groundwater potential is high in the areas with high lineament density. Settlements such as Mallurin Tudu Yautare, Wuro Bundu, Kunde and Tauya which are located in the northern part of the basin have high groundwater potential due to the high lineament density observed from the gravity and the remote sensing methods. Lafiya and Jimbom communities located in the south eastern part of the basin also have high lineament density which signifies good groundwater potential. These results have demonstrated the advantage of remote sensing for detecting lineaments in support of groundwater mapping. This good correlation between lineaments mapped from both methods strengthens existing studies on the structural manifestation of the Gongola Basin. This can serve as a reconnaissance approach to aid more precise geophysical observations.

TI  - Meta-analysis of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Imagery for Agro-environmental Monitoring Using Machine Learning and Statistical Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging systems have recently gained significant attention from researchers and practitioners as a cost-effective means for agro-environmental applications. In particular, machine learning algorithms have been applied to UAV-based remote sensing data for enhancing the UAV capabilities of various applications. This systematic review was performed on studies through a statistical meta-analysis of UAV applications along with machine learning algorithms in agro-environmental monitoring. For this purpose, a total number of 163 peer-reviewed articles published in 13 high-impact remote sensing journals over the past 20 years were reviewed focusing on several features, including study area, application, sensor type, platform type, and spatial resolution. The meta-analysis revealed that 62% and 38% of the studies applied regression and classification models, respectively. Visible sensor technology was the most frequently used sensor with the highest overall accuracy among classification articles. Regarding regression models, linear regression and random forest were the most frequently applied models in UAV remote sensing imagery processing. Finally, the results of this study confirm that applying machine learning approaches on UAV imagery produces fast and reliable results. Agriculture, forestry, and grassland mapping were found as the top three UAV applications in this review, in 42%, 22%, and 8% of the studies, respectively.

TI  - The temporal and spatial relationships between climatic parameters and fire occurrence in northeastern Iran
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a natural disturbance in a wide range of ecosystem types around the world. Although the majority of fires are caused by anthropogenic ignitions, climate and weather are known to influence the risk of fire spread, regardless of ignition source. However, the specific relationships among these factors remain under-studied for many regions of the world. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of climatic variables on forest and rangeland fire regimes in the Golestan Province of Iran in three recent decades. Specifically, we sought to determine: (a) the quantitative temporal relationships between climatic variables and fire occurrence; and (b) the spatial relationships between climatic variables and fire occurrence. To assess quantitative temporal relationships, we used correlation and regression analyses to identify and describe statistically significant relationships between climatic data (mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean annual relative humidity, and mean annual wind velocity) and fire data (number of fire and area burned), using climatic data from the Golestan Meteorological Administration and fire statistics from the Golestan Natural Resources Administration (GNRA). To determine the spatial relationships between climatic variables and fire occurrence, we combined geospatial data on climatic variables (mean annual temperature, mean annual rainfall, wind effect, and topographic wetness index (TWI)) obtained from ASTER-GDEM and active fires derived from MODIS fire products in a random forest (RF) model approach to construct a map of fire susceptibility at 30 m spatial resolution. Our results showed that there was a significant temporal relationship between the number of fires and mean annual temperature, mean annual relative humidity, and mean annual wind velocity. There were also significant temporal relationships between area burned and mean annual relative humidity and mean annual wind velocity. Based on the RF model, the mean annual rainfall had the highest relative importance in fire spatial occurrence. Validation of the fire susceptibility map using area under the curve (AUC) indicated that the RF model created an accurate fire susceptibility map (AUC: 0.823), suggesting that the map can be used as a spatio-temporal climatic alarm system for fire occurrence in the different climatic conditions of the Golestan Province. The results from this study will be important for helping perform climate-change analyses for investigating future temporal and spatial patterns of wildfire in the Golestan Province.

TI  - On the application of METRIC-GEE to estimate spatial and temporal evaporation rates in a mediterranean lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and reservoirs are vital resources for food security and economic prosperity. High evaporation rates can result in a greater water loss leading often to water shortage. Data scarcity prevents the estimation of such phenomenon in many lakes throughout the world. Recently, Google-Earth Engine (GEE) has been ho sting the widely acknowledged Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) system that enables the spatial and temporal estimations of the evaporation rates. Evaporation rates retrieved through METRIC-GEE system were compared to other lake variables between 2014 and 2018. A spatio-temporal assessment of the evaporation rates within the studied lake as well as a comparison to another regional lake (i.e. Kinneret) has been conducted. Results show that thermal stratification was already established in Lake Qaraoun in May. This strong persistent stratification (up to 13 degrees C) continued in June and July, then it started to weaken at the beginning of August. Evaporation correlated slightly better with thermal stratification than with surface temperature, with values of 0.71 and 0.67, respectively. The lowest monthly evaporation rates were found in December (30 mm) and the highest rates in August (above 200 mm). The highest spatial variations were found between May and August. Retrieved monthly evaporation rates were found comparable to those of the nearby studied Lake Kinneret and pan evaporation records from a close station. Such findings highlight on the relation between evaporation and understudied variables and the use of METRIC-GEE system to estimate evaporation rates in data scare regions.

TI  - Integration of InSAR Time-Series Data and GIS to Assess Land Subsidence along Subway Lines in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this research were to map and analyze the risk of land subsidence in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, South Korea using satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series data, and three ensemble machine-learning models, Bagging, LogitBoost, and Multiclass Classifier. Of the types of infrastructure present in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, subway lines may be vulnerable to land subsidence. In this study, we analyzed Persistent Scatterer InSAR time-series data using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) algorithm to generate a deformation time-series map. Subsidence occurred at four locations, with a deformation rate that ranged from 6-12 mm/year. Subsidence inventory maps were prepared using deformation time-series data from Sentinel-1. Additionally, 10 potential subsidence-related factors were selected and subjected to Geographic Information System analysis. The relationship between each factor and subsidence occurrence was analyzed by using the frequency ratio. Land subsidence susceptibility maps were generated using Bagging, Multiclass Classifier, and LogitBoost models, and map validation was carried out using the area under the curve (AUC) method. Of the three models, Bagging produced the largest AUC (0.883), with LogitBoost and Multiclass Classifier producing AUCs of 0.871 and 0.856, respectively.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Environment transformation is inevitable in the coastal lands of eastern China. It is a land characterized by rapid urbanization, which requires an objective method to evaluate environmental quality (EQ). In this study, a remote sensing-based theoretical research framework was used to create a synthetic remote sensing environmental index (RSEI). Then, spatio-temporal characteristics and transformation of EQ were evaluated by applying the RSEI to the coastal lands of Hangzhou Bay. Results demonstrated that: (1) the background value of the RSEI remained stable, but the standard deviation of the RSEI increased from 0.227 to 0.268 from 2000 to 2015; (2) the overall structure of EQ became polarized such that the two extreme grades (excellent and poor) increased by 13.000%; and (3) the lands where prominent EQ changes occurred were in Yinzhou (improvement) and Pinghu (degradation) in Hangzhou Bay.

TI  - Satellite-observed changes of surface spectral reflectances due to solar farming and the implication for radiation budget
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased deployment of solar farms in the last decade is coincident with continued monitoring of surface spectral reflectances by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) aboard NASA Aqua satellite. By analyzing the surface spectral reflectances retrieved at seven MODIS shortwave bands, this study quantifies the changes of surface spectral reflectances caused by solar farms commissioned in the southwestern US. Our case study using one solar farm indicates a 20%-25% reduction of surface reflectance over the seven MODIS bands due to the solar panel installation. Radiative transfer calculation shows that such a reduction in surface spectral reflectance leads to a similar to 23% decrease in the upward shortwave broadband flux at the surface and a similar to 14%-18% decrease in the clear-sky reflected shortwave flux at the top of atmosphere (TOA). Though the MODIS surface reflectance retrievals can be affected by other factors such as aerosol or thin-cirrus contaminations, five out of six solar farm sites analyzed here show unambiguously detectable changes of surface reflectances due to solar panel installations. The brighter the surface is at a given MODIS band before the solar-farm construction, the larger the spectral reflectance reduction tends to be. If all the bright deserts, which occupies about 4% of the global surface, were covered with the solar panels similar to what has been studied here, the estimated instantaneous TOA shortwave radiative forcing would be no more than 1.1 W m(-2).

T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain ecosystems are significantly affected by climate change. However, due to slow vegetation growth in mountain ecosystems, climate-induced vegetation shifts are difficult to detect with low-definition remote sensing images. We used high-definition remote sensing data to identify responses to climate change in a typical Picea crassifolia Kom. forest in the Qilian Mountains, China, from 1968 to 2017. We found that: (1) Picea crassifolia Kom. forests were distributed in small patches or strips on shaded and partly shaded slopes at altitudes of 2700-3250 m, (2) the number, area, and concentration of forest patches have been increasing from 1968 to 2017 in relatively flat and partly sunny areas, but the rate of area increase and ascend of the tree line slowed after 2008, and (3) the establishment of plantation forests may be one of the reasons for the changes. The scale of detected change in Picea crassifolia Kom.forest was about or slightly below 30 m, indicating that monitoring with high-resolution remote sensing data will improve detectability and accuracy.

TI  - Breakpoint detection in non-stationary runoff time series under uncertainty
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most conventional hydrological time series models, used for forecasting or synthetic data generation, are based on the stationary hypothesis. Hydrologic variables such as surface runoff discharge exhibit non-stationary behavior due to the effects of climate change or human activities. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to analyze the uncertainty of the number and location of breakpoints in runoff time series. The non-stationary runoff time series is simulated by segmenting the series into stationary pieces, which follow an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) process, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The length of each piece and the order of the piecewise ARMA model are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Several runoff time series with variable lengths are generated based on the observed data and the probability distribution function(s) (PDFs) of breakpoint location(s) are constructed. An optimal set of breakpoint locations are found for each generated runoff time series by minimizing the objective function based on the MDL. Finally, the PDF(s) of breakpoint location(s) is (are) constructed using the results of the mentioned optimization model. To evaluate the proposed methodology, it is applied to the case study of Zayandehrud River in Iran. According to the obtained breakpoint PDF for the runoff time series, three breakpoints around years of 1987, 1996 and 2006 are identified. The results are analyzed by investigating the time series of agricultural lands derived using remote sensing data and studying the impacts of interbasin water transfer projects implemented in the study area. Overall, investigating human-induced changes in the study area confirms the obtained shape of the PDF of runoff breakpoint and shows the good performance of the developed method for finding the number and location of breakpoints in the runoff time series.

TI  - New Circulation Features in the Okhotsk Sea from a Numerical Model
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the eddy-permitting model, circulation in the Okhotsk Sea and in an adjacent area of the Pacific Ocean is retrospectively simulated from 1991 to 2000. It is shown that the Sea has four types of circulation, each one for its own season with a strengthening of all currents in winter and a weakening in summer. We estimate and analyze the values of the simulated monthly-averaged volume transport of the main currents: the coastal branch of the East Sakhalin Current, the over-slope branch of the East Sakhalin Current, the coastal branch of the North Okhotsk Current, the over-slope branch of the North Okhotsk current, the Middle Current and the West Kamchatka Current. In contrast to the conventional circulation schemes, the North Okhotsk Current is found to consist of two branches, one over a continental slope and another along the northern shelf. The simulation results on the double-branch structure of this current are found to be in a reasonable agreement with instrumental measurements, CTD observations, satellite data and other oceanography reanalysis.

TI  - Flare Statistics for Young Stars from a Convolutional Neural Network Analysis of TESS Data
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - All-sky photometric time-series missions have allowed for the monitoring of thousands of young (t(age) < 800 Myr) stars in order to understand the evolution of stellar activity. Here, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN), stella, specifically trained to find flares in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) short-cadence data. We applied the network to 3200 young stars in order to evaluate flare rates as a function of age and spectral type. The CNN takes a few seconds to identify flares on a single light curve. We also measured rotation periods for 1500 of our targets and find that flares of all amplitudes are present across all spot phases, suggesting high spot coverage across the entire surface. Additionally, flare rates and amplitudes decrease for stars t(age) > 50 Myr across all temperatures T-eff >= 4000 K, while stars from 2300 <= T-eff < 4000 K show no evolution across 800 Myr. Stars of T-eff <= 4000 K also show higher flare rates and amplitudes across all ages. We investigate the effects of high flare rates on photoevaporative atmospheric mass loss for young planets. In the presence of flares, planets lose 4%-7% more atmosphere over the first 1 Gyr. stella is an open-source Python toolkit hosted on GitHub and PyPI.

TI  - Estimating Surface Downward Longwave Radiation Using Machine Learning Methods
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The downward longwave radiation (L-d, 4-100 mu m) is a major component of research for the surface radiation energy budget and balance. In this study, we applied five machine learning methods, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), random forest (RF), and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), to estimate L-d using ground measurements collected from 27 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations. L-d measurements in situ were used to validate the accuracy of L-d estimation models on daily and monthly time scales. A comparison of the results demonstrated that the estimates on the basis of the GBRT method had the highest accuracy, with an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 17.50 W m(-2) and an R value of 0.96 for the test dataset on a daily time scale. These values were 11.19 W m(-2) and 0.98, respectively, on a monthly time scale. The effects of land cover and elevation were further studied to comprehensively evaluate the performance of each machine learning method. All machine learning methods achieved better results over the grass land cover type but relatively worse results over the tundra. GBRT, RF, and MARS methods were found to show good performance at both the high- and low-altitude sites.

TI  - Turbidity Estimation from GOCI Satellite Data in the Turbid Estuaries of China's Coast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the distribution and variation of water turbidity directly represent important information related to the marine ecology and multiple biogeochemical processes, including sediment transport and resuspension and heat transfer in the upper water layer. In this study, a neural network (NN) approach was applied to derive the water turbidity using the geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) data in turbid estuaries of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. The results showed a good agreement between the GOCI-derived turbidity and in situ measured data with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.84, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 58.8 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU), mean absolute error of 25.1 NTU, and mean relative error of 34.4%, showing a better performance than existing empirical algorithms. The hourly spatial distributions of water turbidity in April 2018 suggested that high turbidity regions were distributed in the Yellow River estuary, Yangtze River estuary, Hangzhou Bay, and coastal waters of Zhejiang Province. Furthermore, the relationship between water turbidity and tide were estimated. A defined turbid zone was defined to evaluate the diurnal variations of turbidity, which has subtle changes at different times. Our results showed an inverse relationship between turbidity and tide over six selected stations, i.e., when the value of turbidity is high, then the corresponding tidal height is usually low, and vice versa. The combined effects of tidal height and tidal currents could explain the phenomena, and other factors such as winds also contribute to the turbidity distributions.

TI  - Monitoring Bark Beetle Forest Damage in Central Europe. A Remote Sensing Approach Validated with Field Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decades, climate change has triggered an increase in the frequency of spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) in Central Europe. More than 50% of forests in the Czech Republic are seriously threatened by this pest, leading to high ecological and economic losses. The exponential increase of bark beetle infestation hinders the implementation of costly field campaigns to prevent and mitigate its effects. Remote sensing may help to overcome such limitations as it provides frequent and spatially continuous data on vegetation condition. Using Sentinel-2 images as main input, two models have been developed to test the ability of this data source to map bark beetle damage and severity. All models were based on a change detection approach, and required the generation of previous forest mask and dominant species maps. The first damage mapping model was developed for 2019 and 2020, and it was based on bi-temporal regressions in spruce areas to estimate forest vitality and bark beetle damage. A second model was developed for 2020 considering all forest area, but excluding clear-cuts and completely dead areas, in order to map only changes in stands dominated by alive trees. The three products were validated with in situ data. All the maps showed high accuracies (acc > 0.80). Accuracy was higher than 0.95 and F1-score was higher than 0.88 for areas with high severity, with omission errors under 0.09 in all cases. This confirmed the ability of all the models to detect bark beetle attack at the last phases. Areas with no damage or low severity showed more complex results. The no damage category yielded greater commission errors and relative bias (CEs = 0.30-0.42, relB = 0.42-0.51). The similar results obtained for 2020 leaving out clear-cuts and dead trees proved that the proposed methods could be used to help forest managers fight bark beetle pests. These biotic damage products based on Sentinel-2 can be set up for any location to derive regular forest vitality maps and inform of early damage.

TI  - Soil water content and actual evapotranspiration predictions using regression algorithms and remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of technology and the development of data analysis, such as remote sensing and regression algorithms, are an easy and inexpensive way to estimate parameters related to water management, such as actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and soil water content (SWC). Therefore, the objective of this study was to predict the water management parameters with vegetation indices (VIs) and regression algorithms to enable irrigation management in a totally remote manner. The study was carried out in commercial maize areas irrigated by central pivots in the western part of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The MOD09GQ product was used to generate input data for the training models and to understand the phenology variations in the crops. The prediction of the dependent variables was tested using six regression algorithms, and the best algorithm was selected based on five statistical metrics. Among the regression models tested, the three that best fit the ETa and SWC data were RF (random forest), cubist (cubist regression), and GBM (gradient boosting machine), with slight superiority of cubist for the ETa and RF for the SWC. The fitted models for ETa and SWC showed the potential of VIs in providing information for irrigated agriculture and reinforcing the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the SWC and ETa variables. The findings make it possible to monitor irrigation efficiently with only the red and near infrared wavelengths, a fact that is considered the main contribution of this research to the practical and scientific communities.

TI  - Trends in aerosol optical properties over Eastern Europe based on MODIS-Aqua
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides characteristics of aerosol columnar properties, measured over ten countries in Eastern Europe from 2002 to 2019. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) were obtained with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 merged Dark Target and Deep Blue aerosol product. The product is validated using ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) situated at Minsk, Belsk, Moldova and Kyiv. The results showed that 76.15% of retrieved AOD data are within the expected error. It was established that 64.2% of AOD points are between 0 and 0.2 and 79.3% of all AE points are over 1. Mean AOD values in the region vary from 0.130 +/- 0.04 (Moldova) to 0.193 +/- 0.03 (Czech Republic) with mean value in the region 0.162 +/- 0.05. Seasonal mean AOD (AE) values were at the maximum during the summer from 0.231 +/- 0.05 (1.482 +/- 0.09 in winter) to minimum 0.087 +/- 0.04 during the winter (1.363 +/- 0.17 in summer). Gradual AOD reduction is observed in all countries with annual trend from -0.0050 (Belarus) to -0.0029 (Russia). Finally, the relationship between AOD and AE was studied to classify various aerosol types and showed seasonal non-uniformity of their contribution depending on variation in sources. The entire region is under significant impact of various aerosol types, including clean continental (CC), mixed (MX) and anthropogenic/burning (AB) aerosols types that are at 59.77%, 24.72%, and 12.97% respectively. These results form an important basis for further regional studies of air quality and distribution of sources of pollution.

TI  - The problem of axillary staging in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Role of targeted axillary dissection and types of lymph node markers
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Review
AB  - Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) consists of a new axillary staging technique that combines sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and clipped lymph node biopsy (CLNB) in the same surgery, in order to re-stage patients with breast cancer and positive axillary lymph nodes undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAQT). Prior to the NAQT, the affected lymph node is punctured and a solid marker is left inside echo-guided, in order to biopsy it in the subsequent surgery. There are numerous types of markers: metallic (steel, titanium or polyglycolic acid clips), radioiodine or ferromagnetic seeds, which differ in the method of location (wire, gamma-detection or magnetic probe). The aim of this study is to perform a systematic review about the current status of the TAD, as well as to explain the different techniques and types of axillary marking, based on the current available evidence.

TI  - Empirical modelling of suspended solids in a subtropical lagoon (Brazil) using linear spectral mixing algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) technique has been used in remote sensing applications and allows the estimation of the proportional contribution of different constituents in the pixel reflectance. Despite the great potential for vegetation and land cover studies, there are few studies examining the LSMM efficiency for optically complex inland waters. In addition, LSMM-derived images have shown a promising application in water quality mapping. In this context, Mirim lagoon (Brazil) presents seasonal variability of suspended solids (SS) influenced by sediment yield from tributaries and surrounding areas (e.g.: croplands). While negative impact on water quality makes relevant the SS mapping for management of this ecosystem, there is no studies using remote sensoing in this lagoon. This study develops an empirical model for SS concentration in the Northern Mirim lagoon using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The framework applies the linear spectral mixing algorithm in two MSI images and the empirical model was developed using the multiple linear regression. We validated the model performance using Monte Carlo simulation method. The mapping of SS was satisfactory in both images: the estimated concentrations are consistent with in-situ measurements. The results show that LSMM application supports the mapping of SS and its spatial distribution. Finally, this study is the first application of Sentinel-2 MSI images in the Mirim lagoon and the results present the potential of this empirical modelling for sediment mapping. The spatial information supports the local managers to understand the sources of degradation of water quality and protect this aquatic ecosystem.

TI  - Policing's Information Problem
T2  - TEXAS LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - We spend over $100 billion each year on policing in the United States, yet have very little idea of what keeps us safe. From the adoption of new technologies like facial recognition to militarization to stop-and-frisk tactics, and much else, police in the United States pursue public safety strategies without understanding the full range of costs or benefits. There is a particularly troubling tendency to ignore the social costs (the impact policing practices have on individuals)-and the distributional costs (how policing regularly falls most heavily on racial and marginalized communities). As a result, we don't know what keeps us safe, and there is a real risk we are doing more harm than good.This Article asks why we as a society know so little about how to assure safety, and what we can do to change this state of affairs. The Article's thesis is that a variety of dysfunctions around the politics of policing leads to legislative stasis and executive inertia: governing officials simply defer to the police. Blind trust in the police, fear of a powerful police lobby, and a law enforcement culture of secrecy and insulation result in a serious information failure. Legislative and executive officials (and the police themselves) simply lack the information needed to address whether police are doing a good job of keeping the public safe, and so they do little or nothing to assure public safety.The Article proposes a set of solutions to encourage the development of information about policing, including sentinel event review, information forcing legislation, the establishment of regulatory intermediaries, and the creation of a policing college. Its main proposal is to encourage broad use of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) about policing. CBA, though prominently used in other areas of government, is almost nonexistent in the field of policing. Adoption of some combination of some of these tools is essential to ensure just, effective public safety.

T2  - ASTROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial simulations for crewed missions are critically important for testing technologies and improving methods and procedures for future robotic and human planetary exploration. In February 2018, AMADEE-18 simulated a mission to Mars in the Dhofar region of Oman. During the mission, a field crew coordinated by the osterreichisches Weltraum Forum (OeWF) accomplished several experiments in the fields of astrobiology, space physiology and medicine, geology, and geophysics. Within the scientific payload of AMADEE-18, ScanMars provided geophysical radar imaging of the subsurface at the simulated landing site and was operated by analog astronauts wearing spacesuits during extra-vehicular activities. The analog astronauts were trained to operate a ground-penetrating radar instrument that transmits and then collects radio waves carrying information about the geological setting of the first few meters of the subsurface. The data presented in this work show signal returns from structures down to 4 m depth, associated with the geology of the investigated rocks. Integrating radar data and the analog astronauts' observations of the geology at the surface, it was possible to identify the contact between shallow sediments and bedrock, the local occurrence of conductive soils, and the presence of pebbly materials in the shallow subsurface, which together describe the geology of recent loose sediments overlying an older deformed bedrock. The results obtained by ScanMars confirm that subsurface radar sounding at martian landing sites is key for the geological characterization at shallow depths. The geologic model of the subsurface can be used as the basis for reconstructing palaeoenvironments and paleo-habitats, thus assisting scientific investigations looking for traces of present or past life on the Red Planet.

TI  - Corneal fibroblasts: Function and markers
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Corneal stromal keratocytes contribute to the maintenance of corneal transparency and shape by synthesizing and degrading extracellular matrix. They are quiescent in the healthy cornea, but they become activated in response to insults from the external environment that breach the corneal epithelium, with such activation being associated with phenotypic transformation into fibroblasts. Corneal fibroblasts (activated keratocytes) act as sentinel cells to sense various external stimuli-including damage-associated molecular patterns derived from injured cells, pathogen-associated molecular patterns of infectious microorganisms, and inflammatory mediators such as cytokines-under pathological conditions such as trauma, infection, and allergy. The expression of various chemokines and adhesion molecules by corneal fibroblasts determines the selective recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in a manner dependent on the type of insult. In infectious keratitis, the interaction of corneal fibroblasts with various components of microbes and with cytokines derived from infiltrated inflammatory cells results in excessive degradation of stromal collagen and consequent corneal ulceration. Corneal fibroblasts distinguish between type 1 and type 2 inflammation through recognition of corresponding cytokines, with their activation by type 2 cytokines contributing to the pathogenesis of corneal lesions in severe ocular allergic diseases. Pharmacological targeting of corneal fibroblast function is thus a potential novel therapeutic approach to prevention of excessive corneal stromal inflammation, damage, and scarring.

TI  - Preoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes with hybrid SPECT/computed tomography imaging may improve the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsies in patients with early stages of cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to investigate the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) method in patients with cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) guided by preoperative hybrid single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) lymphoscintigraphy.MethodsThirty-nine patients with stage T1-T3, any N-stage, M0 cancer of the oesophagus or GOJ planned for curatively intended esophagectomy underwent preoperative SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy following endoscopically guided submucosal injection of radiocolloid and intraoperative radio-guided SLNB using a hand-held gamma scintillation device.ResultsThe detection rate in preoperative SPECT/CT imaging was 88%. The median number of detected SLN stations in preoperative imaging was 1 (range 0-4). At least one suspected SLN was identified in all intraoperative SLNP procedures. In six cases, no lymph nodes were identified in the SLNB. In six cases, the SLNB was false negative. The sensitivity for successful SLNB procedures was 20%, the specificity was 100% and the accuracy was 75%.ConclusionsPreoperative SLN mapping using SPECT/CT yields a high number of detected SLN stations compared to previous studies using planar imaging. The accuracy of the SLNB method in patients with predominantly >= T3-stage tumours and with a history of previous neoadjuvant treatment is poor, and the method is not recommended in these patient groups.

TI  - Deformations Prior to the Brumadinho Dam Collapse Revealed by Sentinel-1 InSAR Data Using SBAS and PSI Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential Interferometric SAR (DInSAR) has been used to monitor surface deformations in open pit mines and tailings dams. In this paper, ground deformations have been detected on the area of tailings Dam-I at the Corrego do Feijao Mine (Brumadinho, Brazil) before its catastrophic failure occurred on 25 January 2019. Two techniques optimized for different scattering models, SBAS (Small BAseline Subset) and PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry), were used to perform the analysis based on 26 Sentinel-1B images in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, which were acquired on descending orbits from 03 March 2018 to 22 January 2019. A WorldDEM Digital Surface Model (DSM) product was used to remove the topographic phase component. The results provided by both techniques showed a synoptic and informative view of the deformation process affecting the study area, with the detection of persistent trends of deformation on the crest, middle, and bottom sectors of the dam face until its collapse, as well as the settlements on the tailings. It is worth noting the detection of an acceleration in the displacement time-series for a short period near the failure. The maximum accumulated displacements detected along the downstream slope face were -39 mm (SBAS) and -48 mm (PSI). It is reasonable to consider that Sentinel-1 would provide decision makers with complementary motion information to the in situ monitoring system for risk assessment and for a better understanding of the ongoing instability phenomena affecting the tailings dam.

TI  - Reconstruction of Spatiotemporally Continuous MODIS-Band Reflectance in East and South Asia from 2012 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To reconstruct Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) band reflectance with optimal spatiotemporal continuity, three bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models-the Ross-Thick-Li-Sparse Reciprocal (RTLSR) model, Gao model, and adjusted BF model-were used to retrieve MODIS-band reflectance for cloudy MODIS pixels according to different inversion conditions with a proposed filling algorithm. Then, a spatiotemporally continuous MODIS-band reflectance dataset for most of Asia with more than 98% spatiotemporal coverage was reconstructed from 2012 to 2015. The validation highlighted an evident improvement in filling cloudy MODIS observations; a reasonable spatial distribution, such as in South Asia and Southeast Asia; and acceptable precision for the filled MODIS pixels, with the root mean square error percentage (RMSE%) at 9.7-9.8% and 12-16% for the Gao and adjusted BF models, respectively. In the course of reconstructing the spatiotemporal continuous MODIS-band reflectance, the differences among the three models were discussed further. For a 16-day period with a stable and unchanged land surface, the RTLSR model, as a basic model, accurately derived land surface reflectance (no more than 10% RMSE% for MCD43C1 V006 band 1) and outperformed the other two models. When the inversion period is sufficiently long (e.g., 108 days, 188 days, 268 days, or a full year), the Gao/adjusted BF model provides better precision than the RTLSR model by considering the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture/NDVI as intermediate variables used to adjust the BRDF parameters in real time. The Gao model is optimal when the inversion period is sufficiently long. Based on combining the RTLSR model and Gao/adjusted BF model, we proposed a filling algorithm to derive a dataset of MODIS-band reflectance with optimal spatiotemporal continuity.

TI  - Detecting Cover Crop End-Of-Season Using VENμS and Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops are planted during the off-season to protect the soil and improve watershed management. The ability to map cover crop termination dates over agricultural landscapes is essential for quantifying conservation practice implementation, and enabling estimation of biomass accumulation during the active cover period. Remote sensing detection of end-of-season (termination) for cover crops has been limited by the lack of high spatial and temporal resolution observations and methods. In this paper, a new within-season termination (WIST) algorithm was developed to map cover crop termination dates using the Vegetation and Environment monitoring New Micro Satellite (VEN mu S) imagery (5 m, 2 days revisit). The WIST algorithm first detects the downward trend (senescent period) in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series and then refines the estimate to the two dates with the most rapid rate of decrease in NDVI during the senescent period. The WIST algorithm was assessed using farm operation records for experimental fields at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC). The crop termination dates extracted from VEN mu S and Sentinel-2 time-series in 2019 and 2020 were compared to the recorded termination operation dates. The results show that the termination dates detected from the VEN mu S time-series (aggregated to 10 m) agree with the recorded harvest dates with a mean absolute difference of 2 days and uncertainty of 4 days. The operational Sentinel-2 time-series (10 m, 4-5 days revisit) also detected termination dates at BARC but had 7% missing and 10% false detections due to less frequent temporal observations. Near-real-time simulation using the VEN mu S time-series shows that the average lag times of termination detection are about 4 days for VEN mu S and 8 days for Sentinel-2, not including satellite data latency. The study demonstrates the potential for operational mapping of cover crop termination using high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing data.

TI  - A Spatially Constrained Multichannel Algorithm for Inversion of a First-Order Microwave Emission Model at L-Band
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and reducing the uncertainties in the inversion of the first-order radiative transfer models at the L-band are important for the improved spaceborne retrievals of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) over dense canopy. This article quantifies and compares the sensitivity of dual-channel inversion of the two-stream (2S) and tau-omega models and proposes a new inversion approach for simultaneous retrievals of SM, VOD, and vegetation-scattering albedo (omega) from a single satellite overpass. In particular, the inversion algorithm incorporates the information of the nearby spatial observations, assuming that the values of VOD and omega remain locally invariant, and constrains its solutions to high-resolution alpha priori physical/climatological knowledge of the retrieval variables. The results demonstrate that the uncertainty in the inversion of 2S model is slightly higher than the tau-omega model under noisy observations and remains homoscedastic for SM and omega, while grows heteroscedastically for higher VOD values due to the shape of the cost function. The results are validated using the SMAP data, the dense Mesonet SM network, the in situ measurements from the International SM Network (ISMN), and the derived VOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the state of Oklahoma in the United States. It is shown that the new approach can recover simultaneously high-resolution features of SM, VOD, and omega only from a single Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) overpass, where the unbiased root-meansquared error (ubRMSE) of SM and VOD is reduced by 30% and 70%, respectively, when compared with an unconstrained time-windowed inversion approach.

TI  - Consistency Analysis and Accuracy Assessment of Three Global 30-m Land-Cover Products over the European Union using the LUCAS Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover plays an important role in the Earth's energy balance, the hydrological cycle, and the carbon cycle. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the current global land-cover (GLC) products and to understand the differences between these products so that they can be used effectively in different applications. In this study, three 30-m GLC products, namely GlobeLand30-2010, GLC_FCS30-2015, and FROM_GLC30-2015, were evaluated in terms of areal consistency and spatial consistency using the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) reference dataset over the European Union (EU). Given the limitations of the traditional confusion matrix used in accuracy assessment, we adjusted the confusion matrices from sample counts by accounting for the class proportions of the map and reported the standard errors of the descriptive accuracy measures in the accuracy assessment. The results revealed the following. (1) The overall accuracy of the GlobeLand30-2010 product was the highest at 88.90 +/- 0.68%; this was followed by GLC_FCS30-2015 (84.33 +/- 0.80%) and FROM_GLC2015 (65.31 +/- 1.0%). (2) The consistency between the GLC_FCS30-2015 and GlobeLand30-2010 is higher than the consistency between other products, with an area correlation coefficient of 0.930 and a proportion of consistent pixels of 52.41%, respectively. (3) Across the area of the EU, the dominant land-cover types such as forest and cropland are the most consistent across the three products, whereas the spatial consistency for bare land, grassland, shrubland, and wetland is relatively low. (4) The proportion of pixels for which the consistency is low accounts for less than 16.17% of pixels, whereas the proportion of pixels for which the consistency is high accounts for about 39.12%. The disagreement between these products primarily occurs in transitional zones with mixed land cover types or in mountain areas. Overall, the GlobeLand30 and GLC-FCS30 products were found to be the most consistent and to have good classification accuracy in the EU, with the disagreement between the three 30-m GLC products mainly occurring in heterogeneous regions.

TI  - Estimating access to health care in Yemen, a complex humanitarian emergency setting: a descriptive applied geospatial analysis
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In conflict settings, data to guide humanitarian and development responses are often scarce. Although geospatial analyses have been used to estimate health-care access in many countries, such techniques have not been widely applied to inform real-time operations in protracted health emergencies. Doing so could provide a more robust approach for identifying and prioritising populations in need, targeting assistance, and assessing impact. We aimed to use geospatial analyses to overcome such data gaps in Yemen, the site of one of the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crises.Methods We derived geospatial coordinates, fimctionality, and service availability data for Yemen health facilities from the Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System assessment done by WHO and the Yemen Ministry of Public Health and Population. We modelled population spatial distribution using high-resolution satellite imagery, UN population estimates, and census data. A road network grid was built from OpenStreetMap and satellite data and modified using UN Yemen Logistics Cluster data and other datasets to account for lines of conflict and road accessibility. Using this information, we created a geospatial network model to deduce the travel time of Yemeni people to their nearest health-care facilities.Findings In 2018, we estimated that nearly 8 8 million (30.6%) of the total estimated Yemeni population of 28.7 million people lived more than 30-min travel time from the nearest fully or partially functional public primary health-care facility, and more than 12.1 million (42.4%) Yemeni people lived more than 1 h from the nearest fully or partially functional public hospital, assuming access to motorised transport. We found that access varied widely by district and type of health service, with almost 40% of the population living more than 2 h from comprehensive emergency obstetric and surgical care. We identified and ranked districts according to the number of people living beyond acceptable travel times to facilities and services. We found substantial variability in access and that many front-line districts were among those with the poorest access.Interpretation These findings provide the most comprehensive estimates of geographical access to health care in Yemen since the outbreak of the current conflict, and they provide proof of concept for how geospatial techniques can be used to address data gaps and rigorously inform health programming. Such information is of crucial importance for humanitarian and development organisations seeking to improve effectiveness and accountability.

TI  - Benthic classification and IOP retrievals in shallow water environments using MERIS imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving inherent optical properties (IOPs) from multispectral imagery of shallow water environments using physics-based inversion models require prior knowledge of the spectral reflectance of the bottom substrate. The use of an incorrect bottom reflectance adversely affects the IOPs and, in part, the depth derived from inversion models. To date, an operational approach that determines the bottom reflectance from multispectral imagery is lacking; development in this area is especially paramount for locations that exhibit temporal variability in the spatial distributions of submerged aquatic vegetation and benthic microalgae. In this work, we develop a multispectral implementation of the HOPE-LUT algorithm (Hyperspectral Optimization Processing Exemplar with benthic Look Up Table), and apply the approach to MERIS imagery of the Great Bahama Bank (GBB). Overall benthic classification accuracy of this approach was 80.0%, revealing the areal coverage of benthic flora can range from 1052.3 km(2) to 6169.3 km(2) between years in the Exumas, GBB. Comparison of HOPE-LUT IOP retrievals to common inversion model implementations (particularly HOPE, with its default sand endmember) shows that using an incorrect bottom reflectance can lead to over-estimations in aphy(443) (absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 nm), of up to 95%, under-estimations of adg(443) (absorption coefficient of detritus and gelbstoff) up to 50%, and over-estimations of depth up to 20%. In addition, the HOPE-LUT parameterizations generate IOPs within the range of those measured in situ. We demonstrate that, at the scale of a MERIS pixel, the dominant substrates of seagrass, unattached bottom macroalgae and benthic microalgae are spectrally unresolvable at the depths that these classes occur in the GBB. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of commonly used atmospheric corrections algorithms for bathymetry estimation and benthic classification accuracy. The combined benthic classification and inversion scheme presented here is autonomous, i.e., it does not require scene-specific thresholds or modifications. Thus, it should be portable to Sentinel 3 OLCI and potentially MODIS Aqua imagery to obtain a continuous time series of changes in IOPs and benthic cover for the shallow waters over the Great Bahama Bank.

TI  - Flood Hazard and Risk Assessment of Extreme Weather Events Using Synthetic Aperture Radar and Auxiliary Data: A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greater Houston metropolitan area has experienced recurring flooding events in the past two decades related to tropical cyclones and heavy inland rainfall. With the projected recurrence of severe weather events, an approach that outlines the susceptibility of different localities within the study area to potential floods based on analyses of the impacts from earlier events would be beneficial. We applied a novel C-band Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based flood detection method to map floodwater distribution following three recent severe weather events with the goal of identifying areas that are prone to future flood hazards. Attempts were made to calibrate and validate the C-band-based results and analyses to compensate for possible sources of error. These included qualitative and quantitative assessments on L-band aerial SAR data, as well as aerial imagery acquired after one of the events. The findings included the following: (1) most urban centers of Harris county, with few exceptions, are not believed to be prone to flooding hazards in contrast to the densely populated areas on the outskirts of Harris county; (2) nearly 44% of the mapped flood-prone areas lie within a 1 km distance of major drainage networks; (3) areas experiencing high subsidence rates have persistently experienced flooding, possibly exacerbated by morphological changes to the land surface induced by subsidence.

TI  - Modelling groundwater rebound in recently abandoned coalfields using DInSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) processing algorithms, such as the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS), and increased data availability from SAR systems, such as Sentinel-1, provide the opportunity to increase the spatial and temporal density of ground deformation measurements. Such measurements, when combined with modelling, have the potential to make a significant cost-effective contribution to the progressive abandonment strategy of recently closed coalfields. Applications of DInSAR over coalfields have observed heave in coal measures rocks and temporal correlations between the rise of mine water and deformation time-series. The cessation of systematic dewatering can have a variety of detrimental impacts and knowledge of the time-scales (i.e. the rate of rebound) and structure of the mine system are crucial to the remediation strategy. Although mine plans and borehole measurements provide vital information in this regard, mine plans are often incomplete or inaccurate, whereas monitoring boreholes are spatially sparse. Consequently, groundwater can flow in unanticipated directions via goaf, mine shafts and roadways, making it difficult to determine where the impacts of rebound are likely to occur. In this study, ground deformation data obtained using ISBAS DInSAR on ENVISAT (2002-2009) and Sentinel-1 (2015-2019) data are used to develop a simple method to model groundwater rebound in abandoned coalfields. A forward analytical model based upon the principle of effective stress and mine water ponds is first implemented to estimate surface heave in response to changes in groundwater levels measured in monitoring boreholes. The forward model is then calibrated and validated using the ground deformation data. The DInSAR data were subsequently inverted to map the change in groundwater levels in greater detail across the coalfield and forecast surface discharges in order to support mitigation strategies.

TI  - Are Vegetation Dynamics Impacted from a Nuclear Disaster? The Case of Chernobyl Using Remotely Sensed NDVI and Land Cover Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing interest for scientists and society to acquire deep knowledge on the impacts from environmental disasters. The present work deals with the investigation of vegetation dynamics in the Chernobyl area, a place widely known for the devastating nuclear disaster on the 26th of April 1986. To unveil any possible long-term radiation effects on vegetation phenology, the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was analyzed within the 30 km Exclusion Zone, where all human activities were ceased at that time and public access and inhabitation have been prohibited ever since. The analysis comprised applications of seasonal trend analysis using two techniques, i.e., pixel-wise NDVI time series and spatially averaged NDVI time series. Both techniques were applied in each one of the individual land cover types. To assess the existence of abnormal vegetation dynamics, the same analyses were conducted in two broader zones, i.e., from 30 to 60 km and from 60 to 90 km, away from Chernobyl area, where human activities were not substantially altered. Results of both analyses indicated that vegetation dynamics in the 30 km Exclusion Zone correspond to increasing plant productivity at a rate considerably higher than that of the other two examined zones. The outcome of the analyses presented herein attributes greening trends in the 30 km and the 30 to 60 km zones to a combination of climate, minimized human impact and a consequent prevalence of land cover types which seem to be well adapted to increased radioactivity. The vegetation greening trends observed in the third zone, i.e., the 90 km zone, are indicative of the combination of climate and increasing human activities. Results indicate the positive impact from the absence of human activities on vegetation dynamics as far as vegetation productivity and phenology are concerned in the 30 km Exclusion Zone, and to a lower extent in the 60 km zone. Furthermore, there is evidence that land cover changes evolve into the prevalence of woody vegetation in an area with increased levels of radioactivity.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio temporal variations (with respect to space and time) of some of atmospheric parameters over Lake Tana Basin, Ethiopia have been studied from 2001 to 2019 to understand their relationships among aerosol optical depth AOD) and rainfall. The origin and movement of air masses which bring aerosol particles have been studied by using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) values were found to be maximum during the summer season (June-August), but minimum during the winter season (December-February). The annual average of AOD over the Lake Tana Basin varies from 0.21 to 0.34 during 2001-2019 while monthly and seasonal AOD values vary between 0.05 and 0.32, and 0.07 and 0.25 respectively. The HYSPLIT air mass back trajectories model indicate that air masses were traced from Eritrean Plateau, Red sea, Arabian Peninsula, Gulf of Aden and Afar depression. The negative relationship between AOD and Angstrom exponent indicates that the fine mode aerosol particles are dominate over the Tana Lake Basin. The stronger positive correlation coefficient between AOD and cloud fraction (CF) over the Gonder region (north of the Lake Tana Basin) as compared to that for Dangila region (south-west of the Lake Tana Basin; r = 0.61 and r = 0.58 respectively), indicates the source of moisture from the Red Sea region. Nevertheless, the south-easterly increase in the spatial correlation between AOD and water vapor (WV) over the Lake Tana Basin suggests the prime source of moisture form the Western Indian Ocean. Thus, satellite derived AOD data are useful for the study of rainfall patterns.

TI  - Investigation and characterization of atmospheric aerosols over the Urmia Lake using the satellite data and synoptic recordings
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urmia Lake, a hypersaline lake in Northwest Iran is facing a severe drying scenario. The dried part of the lake can act as a source of salt particles that may contaminate the atmosphere of the lake and its surrounding regions. We used the CALIPSO satellite recordings on particulate depolarization ratio (PDR) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 532 nm as well as MODIS AOD at 550 nm during June 2006 to December 2017, to characterize the atmospheric aerosols over the Urmia Lake water catchment region. By monitoring the aerosol layer height that is retrieved from the CALIPSO recordings, we found that most of the dust layers over the Urmia Lake, are transported from the neighboring sources. The mean PDR value for the aerosol layers that are in contact with the lake surface during dry months is similar to 0.16 +/- 0.03 but for dense dust layers, high above the mountain ranges, this is similar to 0.19 +/- 0.04. This study shows that the Urmia Lake is a minor source of atmospheric mineral particles and is very much under the influence of other major neighboring dust sources. Even though it is not easy to distinguish between transported dust layers and particles that may originate from the lake, our investigations show that the lake is mostly active during the driest times of the year, i.e., June to September. During these times, the PDR for the aerosols that are appearing in the vicinity of the dried lake bed is very close to that of dry salt particles.

TI  - Study of the contamination potential of the Jockey Club Landfill, Distrito Federal, Brazil
T2  - ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jockey Club Landfill is a solid waste disposal site located at Brazil's Federal District, which operated inadequately from 1960 until the beginning of 2018. The main objective of this paper was to assess the contamination potential of the Jockey Club Landfill due to leachate and biogas production. Initially, the most susceptible areas to contamination were identified within the two hydrographic sub-basins of Bananal and Riacho Fundo, where the landfill is located, by producing a map of the aquifer's natural vulnerability to contamination. This map was produced based on the DRASTIC methodology, which consists in a weighted linear combination of seven important hydrogeological parameters, with support of the multicriteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and map algebra tools implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. This map evidenced that Jockey Club Landfill is located in areas of moderate to high natural vulnerability to contamination. The water balance throughout the landfill profile was also simulated using the Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance model (HELP), whose results evidenced that the contamination potential is higher in some portions of the landfill due to greater volumes of leachate produced. Lastly, an analysis of ground cover temperature in the landfill region was undertaken, using TM/Landsat seasonal images between the years 1986 to 2016, which indicated a gradual increase in ground temperature, evidencing a possible occurrence of subsurface biogas distribution in the landfill.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of an Operational Rapid Response Fire Spread Forecasting System in the Southeast Mediterranean (Greece)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The current work presents the operational implementation and evaluation of a rapid response fire spread forecasting system, named IRIS, that was developed to provide support to the tactical wildfire suppression activities of the Hellenic Fire Corps. The system was operationally employed during the 2019 fire season in Greece, providing on-demand wildfire spread predictions for 17 incidents. Satellite remote sensing data were employed for quantitatively assessing IRIS's predictions for eight selected events. Our results suggest an overall satisfactory model performance. More importantly, this study demonstrates that, as coupled fire-atmosphere modeling becomes an increasingly popular approach, the respective models have great potential to support operational agencies and wildfire managers during the incident phase.
