TI  - Copepod carcasses in the western Bay of Bengal and associated ecology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although a portion of all copepods in the natural environment are physiologically inactive or dead, there is little data on this aspect in Indian seas. Using the classical neutral red live staining technique, the dead percentage of copepods in the western Bay of Bengal (BoB) is determined for the first time in this study, which takes into account hydrography and zooplankton samples collected on April 2015 (Spring Intermonsoon [SIM]) from 6 inshore and 8 offshore locations in the western BoB. The offshore parts of the research area were infested with a persistent and extensive warm-core eddy/gyre during the sampling time, as demonstrated by satellite data of sea surface temperature, mean sea level anomaly, and surface currents. As a result, the mixed layer depth in the offshore zone was higher, whereas nutrients, chlorophyll a, and turbidity were significantly lower than inshore. Copepods dominated the zooplankton community (> 80%), with abundances ranging from 112 to 2580 No m(-3) in the study area. Calanoids (particularly Paracalanidae) dominated nearshore waters (35-65%), whereas cyclopoids (notably Corycaeidae and Oncaeidae) dominated offshore (49-71%). There were 48 species of copepods identified in total, and all of them had dead individuals (carcasses). Offshore waters had a larger percentage of copepod carcasses (27-39%) than inshore seas (18-28%). The larger percentage of carcasses is possibly related to a higher top-down feeding pressure on cyclopoids in offshore waters due to extreme oligotrophy and the dominance of the microbial food web.

AB  - AIMS: This study presents our experience with Intra-Operative Electron Radio-Therapy (IOeRT) using a mobile linear accelerator at the Sheba Medical Center.BACKGROUND: Intraoperative radiotherapy is an alternative approach of partial breast irradiation for patients with early breast cancer and low risk for local recurrence who are undergoing breast conservation surgery.METHODS: Patients were selected by a multidisciplinary team according to ASTRO\GEC-ESTRO guidelines for partial breast irradiation. IOeRT was administered using SIT LIAC HWL.RESULTS: A total of 28 patients were referred for breast conservation surgery and IOeRT between 8/2019 and 10/2020; 27/28 received IOeRT. In one patient, radiation was aborted due to anaphylactic shock in response to patent blue dye injected for sentinel node identification. Larger than usual seroma were reported on the first post-operative visit in all patients, and regressed spontaneously in 3-6 months. Infected seroma developed post-operatively in 5 patients, requiring surgical drainage in 2 patients. Final pathology matched the preoperative biopsy. There were no cases of pathology upstaging requiring additional adjuvant irradiation or chemotherapy. The patient who did not receive IOeRT was treated with adjuvant external radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: IOeRT is a safe alternative to partial breast irradiation, with a slight increase of postoperative infection rate.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of Land Surface Temperature Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Satellite Observation for Agricultural Areas Using In Situ Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed data are a source of rich information and are valuable for precision agricultural tasks such as soil quality, plant disease analysis, crop stress assessment, and allowing for better management. It is necessary to validate the accuracy of land surface temperature (LST) that is acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite-based remote sensing and verify these data by a comparison with in situ LST. Comprehensive studies at the field scale are still needed to understand the suitability of UAV imagery and resolution, for which ground measurement is used as a reference. In this study, we examined the accuracy of surface temperature data that were obtained from a thermal infrared (TIR) sensor placed on a UAV. Accordingly, we evaluated the LST from the Landsat 8 satellite for the same specific periods. We used contact thermometers to measure LSTs in situ for comparison and evaluation. Between 18 August and 2 September 2020, UAV imagery and in situ measurements were carried out. The effectiveness of high-resolution UAVs imagery and of Landsat 8 imagery was evaluated by considering a regression and correlation coefficient analysis. The data from the satellite photography was compared to the UAV imagery using statistical metrics after it had been pre-processed. Ground control points (GCPs) were collected to create a rigorous geo-referenced dataset of UAV imagery that could be compared to the geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery. The UAV TIR LST showed higher accuracy (R-2 0.89, 0.90, root-mean-square error (RMSE) 1.07, 0.70 degrees C) than the Landsat LST accuracy (R-2 0.70, 0.73, (RMSE) 0.78 degrees C). The relationship between LST and the available soil water content (SWC) was also observed. The results suggested that the UAV-SMC correlation was negative (-0.85) for the image of DOY 230, while this value remains approximately constant (-0.86) for the DOY 245. Our results showed that satellite imagery that was coherent and correlated with UAV images could be useful to assess the general conditions of the field while the UAV favors localized circumscribed areas that the lowest resolution of satellites missed. Accordingly, our results could help with urban area and environmental planning decisions that take into account the thermal environment.

TI  - Predicting heavy metal contents by applying machine learning approaches and environmental covariates in west of Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The cuurent study was performed to predict spatial distribution of some heavy metals (Ni, Fe, Cu, Mn) in western Iran, using environmental covariates and applying two machine learning methods comprised Random forest (RF), and Cubist. In this respect, a combination of different input environmental variables (remote sensing data, topographic attributes, thematic maps and soil properties) were used in modeling under four scenarios (I: remote sensing data (RS); II: RS + topographic attributes resulted from digital elevation model (DEM); III: RS + topographic attributes + thematic maps; IV: RS + topographic attributes + thematic maps +soil properties). The maps of Euclidean distance from mines and roads as well as the geology map have been used as thematic maps. A total of 346 soil samples were taken using stratified random sampling from the surface layers (0-20 cm depth) of the studied area and selected heavy metals (Ni, Fe, Cu, Mn), and soil properties were measured in the laboratory. RF and Cubist models were used to predict soil heavy metals in four scenarios. The results indicated that the best prediction accuracy was achieved for the fourth scenario (IV) when all input variables were combined to predict selected heavy metals. Moreover, two models showed different capability for various metals. According to our results, the random forest model had a high accuracy in predicting Ni (R2 = 0.67) and Cu (R2 = 0.60), In contrast, the Cubist model had a higher accuracy in predicting Mn (R2 = 0.55). For predicting Fe, both models provided a similar accuracy (R2 = 0.73). This study proved the high capability of machine learning methods to use easily available environmental data to predict studied heavy metals in the large scale that are essential for decision making in sustainable management in agricultural and environmental concerns.

TI  - Development of Preclinical Ultrasound Imaging Techniques to Identify and Image Sentinel Lymph Nodes in a Cancerous Animal Model
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK. Treatment is dominated by major surgery because current imaging modalities cannot accurately determine lymph node involvement or vascular invasion. Although potentially curative, surgery carries a high risk of short- and long-term morbidity, including stoma formation. Optimized pre-treatment imaging would decrease the number of bowel cancer patients requiring major surgery. Such imaging would also be equally applicable to other cancers where local resection could significantly improve patient quality of life without compromising long-term outcomes (e.g., melanoma, head and neck cancers, gastro-esophageal, bladder). In this study, we created two mouse models (tumor and control) and used the resolution of high-frequency ultrasound imaging and parameters calculated from dynamically contrast-enhanced ultrasound to predict the likelihood of draining lymph nodes to be involved in the disease. Lymph nodes (LNs) are believed to be the first organs targeted by colorectal cancer cells detached from a primary solid tumor because of their role in draining interstitial fluids. Better detection and assessment of these organs have the potential to help clinicians in stratification and designing optimal design of oncological treatments for each patient. Whilst highly valuable for the detection of primary tumors, CT and MRI remain limited for the characterization of LNs. B-mode ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can improve the detection of LNs and could provide critical complementary information to MRI and CT scans; however, the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) guidelines advise that further evidence is required before US or CEUS can be recommended for clinical use. Moreover, knowledge of the lymphatic system and LNs is relatively limited, especially in preclinical models. In this pilot study, we have created a mouse model of metastatic cancer and utilized 3D high-frequency ultrasound to assess the volume, shape, and absence of hilum, along with CEUS to assess the flow dynamics of tumor-free and tumor-bearing LNs in vivo. The aforementioned parameters were used to create a scoring system to predict the likelihood of a disease-involved LN before establishing post-mortem diagnosis with histopathology. Preliminary results suggest that a sum score of parameters may provide a more accurate diagnosis than the LN size, the single parameter currently used to predict the involvement of an LN in disease.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of GOES-R Land Surface Temperature over Urban Regions: A Case Study for New York City
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect is among the major environmental issues encountered in urban regions. To better predict the dynamics of the SUHI and its impacts on extreme heat events, an accurate characterization of the surface energy balance in urban regions is needed. However, the ability to improve understanding of the surface energy balance is limited by the heterogeneity of surfaces in urban areas. This study aims to enhance the understanding of the urban surface energy budget through an innovation in the use of land surface temperature (LST) observations from remote sensing satellites. A LST database with 5-min temporal and 30-m spatial resolution is developed by spatial downscaling of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R (GOES-R) series LST product over New York City (NYC). The new downscaling method, known as the Spatial Downscaling Method (SDM), benefits from the fine spatial resolution of Landsat-8 and high temporal resolution of GOES-R, and considers the temporal variation in LST for each land cover type separately. Preliminary results show that the SDM can reproduce the temporal and spatial variability of LST over NYC reasonably well and the downscaled LST has a spatial root mean square error (RMSE) of the order of 2 K as compared to the independent Landsat-8 observations. The SDM shows smaller RMSE of 1.93 K over the tree canopy land cover, whereas RMSE is 2.19 K for built-up areas. The overall results indicate that the SDM has potential to estimate LST at finer spatial and temporal scales over urban regions.

TI  - Estimating the Aboveground Biomass of Urban Trees by Combining Optical and Lidar Data: A Case Study of Hengqin, Zhuhai, China
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aboveground biomass (AGB) of trees plays an important role in the urban ecological environment. Unlike forest biomass estimation. the estimation of AGB of urban trees is greatly influenced by human activities and has strong spatial heterogeneity: In this study, taking Hengqin, China, as an example, we extract the tree area accurately and design a collaborative scheme of optical and lidar data. Finally, five evaluation models are used, including two deep learning models (deep belief network and stacked sparse autoencoder). two machine learning models (random forest and support vector regression), and a geographically weighted regression model. The experimental results show that the deep learning model is effective. The result of the stacked sparse autoencoder, which is the best model, is that R-2 = 0.768 and root mean square error = 18.17 mg/ha. The results show that our method can be applied to estimate the AGB of urban trees, which greatly influences urban ecological construction.

TI  - Climate data induced uncertainties in simulated carbon fluxes under corn and soybean systems
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Net carbon balance on croplands depends on numerous factors (e.g., crop type, soil, climate) and their interactions. Agroecosystem models are generally used to assess cropland carbon fluxes because of their ability to capture the complex interactive effects of factors influencing carbon balance. For regional carbon flux simulations, generally gridded climate data sets are used because they offer data for each grid cell of the region of interest. However, studies consistently report uncertainties in climate datasets, which affect the accuracy of carbon flux simulations.OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to 1) determine the uncertainties in daily weather variables of commonly used high resolution gridded climate datasets in the U.S (NARR, NLDAS, Prism and Daymet); 2) estimate their impact on the accuracy of simulated Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) under irrigated and non-irrigated corn and soybeans using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, and 3) understand the relative sensitivity of the NEE to various climate variables.METHODS: The observational data at four flux tower cropland sites in the U.S Midwest region were used to quantify the uncertainties in the gridded weather datasets, and EPIC simulations were performed at each flux tower site using each gridded climate dataset. Further, sensitivity analysis using Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) was conducted.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that daily weather variables in all gridded climate datasets display some degree of bias, leading to considerable uncertainty in simulated NEE. The gridded climate datasets produced based on interpolation techniques (i.e. Daymet and Prism) were shown to have less uncertainties, and resulted in NEE estimates with relatively higher accuracy, likely due to their higher spatial resolution and higher dependency on meteorological station observations. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) values of average growing season NEE estimates for Dayment, Prism, NLDAS and NARR include 22.53%, 23.45%, 62.52% and 66.18%, respectively. The NEE under irrigation (MAPE = 53.15%) tends to be more sensitive to uncertainties compared to the fluxes under non-irrigation (MAPE = 34.19%). Further, this study highlights that NEE responds differently to the individual climate variables and management. Under irrigation management, NEE are more sensitive to temperature. Conversely, under non-irrigation, precipitation is the most dominant factor influencing NEE uncertainty.SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that careful consideration is necessary when selecting climate data to mitigate uncertainties in simulated NEE. Further, alternative approaches such as integration of remote sensing data products may help reduce the models' dependency on climate datasets and improve the accuracy in the simulated CO2 fluxes.

TI  - Ground Deformation Pattern Analysis and Evolution Prediction of Shanghai Pudong International Airport Based on PSI Long Time Series Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Being built on the reclamation area, Shanghai Pudong International Airport (SPIA) has been undergoing uneven subsidence since the beginning of its operation in 1999. In order to explore the evolution characteristics of ground deformation in the SPIA reclamation area and further provide assurance for the airport's safe operation, 141 Sentinel-1A images from October 2016 to September 2021 were selected to acquire time-series ground deformation observations by the StaMPS PSI processing procedure. We subsequently built a ground deformation prediction model using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for the short-term prediction of the SPIA deformation severity area. On this basis, the spatial-temporal evolution trends of SPIA ground deformation in the reclamation area were revealed concerning the influence and mode of action of geological conditions and environmental factors. Finally, we proposed targeted recommendations and strategies for the comprehensive ground deformation prevention and control needs of SPIA. The results indicated that the SPIA exhibits overall subsidence in the eastern part, with the maximum deformation rate reaching -57.29 mm/a. Meanwhile, the central and western part has a local uplift with the maximum deformation rate reaching 32.76 mm/a. The proposed LSTM ground deformation prediction model demonstrated excellent robustness in the region of uneven deformation, and the prediction results were in high agreement with the StaMPS PSI monitoring results. The time-series observations and prediction results are expected to provide references for the expansion project of SPIA and help the research of ground deformation and prevention in related fields.

AB  - Aim This update of the interdisciplinary S3 guideline on the Diagnosis, Therapy and Follow-up of Cervical Cancer (AWMF Registry No. 032/033OL) was published in March 2021. This updated guideline was funded by German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe) as part of the German Guideline Program in Oncology. The guideline was coordinated by the German Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Gynakologie und Geburtshilfe, DGGG) and the Working Group on Gynecological Oncology (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie, AGO) of the German Cancer Society (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft, DKG).Method The process of updating the S3 guideline dating from 2014 was based on an appraisal of the available evidence using the criteria of evidence-based medicine, adaptations of existing evidence-based national and international guidelines or - if evidence was lacking - on a consensus of the specialists involved in compiling the update. After an initial review of the current literature was carried out according to a prescribed algorithm, several areas were identified which, in contrast to the predecessor version from September 2014, required new recommendations or statements which took account of more recently published literature and the appraisal of the new evidence.Recommendations The short version of this guideline consists of recommendations and statements on the epidemiology, screening, diagnostic workup and therapy of patients with cervical cancer. The most important new aspects included in this updated guideline include the newly published FIGO classification of 2018, the radical open surgery approach for cervical cancers up to FIGO stage IB1, and use of the sentinel lymph node technique for tumors = 2 cm. Other changes include the use of PET-CT, new options in radiotherapy (e.g., intensity-modulated radiotherapy, image-guided adaptive brachytherapy), and drug therapies to treat recurrence or metastasis.

TI  - Insights on Transmission, Spread, and Possible Endemization of Selected Arboviruses in Israel-Interim Results from Five-Year Surveillance
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses that infect livestock impact the health and welfare of domestic and wild animals are often responsible for significant economic losses in livestock production. Surveillance and early warning systems effectively predict the emergence and re-emergence of arboviral disease. This paper presents the interim results of five years monitoring the exposure of sentinel naive heifers and Culicoides biting midges (Diptera; Ceratopogonidae) to bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), Simbu serogroup viruses, bluetongue viruses (BTV), and epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV). The data were collected from 11 dairy farms situated within eight different geographical regions in Israel. The results indicate that cattle in Israel are affected by all four viruses from the early summer onward. The investigated viruses exhibit unique site-specific profiles in both ruminants and vectors. The potential of several vectors to transmit these viruses and lack of cross-protection to re-infection with multiple serotypes (BTV and EHDV) or species (Simbu serogroup viruses) highlights some likely mechanisms that may play a role in these viruses' maintenance cycle and possible endemization in our region.

TI  - Characteristics of the Effective Scale Height in the Topside Ionosphere Extracted From Swarm A and Digisonde Observations: Preliminary Results
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ionospheric scale height is a key parameter that defines the shape of the electron density profile. Given that its direct calculation requires knowledge of the physical and chemical state of the plasma, the concept of the effective scale height was proposed to facilitate its application. It is defined as the scale height that fits the electron density profiles with the alpha-Chapman function. Its main characteristics, including the diurnal and altitudinal variation are still under investigation. This paper focuses on the specification of its key characteristics at middle latitudes based on coincident Digisonde and Swarm A satellite data. Based on the assumption that the topside electron density profile is approximated with the alpha-Chapman model of variable scale height, the effective scale height at the Swarm A altitude is calculated and compared with the effective scale height at hmF2 $hmF2$. A general conclusion is that the topside effective scale height at similar to 450 km exhibits a diurnal variation with highest values in the early morning and evening sectors, while at hmF2 $hmF2$ it gets its maximum values at noon. At night, the effective scale height tends to increase with altitude, however in the daytime, its behavior is more complex. On a local scale, evidence for connection between spread F irregularities and high variability in the topside effective scale height is reported. These preliminary results indicate the potential to further exploit Swarm and Digisonde data for the development of a model for the effective scale height, able to support realistic electron density reconstruction models.

TI  - Scientific faith: social and cognitive aspects
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study analyzes scientific faith through the lenses of its scientific, cognitive, and social potential. The paper aims to study the role of secular non-religious faith in contemporary social processes and individual cognitive formation. The research methodology includes a systematic approach to demonstrate the relationship between an individual's cognitive settings and social reality; dialectical approach; analysis and synthesis. Results: the transformation of traditional social relations leads to the popularization of non-religious secular faith, especially the scientific faith, which motivates to unprovably accept scientific and pseudoscientific positions as true for gaining existential confidence. Scientific faith leads to the irrational acceptance of the scientific understanding of the world, the axiomatic base, and each specific theory, as the closest to the absolute truth, which provides the researcher with permission to use them. Conclusions: Scientific faith turns into a powerful social phenomenon, responsible for transforming the image of science in mass perceptions into the undeniable ideal of truth; this makes further scientific advances difficult.

TI  - On Mystery: explorations on the experience of the numinous
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work aims to present ideas about the notion of 'Mystery', based on the contributions of various thinkers from different areas of knowledge. It will focus especially on the experience itself, that is, on the human possibility of generating the mystical experience and conceptualizing the dimension from contact with it. Concepts such as 'Homo Mysticus' (Erich Neumann), 'Numinous' (Rudolf Otto), 'Synchronicity' and 'Self' (Carl G. Jung) will be developed, approaching them from a psychological perspective. A distinction between two different categories of contact is proposed in the article: violent experiences and subtle experiences. The referential framework of analytical psychology enables the possibility of a transcendent and immaterial realm creatively linked to psychic reality, as well as an attempt to understand it. The conceptualization of the symbolic from the Jungian worldview allows us to understand the experience of Mystery from a psychological point of view in relation to the surrounding world. The idea is even raised that the ultimate (and implicit) purpose of the analysis is the manifestation of Mystery, a general name that could encompass the different phenomenological experiences. Is it possible that such experiences occur in the cultural circumstances of the present? What place does Mystery occupy in these times? What forms could it take? By observing dreams, imaginations and synchronicities, experiences of the mysterious will be explored in the context of contemporary Jungian analysis.

TI  - Reconnecting neighbourhoods with ecosystem functioning: Analysis of solutions from six international case studies
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban design organises and transforms the space, reflecting human context on cities' shape. Since modernism, designers draw urban projects with the goal to improve cities performances based on a mechanistic worldview, in which living systems are almost not considered. This paradigm led to urbanisation that is prominent in ecological process simplification and biodiversity loss. Different emerging urban design frameworks engage with the challenge of integrating ecological information on the design of sustainable urban projects, using this knowledge to guide intervention choices. With a growing application in practice, as through regenerative design and biomimicry, there is still a lack of knowledge on how ecological urban projects operationalise their engagements. We explored this question with a case study approach, generating hypotheses on the topic. We identified that projects focus on reducing human pressures over the ecosystems instead of regenerating the ecosystem's structure. Furthermore, projects mainly deal with energy and material flows. We identified a taxonomy of 36 urban strategies that could inform new design tools. Finally, we argue that the ecosystem biophysical structure needs to be better addressed on urban projects, and that projects would benefit from better articulation between solutions to reduce human pressures with those regenerating the ecosystem state.

TI  - Mapping of crop types and crop sequences with combined time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data for Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring agricultural systems becomes increasingly important in the context of global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth, and the rising demand for agricultural products. High-resolution, national-scale maps of agricultural land are needed to develop strategies for future sustainable agriculture. However, the characterization of agricultural land cover over large areas and for multiple years remains challenging due to the locally diverse and temporally variable characteristics of cultivated land. We here propose a workflow for generating national agricultural land cover maps on a yearly basis that accounts for varying environmental conditions. We tested the approach by mapping 24 agricultural land cover classes in Germany for the three years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in which the meteorological conditions strongly differed. We used a random forest classifier and dense time series data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 in combination with monthly Sentinel-1 composites and environmental data and evaluated the relative importance of optical, radar, and environmental data. Our results show high overall accuracy and plausible class accuracies for the most dominant crop types across different years despite the strong inter-annual meteorological variability and the presence of drought and nondrought years. The maps show high spatial consistency and good delineation of field parcels. Combining optical, SAR, and environmental data increased overall accuracies by 6% to 10% compared to single sensor approaches, in which optical data outperformed SAR. Overall accuracy ranged between 78% and 80%, and the mapped areas aligned well with agricultural statistics at the regional and national level. Based on the multi-year dataset we mapped major crop sequences of cereals and leaf crops. Most crop sequences were dominated by winter cereals followed by summer cereals. Monocultures of summer cereals were mainly revealed in the Northwest of Germany. We showcased that high spatial and thematic detail in combination with annual mapping will stimulate research on crop cycles and studies to assess the impact of environmental policies on management decisions. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of integrated optical time series and SAR data in combination with variables describing local and seasonal environmental conditions for annual large-area crop type mapping.

AB  - A technique is suggested for retrieving the total column water vapor from measurements of the MSU-GS instrument mounted on the Electro-L No. 3 geostationary satellite with the use of an artificial neural network. The comparison of the total column water vapor retrieved from the MSU-GS data with MODIS data and AERONET measurements showed their good agreement. The root mean square error is 0.311 cm when comparing with the MODIS data and 0.409 cm when comparing with the AERONET data; the correlation is 98.2% and 84.7%, respectively. The results confirm the effectiveness of the technique for solving problems of atmospheric physics.

TI  - The synthetism of Ruslan Kireev's autobiographical narrative <i>Fifty Years in Paradise</i>
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The material is the autobiographical novel Fifty Years in Paradise by Ruslan Kireev, which has not previously been the subject of scientific and critical reflection. The relevance of the work is due to the growing interest to the literature of retrospective biographical plan, to specific varieties of autobiographical prose, and due to the need to study theoretical aspects of biographical narration, in particular issues of the laws of the genre and the peculiarities of the genre synthesis, the correlation of truth and fiction in the autobiographical text, the nature of the interaction of central images (the hero and the author), the temporal organization of the autobiographical text (biographical and epic chronotopes). The aim of the research is to analyze the dominant strategies of Kireev's autobiographical narrative and to identify the type of contemporary literary autobiography that his narrative tends towards: autobiography as document, autobiography as fiction, literary autobiography, quasi-autobiography (pseudo-autobiography), or others. Attention to the chronotope of the novel by Kireev, in particular the identification of subjective (hero's) and objective (author's) chronotopes allows us to differentiate the strategies of the writer's worldview and to outline various tactics for using the document (diary, memoirs, notes, reviews, etc.) and its modifications. The main methods used in the research are historical-literary, typological and poetological in their unity and complementarity. The theoretical basis of the research was works on the problems of autobiographical prose (by D. Likhachev, M. Bakhtin, S. Averintsev, L. Ginzburg, N. Leiderman, M. Lipovetsky, T. Breeva, E. Boldyreva, E. Dobin, T. Kolyadich, N. Nikolina, S. Mashinsky, G. Romanova, V. Halizev, et al.). The attempt to qualify Kireev's text and reduce it to the traditional varieties of the autobiographical novel allows us to say that Kireev's narrative is adjacent to the basic modification that is most common in Russian (modern) literature and is defined as a synthesis of autobiographical prose with documentary (autobiography with a documentary basis) one. Such a definition, on the one hand, corresponds to the signs and features that were traced in the course of the analysis; on the other hand, it corresponds to the author's intention, which Kireev sought to implement in the novel Fifty Years in Paradise: to create an (auto)biographical document that reflects the truth of the person and the time. However, we should also supplement the definition "documentary narrative" with the property of "philological prose", the author's own literary narrative, in this case directly related to the theme of the writer's creative work and formation. The novel's composition, text division, "Close-up" (the writer's portrait) chapters, the author's digressions point to an "artistic" component of Kireev's documentalized narrative.

The analysis of coherence of the Sentinel-1B and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data at various sensing geometry and different polarizations has shown that temporal decorrelation of radar backscattering takes place over most of the surface of rupture. The difference in the dynamics of deformations for the western and eastern above-water parts of the landslide in the river has been found. A chaotic change in the surface structure due to rockfalls and small landslides, as well as a displacement of about 10 mm in the lower northeastern part of the surface of rupture have been revealed.

TI  - Surface Water Salinity Evaluation and Identification for Using Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the spatio-temporal distribution of salinity provides valuable information for understanding different processes between biota and environment, especially in hypersaline lakes. Remote sensing techniques have been used for monitoring different components of the environment. Currently, one of the biggest challenges is the spatio-temporal monitoring of the salinity level in water bodies. Due to some limitations, such as the inability to be located there permanently, it is difficult to obtain these data directly. In this study, machine learning techniques were used to evaluate the salinity level in hypersaline East Sivash Bay. In total, 93 in situ data samples and 6 Sentinel-2 datasets were used, according to field measurements. Using linear regression, random forest and AdaBoost models, eight water salinity evaluation models were built (six with simple, one with random forest and one with AdaBoost). The accuracy of the best-fitted simple linear regression model was 0.8797; for random forest, it was equal, at 0.808, and for AdaBoost, it was -0.72. Furthermore, it was found that with an increase in salinity, the absorbing light shifts from the ultraviolet part of the spectrum to the infrared and short-wave infrared parts, which makes it possible to produce continuous monitoring of hypersaline water bodies using remote sensing data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Transmasculine individuals may not have undergone gender-affirming mastectomy and retain natal breast tissue. Our center offers simultaneous oncologic mastectomy with gender-affirming reconstruction to patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer. This study is the first reported series of concurrent gender-affirming and oncologic mastectomies.Methods: A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing gender-affirming mastectomy at a single institution from February 2017 to October 2021 was performed. Patients were included who had breast cancer diagnoses or pathologic lesions preoperatively. Demographic factors, comorbidities, surgical details, and oncologic history were collected. Both plastic surgery and breast surgery were present for the gender-affirming oncologic mastectomies.Results: Five patients were identified who presented for gender-affirming mastectomy in the context of breast pathologies. Average patient age was 50.2 +/- 14.8 years, and no patients used testosterone at any time. Two (40%) patients had a prior breast surgery that included a breast reduction in one patient and breast conserving lumpectomies in another. Sentinel lymph node biopsies were performed in all patients. Only one patient had a positive sentinel lymph node and was subsequently referred for postoperative radiation and chemotherapy. No oncologic recurrence has been detected with 20.6 and 10.0 months of mean and median follow-up.Conclusions: When performed in a multidisciplinary and collaborative setting with breast surgeons and plastic surgeons, oncologic mastectomy can be performed safely while concurrently offering patients an aesthetic gender-affirming reconstructive outcome.

TI  - Extension of an Open GEOBIA Framework for Spatially Explicit Forest Stratification with Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information about forest cover is fundamental for operational forest management and forest monitoring. Although open-satellite-based earth observation data in a spatially high resolution (i.e., Sentinel-2, <= 10 m) can cover some information needs, spatially very high-resolution imagery (i.e., aerial imagery, <= 2 m) is needed to generate maps at a scale suitable for regional and local applications. In this study, we present the development, implementation, and evaluation of a Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) framework to stratify forests (needleleaved, broadleaved, non-forest) in Luxembourg. The framework is exclusively based on open data and free and open-source geospatial software. Although aerial imagery is used to derive image objects with a 0.05 ha minimum size, Sentinel-2 scenes of 2020 are the basis for random forest classifications in different single-date and multi-temporal feature setups. These setups are compared with each other and used to evaluate the framework against classifications based on features derived from aerial imagery. The highest overall accuracies (89.3%) have been achieved with classification on a Sentinel-2-based vegetation index time series (n = 8). Similar accuracies have been achieved with classification based on two (88.9%) or three (89.1%) Sentinel-2 scenes in the greening phase of broadleaved forests. A classification based on color infrared aerial imagery and derived texture measures only achieved an accuracy of 74.5%. The integration of the texture measures into the Sentinel-2-based classification did not improve its accuracy. Our results indicate that high resolution image objects can successfully be stratified based on lower spatial resolution Sentinel-2 single-date and multi-temporal features, and that those setups outperform classifications based on aerial imagery only. The conceptual framework of spatially high-resolution image objects enriched with features from lower resolution imagery facilitates the delivery of frequent and reliable updates due to higher spectral and temporal resolution. The framework additionally holds the potential to derive additional information layers (i.e., forest disturbance) as derivatives of the features attached to the image objects, thus providing up-to-date information on the state of observed forests.

TI  - A Review of the Literature Related to Limb Precautions After Lymph Node Dissection
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper extremity limb precautions are recommended for patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to lower the risk of lymph-edema. Limb precautions involve avoiding use of the affected arm for point-of-care testing, venipunc-ture, and blood pressure measurement, all of which can affect quality of life and create delays in care.OBJECTIVES: This review provides a summary of the evidence regarding limb precautions and evidence-based interventions to lower the risk of lymphedema after ALND or SLNB.METHODS: A literature search was conducted using CINAHL (R); PubMed (R); Education Resources Information Center; History of Science, Technol-ogy, and Medicine; Cochrane Library; and Joanna Briggs Institute databases.FINDINGS: Evidence supports exercising the affected limb, maintaining a body mass index of less than 25, and massaging to lower the risk of lymphedema. There is limited evidence for avoiding IV catheter placement and venipuncture in the affected arm following ALND and SLNB. Best practice is to assess the patient for risk factors of lymphedema before recommending selected evidence-based limb precautions.

TI  - Global Mangrove Watch: Updated 2010 Mangrove Forest Extent (v2.5)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an updated global mangrove forest baseline for 2010: Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) v2.5. The previous GMW maps (v2.0) of the mangrove extent are currently considered the most comprehensive available global products, however areas were identified as missing or poorly mapped. Therefore, this study has updated the 2010 baseline map to increase the mapping quality and completeness of the mangrove extent. This revision resulted in an additional 2660 km(2) of mangroves being mapped yielding a revised global mangrove extent for 2010 of some 140,260 km(2). The overall map accuracy was estimated to be 95.1% with a 95th confidence interval of 93.8-96.5%, as assessed using 50,750 reference points located across 60 globally distributed sites. Of these 60 validation sites, 26 were located in areas that were remapped to produce the v2.5 map and the overall accuracy for these was found to have increased from 82.6% (95th confidence interval: 80.1-84.9) for the v2.0 map to 95.0% (95th confidence interval: 93.7-96.4) for the v2.5 map. Overall, the improved GMW v2.5 map provides a more robust product to support the conservation and sustainable use of mangroves globally.

TI  - Study on High-Resolution Suspended Sediment Distribution under the Influence of Coastal Zone Engineering in the Yangtze River Mouth, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed the influence of coastal zone engineering on suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the Yangtze River mouth based on HY-1C and Chinese GaoFen (GF) satellite data. The results show that: (1) SSC in the Yangtze River mouth is mainly in the range of 200-1300 mg/L, which changes due to natural factors as well as coastal zone engineering; (2) The sand blocking engineering effectively protects the channel from siltation, and SSC in the central line of the channel is 100-300 mg/L lower than that near the dikes in the north and south; (3) Qingcaosha Reservoir plays a stabilizing role in the hydrodynamic force, promoting the deposition of suspended matter, so that the water in the reservoir is clear. SSC inside the Qingcaosha Reservoir, located in the center of the estuary, is 100-500 mg/L lower than the high SSC water outside the reservoir; (4) The bridges interact with the current, facilitating the transport of local sediment, resulting in the increase in SSC downstream of these bridges, and obvious vortexes appear with the length up to nearly 2400 m; and (5) Corresponding protection and development suggestions were put forward as follows. A linear array of wind power plants can be built near and parallel to dikes and leading jetties; to increase the depth of the southeast end of the reservoir; and the location of the bridge should be selected in the place of river where siltation is easy. This study aimed to study the SSC distribution under the complex impact of coastal zone engineering with satellite and to provide possible improvement suggestions.

T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Penile mucosal melanoma is an aggressive and rare genital malignancy. The aim of the present study was to review the management and outcomes of a homogenous cohort of patients with histologically confirmed penile mucosal melanoma, at a single specialist centre. A retrospective review of an institutional database identified patients with penile mucosal melanoma over a 10-year period. Patient demographics, histopathological characteristics, type of primary surgery, recurrence, presence of metastatic disease and molecular markers were evaluated. The management of the patients was initially based on the European Association of Urology (EAU) penile cancer guidelines which are primarily for squamous cell carcinoma with inputs from a melanoma multidisciplinary team. Twelve patients with penile mucosal melanoma were analysed. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age was 69.5 (67.25-81) years. The overall median follow-up (IQR) was 69.5 (20-114) months, while median follow-up for cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 11.5 (8-37) months. Location of the primary tumour was glans penis (n = 7), urethra (n = 2) and inner prepuce (n = 3). The CSS at 1, 2 and 5 years after primary surgery was 33%, 16.7% and 0%, respectively. The recurrence-free survival at 1, 3 and 5 months after the primary surgery was 90%, 67% and 56%, respectively. All patients with metastatic disease or with inguinal lymph node invasion at presentation, died within 25 months of the primary diagnosis. Management based on the modified EAU penile cancer guidelines still led to poor outcomes. We present a management diagram based on our experience.

TI  - Contribution of the satellite-data driven snow routine to a karst hydrological model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow recharge is an important dominant hydrological process in the high altitude mountainous karstic aquifer systems. In general, widely used karst-dedicated hydrological models (e.g., KarstMod, Varkarst) do not include a snow routine in the model structure to avoid increasing the number of model parameters while representing the complex hydrological process. As a result, recharge process is not represented well, which questions the optimality of the results that can be obtained under available datasets. This study presents a novel pre-processing method -called SCA routine- to compensate for the missing snow routine in karst models. The proposed preprocessing method is driven by temperature, precipitation, and satellite-based snow observation datasets. The method classifies the precipitation input into three physical phases (rain, snow, and mixed) based on the temperature datasets to distribute each phase over the catchment using satellite-driven Snow-Covered Area (SCA) products. By the proposed method, the spring discharge simulations are regulated well in time and magnitude. To examine the added utility of the SCA routine, the SCA-included simulations are compared to the model performances with no routine and the classical Degree-Day method as a benchmark. To test the efficiency of our proposed method, we used a karst hydrological model (KarstMod) to simulate the karst spring discharge in a well-observed semi-arid snow-dominated karstic aquifer (Central Taurus, Turkey). Our results confirmed that the KarstMod model coupled by SCA routine ensures better model performance with a value of NSE = 0.784 than those of the classical Degree-day method (NSE = 0.760) and the model with no routine (NSE = 0.306), thus providing a physically more realistic parameter set.

TI  - Assessing Potential Safety Zone Suitability Using a New Online Mapping Tool
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Safety zones (SZs) are critical tools that can be used by wildland firefighters to avoid injury or fatality when engaging a fire. Effective SZs provide safe separation distance (SSD) from surrounding flames, ensuring that a fire's heat cannot cause burn injury to firefighters within the SZ. Evaluating SSD on the ground can be challenging, and underestimating SSD can be fatal. We introduce a new online tool for mapping SSD based on vegetation height, terrain slope, wind speed, and burning condition: the Safe Separation Distance Evaluator (SSDE). It allows users to draw a potential SZ polygon and estimate SSD and the extent to which that SZ polygon may be suitable, given the local landscape, weather, and fire conditions. We begin by describing the algorithm that underlies SSDE. Given the importance of vegetation height for assessing SSD, we then describe an analysis that compares LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Height and a recent Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite image-driven forest height dataset to vegetation heights derived from airborne lidar data in three areas of the Western US. This analysis revealed that both LANDFIRE and GEDI/Landsat tended to underestimate vegetation heights, which translates into an underestimation of SSD. To rectify this underestimation, we performed a bias-correction procedure that adjusted vegetation heights to more closely resemble those of the lidar data. SSDE is a tool that can provide valuable safety information to wildland fire personnel who are charged with the critical responsibility of protecting the public and landscapes from increasingly intense and frequent fires in a changing climate. However, as it is based on data that possess inherent uncertainty, it is essential that all SZ polygons evaluated using SSDE are validated on the ground prior to use.

TI  - Influence of Mental Fatigue on Physical Performance, and Physiological and Perceptual Responses of Judokas Submitted to the Special Judo Fitness Test

M3  - Article
AB  - Campos, BT, Penna, EM, Rodrigues, JGS, Mendes, TT, Maia-Lima, A, Nakamura, FY, Vieira, eLM, Wanner, SP, and Prado, LS. Influence of mental fatigue on physical performance, and physiological and perceptual responses of judokas submitted to the Special Judo Fitness Test. J Strength Cond Res 36(2): 461-468, 2022-Mentally fatigued athletes present impaired aerobic performance, strength endurance, and manual dexterity, despite no changes in anaerobic performance and maximal muscle strength and power. Noteworthy, the effect of mental fatigue on physical performance during high-intensity intermittent tests that require specific motor skills of fighting sports has not been investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to verify whether mental fatigue influences performance and physiological and perceptual responses of judokas subjected to a high-intensity intermittent test designed specifically and validated for judo. Each judoka performed 2 experimental trials-a control trial one and the other one after the induction of mental fatigue. These trials were scheduled in a random and balanced order. In both trials, lactate, glucose, and cortisol concentrations, the heart rate variability, and perceptual variables were collected after the initial treatment and after the Special Judo Fitness Test (SJFT). The initial treatment consisted of a 30-minute cognitive demanding task (Stroop Color test) or watching a movie (control) and was followed by the SJFT. The Stroop Color test increased the perceptions of mental fatigue and effort, without affecting motivation for subsequent testing. Unexpectedly, mentally fatigued athletes did not show reduced performance during the SJFT. Regarding the physiological variables, no significant differences were identified between the 2 experimental conditions. We conclude that physical performance measured during a specific test for judokas is not impaired by a previous 30-minute cognitive task that causes mental fatigue. In addition, this cognitive task did not influence the physiological changes induced by the specific physical test.

TI  - Postfire treatments alter forest canopy structure up to three decades after fire
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of postfire management on forest structure in mixed-conifer forests of northeastern Washington, USA. Postfire treatments were harvest-only, harvest combined with planting, planting-only, and postfire prescribed fire. We used aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to measure vertical and horizontal components of postfire forest structure over a period of 2 to 32 years after fires. We compared treated areas to control areas with similar bioclimatic environments and past fire severity. We used niche overlap statistics to quantify distributions of individual forest structure components and PERMANOVA to assess forest structural response to the presence or absence of treatments, past fire severity, time since treatment, and bioclimatic setting. Harvest alone after fire decreased dominant tree height and reduced vertical canopy complexity and the cover of tall trees. Harvest combined with planting increased dominant tree height, vertical complexity, and cover in lower height strata. Planting and prescribed fires showed little difference in forest structure relative to untreated controls. Overall, the burn severity of the initial fire was the strongest influence on postfire structure, and many aspects of vertical and horizontal forest structure showed little difference with increasing time since fire.

TI  - Diatoms from the Spring Ecosystems Selected for the Long-Term Monitoring of Climate-Change Effects in the Berchtesgaden National Park (Germany)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied diatoms from the fifteen springs selected in the Berchtesgaden National Park on behalf of the Bavarian State Ministry for the Environment to be sentinel environments of climate-change effects. For three of these springs, diatom data based on samples taken in 1997 were also available. A total of 162 species belonging to 49 genera were found sampling three microhabitat types (lithic materials, bryophytes, surface sediments). The cumulative percentage of all species included in a threat category including endangered species was 43%, confirming previous findings for comparable environments of the Alps. We could find a statistically significant positive association between the Meinzer variability index for discharge and the cumulative relative abundance of aerial diatom species. This study thus highlighted once again the relevance of discharge (and associated water-level) variability as an environmental determinant of diatom assemblages in spring ecosystems. Increased nitrate concentrations in some springs, likely due to diffuse airborne pollution and, locally, to impacts such as forest management, game, and cattle, led to a relevant occurrence of eutraphentic diatom species. Our results show a segregation of the older data in non-parametric diatom-based ordinations, suggesting a strong potential for the use of spring diatoms in studies aiming at tracking the effects of climate and environmental change.

TI  - Internal Geometric Quality Improvement of Optical Remote Sensing Satellite Images with Image Reorientation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When the in-orbit geometric calibration of optical satellite cameras is not performed in a precise or timely manner, optical remote sensing satellite images (ORSSIs) are produced with inaccurate camera parameters. The internal orientation (IO) biases of ORSSIs caused by inaccurate camera parameters show a discontinuous distorted characteristic and cannot be compensated by a simple orientation model. The internal geometric quality of ORSSIs will, therefore, be worse than expected. In this study, from the ORSSI users' perspective, a feasible internal geometric quality improvement method is presented for ORSSIs with image reorientation. In the presented method, a sensor orientation model, an external orientation (EO) model, and an IO model are successively established. Then, the EO and IO model parameters are estimated with ground control points. Finally, the original image is reoriented with the estimated IO model parameters. Ten HaiYang-1C coastal zone imager (CZI) images, a ZiYuan-3 02 nadir image, a GaoFen-1B panchromatic image, and a GaoFen-1D panchromatic image, were tested. The experimental results showed that the IO biases of ORSSIs caused by inaccurate camera parameters could be effectively eliminated with the presented method. The IO accuracies of all the tested images were improved to better than 1.0 pixel.

TI  - Estimating the Clear-Sky Longwave Downward Radiation in the Arctic from FengYun-3D MERSI-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface longwave downward radiation (LWDR) plays a key role in determining the Arctic surface energy budget, especially in insolation-absent boreal winter. A reliable LWDR product is essential for understanding the intrinsic physical mechanisms of the rapid changes in the Arctic climate. The Medium-Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-2), a major payload of the Chinese second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, FengYun-3D (FY-3D), was designed similar to the NASA Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in terms of the spectral bands. Although significant progress has been made in estimating clear-sky LWDR from MODIS observations using a variety of methods, few studies have focused on the retrieval of clear-sky LWDR from FY-3D MERSI-2 observations. In this study, we propose an advanced method to directly estimate the clear-sky LWDR in the Arctic from the FY-3D MERSI-2 thermal infrared (TIR) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances and auxiliary information using the extremely randomized trees (ERT) machine learning algorithm. The retrieval accuracy of RMSE and bias, validated with the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) in situ measurements, are 14.14 W/m(2) and 4.36 W/m(2), respectively, which is comparable and even better than previous studies. The scale effect in retrieval accuracy evaluation was further analyzed and showed that the validating window size could significantly influence the retrieval accuracy of the MERSI-2 clear-sky LWDR dataset. After aggregating to a spatial resolution of 9 km, the RMSE and bias of MERSI-2 retrievals can be reduced to 9.43 W/m(2) and -0.14 W/m(2), respectively. The retrieval accuracy of MERSI-2 clear-sky LWDR at the CERES SSF FOV spatial scale (approximately 20 km) can be further reduced to 8.64 W/m(2), which is much higher than the reported accuracy of the CERES SSF products. This study demonstrates the feasibility of producing LWDR datasets from Chinese FY-3D MERSI-2 observations using machine learning methods.

TI  - Landsat observations of chlorophyll-a variations in Lake Taihu from 1984 to 2019
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term datasets of chlorophyll-a (Chla) are necessary to evaluate changes in eutrophication and to assist in lake management; however, current aquatic remote sensing datasets usually start after 2000. Here, a 36-year Chla dataset was assembled from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Landsat Imager (OLI) imagery for Lake Taihu (China) over the period from 1984 to 2019. TM, ETM+ and OLI reflectances were compared to those using the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra, and agreement was found within a mean absolute difference of 15%. An algorithm for Chla retrieval developed by a machine learning approach (XGBoost) had good performance (mean absolute percentage error = 35%, mean absolute error = 9%) and outperformed random forest and support vector machine regressors and existing empirical algorithms for Lake Taihu. Landsat-derived mean Chla ranged between 12.8 mu g L-1 and 32.3 mu g L-1 and indicates that Lake Taihu has been eutrophic from 1984 to 2019. Chla in the northern region was higher than that in other areas over the 36 years. With the limited number of Landsat images each year, we found that the annual variation in Chla had high values during the periods of 1984-1992 and 1994-1997 and significant increases in 1999-2009 and from 2012 to 2019. The spatial and temporal variations in Chla for Lake Taihu were correlated with dissolved nutrients and air temperature. This research illustrates the use of machine learning approaches to generate long-term datasets of water quality from multiple Landsat instruments, for extending watercolor archives for lakes.

TI  - A full physics algorithm to retrieve nighttime sea surface temperature with IASI: Toward an independent homogeneous long time-series for climate studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A fully physically-based algorithm is presented and used to retrieve nighttime sea-surface (skin) temperatures (SSTs) from spectra recorded by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI). The main advantage of the proposed approach, based on radiative transfer calculations, is to provide a dataset totally independent of any in-situ measurement or model. The SSTs are retrieved at the IASI spot resolution (clear sky) for the three Metop platforms, today leading to a continuous record over more than 13 years, which is planned to be extended for at least another decade. Five atmospheric transparency windows centered at 3.8, 4.0, 4.7, 9.0 and 11 mu m have been used in the retrieval. Results are compared with in-situ temperatures provided by the buoys network as well as with other satellite datasets. This first analysis enables to draw the following three main conclusions. First, we confirm the interest of using short wavelengths around 4 mu m which enables accurate estimates characterized by a reduced bias with respect to those around 9 and 11 mu m, thanks to significantly weaker sensitivities to errors in the modeling of the water vapor contribution to the atmospheric absorption and emission. Second, we show that the observed dependences of the skin-depth temperature difference on various observed-scene parameters (wind speed, air-sea temperature difference, humidity) are consistent with predictions of theoretical and empirical models, as well as with those from other SST products. Finally, the overall averaged bias between our retrieved values converted to depth temperatures and those provided by in-situ measurements is -0.04 K (median: -0.024 K), with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.38 K (Robust SD = 0.25 K). The bias is thus well below the 0.1 K required for a SST product usable for climate studies and extremely stable over more than a decade. Then, we investigate the consistency between the three generations of IASI on-board Metop-A, -B, and -C over their overlap periods (2013-2020 for Metop-A and Metop-B, and 2019-2020 for Metop-C) by comparing the associated retrieved monthly-averaged SSTs over 1 degrees x1 degrees grids. The mean differences obtained are lower than 0.02 K, with a SD of 0.3 K consistent with the natural variation of the SST within a month. This demonstrates the high stability of the SSTs retrieved using spectra recorded from the IASI suite and opens the possibility to generate long time series for climate studies. This is tested in a preliminary investigation of the SST anomalies between 2008 and 2020, with the successful detection of short-term (El Nin similar to o and La Nin similar to a) changes as well as of a global warming trend of about +0.3 K/decade quantitatively consistent with other observations.

TI  - Using Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Map Seagrass Cover from Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass habitats are ecologically valuable and play an important role in sequestering and storing carbon. There is, thus, a need to estimate seagrass percentage cover in diverse environments in support of climate change mitigation, marine spatial planning and coastal zone management. In situ approaches are accurate but time-consuming, expensive and may not represent the larger spatial units collected by satellite imaging. Hence, there is a need for a consistent methodology that uses accurate point-based field surveys to deliver high-quality mapping of percentage seagrass cover at large spatial scales. Here, we develop a three-step approach that combines in situ (quadrats), aerial (unoccupied aerial vehicle-UAV) and satellite data to map percentage seagrass cover at Turneffe Atoll, Belize, the largest atoll in the northern hemisphere. First, the optical bands of four UAV images were used to calculate seagrass cover, in combination with in situ data. The seagrass cover calculated from the UAV was then used to develop training and validation datasets to estimate seagrass cover in Sentinel-2 pixels. Next, non-seagrass areas were identified in the Sentinel-2 data and removed by object-based classification, followed by a pixel-based regression to calculate seagrass percentage cover. Using this approach, percentage seagrass cover was mapped using UAVs (R-2 = 0.91 between observed and mapped distributions) and using Sentinel-2 data (R-2 = 0.73). This work provides the first openly available and explorable map of seagrass percentage cover across Turneffe Atoll, where we estimate approximately 242 km(2) of seagrass above 10% cover is located. We estimate that this approach offers 30 times more data for training satellite data than traditional methods, therefore presenting a substantial reduction in cost-per-point for data. Furthermore, the increase in data helps deliver a high-quality seagrass cover map, suitable for resolving trends of deteriorating, stable or recovering seagrass environments at 10 m(2) resolution to underpin evidence-based management and conservation of seagrass.

TI  - An Effective Method for InSAR Mapping of Tropical Forest Degradation in Hilly Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current satellite remote sensing methods struggle to detect and map forest degradation, which is a critical issue as it is likely a major and growing source of carbon emissions and biodiveristy loss. TanDEM-X InSAR phase height (h phi) is a promising variable for measuring forest disturbances, as it is closely related to the mean canopy height, and thus should decrease if canopy trees are removed. However, previous research has focused on relatively flat terrains, despite the fact that much of the world's remaining tropical forests are found in hilly areas, and this inevitably introduces artifacts in sideways imaging systems. In this paper, we find a relationship between h(phi) and aboveground biomass change in four selectively logged plots in a hilly region of central Gabon. We show that minimising multilooking prior to the calculation of h phi strengthens this relationship, and that degradation estimates across steep slopes in the surrounding region are improved by selecting data from the most appropriate pass directions on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This shows that TanDEM-X InSAR can measure the magnitude of degradation, and that topographic effects can be mitigated if data from multiple SAR viewing geometries are available.

TI  - Proxy Data of Surface Water Floods in Rural Areas: Application to the Evaluation of the IRIP Intense Runoff Mapping Method Based on Satellite Remote Sensing and Rainfall Radar
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with fluvial floods (FFs), surface water floods (SWFs) caused by extreme overland flow are one of the main flood hazards occurring after heavy rainfall. Using physics-based distributed hydrological models, surface runoff can be simulated from precipitation inputs to investigate regions prone to soil erosion, mudflows or landslides. Geomatics approaches have also been developed to map susceptibility towards intense surface runoff without explicit hydrological modeling or event-based rainfall forcing. However, in order for these methods to be applicable for prevention purposes, they need to be comprehensively evaluated using proxy data of runoff-related impacts following a given event. Here, the IRIP geomatics mapping model, or "Indicator of Intense Pluvial Runoff", is faced with rainfall radar measurements and damage maps derived from satellite imagery and supervised classification algorithms. Six watersheds in the Aude and Alpes-Maritimes departments in the South of France are investigated over more than 2000 km(2) of rural areas during two flash-flood events. The results of this study show that the greater the IRIP susceptibility scores, the more SWFs are detected by the remote sensing-based detection algorithm. Proportions of damaged plots become even larger when considering areas which experienced heavier precipitations. A negative relationship between the mean IRIP accumulation scores and the intensity of rainfall is found among damaged plots, confirming that SWFs preferably occur over potentially riskier areas where rainfall is lower. Land use and soil hydraulic conductivity are identified as the most relevant indicators for IRIP to define production areas responsible for downslope deteriorations. Multivariate logistic regression is also used to determine the relative weights of upstream and local topography, uphill production areas and rainfall intensity for explaining SWF occurrence. This work overall confirms the relevance of IRIP methodology while suggesting improvements to its core framework to implement better prevention strategies against SWF-related hazards.

TI  - Pushing the boundaries. Concurrent Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer treatment with preservation of pregnancy: A case report
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer and hematological cancers are the most commonly diagnosed malignancies during pregnancy. This case report is the first to describe the ultimate challenge to preserve a pregnancy while the expectant mother is diagnosed and treated simultaneously for two concurrent primary malignancies, a stage IIA Hodgkin lymphoma and pT2N0(Sn) breast cancer.Clinical case: A 36-year-old pregnant primigravida underwent a routine non-invasive prenatal test at 14 weeks and 4 days of gestation. Genome-wide sequencing was used and revealed an aberrant DNA/chromosome copy number profile among which a strong 2p-gain, possibly related to a maternal malignancy. Physical examination showed an enlarged cervical lymph node and ultrasound guided biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a nodular sclerosing classical Hodgkin lymphoma subsequently staged as an early stage, unfavorable (IIA) Hodgkin lymphoma. Whole body magnetic resonance imaging for further staging also indicated a suspicious nodule in the right breast. Further investigation resulted in the concurrent diagnosis of a pT2N0(Sn) invasive ductal adenocarcinoma. Patient underwent a mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy at 15 weeks and 5 days of gestation, followed by 4-weekly chemotherapy administration, consisting of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD). Pregnancy went further relatively uncomplicated and fetal assessment was reassuring during pregnancy. Due to fever of unknown origin and preterm labor, a cesarean section was performed on a gestational age of 35 weeks and 4 days. Oncological treatment was completed after delivery with involved-field radiation therapy for the Hodgkin lymphoma. Completion of systemic treatment for breast cancer consisted of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, and anti-hormonal treatment in the form of ovarian function suppression and letrozole. Conclusion: Here we show for the first time that two concurrent primary malignancies can be treated successfully during pregnancy with respect to maternal and fetal chances. Motivated modifications of breast cancer treatment (mastectomy instead of lumpectomy, AVBD instead of epirubicin-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy), allowed treatment of both cancers during pregnancy. Final treatment was administered after delivery.

TI  - Soil moisture as an essential component for delineating and forecasting agricultural rather than meteorological drought
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a recurring, complex, and extreme climatic phenomenon characterized by subnormal precipitation for months to years triggering negative impacts on agriculture, energy, tourism, recreation, and transportation sectors. Agricultural drought assessment is based on a deficit of soil moisture (SM) during the plant-growing season, whereas meteorological drought corresponds to subnormal precipitation over months to years. However, satellite-derived agricultural and meteorological drought indices (including those comprising root-zone SM) have not been comprehensively compared to evaluate their ability for drought delineation and particularly forecasting across climate regimes, land cover and soil types, and irrigation management (irrigated vs. rainfed) in the contiguous USA (CONUS). Here, we did so from 2015 to 2019 within the CONUS. In most regions except the US Midwest and Southeast, SM-based indices (e.g., Palmer Z, SMAP, SWDI) delineated agricultural drought better than meteorological (e.g., SPI, SPEI) and hybrid (Comprehensive Drought Index, CDI) drought indices. In contrast, the SPI and SPEI showed strong correlation with the aridity index in most part of the CONUS except the Midwest. SM-based and hybrid indices also demonstrated skills for agricultural drought forecasting (represented by end-of-year cumulative GPP), predominantly in the early growing season and particularly in irrigated rather than rainfed croplands. These findings indicate the leading role of SM in controlling ecosystem dryness and confirm "drought memory", possibly due to SM-memory in land-atmosphere coupling. Proper application of meteorological and agricultural drought indices and their contrasting spatial-temporal controls on plant growth and ecosystem dryness has the potential to improve our understanding of drought evolution and provide early drought forecasting across large regions with diverse climate regimes, land cover types, soil textural classes, and irrigation management.

TI  - Clinical and Translational Significance of Basophils in Patients with Cancer
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite comprising a very small proportion of circulating blood leukocytes, basophils are potent immune effector cells. The high-affinity receptor for IgE (FceRI) is expressed on the basophil cell surface and powerful inflammatory mediators such as histamine, granzyme B, and cytokines are stored in dense cytoplasmic granules, ready to be secreted in response to a range of immune stimuli. Basophils play key roles in eliciting potent effector functions in allergic diseases and type 1 hypersensitivity. Beyond allergies, basophils can be recruited to tissues in chronic and autoimmune inflammation, and in response to parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections. While their activation states and functions can be influenced by Th2-biased inflammatory signals, which are also known features of several tumor types, basophils have received little attention in cancer. Here, we discuss the presence and functional significance of basophils in the circulation of cancer patients and in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Interrogating publicly available datasets, we conduct gene expression analyses to explore basophil signatures and associations with clinical outcomes in several cancers. Furthermore, we assess how basophils can be harnessed to predict hypersensitivity to cancer treatments and to monitor the desensitization of patients to oncology drugs, using assays such as the basophil activation test (BAT).

TI  - Adaptive estimation of multi-regional soil salinization using extreme gradient boosting with Bayesian TPE optimization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization endangers the development of ecological agriculture. As soil salinization is often heavily affected by regional environments, difficulties arise when constructing an adaptive multi-regional soil salinity estimation model. In this study, we proposed an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model based on the Tree-structure Parzen Estimator (TPE) optimization algorithm to apply to four study areas with different environments (TPE-XGBoost). The four areas are the Weigan-Kuqa Oasis (Weiku), the Sangong River Basin (Sgr) and the Qitai Oasis in Xinjiang, China, and the middle and lower reaches of the Syr Darya Basin in Kazakhstan. Most previous soil salinity studies did not pay much attention to the impact of feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning on the performance of machine learning models, and the complex dependence and interaction between input features and hyper-parameters. In order to improve the performance of XGBoost model in estimating soil salinity, we proposed for the first time to use TPE algorithm to jointly optimize feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning, and verified it in four areas. Coefficient of determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the model performance. First, we calculated 55 environmental features from Landsat and terrain data. Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity of the TPE-XGBoost model, we used Pearson correlation analysis between surface soil salinity content (SSC) and features to initially filter out the features that were not significantly related (P > 0.05). Finally, the TPE algorithm was used to jointly optimize the parameter space composed of features and hyper-parameters. The results showed that (1) TPE joint optimization algorithm significantly improved the performance of the XGBoost model, achieving high accuracy in the four areas, and had powerful generalization. R-2 values of test sets for Weiku Oasis, Qitai Oasis, Sgr Basin, and the Syr Basin were 0.95, 0.95, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. (2) There is no universal feature can be applied to soil salinity inversion in different environments. TPE algorithm adaptively selected different types and numbers of features for four areas, 19, 11, 25, and 15 features were selected in Weiku Oasis, Qitai Oasis, Sgr Basin, and the Syr Basin, respectively. This showed that the optimal model parameters should not be fixed parameters, but should be re-determined locally according to different environmental conditions. The TPE algorithm can capture the features that reflect environmental differences. (3) The XGBoost model can provide feature importance ranking, which improves the interpretability of machine learning model. The importance analysis results showed that the features had different contributions in different areas. The TPE-XGBoost model proposed in this study has great potential in multi-regional soil salt estimation research.

TI  - Time-Varying Surface Deformation Retrieval and Prediction in Closed Mines through Integration of SBAS InSAR Measurements and LSTM Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After a coal mine is closed, the coal rock mass could undergo weathering deterioration and strength reduction due to factors such as stress and groundwater, which in turn changes the stress and bearing capacity of the fractured rock mass in the abandoned goaf, leading to secondary or multiple surface deformations in the goaf. Currently, the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of the surface deformation of closed mines remains unclear, and there is no integrated monitoring and prediction model for closed mines. Therefore, this study proposed to construct an integrated monitoring and prediction model for closed mines using small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and a deep learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network algorithm to achieve evolution pattern and dynamic prediction of spatiotemporal surface deformation of closed mines. Taking a closed mine in the western part of Xuzhou, China, as an example, based on Sentinel-1A SAR data between 21 December 2015, and 11 January 2021, SBAS InSAR technology was used to obtain the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of the surface during the 5 years after mine closure. The results showed that the ground surface subsided in the early stage of mine closure and then uplifted. In 5 years, the maximum subsidence rate in the study area is -43 mm/a, and the cumulative maximum subsidence is 310 mm; the maximum uplift rate is 29 mm/a, and the cumulative maximum uplift is 135 mm. Moreover, the maximum tilt and curvature are 3.5 mm/m and 0.19 mm/m(2), respectively, which are beyond the safety thresholds of buildings; thus, continuous monitoring is necessary. Based on the evolution pattern of surface deformation, the surface deformation prediction model was proposed by integrating SBAS InSAR and an LSTM neural network. The experiment results showed that the LSTM neural network can accurately predict the deformation trend, with a maximum root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.1 mm. Finally, the relationship between the residual surface deformation and time after mine closure was analyzed, and the mechanisms of surface subsidence and uplift were discussed, which provide a theoretical reference for better understanding the surface deformation process of closed mines and the prevention of surface deformation.

TI  - Assessment and Inter-Comparison of Multi-Source High Spatial Resolution Evapotranspiration Products over Lancang-Mekong River Basin, Southeast Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in water balance within the global hydrological cycle. Timely assessment of ET products can provide the scientific basis for quantitative analysis of hydrological cycle processes and water resources assessment. In this paper, four high spatial resolution remote sensing ET products-the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer global terrestrial evapotranspiration product (MOD16), the ET product based on Penman-Monteith-Leuning equation version 2 (PML-V2), the ET product based on the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) and the ET product of the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS)-were firstly assessed using the eddy covariance (EC) of different vegetation types in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB). To fully assess the performances of these four products, spatiotemporal inter-comparisons and literature comparisons were also conducted across different climatic zones. The results are summarized as follows: (1) MOD16 does not perform well as compared to the other three products, with its Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being higher than GLASS, PML-V2 and BESS, which are approximately 0.47 mm/8-day, 0.66 mm/8-day, and 0.90 mm/8-day, respectively; (2) the performance of each product varies across different vegetation types, and even within the same climate zone. PML-V2 performs best in evergreen broadleaf forests, BESS performs best in deciduous broadleaf forests and croplands, and GLASS performs best in shrubs, grasslands and mixed vegetation; (3) each product can well reflect the spatial difference brought by topography, climate and vegetation over the entire basin but all four ET products do not show either a consistent temporal trend or a uniform spatial distribution; (4) ET ranges of these four products over LMRB are consistent with previous literature in evergreen broadleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, needleleaf forests and mixed forests in other regions with the same climate zones, but they show great differences in croplands, grasslands and shrubs. This study will contribute to improving our understanding of these four ET products in the different climatic zones and vegetation types over LMRB.

TI  - Remote Sensing Big Data for Water Environment Monitoring: Current Status, Challenges, and Future Prospects
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Accurate water extraction and quantitative estimation of water quality are two key and challenging issues for remote sensing of water environment. Recent advances in remote sensing big data, cloud computing, and machine learning have promoted these two fields into a new era. This study reviews the operating framework and methods of remote sensing big data for water environment monitoring, with emphasis on water extraction and quantitative estimation of water quality. The following aspects were investigated in this study: (a) image data source and model evaluation metrics; (b) state-of-the-art methods for water extraction, including threshold-based methods, water indices, and machine learning-based methods; (c) state-of-the-art models for quantitative estimation of water quality, including empirical models, semi-empirical/semi-analytical models, and machine learning-based models; (d) some shortcomings and three challenges of current remote sensing big data for water environment monitoring, namely the new data gap caused by massive heterogeneous data, inefficient water environment monitoring due to "low spatiotemporal resolution," and low accuracy of water quality estimation models resulting from complex water composition and insufficient atmospheric correction methods for water bodies; and (e) five recommendations to solve these challenges, namely, using cloud computing and emerging sensors/platforms to monitor water changes in intensive time series, establishing models based on ensemble machine learning algorithms, exploring quantitative estimation models of water quality that couple physics and causality, identifying the missing elements in water environment assessments, and developing new governance models to meet the widespread applications of remote sensing of water environment. This review can help provide a potential roadmap and information support for researchers, practitioners, and management departments in the theoretical exploration and innovative application of remote sensing big data for water environment monitoring.

TI  - Combined Effects of Artificial Surface and Urban Blue-Green Space on Land Surface Temperature in 28 Major Cities in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The two most common land cover types in urban areas, artificial surface (AS) and urban blue-green space (UBGS), interact with land surface temperature (LST) and exhibit competitive effects, namely, heating and cooling effects. Understanding the variation of these effects along the AS ratio gradient is highly important for the healthy development of cities. In this study, we aimed to find the critical point of the joint competitive effects of UBGS and AS on LST, and to explore the variability in different climate zones and cities at different development levels. An urban land cover map and LST distribution map were produced using Sentinel-2 images and Landsat-8 LST data, respectively, covering 28 major cities in China. On this basis, the characteristics of water, vegetation, and LST in these cities were analyzed. Moreover, the UBGS (water or vegetation)-AS-LST relationship of each city was quantitatively explored. The results showed that UBGS and AS have a competitive relationship and jointly affect LST; this competition has a critical point (threshold). When the proportion of UBGS exceeds this value, UBGS replaces AS as the dominant variable for LST, bringing about a cooling effect. In contrast, when AS dominates LST, it causes a warming effect. The critical points between AS and water and between AS and vegetation in 28 major cities in China were 80% and 70%, respectively. The critical point showed an obvious zonal difference. Compared with cities in subtropical and temperate climate regions, the critical point of arid cities is higher, and UBGS exhibited better performance at alleviating the urban thermal environment. The critical point of cities with higher development levels is lower than that of cities with lower development levels. Even areas with relatively low AS coverage are prone to high temperatures, and more attention should be paid to improving the coverage of UBGS. Our research results provide a reference for the more reasonable handling of the relationship between urban construction, landscape layout, and temperature control.

TI  - DeepUrbanDownscale: A physics informed deep learning framework for high-resolution urban surface temperature estimation via 3D point clouds
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate high-resolution downscaling of surface climate variables (such as surface temperature) over urban areas has long been a critical yet unresolved research problem in the field of urban climate and environmental sciences. In this paper, we propose a novel physics informed neural network (PINN) based framework: DeepUrbanDownscale (DUD) for high-resolution urban surface temperature estimation. Anchored in process-based modeling and satellite remote sensing, the DUD network leverages the high-precision 3D point clouds to achieve accurate urban land surface temperature (LST) estimation at an ultra-high spatial resolution. This network, ingesting the high-precision land surface geometry information derived from 3D point clouds and guided by the atmospheric physics related to surface temperature, constructs a physics informed data-driven framework to fit high-resolution temperature distribution, which is otherwise difficult to be obtained by physical (numerical) simulations or traditional machine learning. Specifically, the proposed DUD network contains two branches: The Global Feature Perception (GPFP) branch and Local Urban Surface Perception (LUSP) branch. The former considers the broader-scale urban physical parameters, constraining the estimation results in accordance with the relevant physical laws. The latter, by employing a proposed local spatial coefficient index (LSCI), which is based on 3D point clouds, the estimation performance is further improved at a very high resolution. Results from designed experiments demonstrate that the proposed DUD network predicts the urban LST on a 30-by-30 m grid with the estimated error less than 0.2 Kelvin compared to the satellite measurement, which is well below the errors of other traditional methods.

TI  - Quantification and mapping cooling effect and its accessibility of urban parks in an extreme heat event in a megacity
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid process of urbanization and global warming, extreme heat events occur frequently, endangering urban dwellers' health. Urban parks could alleviate the severe urban heating climate. However, due to the scarcity of urban land, it is impractical to plan and design urban parks by increasing the blue-green space without restriction. Few studies have focused on optimization and the equity of the parks' cooling service. This study quantifies four cooling indicators of urban parks in Wuhan city, park's cooling intensity (PCI), park's cooling area (PCA), park's cooling gradient (PCG), and park's cooling efficiency (PCE), analyze the drivers for four indicators, discuss different cooling bundles (urban parks with similar specific cooling ability are grouped into bundles) for the specific heat mitigation demands, and map the spatial accessibility for residents to parks' PCA using spatial network analysis. We find that 54 of 60 urban parks have significant cooling effect, with average PCI of 3.5 & PLUSMN; 0.2 ?, PCA of 131.6 & PLUSMN; 29.6 ha, PCG of 17.9 & PLUSMN; 1.5 ?/km, PCE of 4.5 & PLUSMN; 0.8. Blue and green infrastructure inside parks and impervious surface ratio surrounding the parks play significant roles in cooling service. Larger urban parks usually have larger PCA, but lower PCG and PCE. Five cooling bundles clustered with specific dominant cooling indicators could be references for the specific demand considering tradeoffs in urban parks' design and planning. Taking one step further, we unmask the unequal accessibility of the urban parks cooling service in one extreme heat day: 83.6% of the residents in the central area can enjoy the urban parks' cooling service within 30-min walk, while most residents (74.4%) in suburbs are not able to access to the cooling service within 30-min walk. Our study should be valuable for the urban planning and practice to find heat mitigation solutions and improve residents' heat comfort, also helpful for local municipalities to consider the urban parks' service provision for marginal groups.

TI  - Long-Term 10 m Resolution Water Dynamics of Qinghai Lake and the Driving Factors
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest inland saltwater lake in China, Qinghai Lake plays an important role in regional sustainable development and ecological environment protection. In this study, we adopted a spatial downscaling model for mapping lake water at 10 m resolution through integrating Sentinel-2 and Landsat data, which was applied to map the water extent of Qinghai Lake from 1991 to 2020. This was further combined with the Hydroweb water level dataset to establish an area-level relationship to acquire the 30-year water level and water volume. Then, the driving factors of its water dynamics were analyzed based on the grey system theory. It was found that the lake area, water level, and water volume decreased from 1991 to 2004, but then showed an increasing trend afterwards. The lake area ranges from 4199.23 to 4494.99 km(2). The water level decreased with a speed of ~0.05 m/a before 2004 and then increased with a speed of 0.22 m/a thereafter. Correspondingly, the water volume declined by 5.29 km(3) in the first 13 years, and rapidly increased by 15.57 km(3) thereafter. The correlation between climatic factors and the water volume of Qinghai Lake is significant. Precipitation has the greatest positive impact on the water volume variation with the relational grade of 0.912, while evaporation has a negative impact.

TI  - Urbanization, Economic Development, and Ecological Environment: Evidence from Provincial Panel Data in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between urbanization and the ecological environment is not conclusive in the literature. We used the provincial data from China from 1998 to 2019 to empirically study the relationship between the urbanization ratio and ecological environment which is proxied by the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) from the remote sensing data. The results indicate that the coefficient of the interaction between urbanization and per capita GDP is statistically significant and negative (-0.0946), while the coefficient of urbanization itself is very trivial and not statistically significant. It implies that urbanization could reduce ecological quality, particularly for the high-income regions. The higher the urbanization ratio is, the larger the negative impact is. It implies that urban expansion does reduce the ecological environment. The effect of economic development level on the NDVI can be divided into three stages: the one where the NDVI improves with the increase of GDP per capita (urbanization rate of less than 77.59%), the one where the value of the NDVI is not affected by the level of GDP per capita (urbanization rate equal to 77.59%), and the one where the NDVI decreases with the increase of GDP per capita (urbanization rate of more than 77.59%).

TI  - Neural Network AEROsol Retrieval for Geostationary Satellite (NNAeroG) Based on Temporal, Spatial and Spectral Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary satellites observe the earth surface and atmosphere with a short repeat time, thus, providing aerosol parameters with high temporal resolution, which contributes to the air quality monitoring. Due to the limited information content in satellite data, and the coupling between the signals received from the surface and the atmosphere, the accurate retrieval of multiple aerosol parameters over land is difficult. With the strategy of taking full advantage of satellite measurement information, here we propose a neural network AEROsol retrieval framework for geostationary satellite (NNAeroG), which can potentially be applied to different instruments to obtain various aerosol parameters. NNAeroG was applied to the Advanced Himawari Imager on Himawari-8 and the results were evaluated versus independent ground-based sun photometer reference data. The aerosol optical depth, angstrom ngstrom exponent and fine mode fraction produced by the NNAeroG method are significantly better than the official JAXA aerosol products. With spectral bands selection, the use of thermal infrared bands is meaningful for aerosol retrieval.

TI  - A Simple and Robust Spectral Index for Identifying Lodged Maize Using Gaofen1 Satellite Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop lodging is a major destructive factor for agricultural production. Developing a cost-efficient and accurate method to assess crop lodging is crucial for informing crop management decisions and reducing lodging losses. Satellite remote sensing can provide continuous data on a large scale; however, its utility in detecting lodging crops is limited due to the complexity of lodging events and the unavailability of high spatial and temporal resolution data. Gaofen1 satellite was launched in 2013. The short revisit cycle and wide orbit coverage of the Gaofen1 satellite make it suitable for lodging identification. However, few studies have explored lodging detection using Gaofen1 data, and the operational application of existing approaches over large spatial extents seems to be unrealistic. In this paper, we discuss the identification method of lodged maize and explore the potential of using Gaofen1 data. An analysis of the spectral features after maize lodging revealed that reflectance increased significantly in all bands, compared to non-lodged maize. A spectral sum index was proposed to distinguish lodged and non-lodged maize. Two study areas were considered: Zhaodong City in Heilongjiang Province and Ningjiang District in Jilin Province. The results of the identified lodged maize from the Gaofen1 data were validated based on three methods: first, ground sample points exhibited the overall accuracies of 92.86% and 88.24% for Zhaodong City and Ningjiang District, respectively; second, the cross-comparison differences of 1.01% for Zhaodong City and 1.13% for Ningjiang District were obtained, compared to the results acquired from the finer-resolution Planet data; and third, the identified results from Gaofen1 data and those from farmer survey questionnaires were found to be consistent. The validation results indicate that the proposed index is promising, and the Gaofen1 data have the potential for rapid lodging monitoring.

TI  - Retrieving Freeze/Thaw Cycles Using Sentinel-1 Data in Eastern Nunavik (Quebec, Canada)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the terrestrial cryosphere, freeze/thaw (FT) state transitions play an important and measurable role in climatic, hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes in permafrost landscapes. Active and passive microwave remote sensing has shown a principal capacity to provide effective monitoring of landscape FT dynamics. The study presents a seasonal threshold approach, which examines the timeseries progression of remote sensing measurements relative to signatures acquired during seasonal frozen and thawed reference states. This is used to estimate the FT state from the Sentinel-1 database and applied and evaluated for the region of Eastern Nunavik (Quebec, Canada). An optimization process of the threshold is included. In situ measurements from the meteorological station network were used for the validation process. Overall, acceptable estimation accuracy (>70%) was achieved in most tests; on the best-performing sites, an accuracy higher than 90% was reached. The performance of the seasonal threshold approach over the study region was further discussed with consideration of land cover, spatial heterogeneity, and soil depth. This work is dedicated to providing more accurate data to capture the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of freeze/thaw transitions and to improving our understanding of related processes in permafrost landscapes.

TI  - A Maritime Cloud-Detection Method Using Visible and Near-Infrared Bands over the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cloud-masking procedures to distinguish cloud-free pixels from cloudy pixels are essential for optical satellite remote sensing. Many studies on satellite-based cloud-detection have been performed using the spectral characteristics of clouds in terms of reflectance and temperature. This study proposes a cloud-detection method using reflectance in four bands: 0.56 mu m, 0.86 mu m, 1.38 mu m, and 1.61 mu m. Methodologically, we present a conversion relationship between the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the green band in the visible spectrum for thick cloud detection using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. NDWI consists of reflectance at the 0.56 and 0.86 mu m bands. For thin cloud detection, the 1.38 and 1.61 mu m bands were applied with empirically determined threshold values. Case study analyses for the four seasons from 2000 to 2019 were performed for the sea surface area of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. In the case studies, the comparison of the proposed cloud-detection method with the MODIS cloud mask (CM) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation data indicated a probability of detection of 0.933, a false-alarm ratio of 0.086, and a Heidke Skill Score of 0.753. Our method demonstrated an additional important benefit in distinguishing clouds from sea ice or yellow dust, compared to the MODIS CM products, which usually misidentify the latter as clouds. Consequently, our cloud-detection method could be applied to a variety of low-orbit and geostationary satellites with 0.56, 0.86, 1.38, and 1.61 mu m bands.

TI  - Role of sentinel lymph node biopsy for gynecologic cancers
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review To provide an overview of the current knowledge and recent advances of sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment in uterine, cervical, vulvar, and ovarian cancers. Recent findings In endometrial cancer, SLN evaluation has become increasingly utilized as part of the treatment of early-stage disease, with data showing improved detection of pelvic lymph node metastasis. In cervical cancer, SLN biopsy has also gained increasing traction with studies demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of SLN detection. Evaluation with frozen section, however, remains limited in the detection of metastases. The prognostic significance of positive SLN in vulvar cancer is currently being investigated, with preliminary data showing lower recurrence rates in patients receiving adjuvant radiation. SLN evaluation remains standard of care to detect lymph node metastasis in early-staged endometrial cancer. In cervical cancer, SLN biopsy has been shown to be reliable, while decreasing morbidity without impacting disease-free survival in select patients. The technique and high sensitivity of SLN biopsy in vulvar cancer has been demonstrated in large prospective trials. There are no randomized controlled trials in ovarian cancer that evaluate the role of SLN biopsy on treatment and outcome; current SLN evaluation remains investigational.

TI  - Soil Moisture Content Estimation Based on Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery Using an Artificial Neural Network and Hydrological Components
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates soil moisture content (SMC) using Sentinel-1A/B C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and an artificial neural network (ANN) over a 40 x 50-km(2) area located in the Geum River basin in South Korea. The hydrological components characterized by the antecedent precipitation index (API) and dry days were used as input data as well as SAR (cross-polarization (VH) and copolarization (VV) backscattering coefficients and local incidence angle), topographic (elevation and slope), and soil (percentage of clay and sand)-related data in the ANN simulations. A simple logarithmic transformation was useful in establishing the linear relationship between the observed SMC and the API. In the dry period without rainfall, API did not decrease below 0, thus the Dry days were applied to express the decreasing SMC. The optimal ANN architecture was constructed in terms of the number of hidden layers, hidden neurons, and activation function. The comparison of the estimated SMC with the observed SMC showed that the Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.85 and 4.59%, respectively.

TI  - Angels and What They Could Bring
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENTECOSTAL THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Angels are endemic to the pentecostal worldview, are currently in vogue in popular spirituality, and pentecostal scholars desire for their theology to be of benefit to the pentecostal and public communities as a whole. This article contends, therefore, that scholarly pentecostal theology on the topic of angels would be of much value. It provides a scholarly contribution to the topic by first reviewing the fullest angelology proffered by a pentecostal scholar to date - that of Amos Yong. It then offers a classic-contemporary pentecostal theology and definition of angels that is more consistent with modern experiences of angels, as well as the teaching of Scripture, tradition, and reason. Finally, it commends how this angelology could be applied practically in a way that feeds the intrigue of the popular imagination, functions as a resource for apologists, and gives the interested theologian several leads for further exploration of the topic.

TI  - A Randomized Prospective Non-Inferiority Trial of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer: Blue Dye Compared with Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Tracer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This randomized study was conducted to evaluate sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green (ICG) compared with blue dye as a tracer in women with early breast cancer without any sign of lymph node invasion. ICG is a fluorescent tracer well known in medical practice for 50 years that is used as tracer of sentinel lymph nodes in numerous types of cancers other than breast cancer. This tracer is cheaper than radioactive tracers, with an easy learning curve. Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) is a promising tracer for sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer. This randomized study was conducted to evaluate sentinel lymph node biopsy with ICG compared with blue dye as a tracer in woman with early breast cancer without any sign of lymph node invasion. Methods: Between January 2019 and November 2020, 240 consecutive women with early breast cancer were enrolled and randomized to sentinel lymph node biopsy using ICG or blue dye. The primary endpoint was the sentinel lymph node detection rate in both arms. Results: ICG was used in 121 patients and detected sentinel lymph nodes in all patients (detection rate, 100%; 95% CI: 96.9-100.0) while blue dye was used in 119 patients and detected sentinel lymph nodes in 116 patients (detection rate: 97.5%, 95% CI: 92.9-99.1). This analysis indicated the non-inferiority of ICG vs. blue dye tracer (90%CI: -1.9-6.9; p = 0.0009). Conclusion: ICG represents a new promising tracer to detect sentinel lymph nodes in early breast cancer with a detection rate similar to other conventional tracers, and is associated with easy learning and low cost. Our result suggest that this technique is a good alternative to avoid radioactive isotope manipulation.

TI  - Dynamic Landscapes in the UK Driven by Pressures from Energy Production and Forestry-Results of the CORINE Land Cover Map 2018
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map was established in 1985 and is now one of the most widely used products from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. As the world's longest consistent operational land cover monitoring product, CLC maps have been produced for reference years 1990, 2000, 2006, 2012 and now for 2018. This paper presents the results from the CLC2018 mapping project in the UK and analyses the results of the land cover status layer and the change layer from the period 2012-2018. It sets this change in context with the change results from the period 2006-2012 and finds that the rate of change between the subsequent CORINE land cover maps is continuing to increase. Changes mapped for the period 2012-2018 covered 76,032 ha greater than the change mapped between 2006 and 2012, an increase of 26% of mapped change. The area of changes mapped covered an area equivalent to 1.16% of the total land area of the UK. The number of different types of changes also continue to diversify; however, the dominance of rotational forestry is consistent with the previous map. The process of urban land take has been highlighted in the results between 2012 and 2018 and is a trend identified in previous iterations of the CLC inventories. The largest gain is in industrial or commercial units (an increase of 14.4%). This growth is mainly attributed to renewable energy infrastructure. As well as the descriptive analysis, the results have been analysed to identify the likely pressures being experienced on the land in the UK. Although the CLC mapping approach is consistent, there have been improvements to the input EO data used to map the changes. For 2018, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 system offered a consistent and reliable image source for the first time. This increased the spatial resolution of the source datasets to 10 m, allowing for more accurate identification of small features and those with fine spatial textures such as suburban, road networks and windfarms. We also look forward to the development of CLC+, the new generation of CORINE land mapping, and the improvements it could make.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation of Metoceanic Processes Using SAR Observations and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Through the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) embarked on the satellites Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B of the Copernicus program, a large quantity of observations is routinely acquired over the oceans. A wide range of features from both oceanic (e.g., biological slicks, icebergs, etc.) and meteorologic origin (e.g., rain cells, wind streaks, etc.) are distinguishable on these acquisitions. This paper studies the semantic segmentation of ten metoceanic processes either in the context of a large quantity of image-level groundtruths (i.e., weakly-supervised framework) or of scarce pixel-level groundtruths (i.e., fully-supervised framework). Our main result is that a fully-supervised model outperforms any tested weakly-supervised algorithm. Adding more segmentation examples in the training set would further increase the precision of the predictions. Trained on 20 x 20 km imagettes acquired from the WV acquisition mode of the Sentinel-1 mission, the model is shown to generalize, under some assumptions, to wide-swath SAR data, which further extents its application domain to coastal areas.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-2 Satellite for Spatially Variable Rate Fertiliser Management in a Sicilian Vineyard
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites can be used for producing maps of within-field crop and soil parameters and, consequentially, spatially variable rate crop input application maps. The plant vegetative vigour index (i.e., Normalised Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI) and the leaf water content index (i.e., Normalised Difference Water Index-NDWI) maps were used to study-through both time and space-the phenological phases of two plots, with Syrah and Nero d'Avola grapevine varieties, in a Sicilian vineyard farm, located in Naro (Agrigento, Sicily, Italy). The aim of this work is to produce spatially variable rate nitrogen fertiliser maps to be applied in the two vineyard plots under study as well as to understand when they should be fertilised or not according to their target crop yields. The average plant vegetative vigour and leaf water content of both the plots showed a high temporal and spatial variability during all phenological phases and, according to these results, the optimal fertilisation time should have been 12 April 2021. In fact, this crop operation is aimed at supporting the vegetative activity but must be performed when the soil water and, therefore, the plant leaf water content are high. Therefore, spatially variable rate fertilisation should have been performed around 12 April 2021 in both plots, using previous NDVI maps and taking into consideration two management zones. This work demonstrates the usefulness of remote sensing data as Decision Support Systems (DSS) for nitrogen fertilisation in order to reduce the production cost, environmental impact and climate footprints per kg of produced grapes, according to the European Green Deal challenges.

TI  - Shallow magma convection evidenced by excess degassing and thermal radiation during the dome-forming Sabancaya eruption (2012-2020)
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a large set of satellite- (visible, infrared, and radar images from Planetscope, MODIS, VIIRS, Sentinel2, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 1) and ground-based data (optical images, SO2 flux, shallow seismicity) to describe and characterize the activity of the Sabancaya volcano during the unrest and eruption phases that occurred between 2012 and 2020. The unrest phase (2012-2016) was characterized by increasing gas and thermal flux, sourced by a convective magma column rising along with the remnants of a buried plug still permeable to fluid flow. Conversely, a new conduit, adjacent to the previous one, fed the eruptive phase (2016-2020) which was instead characterized by a discontinuous extrusive activity, with phases of dome growth (at rates from 0.04 to 0.75 m(3) s(-1)) and collapse. The extrusive activity was accompanied by fluctuating thermal anomalies (0.5-25 MW), by irregular SO2 degassing (700-7000 tons day(-1)), and by variable explosive activity (4-100 events d(-1)) producing repeated vulcanian ash plumes (500-5000 m above the crater). Magma budget calculation during the eruptive phase indicates a large excess of degassing, with the volume of degassed magma (0.25-1.28 km(3)) much higher than the volume of erupted magma (< 0.01 km(3)). Similarly, the thermal energy radiated by the eruption was much higher than that sourced by the dome itself, an unbalance that, by analogy with the degassing, we define as "excess thermal radiation". Both of these unbalances are consistent with the presence of shallow magma convection that fed the extrusive and explosive activity of the Sabancaya dome.

TI  - Weekly Monitoring and Forecasting of Hydropower Production Coupling Meteo-Hydrological Modeling with Ground and Satellite Data in the Italian Alps
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a system for supporting hydropower production on mountainous areas. The system couples the outputs of a numerical weather prediction model and a snow melting and accumulation temperature-based model. Several procedures are presented for interpolating meteorological variables and calibrating and validating model parameters that can be generalized to any other mountainous area where the estimation of current and forecasted snow water equivalent and melting amount is required. The system reliability has been assessed through the validation of three components: spatial interpolation of meteorological data, mathematical modeling, and quantitative meteorological forecast. The results show that good accuracy of meteorological data spatial interpolation can be achieved when the data from snow gauges are used for assessing the precipitation lapse rate at higher altitudes, and the temperature lapse rate is computed from data at each time step. The temperature-based hydrological model proved to be effective in simulating lake inflow water volume and energy production. No clear result has been found for snow melt forecast due to the difficulties in providing reliable quantitative weather forecast in complex alpine area.

TI  - Finding Mesolithic Sites: A Multichannel Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) Investigation at the Ancient Lake Duvensee
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The shift to the early Holocene in northern Europe is strongly associated with major environmental and climatic changes that influenced hunter-gatherers' activities and occupation during the Mesolithic period. The ancient lake Duvensee (10,000-6500 cal. BCE) has been studied for almost a century, providing archaeological sites consisting of bark mats and hazelnut-roasting hearths situated on small sand banks deposited by the glacier. No method is yet available to locate these features before excavation. Therefore, a key method for understanding the living conditions of hunter-gatherer groups is to reconstruct the paleoenvironment with a focus on the identification of areas that could possibly host Mesolithic camps and well-preserved archaeological artefacts. We performed a 16-channel MAL angstrom Imaging Radar Array (MIRA) system survey aimed at understanding the landscape surrounding the find spot Duvensee WP10, located in a hitherto uninvestigated part of the bog. Using an integrated approach of high-resolution ground radar mapping and targeted excavations enabled us to derive a 3D spatio-temporal landscape reconstruction of the investigated sector, including paleo-bathymetry, stratigraphy, and shorelines around the Mesolithic camps. Additionally, we detected previously unknown islands as potential areas for yet unknown dwelling sites. We found that the growth rates of the islands were in the order of approximately 0.3 m(2)/yr to 0.7 m(2)/yr between the late Preboreal and the Subboreal stages. The ground-penetrating radar surveying performed excellently in all aspects of near-surface landscape reconstruction as well as in identifying potential dwellings; however, the direct identification of small-scale artefacts, such as fireplaces, was not successful because of their similarity to natural structures.

TI  - The Extreme Heat Wave over Western North America in 2021: An Assessment by Means of Land Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In our current global warming climate, the growth of record-breaking heat waves (HWs) is expected to increase in its frequency and intensity. Consequently, the considerably growing and agglomerated world's urban population becomes more exposed to serious heat-related health risks. In this context, the study of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) intensity during HWs is of substantial importance due to the potential vulnerability urbanized areas might have to HWs in comparison to their surrounding rural areas. This article discusses Land Surface Temperatures (LST) reached during the extreme HW over Western North America during the boreal summer of 2021 using Thermal InfraRed (TIR) imagery acquired from TIR Sensor (TIRS) (30 m spatial resolution) onboard Landsat-8 platform and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (1 km spatial resolution) onboard Terra/Aqua platforms. We provide an early assessment of maximum LSTs reached over the affected areas, as well as impacts in terms of SUHI over the main cities and towns. MODIS series of LST from 2000 to 2021 over urbanized areas presented the highest recorded LST values in late June 2021, with maximum values around 50 degrees C for some cities. High spatial resolution LSTs (Landsat-8) were used to map SUHI intensity as well as to assess the impact of SUHI on thermal comfort conditions at intraurban space by means of a thermal environmental quality indicator, the Urban Field Thermal Variance Index (UFTVI). The same high resolution LSTs were used to verify the existence of clusters and employ a Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) to quantify its degree of strength. We identified the spatial distribution of heat patterns within the intraurban space as well as described its behavior across the thermal landscape by fitting a polynomial regression model. We also qualitatively analyze the relationship between both UFTVI and LST clusters with different land cover types. Findings indicate that average daytime SUHI intensity for the studied cities was typically within 1 to 5 degrees C, with some exceptional values surpassing 7 degrees C and 9 degrees C. During night, the SUHI intensity was reduced to variations within 1-3 degrees C, with a maximum value of +4 degrees C. The extreme LSTs recorded indicate no significant influence of HW on SUHI intensity. SUHI intensity maps of the intraurban space evidence hotspots of much higher values located at densely built-up areas, while urban green spaces and dense vegetation show lower values. In the same manner, UTFVI has shown "no" SUHI for densely vegetated regions, water bodies, and low-dense built-up areas with intertwined dense vegetation, while the "strongest" SUHI was observed for non-vegetated dense built-up areas with low albedo material such as concrete and pavement. LST was evidenced as a good marker for assessing the influence of HWs on SUHI and recognizing potential thermal environmental consequences of SUHI intensity. This finding highlights that remote-sensing based LST is particularly suitable as an indicator in the analysis of SUHI intensity patterns during HWs at different spatial resolutions. LST used as an indicator for analyzing and detecting extreme temperature events and its consequences seems to be a promising means for rapid and accurate monitoring and mapping.

TI  - Towards codesign in respiratory care: development of an implementation-ready intervention to improve guideline-adherent adult asthma care across primary and secondary care settings (The SENTINEL Project)
T2  - BMJ OPEN RESPIRATORY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) overuse (>= 3 canisters annually) is associated with worse asthma outcomes and accounts for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions from asthma inhalers in England. Reducing SABA overuse aligns with the National Health Service long-term plan to optimise asthma treatment while minimising environmental impact, but adoption of local asthma guidelines for a SABA-free maintenance and reliever therapy strategy for step 3 asthma patients is limited. In this Perspective, we describe patient and staff involvement in a codesign process adapted from experience-based codesign (EBCD) principles to develop an implementation-ready intervention within a practice-relevant timescale. The codesigned intervention consists of five pillars: healthcare professional education; implementation of 'gold standard' prescribing practices; targeted asthma reviews; patient education and support; and real-time data monitoring and reporting of asthma care metrics. The codesign process contributed to all pillars and, by identifying potential individual and organisational barriers to implementation, enabled the development of plans to address these barriers. In this Perspective, we reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of our codesign process, outline how EBCD principles can be used in respiratory research and propose actions for patients, health professionals, researchers and funders to develop the potential of EBCD in respiratory research.

TI  - SRSe-Net: Super-Resolution-Based Semantic Segmentation Network for Green Tide Extraction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the phenomenon of mixed pixels in low-resolution remote sensing images, the green tide spectral features with low Enteromorpha coverage are not obvious. Super-resolution technology based on deep learning can supplement more detailed information for subsequent semantic segmentation tasks. In this paper, a novel green tide extraction method for MODIS images based on super-resolution and a deep semantic segmentation network was proposed. Inspired by the idea of transfer learning, a super-resolution model (i.e., WDSR) is first pre-trained with high spatial resolution GF1-WFV images, and then the representations learned in the GF1-WFV image domain are transferred to the MODIS image domain. The improvement of remote sensing image resolution enables us to better distinguish the green tide patches from the surrounding seawater. As a result, a deep semantic segmentation network (SRSe-Net) suitable for large-scale green tide information extraction is proposed. The SRSe-Net introduced the dense connection mechanism on the basis of U-Net and replaces the convolution operations with dense blocks, which effectively obtained the detailed green tide boundary information by strengthening the propagation and reusing features. In addition, the SRSe-Net reducs the pooling layer and adds a bridge module in the final stage of the encoder. The experimental results show that a SRSe-Net can obtain more accurate segmentation results with fewer network parameters.

TI  - MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product Reconstruction Based on the SSA-BiLSTM Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter indispensable for studying the substance and energy exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere, climate changes, and other related aspects. However, due to cloud cover, there are many null values in MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LST data, which prevents such data from being widely used. Therefore, an LST reconstruction method is proposed by combining data decomposition with data prediction-SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory). This method consists of two major processes, namely, rough LST reconstruction based on the SSA model and refined LST reconstruction based on the BiLSTM model. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified through "removal-reconstruction-comparison" using remote sensing data and measured data. The verification results show that when the rate of original missing values in the LST time series for the study area is lower than 10%, the RMSE is smaller than 1.1 K, and the correlation coefficient is more significant than 0.98. Even when the rate of missing data is 40% and 50%, the proposed method remains accurate, the values of RMSE are 1.8331 K and 2.2929 K, and the importance of R-2 are 0.9856 and 0.9800, respectively. The proposed method is compared with other existing LST reconstruction methods. The results of the comparative analysis indicate that the proposed method is superior to other methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and stability. Moreover, the LST data reconstructed using the proposed method are highly consistent with the measured data, which further proves the accuracy of this method in LST reconstruction. The research findings provide a new technique and idea for accurate LST reconstruction.

TI  - Quantitatively Assessing the Future Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes and Their Driving Factors in the Upper Stream of the Awash River Based on the CA-Markov Model and Their Implications for Water Resources Management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the rapid economic and population growth, the risks related to the current dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) have attracted a lot of attention in Ethiopia. Therefore, a complete investigation of past and future LULC changes is essential for sustainable water resources and land-use planning and management. Since the 1980s, LULC change has been detected in the upper stream of the Awash River basin. The main purpose of this research was to investigate the current dynamics of LULC and use the combined application of the cellular automata and the Markov chain (CA-Markov) model to simulate the year 2038 LULC in the future; key informant interviews, household surveys, focus group discussions, and field observations were used to assess the consequences and drivers of LULC changes in the upstream Awash basin (USAB). This research highlighted the importance of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques for analyzing the LULC changes in the USAB. Multi-temporal cloud-free Landsat images of three sequential data sets for the periods (1984, 2000, and 2019) were employed to classify based on supervised classification and map LULC changes. Satellite imagery enhancement techniques were performed to improve and visualize the image for interpretation. ArcGIS10.4 and IDRISI software was used for LULC classification, data processing, and analyses. Based on Landsat 5 TM-GLS 1984, Landsat 7 ETM-GLS 2000, and Landsat 8 2019 OLI-TIRS, the supervised maximum likelihood image classification method was used to map the LULC dynamics. Landsat images from 1984, 2000, and 2019 were classified to simulate possible LULC in 2019 and 2038. The result reveals that the maximum area is covered by agricultural land and shrubland. It showed, to the areal extent, a substantial increase in agricultural land and urbanization and a decrease in shrubland, forest, grassland, and water. The LULC dynamics showed that those larger change rates were observed from forest and shrubland to agricultural areas. The results of the study show the radical changes in LULC during 1984-2019; the main reasons for this were agricultural expansion and urbanization. From 1984 to 2019, agriculture increased by 62%, urban area increased by 570.5%, and forest decreased by 88.7%. In the same year, the area of shrubland decreased by 68.6%, the area of water decreased by 65.5%, and the area of grassland decreased by 57.7%. In view of the greater increase in agricultural land and urbanization, as well as the decrease in shrubland, it means that the LULC of the region has changed. This research provides valuable information for water resources managers and land-use planners to make changes in the improvement of future LULC policies and development of sub-basin management strategies in the context of sustainable water resources and land-use planning and management.

TI  - Multi-Species Inference of Exotic Annual and Native Perennial Grasses in Rangelands of the Western United States Using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasion of exotic annual grass (EAG), e.g., cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and medusa-head (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), into rangeland ecosystems of the western United States is a broad-scale problem that affects wildlife habitats, increases wildfire frequency, and adds to land management costs. However, identifying individual species of EAG abundance from remote sensing, particularly at early stages of invasion or growth, can be problematic because of overlapping controls and similar phenological characteristics among native and other exotic vegetation. Subsequently, refining and developing tools capable of quantifying the abundance and phenology of annual and perennial grass species would be beneficial to help inform conservation and management efforts at local to regional scales. Here, we deploy an enhanced version of the U.S. Geological Survey Rangeland Exotic Plant Monitoring System to develop timely and accurate maps of annual (2016-2020) and intra-annual (May 2021 and July 2021) abundances of exotic annual and perennial grass species throughout the rangelands of the western United States. This monitoring system leverages field observations and remote-sensing data with artificial intelligence/machine learning to rapidly produce annual and early season estimates of species abundances at a 30-m spatial resolution. We introduce a fully automated and multi-task deep-learning framework to simultaneously predict and generate weekly, near-seamless composites of Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 spectral data. These data, along with auxiliary datasets and time series metrics, are incorporated into an ensemble of independent XGBoost models. This study demonstrates that inclusion of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Wetness Index time-series data generated from our deep-learning framework enables near real-time and accurate mapping of EAG (Median Absolute Error (MdAE): 3.22, 2.72, and 0.02; and correlation coefficient (r): 0.82, 0.81, and 0.73; respectively for EAG, cheatgrass, and medusahead) and native perennial grass abundance (MdAE: 2.51, r:0.72 for Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda)). Our approach and the resulting data provide insights into rangeland grass dynamics, which will be useful for applications, such as fire and drought monitoring, habitat suitability mapping, as well as land-cover and land-change modelling. Spatially explicit, timely, and accurate species-specific abundance datasets provide invaluable information to land managers.

TI  - Land Use Change in the Cross-Boundary Regions of a Metropolitan Area: A Case Study of Tongzhou-Wuqing-Langfang
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1980s, metropolitan areas have increased worldwide due to urbanization and regionalization. While the spatial integration of the labor and housing markets has benefitted the development of cities within metropolitan areas, they have also brought great challenges for land governance; this is particularly evident in cross-boundary regions due to the complex relations between the markets and the regulations and between governments at different levels. Extensive research has been conducted on the city-level analysis of socioeconomic integration, land use development, and urban governance within metropolitan areas; yet, it is insufficient for understanding the intricate interplay between the various forces in such regions. This study aims to reveal the dynamics of land use change from 1990-2020 and its driving forces in the recent decade in the Tongzhou-Wuqing-Langfang (TWL) region-a typical cross-boundary area between Beijing, Tianjin, and the Hebei Metropolitan Area-using Landsat imagery. We employed the land-use dynamic degree, kernel density analysis, principal component analysis, and multiple linear regression to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of land use change and its driving factors at the district/county level. The results show that the general land use changes from cultivated and forest land to urban and rural construction land across the region. The speed of the trend varies considerably over time between different areas as the land use policies and regulations of each local government change. The population growth and the tertiary and secondary industry growth are the main driving factors for the change in construction land across the whole TWL region, while the urbanization rate and fixed asset investment have different impacts across the cross-boundary region. The results suggest that expanding the integration of land use policies and regulations in the cross-boundary region is urgently required.

TI  - Military woman and defense policy: reflections from Ecuador and Buen Vivir
T2  - RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2007, after the election of the economist Rafael Correa Delgado for president of the Republic of Ecuador, the country has been experiencing a series of ideological, structural and political changes. A Constitutional Assembly, demanded by a Popular Consultation, materialized Correa's project of "homeland refoundation" (Ulloa, 2020, p. 19). In 2008, once the Constitution had been drafted, 63,93% of the voting population said "Yes" to the new Constitution, thus establishing what would be a turning point in national politics.On the one hand, until the fall of Colonel Lucio Gutierrez (2003-2005), the country had undergone turbulence during the nineties due to significant political-institutional instability. There were three political leaders toppled in total; an armed conflict with its neighbor country, Peru; and a deep economic crisis that led the country to embark on dollarization. Correa's presidency, on the other hand, lasted ten years (2007-2017), after which time he left one of his vice-presidents Lenin Moreno as successor (2017-2021). In addition, despite the corruption during his government, he continues to lead the second largest political party, as can be seen in the 2021 elections.His Plan of Government, called 'Plan Nacional para el Buen Vivir,' introduced the indigenous worldview of Sumak Kawsay. Translated from quichua language as Buen Vivir, this philosophy enabled the adoption of social inclusion measures, the enlargement of minority rights, including the expansion of the liberal juridical anthropocentric concept, by offering nature rights (Hernandez, 2017). Sumak Kawsay means "life in its fullness [...] in its material and spiritual excellence [...] in its inner and outer balance of the community" (Macas, 2010, p. 14).Based on this philosophy, Ecuador started moving towards social change, which was impossible without the inclusion of gender equality (Zaragocin, 2017, p. 64). In that sense, many public policies have been planned, creating debates on economic, political and social issues (Acosta, 2012;Acosta y Cajas-Guijarro, 2018; Hernandez, 2017; Radcliffe, 2017). Furthermore, these policies targeted one of the most hermetic institutions: the Armed Forces.In this respect, this paper aims to analyze the discursive reproductions and disruptions in gender categories (masculine and feminine) based on an analysis of Ecuadorian defense documents. The masculinities constitute a gender category that reflects the subjugation of the feminine by the masculine, and is connected to a superiority associated with strength, rationality, command, in opposition to feminine values (weakness, emotionality, anarchy) (Hooper, 1999). Nevertheless, masculinities are not personal characteristics concerning individuals. Instead, they should be understood as configurations produced by social actions in a particular context (Connell y Messerschmidt, 2005, p. 832). In this paper, Maya Eichler's militarized masculinities (MM) concept is used as a reference to the stereotypical masculine characteristics created by the exacerbation of virility in military rituals (military service, combat) (Eichler, 2014, pp. 83-85). The author highlights that the MM are regularly and dynamically produced, making necessary an analysis on its features. Therefore, it is used to identify discursive and ideological formations and interdiscourses associated with gender notions present in the documents through a post-structural feminist approach and a discourse analysis methodology.Gender equality constitutes an unavoidable issue in contemporary democracies and consequently the inclusion of women in the Ecuadorian Armed Forces is an ongoing challenge. Recent studies on the integration of women in the military demonstrate that public policies, mainly regarding gender equality and interculturality, have been militarized (Zaragocin, 2018, p. 436). In other words, the potential for social change has been lost. From this fact, this paper argues that the militarization of gender equality, besides undermining the transformative potential of social inclusion, allowed the reproduction of new manifestations of militarized masculinities in the defense documents, updating the dynamics based on a dialectic and negative masculine/feminine dichotomy.Furthermore, the existence of a gap in the Ecuadorian security and defense literature is identified; despite the increase of women in the military, studies on this phenomenon remain incipient (Chacon, 2014; Iturralde, 2015; Morales et al., 2017; Zaldumbide, 2020; Zaragocin, 2018). Issues concerning military masculinities, hegemonic masculinity in these places and in Ecuadorian society -and their discursive reproductions, continuities and resistances- constitute a fertile ground for the analysis of the consequences of militarization for social inclusion. This paper fills this gap by analyzing the transformation in militarized masculinities in national defense discourse, and it does so through innovative methodological resources that allow a critical perspective on the results of the policies implemented since 2007.In terms of methodology, a framework of analisis is used consisting of defense documents published from 2002 to 2017, namely: Libro Blanco de Defensa (2002, 2006), Agenda Politica de Defensa (2009-2013 and 2014-2017), Politica de Genero de las Fuerzas Armadas del Ecuador (2013) and the Cartilla de Genero Fuerzas Armadas del Ecuador (2017). This framework refers to the year of 2002 due to the release of the first Libro Blanco during Gustavo Noboa's administration (2000-2003). This permits us to determine to what extent the inclusion of gender politics was an unavoidable issue in national defense politics during the documents' transition.The body of analysis is addressed through the combination of a discourse analysis and a post-structural feminist perspective on gender, using Laura Shepherd's theoretical lens. The connection between these methodologies permits the identification of the ways that gender manifests itself as an element of power in discourses. It is highlighted how the post-structural feminist perspective allows us to question how the texts signify, enabling the realization of profound analyses that address the documents' discursive meanings (Shepherd, 2010, p. 9). Discourse should be understood as "word in motion", whose purpose is the production of effects of meaning (Orlandi, 2012, p. 15). Discourse is represented by oral and written word, and symbols that dispute meanings in subjective and ideological fields (Brandao, 2012, p. 9). For this study, the texts that form the body of analysis are considered discourses. In this way, discourses are understood as neither transparent nor inert (Orlandi, 2012, p. 15), but dynamic and contingent.Besides the introduction and the final considerations, the work has three sections. The first section presents the conceptual tools that will be used to understand the relation between gender and masculinities. After that, a brief description of the methodology employed in the study is developed. Finally, the analysis is conducted on the manifestations of militarized masculinities in the documents. The work finishes by presenting a final argument, that is: besides undermining the transformative potential of social inclusion, the militarization of gender equality allows for the reproduction of new manifestations of militarized masculinities in the defense documents. The dynamics are updated based on a dialectic and negative masculine/feminine dichotomy.Through this analysis three illustrative images of women's presence in the defense documents were created: "partial citizen", "authorized citizen" and "military woman". The three representations show, in a "before" and "after" comparison of gender politics, that women continue experiencing rejection in military spaces, being the "Other", and inherently a stranger to the ideal of militarized masculinity that prevails in the barracks. The conclusion is that militarized masculinities have experienced a discursive metamorphosis, demonstrating the subtle and resistant armor of the masculine military ethos.

TI  - A step towards mapping rainfall erosivity for India using high-resolution GPM satellite rainfall products
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The R-factor is a multi-annual average index that measures the climatological potential of rainfall and its kinetic energy. It is used to evaluate the effect of rainfall on sheet and rill-erosion. A continuous record of 30-minute resolution pluviograph data is required to compute rainfall erosivity. However, due to the limited availability of short interval precipitation data, rainfall erosivity mapping involves interpolation from point-rainfall erosivity values. This study attempts to prepare the first-ever rainfall erosivity map from high-resolution satellite precipitation data for India. We used the IMERG final run 30-minute precipitation data from 2001 to 2018 to compute spatially distributed rainfall erosivity for India. We also correlated rainfall erosivity with daily rainfall data using a power equation. We presented the calibrated parameter values of the developed power equation as maps at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees spatial resolution. The mean annual rainfall erosivity value ranges from 77 to 20,662 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) yr(-1). The summer monsoon is the most erosive season, accounting for about 85% of the annual rainfall erosivity. We compared the rainfall erosivity map computed in this study with the previously available rainfall erosivity map produced from very few gauged point rainfall data. It is found that the spatial pattern of erosivity between the two maps matches very well. However, the erosivity map produced using satellite data exhibits slightly lower erosivity values in areas receiving very low and very high rainfall than the previously available erosivity map. We also computed erosivity density maps of India to identify the hotspot areas prone to erosion and landslide. Northeast and the Western Ghats of India receive high-intensity rainfall in the summer monsoon and have significantly high erosivity density. This study's outcome could serve as the primary source of information by the policymakers to take appropriate catchment management measures to reduce soil erosion.

TI  - Heavy metal tolerance strategies in metallicolous and non-metallicolous populations of mosses: Insights of γ plus β-tocopherol regulatory role
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - As bryophytes present the capacity to colonize a wide range of habitats, including extreme environments (e.g., mine areas), we first checked the global response of bryophytes to heavy metals (HM) by a systematic review. This analysis found i) the lack of studies in a polluted environment and ii) resulted in a global trend of photochemical efficiency decrease when bryophytes faced heavy metals. Secondly, we characterized the photoprotective responses of four metallicolous populations of mosses (Lewinskya rupestris, Polytrichum commune, Ptychostomum compactum and Rhynchostegium confertum) naturally growing in an abandoned mine area by an experimental field approach. As a result, we found markedly species-specific tolerance patterns: i) less tolerant species, presenting high pollutants content accompanied by marked dissipative and antioxidative strategies. This strategy was depicted by the species R. confertum that result to be a good sentinel species due to the high pollutant content and high physiological sensitivity.; ii) intermediate tolerant species presenting a medium content of pollutants and less marked photoprotective mechanisms, and iii) most tolerant species minimizing pollutants content and consequently presenting no changes in their physiological performance. This evidence support that species' bryological attributes have a key role in determining species' tolerance towards environmental heavy metals, and should be taken into consideration in future studies. The findings of this study also pointed out that the higher levels of gamma + beta-tocopherol in metallicolous populations could play a regulatory role in metal stress tolerance in mosses and it could be a suitable functional responsive trait for environmental response prediction to heavy metals in polluted environments.

TI  - Characteristics of the community food environment and home surroundings of households beneficiaries of the "Bolsa Familia" (family aid) program
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the food environment to which the households benefiting from the Bolsa Familia Program (PBF) are exposed is necessary to identi-fy exposure to environments that favor worse food choices. This work aimed to characterize the com-munity food environment of the urban area of the municipality of Ouro Preto (MG), Brazil, and the surroundings of the homes of households that are beneficiaries of the PBF. This ecological study was conducted with data from the Single Registry and the State Treasury Department Systems, both from 2014, and from the 2010 Census. Spatial analyses were conducted to evaluate the clusters of beneficiary households and establishments. The peripheral and with lower per capita income cen-sus tracts (CTs) had little or no establishment for food sales, and greater agglomeration of PBF ben-eficiar y households closer to unhealthy establish-ments (median: 65.73 meters). There was a high -er concentration of - mainly unhealthy - food sales establishments in the central CTs and higher per capita income (59.2%). Given the above, it becomes important to dialogue with other nutri-tion-related public policies to reduce inequalities and improve physical access to healthy food sales establishments.

TI  - Panoptic Segmentation Meets Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Panoptic segmentation combines instance and semantic predictions, allowing the detection of countable objects and different backgrounds simultaneously. Effectively approaching panoptic segmentation in remotely sensed data is very promising since it provides a complete classification, especially in areas with many elements as the urban setting. However, some difficulties have prevented the growth of this task: (a) it is very laborious to label large images with many classes, (b) there is no software for generating DL samples in the panoptic segmentation format, (c) remote sensing images are often very large requiring methods for selecting and generating samples, and (d) most available software is not friendly to remote sensing data formats (e.g., TIFF). Thus, this study aims to increase the operability of panoptic segmentation in remote sensing by providing: (1) a pipeline for generating panoptic segmentation datasets, (2) software to create deep learning samples in the Common Objects in Context (COCO) annotation format automatically, (3) a novel dataset, (4) leverage the Detectron2 software for compatibility with remote sensing data, and (5) evaluate this task on the urban setting. The proposed pipeline considers three inputs (original image, semantic image, and panoptic image), and our software uses these inputs alongside point shapefiles to automatically generate samples in the COCO annotation format. We generated 3400 samples with 512 x 512 pixel dimensions and evaluated the dataset using Panoptic-FPN. Besides, the metric analysis considered semantic, instance, and panoptic metrics, obtaining 93.865 mean intersection over union (mIoU), 47.691 Average (AP) Precision, and 64.979 Panoptic Quality (PQ). Our study presents the first effective pipeline for generating panoptic segmentation data for remote sensing targets.

TI  - Semi-Automatic Method to Evaluate Ecological Value of Urban Settlements with the Biotope Area Factor Index: Sources and Logical Framework
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the number of people living in cities continues to increase and as their needs continue rapidly to evolve, planners and scholars have been encouraged to define what constitutes high levels of quality of life in urban settlements. The relationship of an area's inhabitants with natural and green resources increases urban environmental value, which is one of the most relevant aspects in the determination of the quality of life in built-up contexts. Moreover, it is fundamental to find quantitative parameters that can monitor the development of planning processes, working together with natural systems. The authors present a comparative method that can be used to analyze and evaluate the ecological value of urban settlements, using a semi-automatic process that is based on calculating the biotope area factor (BAF) using different open-access databases (a cartographic dataset, aerial imagery, and Sentinel-2 images). Two different Italian case studies that are set in the Milan metropolitan area are presented. In this paper, the authors describe the two settlements using the city-planning parameters of physical structure and morphology; they show the ecological differences and similarities throughout the various remote sensing sources and data. Finally, the authors indicate how the research can be developed, highlighting the weaknesses, the potentiality, the replicability process, and the urban planning implications of the methodology.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of forest change dynamics with satellite time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several forest change detection algorithms are available for tracking and quantifying deforestation based on dense Landsat and Sentinel time series satellite data. Only few also capture regrowth after clearing in an accurate and continuous way across a diversity of forest types (including dry and seasonal forests) and are thus suitable to address the need for better information on secondary forest succession and for assessing forest restoration activities. We present a new change detection algorithm that makes use of the flexibility of kernel density estimations to create a forest reference phenology, taking into account all historical phenological variations of the forest rather than smoothing these out by curve fitting. The AVOCADO (Anomaly Vegetation Change Detection) algorithm allows detection of anomalies with a spatially explicit likelihood measure. We demonstrate the flexibility of the algorithm for three contrasting sites using all available Landsat time series data; ranging from tropical rainforest to dry miombo forest ecosystems, with different time series data densities, and characterized by different forest change types (e.g. selective logging, shifting cultivation). We found that the approach produced in general high overall accuracies (> 90%) across these varying conditions, but had lower accuracies in the dry forest site with a slight overestimation of disturbances and regrowth. The latter was due to the similarity of crops in the time series NDMI signal, causing false regrowth detections. In the moist forest site the low producer accuracies in the intact forest and regrowth class was due to its very small area class (most forest disappeared by the nineties). We showed that the algorithm is capable of capturing small-scale (gradual) changes (e.g. selective logging, forest edge logging) and the multiple changes associated to shifting cultivation. The performance of the algorithm has been shown at regional scale, but if larger scale studies are required a representative selection of reference forest types need to be selected carefully. The outputs of the change maps allow the estimation of the spatio-temporal trends in the proportions of intact forest, secondary forest and non-forest - information that is useful for assessing the areas and potential of secondary forests to accumulate carbon and forest restoration targets. The algorithm can be used for disturbance and regrowth monitoring in different ecozones, is user friendly, and open source.

TI  - Interferometric Satellite Data in Structural Health Monitoring: An Application to the Effects of the Construction of a Subway Line in the Urban Area of Rome
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the use of interferometric satellite data for Structural Health Monitoring has experienced a strong development. The urban environment confirms its fragility to adverse natural events, made even more severe by climate change. Hence, the need to carry out continuous monitoring of structures and artefacts appears increasingly urgent. Furthermore, satellite data could considerably increase the feasibility of traditional Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) approaches. This study aims to explore this remote sensing approach, focusing on the representation techniques that can be adopted to highlight their advantages and provide an interpretation of the results. In particular, the study analyzes records from the urban area of Rome (Italy), subject to the construction of a new subway line. These data are exploited to create a velocity map to highlight the possible subsidence phenomenon induced by excavations. Then, the paper focuses on single buildings or building complexes through the entropy-energy representation. Beyond the different limitations caused by the input data, a correlation is identified between the results of the two representation techniques. Accordingly, the effects of excavation on the urban area are demonstrated, and the methodologies are validated.

TI  - Stratified Mucin-producing Intraepithelial Lesions of the Cervix: Clinical Diversity of Cases and Literature Review
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: This report discusses the current ((i)SMILE) lesions of the cervix with focus on the pathology and its related clinical diversity in several cases. Currently, the knowledge on (i)SMILE is limited to single case reports and series. As a consequence, consensus guidelines regarding the management are lacking. Although there is overlap with both high grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (HSIL) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) on immunohistochemical analyses, it is recommended to treat SMILE like AIS and further excision is needed when surgical margins are positive for SMILE on conization. (i)SMILE, should be considered as a rare subtype of adenocarcinoma of the cervix, and should be treated as such. Case Report: We describe a case with a SMILE lesion undergoing a subsequent robotic hysterectomy after conization and two cases with iSMILE: one case with an early FIGO-stage 1B1 iSMILE tumor, undergoing a robotic radical hysterectomy with sentinel procedure, and one case undergoing a roboticassisted pelvic/para-aortic lymph node staging dissection, confirming a metastatic FIGO-stage 3C2 (for primary chemo-radiotherapy treatment). Conclusion: Here, we report for the first time a few cases of (i)SMILE with different clinical presentations, their management and follow-up. Immunohistochemical characteristics are given for both primary lesions as well as the metastases.

TI  - Assessing Surface Water Losses and Gains under Rapid Urbanization for SDG 6.6.1 Using Long-Term Landsat Imagery in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most open and dynamic regions in China, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has been urbanizing rapidly in recent decades. The surface water in the GBA also has been suffering from urbanization and intensified human activities. The study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns and assess the losses and gains of surface water caused by urbanization in the GBA via long time-series remote sensing data, which could support the progress towards sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations, especially for measuring SDG 6.6.1 indicator. Firstly, utilizing 4750 continuous Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images during 1986-2020 and the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, the multiple index water detection rule (MIWDR) was performed to extract surface water extent in the GBA. Secondly, we achieved surface water dynamic type classification based on annual water inundation frequency time-series in the GBA. Finally, the spatial distribution and temporal variation of urbanization-induced water losses and gains were analyzed through a land cover transfer matrix. Results showed that (1) the average minimal and maximal surface water extents of the GBA during 1986-2020 were 2017.62 km(2) and 6129.55 km(2), respectively. The maximal surface water extent fell rapidly from 7897.96 km(2) in 2001 to 5087.46 km(2) in 2020, with a loss speed of 155.41 km(2) per year (R-2 = 0.86). (2) The surface water areas of permanent and dynamic types were 1529.02 km(2) and 2064.99 km(2) during 2000-2020, accounting for 42.54% and 57.46% of all water-related areas, respectively. (3) The surface water extent occupied by impervious land surfaces showed a significant linear downward trend (R-2 = 0.98, slope = 36.41 km(2) per year), while the surface water restored from impervious land surfaces denoted a slight growing trend (R-2 = 0.86, slope = 0.99 km(2) per year). Our study monitored the long-term changes in the surface water of the GBA, which can provide valuable information for the sustainable development of the GBA urban agglomeration. In addition, the proposed framework can easily be implemented in other similar regions worldwide.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion Modelling Using STARFM: Examples of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 NDVI in Bavaria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability and variety of global satellite products provide a new level of data with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions; however, identifying the most suited resolution for a specific application consumes increasingly more time and computation effort. The region's cloud coverage additionally influences the choice of the best trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution, and different pixel sizes of remote sensing (RS) data may hinder the accurate monitoring of different land cover (LC) classes such as agriculture, forest, grassland, water, urban, and natural-seminatural. To investigate the importance of RS data for these LC classes, the present study fuses NDVIs of two high spatial resolution data (high pair) (Landsat (30 m, 16 days; L) and Sentinel-2 (10 m, 5-6 days; S), with four low spatial resolution data (low pair) (MOD13Q1 (250 m, 16 days), MCD43A4 (500 m, one day), MOD09GQ (250 m, one-day), and MOD09Q1 (250 m, eight day)) using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), which fills regions' cloud or shadow gaps without losing spatial information. These eight synthetic NDVI STARFM products (2: high pair multiply 4: low pair) offer a spatial resolution of 10 or 30 m and temporal resolution of 1, 8, or 16 days for the entire state of Bavaria (Germany) in 2019. Due to their higher revisit frequency and more cloud and shadow-free scenes (S = 13, L = 9), Sentinel-2 (overall R-2 = 0.71, and RMSE = 0.11) synthetic NDVI products provide more accurate results than Landsat (overall R-2 = 0.61, and RMSE = 0.13). Likewise, for the agriculture class, synthetic products obtained using Sentinel-2 resulted in higher accuracy than Landsat except for L-MOD13Q1 (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.11), resulting in similar accuracy preciseness as S-MOD13Q1 (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.13). Similarly, comparing L-MOD13Q1 (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 0.05) and S-MOD13Q1 (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 0.09) for the forest class, the former resulted in higher accuracy and precision than the latter. Conclusively, both L-MOD13Q1 and S-MOD13Q1 are suitable for agricultural and forest monitoring; however, the spatial resolution of 30 m and low storage capacity makes L-MOD13Q1 more prominent and faster than that of S-MOD13Q1 with the 10-m spatial resolution.

TI  - Extension of the Hapke model to the spectral domain to characterize soil physical properties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hapke bidirectional reflectance model has mainly been used in planetary remote sensing and has given rise to some studies in Earth science. However, it has not yet been comprehensively evaluated using data from different sources, and its ability to model reflectance spectra needs to be further explored. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a tangible parametric model of soil hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance via the evaluation and extension of the Hapke model (hereafter named the Hapke-HSR model). Comprehensive directional and spectral soil reflectance datasets, including satellite, field data, two spectral libraries, and simulated reflectance spectra, were used. First, the two widely used versions of the Hapke model, namely, the SOILSPECT and original Hapke models, were compared. Thereafter, the simplified SOILSPECT model was extended to characterize soil hyperspectral reflectance by deriving an approximate relationship between the single-scattering albedo and wavelength. We obtained the following results. (1) Both versions of the Hapke model agreed well in fitting soil bidirectional reflectance data. However, the SOILSPECT model (R-2 = 0.983-0.997, RMSE = 0.007-0.014) performed better than the original Hapke model (R-2 = 0.800-0.988, RMSE = 0.014-0.057) when both satellite and field data were used. (2) The Hapke-HSR model could effectively capture the characteristics of the soil hyperspectral reflectance (R-2 = 0.963-0.983 and RMSE = 0.018-0.028) based on both spectral libraries. The simulated reflectance spectra showed that the Hapke-HSR model can capture the soil moisture content variations (R-2 = 0.987, RMSE = 0.011). In addition, the residual prediction deviation (RPD) values of the Hapke-HSR model were greater than 3, indicating a high prediction accuracy. These findings demonstrate that the Hapke-HSR model performs well with respect to the characterization of soil hyperspectral directional reflectance.

TI  - Phytoplankton Community Patterns in the Northeastern South China Sea: Implications of Intensified Kuroshio Intrusion During the 2015/16 El Nino
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kuroshio intrusion into the South China Sea (SCS) varies seasonally and interannually under different climatic conditions. To characterize the intensity of the climate-driven Kuroshio intrusion and its impact on the phytoplankton community in the northeastern South China Sea (NESCS), two cruises were conducted during the 2015/16 El Nino event. In situ observations and remote sensing data showed that the Kuroshio strongly intruded into the SCS in both summer and winter. The summer phytoplankton community was dominated by cyanobacteria (Trichodesmium erythraeum), associated with high surface temperature, shallower mixed layer depth, and low nutrient concentrations. The winter phytoplankton community was mainly dominated by cosmopolitan diatoms (Thalassiosira diporocyclus, Thalassionema nitzschioides, and Chaetoceros socialis), associated with low surface temperature, deeper mixed layers, and relatively higher nutrient concentrations. Meanwhile, the elevated abundance of T. erythraeum coupled well with the Kuroshio intrusion index during the El Nino summer. The phytoplankton network was unstable in summer but not in winter, induced by the Kuroshio intrusion. Our findings show that intensified Kuroshio intrusion during the El Nino event was a vital driving force for reshaping phytoplankton community dynamics of the NESCS through lateral advection and affecting temperature, mixed layer depth, and nutrient supply.Plain Language Summary In this study, we report the impacts of intensified Kuroshio intrusion on the phytoplankton community of the northeastern South China Sea during the 2015/16 El Nino event. We investigate the intensity of the climate-driven Kuroshio intrusion and its impact on the phytoplankton community. The phytoplankton community exhibited apparent seasonal variations, dominated by cyanobacteria and diatoms in summer and winter, respectively. The intensified Kuroshio intrusion contributed to higher abundance of cyanobacteria Trichodesmium erythraeum during the El Nino summer. In addition, Kuroshio intrusion significantly reduced phytoplankton network stability in summer but not in winter.

TI  - Tree Diversity and Tree Community Composition in Northern Part of Megacity Bengaluru, India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees are natural capital assets, especially for cities, as they provide immense environmental benefits and improve urban biodiversity and ecology. However, urbanization has largely destroyed the original native ecosystems and has caused a homogenization where frequently native species are replaced by non-native species. When attempting to understand the role of trees in urban settings, it is important to generate science-based data on the spatial distribution of trees, their species composition and tree species diversity as a function of the degree of urbanization. Such information may specifically inform the planning of effective long-term management of trees across urban and rural gradients. A total of 23 of 1 ha each were surveyed along a Northern research transect laid out along the urban-rural gradient of the metropolitan area of Bengaluru, India. Plots were randomly selected from the stratum "settlement areas", where WorldView-3 imagery supported both stratification and plot selection. The plots were fully mapped for trees, where a total of eleven variables had been observed for each tree. In addition, the basal area and wood volume was calculated to understand the biomass potential of the trees in the plots. The diversity indices such as the Shannon index, Simpson index, Pielou's evenness and Margalef's richness were considered for comparing the species diversity, composition and distribution along the gradient of Bengaluru. A total of 1128 individuals of 93 tree species were recorded. Among 92 species identified along the northern gradient, 53 are exotic, and 39 are native species. The Shannon-Wiener index varied from 1.33 to 2.72; Simpson's index varied from 0.65 to 0.90; Pielou's index varied from 0.66 to 0.90, and Margalef's index ranged from 1.41 to 5.20 along the gradient. The basal area increased from 96.39 m(2) to 102.76 m(2) from 2017 to 2019 along the transect, with a net gain of 6.37 m(2). Similarly, the wood volume increased from 1819.57 m(3) to 1926.23 m(3) with a net gain of 106.66 m(3). The present study reports on tree distribution, species composition and tree species diversity along a gradient from the city center to the rural surroundings of northern parts of Bengaluru city. The information generated may support the city planners/administrators by providing a holistic understanding of the species composition and abundance for a further selection of adaptive species and appropriate tree and vegetation management practices to conserve the existing green spaces and contribute towards sustainable urban planning. The sample plots laid out may also serve as permanent observation plots for monitoring the dynamics of tree cover in the city.

TI  - 6+: A Novel Approach for Building Extraction from a Medium Resolution Multi-Spectral Satellite
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For smart, sustainable cities and urban planning, building extraction through satellite images becomes a crucial activity. It is challenging in the medium spatial resolution. This work proposes a novel methodology named '6+' for improving building extraction in 10 m medium spatial resolution multispectral satellite images. Data resources used are Sentinel-2A satellite images and OpenStreetMap (OSM). The proposed methodology merges the available high-resolution bands, super-resolved Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) bands, and an Enhanced Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (ENDISI) built-up index-based image to produce enhanced multispectral satellite images that contain additional information on impervious surfaces for improving building extraction results. The proposed methodology produces a novel building extraction dataset named '6+'. Another dataset named '6 band' is also prepared for comparison by merging super-resolved bands 11 and 12 along with all the highest spatial resolution bands. The building ground truths are prepared using OSM shapefiles. The models specific for extracting buildings, i.e., BRRNet, JointNet, SegUnet, Dilated-ResUnet, and other Unet based encoder-decoder models with a backbone of various state-of-art image segmentation algorithms, are applied on both datasets. The comparative analyses of all models applied to the '6+' dataset achieve a better performance in terms of F1-Score and Intersection over Union (IoU) than the '6 band' dataset.

TI  - Cerebral Protection in TAVR-Can We Do Without? A Real-World All-Comer Intention-to-Treat Study-Impact on Stroke Rate, Length of Hospital Stay, and Twelve-Month Mortality
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stroke associated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a potentially devastating complication. Until recently, the Sentinel (TM) Cerebral Protection System (CPS; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) has been the only commercially available device for mechanical prevention of TAVR-related stroke. However, its effectiveness is still undetermined. Objectives: To explore the impact of Sentinel (TM) on stroke rate, length of hospital stay (LOS), and twelve-month mortality in a single-center, real-world, all-comers TAVR cohort. Material and Methods: Between January 2019 and August 2020 consecutive patients were assigned to TAVR with or without Sentinel (TM) in a 1:1 fashion according to the treating operator. We defined as primary endpoint clinically detectable cerebrovascular events within 72 h after TAVR and as secondary endpoints LOS and 12-month mortality. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to assess associations of Sentinel (TM) use with endpoints. Results: Of 411 patients (80 & PLUSMN; 7 y/o, 47.4% female, EuroSCORE II 6.3 & PLUSMN; 5.9%), Sentinel (TM) was used in 213 (51.8%), with both filters correctly deployed in 189 (46.0%). Twenty (4.9%) cerebrovascular events were recorded, ten (2.4%) of which were disabling strokes. Patients with Sentinel (TM) suffered 71% less (univariate analysis; OR 0.29, 95%CI 0.11-0.82; p = 0.02) and, respectively, 76% less (multivariate analysis; OR 0.24, 95%CI 0.08-0.76; p = 0.02) cerebrovascular events compared to patients without Sentinel (TM). Sentinel (TM) use was also significantly associated with shorter LOS (Regression coefficient -2.47, 95%CI -4.08, -0.87; p < 0.01) and lower 12-month all-cause mortality (OR 0.45; 95%CI 0.22-0.93; p = 0.03). Conclusion: In the present prospective all-comers TAVR cohort, patients with Sentinel (TM) use showed (1) lower rates of cerebrovascular events, (2) shortened LOS, and (3) improved 12-month survival. These data promote the use of a CPS when implanting TAVR valves.

TI  - Spatial Stratification Method for the Sampling Design of LULC Classification Accuracy Assessment: A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial sampling design is important for accurately assessing land use and land cover (LULC) classification results from remote sensing data. Spatial stratification can dramatically improve spatial sampling efficiency by dividing the study area into several strata when classification correctness is spatially stratified heterogeneous. By integrating the LULC classification results from different sources and spatial resolutions, a spatial stratification method for spatial sampling of accuracy assessment is presented in this paper. Its efficiency is demonstrated in the case study using LULC data of Beijing, China, in the following steps. First, we standardized and reclassified multiresolution remote sensing data, including China's land use/cover datasets (CLUDs) from 2017 (resolution: 30 m), 500 m MCD12Q1, and 10 m FROM-GLC10 data, into six classes. Second, we customized stratification rules, formulated a technical specification to realize 11 strata using CLUDs and MCD12Q1, and employed FROM-GLC10 as the reference data for accuracy assessment. Furthermore, six sample sets with sizes of 16,417; 1821; 652; 337; 198; and 142 were drawn using different methods, and their overall accuracy (OA), deviation accuracy (DA), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and standard deviation (STDEV) values were also evaluated to demonstrate the efficiency brought by spatial stratification. Compared with the spatial even sampling method, the OAs of the stratified even sampling method adopting the proposed stratification method was much closer to the true OA, and the corresponding RMSE and STDEV results decreased from 2.097% and 2.127% to 0.914% and 0.713%, respectively, due to the contribution of spatial stratification in the sampling scheme. The method can be used to distinguish the differences and improve the representativeness of samples, and it can be employed to select validation samples for LULC classification.

TI  - Identifying Precarious Settlements and Urban Fabric Typologies Based on GEOBIA and Data Mining in Brazilian Amazon Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although 70% of the Amazon population lives in urban areas, studies on the urban Amazon are scarce. Much of the urban Amazon population lives in precarious settlements. The distinctiveness and diversity of Amazonian precarious settlements are vast and must be identified to be considered in the development of appropriate public policies. Aiming at investigating precarious settlements in Amazon, this study is guided by the following questions: For the Brazilian Amazon region, is it possible to identify areas of precarious settlements by combining geoprocessing and remote sensing techniques? Are there different typologies of precarious settlements distinguishable by their spatial arrangements? Thus, we developed a methodology for identifying precarious settlements and subsequently classifying them into urban fabric typologies (UFT), choosing the cities of Altamira, Cameta, and Maraba as study sites. Our classification model utilized geographic objects-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and data mining of spectral data from WPM sensor images from the CBERS-4A satellite, jointly with texture metrics, context metrics, biophysical index, voluntary geographical information, and neighborhood relationships. With the C5.0 decision tree algorithm we carried out variable selection and classification of these geographic objects. Our estimated models show accuracy above 90% when applied to the study sites. Additionally, we described Amazonian UFT in six types to be identified. We concluded that Amazonian precarious settlements are morphologically diverse, with an urban fabric different from those commonly found in Brazilian metropolitan areas. Identifying and characterizing distinct precarious areas is vital for the planning and development of sustainable and effective public policies for the urban Amazon.

TI  - Assessing the Wall-to-Wall Spatial and Qualitative Dynamics of the Brazilian Pasturelands 2010-2018, Based on the Analysis of the Landsat Data Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian livestock is predominantly extensive, with approximately 90% of the production being sustained on pasture, which occupies around 20% of the territory. It is estimated that more than half of Brazilian pastures have some level of degradation. In this study, we mapped and evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of pasture quality in Brazil, between 2010 and 2018, considering three classes of degradation: Absent (D0), Intermediate (D1), and Severe (D2). There was no variation in the total area occupied by pastures in the evaluated period, in spite of the accentuated spatial dynamics. The percentage of non-degraded pastures increased by ~12%, due to the recovery of degraded areas and the emergence of new pasture areas. However, about 44 Mha of the pasture area is currently severely degraded. The dynamics in pasture quality were not homogeneous in property size classes. We observed that in the approximately 2.68 million properties with livestock activity, the proportion with quality gains was twice as low in small properties compared with large ones, and the proportion with losses was three times greater, showing an increase in inequality between properties with more and fewer resources (large and small properties, respectively). The areas occupied by pastures in Brazil present a unique opportunity to increase livestock production and make areas available for agriculture, without the need for new deforestation in the coming decades.

TI  - A Machine Learning approach to reconstruct cloudy affected vegetation indices imagery via data fusion from Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - A way to reconstruct optical sensor-derived images allowing cloud-free vegetation monitoring is proposed in this paper. The motivation is the influence that clouds have on optical remote sensing of tropical regions, which hinders Earth observation systems because their presence reduces imaging frequency. To circumvent that problem, a machine learning model-based integration methodology for the fusion of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 data is proposed herein. Sentinel-1 constellation has mounted Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are used because the imaging is not affected by clouds due to microwave spectrum characteristics. To study the problem and predict both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), three algorithms were selected: multivariate linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and random forest (RF). Two testing strategies were also chosen: k-Fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning of the model and holdout testing to assess the generalization ability of the model. The SAR covariables were employed to feed the algorithms, including selected SAR vegetation indices; in addition, environmental data, such as land use and land cover (LULC), the date, and position of the samples were used. The predictions from the NDVI and EVI produced good results, namely, similar Willmott's agreement index (d) values that ranged from similar to 0.64 to 0.96. The best-fitted model was the RF, which was used to reconstruct the NDVI images and produced good results that agreed well with the predictions (d index from 0.58 to 0.87) and spatial patterns. The results obtained show that the integration of radar and environmental covariables with optical vegetation indices can allow vegetation monitoring that is free of gaps due to clouds.

TI  - WaCoDiS: Automated Earth Observation data processing within an event-driven architecture for water monitoring
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate changes and the ongoing intensification of agriculture effect in increased material inputs in watercourses and dams. To ensure an efficient and environmentally friendly water resource management, water management associations need means for efficient water monitoring as well as novel strategies to reduce the pollution of surface and ground water. Traditionally, water management associations operate large sensor networks to suffice their needs for hydrological and meteorological measurement data to monitor and model physical processes within the catchments they are responsible for. Implementing a comprehensive monitoring system often suffers from sparse coverage of in-situ data. Due to the evolvement of the Copernicus satellite platforms, the broader availability of satellite data provides a great potential for deriving valuable, complementary information from Earth Observation data, that contributes to a detailed understanding of hydrological processes. Although the number of satellite data platforms that provide online processing environments is growing, it is still a big challenge to integrate those platforms into traditional workflows of users from environmental domains such as hydrology. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the generation of Earth Observation information targeted towards hydrology. The presented WaCoDiS System comprises several microservices as well standardized interfaces that enable a platform-independent processing of satellite data. First, we discuss the contribution of Earth Observation data to water monitoring and derive several challenges regarding the facilitation of satellite data processing. We then describe our system design with a brief overview about the different system components which form an automated processing pipeline. The suitability of our system is proven as part of a pre-operational deployment for a German water management association. In addition, we demonstrate how our system is capable of integrating satellite data platforms, using the Copernicus Data and Exploitation Platform -Deutschland (CODE-DE) as a reference example.

TI  - A Novel Object Detection Model Based on Faster R-CNN for <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> According to Feeding Trace of Corn Leaves
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional method for crop insect detection based on visual judgment of the field is time-consuming, laborious, subjective, and error prone. The early detection and accurate localization of agricultural insect pests can significantly improve the effectiveness of pest control as well as reduce the costs, which has become an urgent demand for crop production. Maize Spodoptera frugiperda is a migratory agricultural pest that has severely decreased the yield of maize, rice, and other kinds of crops worldwide. To monitor the occurrences of maize Spodoptera frugiperda in a timely manner, an end-to-end Spodoptera frugiperda detection model termed the Pest Region-CNN (Pest R-CNN) was proposed based on the Faster Region-CNN (Faster R-CNN) model. Pest R-CNN was carried out according to the feeding traces of maize leaves by Spodoptera frugiperda. The proposed model was trained and validated using high-spatial-resolution red-green-blue (RGB) ortho-images acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). On the basis of the severity of feeding, the degree of Spodoptera frugiperda invasion severity was classified into the four classes of juvenile, minor, moderate, and severe. The degree of severity and specific feed location of S. frugiperda infestation can be determined and depicted in the frame forms using the proposed model. A mean average precision (mAP) of 43.6% was achieved by the proposed model on the test dataset, showing the great potential of deep learning object detection in pest monitoring. Compared with the Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5 model, the detection accuracy of the proposed model increased by 12% and 19%, respectively. Further ablation studies showed the effectives of channel and spatial attention, group convolution, deformable convolution, and the multi-scale aggregation strategy in the aspect of improving the accuracy of detection. The design methods of the object detection architecture could provide reference for other research. This is the first step in applying deep-learning object detection to S. frugiperda feeding trace, enabling the application of high-spatial-resolution RGB images obtained by UAVs to S. frugiperda-infested object detection. The proposed model will be beneficial with respect to S. frugiperda pest stress monitoring to realize precision pest control.

TI  - Long-Term Temporal and Spatial Monitoring of Cladophora Blooms in Qinghai Lake Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With climate warming and intensification of human activities, the eco-environmental problems of lakes in middle and high latitudes become increasingly prominent. Qinghai Lake, located in the northeastern of the Tibetan Plateau, is the largest inland saltwater lake in China. Recently, the problem of Cladophora blooms has been widely concerning. In this study, the area of floating Cladophora blooms (hereafter FCBs) in Qinghai Lake from 1986 to 2021 was extracted using Floating Algal Index (FAI) method based on Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images, and then the intra- and inter-annual variation characteristics and spatial patterns of FCBs were analyzed. The results show that the general change trend of FCBs in Qinghai Lake featured starting in May, expanding rapidly from June to August, and increasing steadily from September to October. From 1986 to 2021, the area of FCBs in Qinghai Lake showed an overall increasing trend in all months, with the largest increase in July at 0.1 km(2)/a, followed by October at 0.096 km(2)/a. Spatially speaking, the FCBs area showed a significant increasing trend in the northern Buha River estuary (BRN) and southern Buha River estuary (BRS) regions, a slight increase in the Shaliu River estuary (SR) region, and a decreasing trend in the Quanji River estuary (QR) region and the Heima River estuary (HR) region. The correlation between the meteorological factors and the changes in FCBs was weak, but the increase in flooded pastures in the BRN region (Bird Island) due to rising water levels was definitely responsible for the large-scale increase in FCBs in this region. However, the QB, northeastern bay of Shaliu River estuary (SRB) and HR regions, which also have extensive inundated grassland, did not have the same increase in FCBs area, suggesting that the growth of Cladophora is caused by multiple factors. The complex relationships need to be verified by further research. The current control measures have a certain inhibitory effect on the Cladophora bloom in Qinghai Lake because the FCBs area was significantly smaller in 2017-2020 (5.22 km(2), 3.32 km(2), 4.55 km(2) and 2.49 km(2)), when salvage work was performed, than in 2016 and 2021 (8.67 km(2) and 9.14 km(2)), when no salvage work was performed.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Data and Unmanned Aerial System Products to Support Crop and Bare Soil Monitoring: Methodology Based on a Statistical Comparison between Remote Sensing Data with Identical Spectral Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing need for sustainable management approaches of crops and bare soils requires measurements at a multiple scale (space and time) field system level, which have become increasingly accurate. In this context, proximal and satellite remote sensing data cooperation seems good practice for the present and future. The primary purpose of this work is the development of a sound protocol based on a statistical comparison between Copernicus Sentinel-2 MIS satellite data and a multispectral sensor mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), featuring spectral deployment identical to Sentinel-2. The experimental dataset, based on simultaneously acquired proximal and Sentinel-2 data, concerns an agricultural field in Pisa (Tuscany), cultivated with corn. To understand how the two systems, comparable but quite different in terms of spatial resolution and atmosphere impacts, can effectively cooperate to create a value-added product, statistical tests were applied on bands and the derived Vegetation and Soil index. Overall, as expected, due to the mentioned impacts, the outcomes show a heterogeneous behavior with a difference between the coincident bands as well for the derived indices, modulated in the same manner by the phenological status (e.g., during the canopy developments) or by vegetation absence. Instead, similar behavior between two sensors occurred during the maturity phase of crop plants.

TI  - Can Forest Fires Be an Important Factor in the Reduction in Solar Power Production in India?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wildfires over the central Indian Himalayan region have attracted the significant attention of environmental scientists. Despite their major and disastrous effects on the environment and air quality, studies on the forest fires' impacts from a renewable energy point of view are lacking for this region. Therefore, for the first time, we examine the impact of massive forest fires on the reduction in solar energy production over the Indian subcontinent via remote sensing techniques. For this purpose, we used data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO), the Satellite Application Facility on support to Nowcasting/Very Short-Range Forecasting Meteosat Second Generation (SAFNWC/MSG) in conjunction with radiative transfer model (RTM) simulation, in addition to 1-day aerosol forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). The energy production during the first quarter of 2021 was found to reach 650 kWh/m(2) and the revenue generated was about INR (Indian rupee) 79.5 million. During the study period, the total attenuation due to aerosols and clouds was estimated to be 116 and 63 kWh/m(2) for global and beam horizontal irradiance (GHI and BHI), respectively. The financial loss due to the presence of aerosols was found to be INR 8 million, with the corresponding loss due to clouds reaching INR 14 million for the total Indian solar plant's capacity potential (40 GW). This analysis of daily energy and financial losses can help the grid operators in planning and scheduling power generation and supply during the period of fires. The findings of the present study will drastically increase the awareness among the decision makers in India about the indirect effects of forest fires on renewable energy production, and help promote the reduction in carbon emissions and greenhouse gases in the air, along with the increase in mitigation processes and policies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the fusion of optical and synthetic aperture radar images with wavelet transform was investigated. Images are obtained from Sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 satellites. Images were decomposed by wavelet transform. The four main coefficients were obtained for different wavelet packages and up to ten decomposition levels. The coefficients were combined taking the maximum, minimum or mean. 1710 Fused images were obtained for all possible combinations in terms of different wavelet packets, decomposition levels and fusion rules. Fused images were evaluated according to the structural similarity index (SSI). It was seen that the missing regions in the optical images were improved in the fused images with the appropriate wavelet packets and highest SSI.

TI  - Wildfire Dynamics along a North-Central Siberian Latitudinal Transect Assessed Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of wildfires along a latitudinal transect from forest-tundra to middle taiga in North-Central Siberia was reconstructed for the period from 1985 to 2020 using Landsat imagery. The transect passed through four key regions (75 x 75 km(2)) with different climate and landscape conditions that allowed us to evaluate regional wildfire dynamics as well as estimate differences in post-fire forest recovery. The Level-2A Landsat data (TM, ETM+, and OLI) were used to derive: (i) burned area (BA) locations, (ii) timing of wildfire occurrence (date, month, or season), (iii) fire severity, and (iv) trends in post-fire vegetation recovery. We used pre-selected and pre-processed scenes suitable for BA mapping taken within four consecutive time intervals covering the entire period of data analysis (1985-2020). Pre- and post-fire dynamics of forest vegetation were described using spectral indices, i.e., NBR and NDVI. We found that during the last three decades, the maximum BA occurred in the southernmost Vanavara region where approximate to 58% of the area burned. Total BA gradually decreased to the northwest with a minimum in the Igarka region (approximate to 1%). Nearly half of these BAs appeared between summer 2013 and autumn 2020 due to higher frequency of hot and dry weather. The most severe wildfires were detected in the most northeastern Tura region. Analysis of NDVI and NBR dynamics showed that the mean period of post-fire vegetation recovery ranged between 20 and 25 years. The time of vegetation recovery at BAs with repeat wildfires and high severity was significantly longer.

TI  - Challenging and Confronting: The Role of Humanities in Fostering Critical Thinking, Cultural Competency and an Evolution of Worldview in Enabling Education
T2  - STUDENT SUCCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Humanities discourse forms part of several Australian academic enabling programs, either embedded within the broader curriculum. or as part of a standalone unit. Within Edith Cowan University's UniPrep course. an introductory Humanities unit is offered to students as one of two electives alongside three other core units. The unit introduces students to key concepts within the Humanities, exploring disciplines such as ethics, philosophy, language, history, religion, politics, law, Indigenous studies and fine arts. In addition to offering students an understanding of these disciplines, studying Humanities within the context of an academic enabling program can provide students with several other benefits. Feedback from students enrolled in the UniPrep Humanities unit indicates that students experience an increased level of cultural competency, an evolution of worldview, and an enhanced level of critical thinking upon completion of the unit. Importantly, these areas align with research conducted into broader academic enabling principles. This article will explore these connections to suggest that the inclusion of Humanities within an academic enabling program can enhance students' preparedness for undergraduate study and life beyond university on several levels.

TI  - A Comparison of the Effects of Several Foliar Forms of Magnesium Fertilization on 'Superior Seedless' (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.) in Saline Soils
T2  - COATINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnesium (Mg) is the most essential element constituent in chlorophyll molecules that regulates photosynthesis processes. The physiological response of 'Superior Seedless' grapes was evaluated under different foliar magnesium fertilization such as sulfate magnesium (MgSO4 center dot 7 H2O), magnesium disodium EDTA (Mg-EDTA), and magnesium nanoparticles (Mg-NPs) during the berry development stages (flowering, fruit set, veraison, and harvest). In general, the 'Superior Seedless' vine had a higher performance in photosynthesis with Mg-NPs application than other forms. The Fy/Fm ratio declined rapidly after the fruit set stage; then, it decreased gradually up until the harvesting stage. However, both MgSO4 and Mg-EDTA forms showed slight differences in Fv/Fm ratio during the berry development stages. The outcomes of this research suggest that the Fv/Fm ratio during the growth season of the 'Superior Seedless' vine may be a good tool to assess magnesium fertilization effects before visible deficiency symptoms appear. Mg-NPs are more effective at improving 'Superior Seedless' berry development than the other magnesium forms. These findings suggest that applying foliar Mg-NPs to vines grown on salinity-sandy soil alleviates the potential Mg deficiency in 'Superior Seedless' vines and improves bunches quality.

TI  - Environmental and human risk assessment of heavy metals at northern Nile Delta region using geostatistical analyses
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Present study aims to assess the possible toxic metal hazard of Pb, Cd and Fe in street dust and soil on environment and human health at the northern Deltaic region of Egypt using spatial and statistical analyses. To achieve this aim, 13 different sites were sampled for street dust and soil to represent various residential, industrial and agricultural activities. Unsupervised classification of multispectral Landsat OLI image (March 2021) helped to identify the sampling sites. Heavy metals were evaluated using environmental and human health risk indices incorporated in a GIS environment through geostatistical techniques. Multivariate analyses were demonstrated for further interpretation including principle components analysis (PCA), Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and cluster analysis (CA). The average metal concentrations in street dust for Pb, Cd and Fe were 0.57, 0.07 and 435.92 mg/kg, however in soil were 0.61, 0.08 and 1098.30 mg/kg, respectively. The mean value of Cd and Pb in soil was higher than street dust while the reverse was reported for Fe. Spatial distribution maps showed that the high levels of metals in street dust were observed in the southern parts of the study area due to industrial activities and automobile emissions. The risk assessment exhibited that the area suffers from serious metals pollution particularly Cd. Human risk assessment indicated that derma is the main exposure route that harmfully affects the human health. Exposure to the pollutant through the three pathways is higher for Pb than Cd. The values of hazard quotient (HQ) followed the next trend; Fe > Pb > Cd. The measured cancer risk was negligible in the investigated area. Statistical analysis of PCA and CCA showed that industrial and agricultural activities contribute to the occurrence of heavy metals.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Detecting the environmental risk on the archaeological sites using satellite imagery in Basilicata Region, Italy
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods, along with coastal erosion, are among the most dangerous events that threaten heritage sites worldwide. Space agencies (e.g. NASA and ESA) create new platforms and applications that can help for providing the time in studying the changes occurring in the land use/land cover besides flood events such as the Google Earth Engine platform. This study aims to use the most up-to-date data, methods, and platforms in studying the changes in the land cover and its impacts on the archaeological sites of Metaponto and Policoro areas in Basilicata Region, southern Italy. In this study, the Sentinel-1 (C-band) and Landsat time-series data are used in detecting the effects of the weather and land cover changes on the heritage sites in Metaponto and Policoro regions on Ionian coastal, Italy. While, Landsat (MSS, TM, and ETM) data are downloaded from the USGS site, the Sentienl1 data are imported and analysed using the Google Earth Engine platform. As well, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) statically software through the End Point Rate (EPR) and the Linear Regression Rate (LRR) models are used for estimating shoreline rate of change over the long-time period. Also, the historical topo-graphic maps returning to 1941 are used to detect the ancient land cover of the study area. As well, the ArcMap 10.5 software is used in analysing the topographic maps and Optical Landsat data. The results of this study showed that the flooding events during 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, and the total period between 2014 and 2021 respectively covered areas by km2 based on the total space of the non-water area about 8.3, 1.7, 0.5, 0.6, and 39.17. Such results of this study can help decrease the risk around the heritage areas by detecting the most affected areas across the shoreline changes, and the previous flood events.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

AB  - In this article, the local spatial correlation of multiple remote sensing datasets, such as those from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and digital surface models (DSMs), are linked to machine learning (ML) regression algorithms for flash floodwater depth retrieval. Edge detection filters are applied to remote sensing images to extract features that are used as independent features by ML algorithms to estimate flood depths. Data of dependent variables were obtained from the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS 2D) simulation model, as applied to the New Cairo, Egypt, post-flash flood event from 24-26 April 2018. Gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest regression (RFR), linear regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), multilayer perceptron neural network regression (MLPR), k-nearest neighbors regression (KNR), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to estimate floodwater depths; their outputs were compared and evaluated for accuracy using the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The RMSE accuracy for all ML algorithms was 0.18-0.22 m for depths less than 1 m (96% of all test data), indicating that ML models are relatively portable and capable of computing floodwater depths using remote sensing data as an input.

TI  - An Integrated District Mapping Strategy for Loiasis to Enable Safe Mass Treatment for Onchocerciasis in Gabon
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of a WHO-recommended strategy for onchocerciasis treatment with ivermectin in hypo-endemic areas co-endemic with loiasis is an impediment to global onchocerciasis elimination. New loiasis diagnostics (LoaScope; Loa antibody rapid test) and risk prediction tools may enable safe mass treatment decisions in co-endemic areas. In 2017-2018, an integrated mapping strategy for onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis (LF), and loiasis, aimed at enabling safe ivermectin treatment decisions, was piloted in Gabon. Three ivermectin-naive departments suspected to be hypoendemic were selected and up to 100 adults per village across 30 villages in each of the three departments underwent testing for indicators of onchocerciasis, LF, and loiasis. An additional 67 communities in five adjoining departments were tested for loiasis to extend the prevalence and intensity predictions and possibly expand the boundaries of areas deemed safe for ivermectin treatment. Integrated testing in the three departments revealed within-department heterogeneity for all the three diseases, highlighting the value of a mapping approach that relies on cluster-based sampling rather than sentinel sites. These results suggest that safe mass treatment of onchocerciasis may be possible at the subdepartment level, even in departments where loiasis is present. Beyond valuable epidemiologic data, the study generated insight into the performance of various diagnostics and the feasibility of an integrated mapping approach utilizing new diagnostic and modeling tools. Further research should explore how programs can combine these diagnostic and risk prediction tools into a feasible programmatic strategy to enable safe treatment decisions where loiasis and onchocerciasis are co-endemic.

TI  - The personal is political and international: feminist contributions, intersectionality and International Relations
T2  - RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to describe and analyse international relations debates, focusing on the contributions that feminisms make to the field as one of the dissident currents and reflectivist approaches-especially in its postcolonial/decolonial formulations. The methodology used is qualitative, and a specific bibliography is reviewed in order to examine the current discussions in the discipline, the confrontations within feminisms in IR, as well as their contributions. Moreover, we will look at the revision that Latin American and Caribbean decolonial feminism has instigated, considering the importance of intersectionality for expanding disciplinary boundaries.The text is articulated around the following questions:What debates run through the contemporary disciplinary field? What do the approaches of feminisms, within this framework, question and propose? What methodologies and notions do they introduce in IR studies? Which contributions are made by Latin American and Caribbean feminism?Thus, specific methodological and epistemological issues illuminated by feminisms in IR, such as the body politics,the micropolitics approach, and the focus on everyday practices,are given particular consideration. Solomon & Steele (2016) affirm that it "is only now - with increasing shifts to the micro - that academic IR has begun to (re)discover the lives and people of global politics, and to breathe life back into a field that grand theory mostly neglected". Every life of any person around the world should be recognized; there is no international system or society without the actions and practices of ordinary people.In this regard, feminisms have been key introductions into the field of IR, along with poststructuralism and postcolonialism, which are regular research instruments in disciplines like anthropology or sociology. For instance, ethnographic studies or participant observation are techniques that support the turns and innovations mentioned above.This framework is fundamental to make gender differences visible from an intersectional perspective. Postcolonial/decolonial feminism concentrates their studies on that difference, especially considering its links with other inequalities and concrete oppressions: e.g. in relation to race, ethnicity, religion, class, and nationality.In Latin America and the Caribbean, this perspective takes on an added relevance, and gives rise in this text to the problematization of its entanglement with human rights;the relationship between women, work and racialization; inequalities and violence; together with their links with global neoliberalism.In this respect, the article gives a comprehensive account of the main issues tackled by feminisms in the region, such as women's positions during the colonization period, and the multiple forms of violence related to their role. For instance, there is the importance of state responsibility in femicides, and the internal colonization and the neglect of diversity in national (plurinational) societies. These are performed by academia and social movements, particularly so in Western (white) feminist perspectives.The text is divided into three sections. Firstly, the framework of current IR debates is established, the differences between feminisms in IR and their classifications are described, and the theoretical contributions that these approaches have made to the discipline through methodological instruments such as micropolitics, corporeality and the practices of everyday life are elaborated.In the words of Enloe (2007, p.100) "Feminism is a multidimensional yet coherent worldview. Feminism is an achieved mosaic of understandings, yet it is still unfolding. [...] feminism is a complex set of understandings about how power operates, how power is legitimized and how power is perpetuated". Regardless of which perspective within feminism is being highlighted, some fundamental common issues will appear: neoliberalism and patriarchy are two of them, but also violence against women, gender identities and rights, exploitation, public and private spheres distinctions, etc.Then, the particularities of decolonial feminisms in Latin America and the Caribbean, along with their intersectional look at the field, are discussed: the question of subalternity, difference and neoliberalism, the concrete forms they acquire in the Global South and in the region. Moreover, the relevance of the link between neoliberalism and patriarchy is brought into consideration as a research topic shared by different feminist perspectives. In this respect, we name some authors form the region that propose feminist genealogic studies (Ciriza, 2015; Parra, 2021).As Marchand (2013, p.64) explains, the opportunities of a young middle-class woman with a university education are greater than those of a 65-year-old indigenous man with little formal education and a peasant life. While obviously not in a dominant position in society and the labour market, the young woman still has a privileged position with respect to the indigenous. These differences are invisible in the rational mainstream, and also in liberal-and some socialist or poststructuralist-feminisms. Some particular research is mentioned to show how the body politics, micropolitical approaches, and the practice turn are effectively used in IR studies, with innovative techniques oriented towards ethnographic studies and participated action. For instance, the examination of global women (and gender diversities), migration and mobility are illuminated by focusing in particular case: women from Guerrero in Texas (Munoz y Mendoza, 2018). Also, the incidences of sexual violence in the conflict in Guatemala is brought to light through the voices of the Maya women survivors and thanks to the research of Fulchiron (2016). This research emphasises the use of the femininized body as a war instrument.In addition, this paper mentions the contribution that Latin American and Caribbean feminisms have made to the field of human rights, especially through the participation in international organizations such as OAS and UN. (Barrancos, 2021; Chiarotti Boero, 2021)Considering all the above mentioned, we state that critical and intersectional feminisms allow us to think IR as a diverse field, with true planetary scope, and capable of recovering the importance of the well-being and daily lives of people. Finally, the conclusions are presented with possible relevant lines for future research (ecofeminism and the Latin American approaches to it). Dissident contributions in IR, in general, call into question the mainstream, giving rise in recent years to alternative, peripheral and silenced voices through postcolonial studies (decoloniality) and the feminisms, amongst others. These voices of difference generate discussion beyond hegemonic perspectives, producing key contributions for the continued interrogation of the discipline. These voices, for instance from Latin America and the Caribbean, draw on their own worldviews, along with traditional and popular knowledge. This assists in the promotion of new approaches and value situated, plural, intersectional and corporeized knowledges.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry from High and Medium-Resolution Sensors Using Empirical Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the accuracy of bathymetric maps generated from multispectral satellite datasets acquired from different multispectral sensors, namely the Worldview 2, PlanetScope, and the Sentinel 2, in the bay of Elounda in Crete. Image pre-processing steps were implemented before the use of the three empirical methods for estimating bathymetry. A dedicated correction and median filter have been applied to minimize noise from the sun glint and the sea waves. Due to the spectral complexity of the selected study area, statistical correlation with different numbers of bands was applied. The analysis indicated that blue and green bands obtained the best results with higher accuracy. Then, three empirical models, namely the Single Band Linear Algorithm, the Multiband Linear Algorithm, and the Ratio Transform Algorithm, were applied to the three multispectral images. Bathymetric and error distribution maps were created and used for the error assessment of results. The accuracy of the bathymetric maps estimated from different empirical models is compared with on-site Single beam Echo Sounder measurements. The most accurate bathymetric maps were obtained using the WorldView 2 and the empirical model of the Ratio Transform algorithm, with the RMSE reaching 1.01 m.

TI  - On the Misclassification of Dust as Cloud at an AERONET Site in the Sonoran Desert
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we present retrievals of aerosol optical depth tau from an Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station in the southeastern corner of California, an area where dust storms are frequent. By combining AERONET data with collocated ceilometer measurements, camera imagery, and satellite data, we show that during significant dust outbreaks the AERONET cloud-screening algorithm oftentimes classifies dusty measurements as cloud contaminated, thus removing them from the aerosol record. During dust storms we estimate that approximately 85% of all dusty retrievals of tau and more than 95% of retrievals when tau > 0.1 are rejected, resulting in a factor-of-2 reduction in dust-storm averaged tau. We document the specific components in the screening algorithm responsible for the misclassification. We find that a major reason for the loss of these dusty measurements is the high temporal variability in tau during the passage of dust storms over the site, which itself is related to the proximity of the site to the locations of emission. We describe a method to recover these dusty measurements that is based on collocated ceilometer measurements. These results suggest that AERONET sites that are located close to dust source regions may require ancillary measurements to aid in the identification of dust. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this study we demonstrate that, during dust storms, measurements made with a sun photometer at an AERONET site in the western Sonoran Desert are frequently classified as cloud contaminated by the network's processing algorithm. We identify the various algorithmic tests that result in the misclassification and discuss the physical reasons why dust typically fails those tests. We then present a method to restore these data that utilizes measurements from a collocated ceilometer. This work highlights the challenges, and one solution, to operating an AERONET site in a region that is close to the sources of airborne dust.

TI  - Extreme citizens science for climate justice: linking pixel to people for mapping gas flaring in Amazon rainforest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Ecuadorian Amazon-one of Earth's last high-biodiversity wilderness areas and home to uncontacted indigenous populations-50 years of widespread oil development is jeopardizing biodiversity and feeding environmental conflicts. In 2019, a campaign to eliminate oil-related gas flaring, led by Amazonian communities impacted by fossil fuel production, resulted in an injunction against the Ecuadoran Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources and the Ministry of Environment and Water. On 26 January 2021 the Court of Nueva Loja issued a historical order to ban gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The present citizen science project played an important role in this process, enabling the production of independent spatial information through participatory mapping with indigenous and farmer communities. Globally, lack of independent information about oil activities has led to the monitoring of gas flaring by satellite imagery, achieving remarkable results. However, apart from institutional and remotely sensed data, reliable spatial information on gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon is not available. Therefore, we adopted the community-based participatory action research approach to develop a participatory GIS process, aiming both to provide reliable data and to support social campaigns for environmental and climate justice. This work presents the first participatory mapping initiative of gas flaring at a regional scale, carried out completely through open source data and software. Having identified 295 previously unmapped gas flaring sites through participatory mapping, we highlight that the extent of gas flaring activities is well beyond the official data provided by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Nightfire annual datasets, which map only 24% and 33% of the sites, respectively. Seventy five of the detected sites were in the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve. Moreover, 39 of the identified sites were venting instead of flaring, a phenomenon never before documented in the Ecuadorian Amazon. This study demonstrates that, because official datasets and satellite imagery underestimate the extent of gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon, community-based mapping offers a promising alternative for producing trusted, community-based scientific data. This community-produced data can support campaigns for legal recognition of human rights and environmental justice in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Finally, this study shows how local environmental conflicts can foster policy transformations that promote climate justice.

TI  - Distribution pattern of potential fishing zones in the Bangka Strait waters: An application of the remote sensing technique
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Information regarding fishing grounds was needed to assist fishermen in their fishing activities. Information about the sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (SSCC) and sea surface temperature (SST) could be used as a reference to identify potential fishing zones (PFZ). The purpose of this study was to identify SST and SSCC data using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satel-lite imagery for determining the PFZ and analyzing their distribution pattern seasonally. The determina-tion of the PFZ point was carried out by overlaying the SSCC and SST data based on the results of image data processing. The results showed that the distribution pattern of PFZ points in the Bangka Strait waters was predominantly found in the Banyuasin waters. The distribution pattern of PFZ points in the dry sea -son (June-August) and transition season II (September-November) had the same pattern and tended to dominate the coastal areas of the waters. The distribution patterns in the wet season (December-February) and transition season I (March-May) spread throughout the Bangka Strait waters. The most PFZ points were found in transition season I (636 PFZ points), while the minor PFZ points were found in transition season II (219 PFZ points). Integrating the remote sensing and GIS technique with statistical validation tests were useful and became a simple method for identifying the PFZ distribution. However, validating the PFZ distributions using the catch data was required.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim This is an update of the interdisciplinary S3-guideline on the Diagnosis, Therapy and Follow-up of Cervical Cancer (AWMF Registry No. 032/033OL), published in March 2021. The work on the updated guideline was funded by German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe) as part of the German Guideline Program in Oncology. The guideline was coordinated by the German Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Gynakologie und Geburtshilfe, DGGG) and the Working Group on Gynecological Oncology (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie, AGO) of the German Cancer Society (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft, DKG).Method The process used to update the 2014 S3-guideline was based on an appraisal of the available evidence using the criteria of evidence- based medicine, adaptations of existing evidence-based national and international guidelines or - if evidence was lacking - on the consensus of the specialists involved in compiling the update. After an initial review of the current literature was carried out according to a prescribed algorithm, several areas were identified which, in contrast to the predecessor version from September 2014, required new recommendations or statements which would take account of more recently published literature and the recent appraisal of new evidence.Recommendations The short version of this guideline consists of recommendations and statements on palliative therapy and follow-up of patients with cervical cancer. The most important aspects included in this updated guideline are the new FIGO classification published in 2018, the radical open surgery approach used to treat cervical cancer up to FIGO stage IB1, and the use of the sentinel lymph node technique for tumors = 2 cm. Other changes include the use of PET-CT, new options in radiotherapy (e.g., intensity-modulated radiotherapy, image- guided adaptive brachytherapy), and drug therapies to treat recurrence or metastasis.

TI  - Cotton Classification Method at the County Scale Based on Multi-Features and Random Forest Feature Selection Algorithm and Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cotton maps are crucial for monitoring cotton growth and precision management. The paper proposed a county-scale cotton mapping method by using random forest (RF) feature selection algorithm and classifier based on selecting multi-features, including spectral, vegetation indices, and texture features. The contribution of texture features to cotton classification accuracy was also explored in addition to spectral features and vegetation index. In addition, the optimal classification time, feature importance, and the best classifier on the cotton extraction accuracy were evaluated. The results showed that the texture feature named the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is effective for improving classification accuracy, ranking second in contribution among all studied spectral, VI, and texture features. Among the three classifiers, the RF showed higher accuracy and better stability than support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The average overall accuracy (OA) of the classification combining multiple features was 93.36%, 7.33% higher than the average OA of the single-time spectrum, and 2.05% higher than the average OA of the multi-time spectrum. The classification accuracy after feature selection by RF can still reach 92.12%, showing high accuracy and efficiency. Combining multiple features and random forest methods may be a promising county-scale cotton classification method.

TI  - A Multiscale Normalization Method of a Mixed-Effects Model for Monitoring Forest Fires Using Multi-Sensor Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper points out the shortcomings of existing normalization methods, and proposes a brightness temperature inversion normalization method for multi-source remote sensing monitoring of forest fires. This method can satisfy both radiation normalization and observation angle normalization, and reduce the discrepancies in forest fire monitoring between multi-source sensors. The study was based on Himawari-8 data; the longitude, latitude, solar zenith angle, solar azimuth angle, emissivity, slope, aspect, elevation, and brightness temperature values were collected as modeling parameters. The mixed-effects brightness temperature inversion normalization (MEMN) model based on FY-4A and Himawari-8 satellite sensors is fitted by multiple stepwise regression and mixed-effects modeling methods. The results show that, when the model is tested by Himawari-8 data, the coefficient of determination (R-2) reaches 0.8418, and when it is tested by FY-4A data, R-2 reaches 0.8045. At the same time, through comparison and analysis, the accuracy of the MEMN method is higher than that of the random forest normalization method (RF) (R-2=0.7318), the pseudo-invariant feature method (PIF) (R-2=0.7264), and the automatic control scatter regression method (ASCR) (R-2=0.6841). The MEMN model can not only reduce the discrepancies in forest fire monitoring owing to different satellite sensors between FY-4A and Himawari-8, but also improve the accuracy and timeliness of forest fire monitoring.

TI  - Decadal Lake Volume Changes (2003-2020) and Driving Forces at a Global Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes play a key role in the global water cycle, providing essential water resources and ecosystem services for humans and wildlife. Quantifying long-term changes in lake volume at a global scale is therefore important to the sustainability of humanity and natural ecosystems. Yet, such an estimate is still unavailable because, unlike lake area, lake volume is three-dimensional, challenging to be estimated consistently across space and time. Here, taking advantage of recent advances in remote sensing technology, especially NASA's ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter launched in 2018, we generated monthly volume series from 2003 to 2020 for 9065 lakes worldwide with an area >= 10 km(2). We found that the total volume of the 9065 lakes increased by 597 km(3) (90% confidence interval 239-2618 km(3)). Validation against in situ measurements showed a correlation coefficient of 0.98, an RMSE (i.e., root mean square error) of 0.57 km(3) and a normalized RMSE of 2.6%. In addition, 6753 (74.5%) of the lakes showed an increasing trend in lake volume and were spatially clustered into nine hot spots, most of which are located in sparsely populated high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau; 2323 (25.5%) of the lakes showed a decreasing trend in lake volume and were clustered into six hot spots-most located in the world's arid/semi-arid regions where lakes are scarce, but population density is high. Our results uncovered, from a three-dimensional volumetric perspective, spatially uneven lake changes that aggravate the conflict between human demands and lake resources. The situation is likely to intensify given projected higher temperatures in glacier-covered regions and drier climates in arid/semi-arid areas. The 15 hot spots could serve as a blueprint for prioritizing future lake research and conservation efforts.

TI  - Forecasting vegetation indices from spatio-temporal remotely sensed data using deep learning-based approaches: A systematic literature review
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the last few years, Deep learning (DL) approaches have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques in many applications such as vegetation forecasting, sales forecast, weather conditions, crop yield prediction, landslides detection and even COVID-19 spread predictions. Several DL algorithms have been employed to facilitate vegetation forecasting research using Remotely Sensed (RS) data. Vegetation is an extremely important component of our global ecosystem and a necessary indicator of land cover dynamics and productivity. Vegetation phenology is influenced by lifecycle patterns, seasonality and weather conditions, leading to changes in their spectral reflectance. Various relevant information, such as vegetation indices (VIs), can be extracted from RS data for vegetation forecasting. Therefore, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is known as one of the most widely recognized indices for vegetation related studies. This paper reviews the related works on DL-based spatio-temporal vegetation forecasting using RS data over the period between 2015 and 2021. In this review, we present several DL-based studies and discuss DL algorithms and various sources of data that have been used in these studies. The purpose of this work is to highlight the open challenges such as spatio-temporal prediction issues, spatial and temporal non-stationarity, fusion data, hybrid approaches, deep transfer learning and large parameter requirements. We also attempt to figure out the future directions and limits of DL for vegetation forecasting.

TI  - The Impact of Surgical Practice on Oncological Outcomes in Robot-Assisted Radical Hysterectomy for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer, Spanish National Registry
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Minimal invasive surgery (MIS) has been associated with lower disease-free survival than open surgery among women who underwent radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer. However, the mechanisms by which MIS increases mortality in cervical cancer remain uncertain. We aimed to determine if surgical practice among centers using robotic surgery has an impact on oncological outcomes. We evaluated 215 women with early-stage cervical cancer (<= IB1 or IIA1, FIGO 2009) who underwent robot-assisted radical hysterectomy in five Spanish tertiary centers between 2009 and 2018. A higher surgical volume, higher participation in clinical trials, higher rate of MRI use for diagnosis, greater use of sentinel lymph node biopsies, and a favorable learning curve with low rates of early recurrences were observed for the centers with better oncological outcomes. These factors might have a significant impact on oncological outcomes in all surgical approaches. This study aimed to assess whether surgical practice had a significant impact on oncological outcomes among women who underwent robot-assisted radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer (<= IB1 or IIA1, FIGO 2009). The secondary objective was to audit the pre-surgical quality indicators (QI) proposed by the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO). The top 5 of 10 centers in Spain and Portugal were included in the analysis. The hospitals were divided into group A (n = 118) and group B (n = 97), with recurrence rates of 10%, respectively. After balancing both groups using the propensity score, the ORs for all events were higher and statistically significant for group B (recurrences OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.13-1.15, p-value = 0.001; death OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.18, p-value = 0.012; disease-specific mortality ORr = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04-1.19, p-value = 0.002). A higher surgical volume, higher participation in clinical trials, higher rate of MRI use for diagnosis, greater use of sentinel lymph node biopsies, and a favorable learning curve with low rates of early recurrences were observed among the centers with better oncological outcomes. These factors might have a significant impact on oncological outcomes not only after robot-assisted surgery, but also after laparoscopies and open surgeries in the treatment of cervical cancer.

M3  - Article
AB  - Western discourses around food (in)security and nutrition often focus on food access primarily through male driven efforts. In turn, the gendered dimension is missing. Yet Indigenous food systems cannot be fully understood without Indigenous women's worldview, challenges, and labour. Our critique points to the importance of centring Indigenous women's embodied knowledge systems in our food related research. Novelty: center dot Rematriating food research regenerates the complexities of kinship wellbeing, sustainable economies, and body sovereignty.

TI  - A Comparative Study about Vertical Accuracy of Four Freely Available Digital Elevation Models: A Case Study in the Balsas River Watershed, Brazil
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide important support to research since these data are freely available for almost all areas of the terrestrial surface. Thus, it is important to assess their accuracy for correct applicability regarding the correct use scale. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the vertical accuracy of ALOS PALSAR, GMTED2010, SRTM, and Topodata DEMs according to the Brazilian Cartographic Accuracy Standard through the official high accuracy network data of the Brazilian Geodetic System. This study also seeks to investigate whether the altimetric error is correlated with altitude and slope in the study area. Our results showed that the four assessed DEMs in this study demonstrated satisfactory accuracy to provide mappings in scales up to 1:100,000 because more than 90% of the extracted points presented altimetric errors of less than 25 m when compared with the reference points from the high accuracy network of the Brazilian Geodetic System. Regarding the altimetric error, we could not find a significant correlation with altitude or slope in the study area. In this sense, future DEMs assessments should be based on the investigation of other factors that may influence altimetric error.

TI  - Earth Observation for Phenological Metrics (EO4PM): Temporal Discriminant to Characterize Forest Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of vegetation phenology has great relevance in many fields since the importance of knowing timing and shifts in periodic plant life cycle events to face the consequences of global changes in issues such as crop production, forest management, ecosystem disturbances, and human health. The availability of high spatial resolution and dense revisit time satellite observations, such as Sentinel-2 satellites, allows high resolution phenological metrics to be estimated, able to provide key information from time series and to discriminate vegetation typologies. This paper presents an automated and transferable procedure that combines validated methodologies based on local curve fitting and local derivatives to exploit full satellite Earth observation time series to produce information about plant phenology. Multivariate statistical analysis is performed for the purpose of demonstrating the capacity of the generated smoothed vegetation curve, temporal statistics, and phenological metrics to serve as temporal discriminants to detect forest ecosystems processes responses to environmental gradients. The results show smoothed vegetation curve and temporal statistics able to highlight seasonal gradient and leaf type characteristics to discriminate forest types, with additional information about forest and leaf productivity provided by temporal statistics analysis. Furthermore, temporal, altitudinal, and latitudinal gradients are obtained from phenological metrics analysis, which also allows to associate temporal gradient with specific phenophases that support forest types distinction. This study highlights the importance of integrated data and methodologies to support the processes of vegetation recognition and monitoring activities.

TI  - Glacier Monitoring Based on Multi-Spectral and Multi-Temporal Satellite Data: A Case Study for Classification with Respect to Different Snow and Ice Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are frequently applied for the surveying of remote areas, where the use of conventional surveying techniques remains difficult and impracticable. In this paper, we focus on one of the remote glacier areas, namely the Tyndall Glacier area in the Southern Patagonian Icefield in Chile. Based on optical remote sensing data in the form of multi-spectral Sentinel-2 imagery, we analyze the extent of different snow and ice classes on the surface of the glacier by means of pixel-wise classification. Our study comprises three main steps: (1) Labeled Sentinel-2 compliant data are obtained from theoretical spectral reflectance curves, as there are no training data available for the investigated area; (2) Four different classification approaches are used and compared in their ability to identify the defined five snow and ice types, thereof two unsupervised approaches (k-means clustering and rule-based classification via snow and ice indices) and two supervised approaches (Linear Discriminant Analysis and Random Forest classifier); (3) We first focus on the pixel-wise classification of Sentinel-2 imagery, and we then use the best-performing approach for a multi-temporal analysis of the Tyndall Glacier area. While the achieved classification results reveal that all of the used classification approaches are suitable for detecting different snow and ice classes on the glacier surface, the multi-temporal analysis clearly reveals the seasonal development of the glacier. The change of snow and ice types on the glacier surface is evident, especially between the end of ablation season (April) and the end of accumulation season (September) in Southern Chile.

TI  - Supervised Machine Learning Approaches on Multispectral Remote Sensing Data for a Combined Detection of Fire and Burned Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bushfires pose a severe risk, among others, to humans, wildlife, and infrastructures. Rapid detection of fires is crucial for fire-extinguishing activities and rescue missions. Besides, mapping burned areas also supports evacuation and accessibility to emergency facilities. In this study, we propose a generic approach for detecting fires and burned areas based on machine learning (ML) approaches and remote sensing data. While most studies investigated either the detection of fires or mapping burned areas, we addressed and evaluated, in particular, the combined detection on three selected case study regions. Multispectral Sentinel-2 images represent the input data for the supervised ML models. First, we generated the reference data for the three target classes, burned, unburned, and fire, since no reference data were available. Second, the three regional fire datasets were preprocessed and divided into training, validation, and test subsets according to a defined schema. Furthermore, an undersampling approach ensured the balancing of the datasets. Third, seven selected supervised classification approaches were used and evaluated, including tree-based models, a self-organizing map, an artificial neural network, and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). All selected ML approaches achieved satisfying classification results. Moreover, they performed a highly accurate fire detection, while separating burned and unburned areas was slightly more challenging. The 1D-CNN and extremely randomized tree were the best-performing models with an overall accuracy score of 98% on the test subsets. Even on an unknown test dataset, the 1D-CNN achieved high classification accuracies. This generalization is even more valuable for any use-case scenario, including the organization of fire-fighting activities or civil protection. The proposed combined detection could be extended and enhanced with crowdsourced data in further studies.

TI  - Mosquito population structure, pathogen surveillance and insecticide resistance monitoring in urban regions of Crete, Greece
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryThe island of Crete, is one of Greece's major tourist destinations, receiving over 5 million tourists annually, making control of vector borne diseases (VBD) like West Nile virus (WNV) both a public health and economic priority. A comprehensive surveillance network targeting mosquitoes and associated pathogens was established in Crete for the years 2018-2020. Important disease vectors (Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus and Anopheles superpictus) were recorded across the island. The presence of WNV antibodies in sentinel chickens was also recorded and, notably, preceded human WNV occurrence in the same region by approximately two weeks. Mutations associated with resistance to insecticides used for vector control were also detected; most importantly the chitin synthase mutation I1043F (associated with high diflubenzuron resistance) was recorded for the first time in Greece. The findings of our study are of major concern for VBD control in Greece (and Crete specifically), highlighting (i) the necessity for establishing seasonal surveillance programs and ii) the need for establishing appropriate insecticide resistance management programs for sustainable vector control.BackgroundIn Greece vector borne diseases (VBD) and foremost West Nile virus (WNV) pose an important threat to public health and the tourist industry, the primary sector of contribution to the national economy. The island of Crete, is one of Greece's major tourist destinations receiving annually over 5 million tourists making regional VBD control both a public health and economic priority.MethodologyUnder the auspices of the Region of Crete, a systematic integrative surveillance network targeting mosquitoes and associated pathogens was established in Crete for the years 2018-2020. Using conventional and molecular diagnostic tools we investigated the mosquito species composition and population dynamics, pathogen infection occurrences in vector populations and in sentinel chickens, and the insecticide resistance status of the major vector species.Principal findingsImportant disease vectors were recorded across the island including Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles superpictus. Over 75% of the sampled specimens were collected in the western prefectures potentially attributed to the local precipitation patterns, with Cx. pipiens being the most dominant species. Although no pathogens (flaviviruses) were detected in the analysed mosquito specimens, chicken blood serum analyses recorded a 1.7% WNV antibody detection rate in the 2018 samples. Notably detection of the first WNV positive chicken preceded human WNV occurrence in the same region by approximately two weeks. The chitin synthase mutation I1043F (associated with high diflubenzuron resistance) was recorded at an 8% allelic frequency in Lasithi prefecture Cx. pipiens mosquitoes (sampled in 2020) for the first time in Greece. Markedly, Cx. pipiens populations in all four prefectures were found harboring the kdr mutations L1014F/C/S (associated with pyrethroid resistance) at a close to fixation rate, with mutation L1014C being the most commonly found allele (>= 74% representation). Voltage gated sodium channel analyses in Ae. albopictus revealed the presence of the kdr mutations F1534C and I1532T (associated with putative mild pyrethroid resistance phenotypes) yet absence of V1016G. Allele F1534C was recorded in all prefectures (at an allelic frequency range of 25-46.6%) while I1532T was detected in populations from Chania, Rethymnon and Heraklion (at frequencies below 7.1%). Finally, no kdr were detected in the Anopheles specimens included in the analyses.Conclusions/SignificanceThe findings of our study are of major concern for VBD control in Crete, highlighting (i) the necessity for establishing seasonal integrated entomological/pathogen surveillance programs, supporting the design of targeted vector control responses and; ii) the need for establishing appropriate insecticide resistance management programs ensuring the efficacy and sustainable use of DFB and pyrethroid based products in vector control.

TI  - Space-Based Displacement Monitoring of Coastal Urban Areas: The Case of Limassol's Coastal Front
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last five years, the urban development of the city of Limassol has rapidly increased in the sectors of industry, trade, real estate, and many others. This exponentially increased urban development arises several concerns about the aggravation of potential land subsidence in the Limassol coastal front. Forty six Copernicus Sentinel-1 acquisitions from 2017 to 2021 have been processed and analyzed using the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS). A case study for the identification and analysis of the persistent scatterers (PS) in pixels in a series of interferograms and the quantity of the land displacements in the line of sight of the Limassol coastal front is presented in this research, with subsidence rates up to about (-5 to 4 mm/year). For the validation of the detected deformation, accurate groundbased geodetic measurements along the coastal area were used. Concordantly, considering that there is a significant number of skyscrapers planned or currently under construction, this study attempts a preliminary assessment of the impact these structures will pose on the coastal front of the area of Limassol.

TI  - An open science and open data approach for the statistically robust estimation of forest disturbance areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance monitoring is critical for understanding forest-related greenhouse gas emissions and for determining the role of forest management in mitigating climate change. Multiple algorithms for the automated mapping of forest disturbance using remotely sensed imagery have been developed and applied; however, variability in natural and anthropogenic disturbance phenomena, as well as image acquisition conditions, can result in maps that may be incomplete or that contain inaccuracies that prevent their use for directly estimating areas of disturbance. To reduce errors in reporting disturbance areas, stratified estimators can be applied to obtain statistically robust area estimates, while simultaneously circumventing the need to conduct a complete census or in situations where such a census may not be possible. We present a semi-automated procedure for implementation in Google Earth Engine, 3I3D-GEE, for regional to global mapping of forest disturbance (including clear-cut harvesting, fire, and wind damage) and sample-based estimation of related areas using data from the processing capacity of Google Earth Engine. Documentation for the application is also provided in Appendix A. Using Sentinel-2 (52) imagery, our procedure was applied and tested for 2018 in Italy for which the approximately 11 million ha of forests (mostly Q. pubescens, Q. robur, Q. cerris, Q. petraea, and Fagus sylvatica) serve as an appropriate case study because national statistics on forest disturbance areas are not available. To decrease the overall standard errors of the area estimates, the sampling intensities in areas where greater variability in the form of greater commission and omission errors are expected can be increased. To this end, we augmented the predicted forest disturbance map with a buffer class consisting of a two-pixel buffer (20 m) on each side of the disturbance class boundary. We selected a reference sample of 19,300 points: a simple random sample of 9,300 points from the buffer and simple random samples of 5000 from each of the undisturbed and disturbed classes. The reference sample was photointerpreted using fine resolution orthophotos (30 cm) and 52 imagery. While the estimate of the disturbed area obtained by adding the areas of pixels classified as disturbed was 41,732 ha, the estimate obtained using the unbiased stratified estimator was 27% greater at 57,717 +/- 716 ha. Regarding map accuracy, we found several omission errors in the buffer (53.4%) but none (0%) in the undisturbed map class. Similarly, among the 1035 commission errors, the majority (744) were in the buffer class. The methods presented herein provide a useful tool that can be used to estimate areas of forest disturbance, which many nations must report as part of their commitment to international conventions and treaties. In addition, the information generated can support forest management, enabling the forest sector to monitor stand-replacing forest harvesting over space and time.

TI  - Using long temporal reference units to assess the spatial accuracy of global satellite-derived burned area products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the growing availability of global satellite-derived burned area (BA) products has led to the development of methods and protocols to rigorously estimate their accuracy metrics. These protocols are based on design-based inference and provide unbiased estimators of various dimensions of accuracy. Current procedures consider the spatial and temporal dimension when obtaining the independent reference data used to assess accuracy, commonly based on the Landsat imagery archive as the basic source. The protocol in which the temporal dimension is addressed in the reference data impacts the accuracy metrics. For example, the 8-16-day sampling units usually recommended in Stage 3 BA validation protocols may result in confounding of spatial and temporal classification errors. However, both errors have different implications from a user's perspective, depending on whether the spatial detection or the temporal dating are relevant. While maintaining the fundamentals of current validation protocols, this study presents a new approach based on long temporal reference units (> 48 days) to diminish the influence of temporal reporting (i.e., dating errors) on the spatial accuracy estimates. This methodology is applied to estimate the accuracy of several global BA products for the period 2017-2019, including two European BA products, the FireCCI51 and C3SBA10, and NASA's standard BA product, the MCD64A1 collection 6 (MCD64C6). Global estimates showed similar performance for the three products; BA commission errors ranged from 17.2% +/- 1.1% for C3SBA10 to 19.4% +/- 1.1% for FireCCI51, and BA omission errors ranged from 43.1% +/- 1.9% for FireCCI51 to 49.3% +/- 2.2% for MCD64C6 (+/- values are one standard error). The total burned area was consistently underestimated in all products. These errors are much lower relative to those obtained in recent Stage 3 validation exercises based on short temporal reference units, which estimated global commission and omission errors greater than 40% and 70%, respectively. Thus, this study demonstrates that using long reference units provides a method to address the impact of BA product dating errors on estimates of spatial accuracy metrics, particularly for those products with lower temporal resolution or for areas with greater cloud coverage. Validation methods developed in this study may contribute to improving future protocols adopted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) subgroup.

TI  - Revisiting the Past: Replicability of a Historic Long-Term Vegetation Dynamics Assessment in the Era of Big Data Analytics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Open and analysis-ready data, as well as methodological and technical advancements have resulted in an unprecedented capability for observing the Earth's land surfaces. Over 10 years ago, Landsat time series analyses were inevitably limited to a few expensive images from carefully selected acquisition dates. Yet, such a static selection may have introduced uncertainties when spatial or inter-annual variability in seasonal vegetation growth were large. As seminal pre-open-data-era papers are still heavily cited, variations of their workflows are still widely used, too. Thus, here we quantitatively assessed the level of agreement between an approach using carefully selected images and a state-of-the-art analysis that uses all available images. We reproduced a representative case study from the year 2003 that for the first time used annual Landsat time series to assess long-term vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem in Crete, Greece. We replicated this assessment using all available data paired with a time series method based on land surface phenology metrics. Results differed fundamentally because the volatile timing of statically selected images relative to the phenological cycle introduced systematic uncertainty. We further applied lessons learned to arrive at a more nuanced and information-enriched vegetation dynamics description by decomposing vegetation cover into woody and herbaceous components, followed by a syndrome-based classification of change and trend parameters. This allowed for a more reliable interpretation of vegetation changes and even permitted us to disentangle certain land-use change processes with opposite trajectories in the vegetation components that were not observable when solely analyzing total vegetation cover. The long-term budget of net cover change revealed that vegetation cover of both components has increased at large and that this process was mainly driven by gradual processes. We conclude that study designs based on static image selection strategies should be critically evaluated in the light of current data availability, analytical capabilities, and with regards to the ecosystem under investigation. We recommend using all available data and taking advantage of phenology-based approaches that remove the selection bias and hence reduce uncertainties in results.

TI  - Aeromagnetic and Landsat-8 data interpretation for structural and hydrothermal alteration mapping along the Central and Southern Eastern Desert boundary, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-African basement rocks cover the study area along the boundary between Central and Southern Eastern Desert with small exposed sedimentary sequences. Several vein-type gold mineralization with hydrothermal alteration zones have long been known in the study area. Aeromagnetic and remote sensing imagery data were integrated for mapping the structural elements and hydrothermal alteration zones related to gold mineralization. By aeromagnetic imagery inspection, the structural complexity and porphyry intrusions density maps have been effectively constructed by applying Enhanced Center for Exploration Targeting (CET) techniques. Major NW shear zones along with NNW-SSE, WNW-ESE, NS, and NE-SW are the main trends controlling gold mineralization. On the other hand, applying band ratios and constrained energy minimization (CEM) technique on Landsat-8 data pointed out alteration minerals associated with the hydrothermal fluids. Calcite, sericite, and chlorite are the common alteration minerals detected, while goethite and epidote are less common in alteration zones of the area under study. A combination of CET structural complexity, circular features, and alteration zones produced a potential mineralization map pointing out numerous prospective zones for mineralizing gold. The predictive map was validated by projecting the known gold prospects at the study area, reflecting an agreement between the known gold occurrences and the higher classes of the predictive zone. The discussed techniques in the current research can be adopted as a direct indicator for structural mapping and detecting the alteration zones related to gold mineralization elsewhere.

TI  - Removal of Ionospheric Effects from Sigma Naught Images of the ALOS/PALSAR-2 Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of forest degradation in the Amazon through radar remote sensing methodologies has increased intensely in recent years. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors that operate in L-band have an interesting response for land use and land cover (LULC) as well as for aboveground biomass (AGB). Depending on the magnetic and solar activities and seasonality, plasma bubbles in the ionosphere appear in the equatorial and tropical regions; these factors can cause stripes across SAR images, which disturb the interpretation and the classification. Our article shows a methodology to filter these stripes using Fourier fast transform (FFT), in which a stop-band filter removes this noise. In order to make this possible, we used Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI), Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP), and Interactive Data Language (IDL). The final filtered scenes were classified by random forest (RF), and the results of this classification showed superior performance compared to the original scenes, showing this methodology can help to recover historic series of L-band images.

TI  - Mapping South America's Drylands through Remote Sensing-A Review of the Methodological Trends and Current Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scientific grasp of the distribution and dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in South America is still limited. This is especially true for the continent's hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid zones, collectively known as drylands, which are under-represented ecosystems that are highly threatened by climate change and human activity. Maps of LULC in drylands are, thus, essential in order to investigate their vulnerability to both natural and anthropogenic impacts. This paper comprehensively reviewed existing mapping initiatives of South America's drylands to discuss the main knowledge gaps, as well as central methodological trends and challenges, for advancing our understanding of LULC dynamics in these fragile ecosystems. Our review centered on five essential aspects of remote-sensing-based LULC mapping: scale, datasets, classification techniques, number of classes (legends), and validation protocols. The results indicated that the Landsat sensor dataset was the most frequently used, followed by AVHRR and MODIS, and no studies used recently available high-resolution satellite sensors. Machine learning algorithms emerged as a broadly employed methodology for land cover classification in South America. Still, such advancement in classification methods did not yet reflect in the upsurge of detailed mapping of dryland vegetation types and functional groups. Among the 23 mapping initiatives, the number of LULC classes in their respective legends varied from 6 to 39, with 1 to 14 classes representing drylands. Validation protocols included fieldwork and automatic processes with sampling strategies ranging from solely random to stratified approaches. Finally, we discussed the opportunities and challenges for advancing research on desertification, climate change, fire mapping, and the resilience of dryland populations. By and large, multi-level studies for dryland vegetation mapping are still lacking.

TI  - Enhancing the Accuracy and Temporal Transferability of Irrigated Cropping Field Classification Using Optical Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping irrigated areas using remotely sensed imagery has been widely applied to support agricultural water management; however, accuracy is often compromised by the in-field heterogeneity of and interannual variability in crop conditions. This paper addresses these key issues. Two classification methods were employed to map irrigated fields using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values derived from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8: a dynamic thresholding method (method one) and a random forest method (method two). To improve the representativeness of field-level NDVI aggregates, which are the key inputs in our methods, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based filtering approach was adopted to remove noncrop pixels (e.g., trees and bare soils) and mixed pixels along the field boundary. To improve the temporal transferability of method one we dynamically determined the threshold value to account for the impact of interannual weather variability based on the dynamic range of NDVI values. In method two an innovative training sample pool was designed for the random forest modeling to enable automatic calibration for each season, which contributes to consistent performance across years. The irrigated field mapping was applied to a major irrigation district in Australia from 2011 to 2018, for summer and winter cropping seasons separately. The results showed that using GMM-based filtering can markedly improve field-level data quality and avoid up to 1/3 of omission errors for irrigated fields. Method two showed superior performance, exhibiting consistent and good accuracy (kappa > 0.9) for both seasons. The classified maps in wet winter seasons should be used with caution, because rainfall alone can largely meet plant water requirements, leaving the contribution of irrigation to the surface spectral signature weak. The approaches introduced are transferable to other areas, can support multiyear irrigated area mapping with high accuracy, and significantly reduced model development effort.

TI  - Detecting the Planform Changes Due to the Seasonal Flow Fluctuation and 2012 Severe Flood in the Amazon River near Iquitos City, Peru Based on Remote Sensing Image Analysis
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Amazon River forms an anabranching planform, which has been found to have significant changes in migration rate and river morphology. Previous studies have elaborated long-term evolution of the anabranching systems; however, research on the influence of the water level on temporal changes in anabranching is absent. According to the theory of river hydraulics, fluvial scour usually occurs when the shear force possessed by the high flow exceeds the resistance of the streambank. In contrast, deposition occurs when the tractive force of the low flow is insufficient to overcome the forces of gravity and friction. This study investigated the Muyuy anabranching planform change of the Upper Peruvian Amazon River due to the seasonal flow fluctuations and a severe flood in 2012. The Muyuy anabranching area is located 20 km upstream of Iquitos City, Peru. Landsat images from the wet and dry seasons in 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013 were collected. The images were classified into three land cover classes (water, bare soil, vegetation and others) based on NDVI analysis. Quantitative analysis of the erosion/deposition shows that deposition is more noticeable than erosion in the Muyuy anabranching area. Considerable deposition can be found on the island of the anabranching system, and the streambank erosion occurred in the outer (concave) side of the main channel. This phenomenon of river erosion and deposition consistently occurred in 2008 and 2009 because of the periodical variation among the wet and dry seasons. However, prominent erosion was observed in 2012 and it was recognized to be caused by the severe flood. Furthermore, the extensive island was formed in 2013, which means substantial depositions accumulated in the recession of the 2012 flood.

TI  - Sentinel Surveillance Reveals Emerging Daptomycin-Resistant ST736 <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> and Multiple Mechanisms of Linezolid Resistance in Enterococci in the United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis and faecium with resistance to daptomycin and/or linezolid are emerging globally. We present the genomic characterization of daptomycin- and linezolid-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium surveillance isolates from the United States, 2013-2016. Daptomycin resistance was low among E. faecalis (2/364, 0.5%) and E. faecium (17/344, 5%). The majority (71%, 12/17) of daptomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates belonged to the emerging ST736 clone and contained mutations in liaFSR and cls previously associated with resistance. However, 1/2 E. faecalis and 3/17 E. faecium did not contain these mutations previously associated with daptomycin resistance. Linezolid resistance was rare among E. faecalis (1/364, 0.3%) and E. faecium (2/344, 0.6%). These two E. faecium isolates, one of which was also resistant to daptomycin and vancomycin, contained the 23S rRNA nucleotide mutation (G2576T) associated with linezolid resistance. Long-read sequencing revealed the linezolid-resistant E. faecalis isolate contained chromosomal- and plasmid-encoded copies of optrA. The chromosomal optrA was located on the recently described Tn6674 multiresistance transposon. The second copy of optrA was encoded on an similar to 65 kb mosaic plasmid, with component regions sharing high sequence identity to optrA-encoding multiresistance plasmids of animal origin. The optrA-encoding plasmid contained open reading frames predicted to encode proteins associated with a pheromone-responsive plasmid transfer system, and filter mating experiments confirmed the plasmid was conjugative. Continued surveillance of enterococci is necessary to assess the prevalence and trends of daptomycin and linezolid resistance in the United States, characterize resistance mechanisms and how they transfer, and monitor for emerging sequence types associated with resistance.

TI  - Spectral diversity allows remote detection of the rehabilitation status in an Amazonian iron mining complex
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineland rehabilitation is intended to reduce the overall impacts of mining on biodiversity and ecosystem services and requires periodic monitoring to guarantee institutional tractability and to refine rehabilitation practices. As time- and money-consuming field surveys challenge this monitoring, the aim of this study was to develop a remote sensing framework to assess the environmental quality of minelands undergoing rehabilitation based on free and open-access multispectral Sentinel-2 images. For this purpose, we linked spectral diversity, i.e., measures of spectral variation among neighboring pixels, to the field-surveyed environmental quality of a rehabilitation chronosequence covering five waste piles in the Carajas National Forest, Eastern Amazon. Field data were separated into a training data set from 2017 (54 plots) and a testing data set from 2019 (66 plots). Based on the training data set, we optimized the computational parameters of spectral diversity (separation of vegetated from nonvegetated pixels by the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], size of the buffer zones, number of clusters representing distinct spectral species and applied diversity metrics), maximizing the accuracy of the remote monitoring approach. Then, we validated the procedure with the testing data set and compared the number of areas undergoing rehabilitation and their quality from 2017 and 2019. The overall accuracy of our methodology was 83%, and user and producer accuracies exceeded 60% for all rehabilitation classes, enabling the remote sensing of successional advancement of rehabilitating minelands. Despite punctual losses in spectral diversity, we detected comprehensive gains in spectral diversity within the target structures. This is due to an increase in the overall rehabilitation area from 282.39 to 364.54 ha, but enhancements in the spectral diversity of already vegetated areas indicate the successional advancement of these areas with time, reducing the overall impact of mining activities on biodiversity and ecosystem services. We conclude that the remote sensing framework presented here is promising for mapping environmental quality in minelands undergoing rehabilitation, and we encourage its integration in current monitoring protocols to reduce costs and increase the transparency of a company's rehabilitation activities, as freely available satellite images and opensource software are applied.

TI  - Modification of Temperature Lapse Rates and Cloud Properties during a Spatiotemporally Extended Dust Aerosol Episode (16-18 June 2016) over the Mediterranean Basin Based on Satellite and Reanalysis Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatiotemporally extended dust aerosol episode that occurred over the Mediterranean Basin (MB) from 16 to 18 June 2016 is investigated using observational satellite and reanalysis data, focusing on the effects of high dust loads on cloud formation and temperature fields, including the creation of temperature inversions. The atmospheric conditions before and during the 3-day dust aerosol episode case (DAEC) are also analyzed. The dust episode, which is identified using a contemporary satellite algorithm, consists of long-range transport of African dust to the western and central MB. The day to day, before and during the DAEC, atmospheric circulation, dust-cloud interactions, and dust effect on temperature are examined using a variety of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-3 Collection 6.1 satellite and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data. According to the obtained results, the dust export from N. Africa, which occurs under the prevalence of a trough over the western MB, and a ridge over the central MB, extends from southwest to northeast along two axes, one in the western and another in the central Mediterranean, covering remote areas up to the coasts of southern Europe, including the Balearic and Tyrrhenian Seas, the Italian peninsula, the Ionian and Adriatic Seas, and the Balkan peninsula. The analysis provides evidence of the formation of mixed-phase clouds, with high cloud-top heights (CTH higher than 10 km) and low cloud-top temperatures (CTT as low as 230 K), which spatiotemporally coincide with the high dust loadings that provide the necessary CCN and IN. Dust aerosols are transported either in the boundary layer (within the first 1-2 km) of areas close to the North African dust source areas or in the free troposphere over the Mediterranean Sea and the Italian and Balkan peninsulas (between 2 and 8 km). Distinct and extended layers of remarkable temperature inversions (up to 20 K/km) are created below the exported dust layers in the boundary layer of Mediterranean Sea areas, while weak/reduced lapse rates are formed over continental areas of MB undergoing the dust transport. Such modifications of temperature fields are important for the dynamics of the atmosphere of MB.

TI  - Automated Power Lines Vegetation Monitoring Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation Management is a significant preventive maintenance expense in many power transmission and distribution companies. Traditional Vegetation Management operational practices have proven ineffective and are rapidly becoming obsolete due to the lack of frequent inspection of vegetation and environmental states. The rise of satellite imagery data and machine learning provides an opportunity to close the loop with continuous data-driven vegetation monitoring. This paper proposes an automated framework for monitoring vegetation along power lines using high-resolution satellite imagery and a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm. The proposed satellite-based vegetation monitoring framework aims to reduce the cost and time of power line monitoring by partially replacing ground patrols and helicopter or drone inspection with satellite data analytics. It is implemented and demonstrated for a power distribution system operator (DSO) in the west of Norway. For further assessment, the satellite-based algorithm outcomes are compared with LiDAR survey data collected by helicopters. The results show the potential of the solution for reducing the monitoring costs for electric utilities.

TI  - Multi-target regressor chains with repetitive permutation scheme for characterization of built environments with remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-task learning techniques allow the beneficial joint estimation of multiple target variables. Here, we propose a novel multi-task regression (MTR) method called ensemble of regressor chains with repetitive permutation scheme. It belongs to the family of problem transformation-based MTR methods which foresee the creation of an individual model per target variable. Subsequently, the combination of the separate models allows obtaining an overall prediction. Our method builds upon the concept of so-called ensemble of regressor chains which align single-target models along a flexible permutation, i.e., chain. However, in order to particularly address situations with a small number of target variables, we equip ensemble of regressor chains with a repetitive permutation scheme. Thereby, estimates of the target variables are cascaded to subsequent models as additional features when learning along a chain, whereby one target variable can occupy multiple elements of the chain. We provide experimental evaluation of the method by jointly estimating built-up height and built-up density based on features derived from Sentinel-2 data for the four largest cities in Germany in a comparative setup. We also consider single-target stacking, multi-target stacking, and ensemble of regressor chains without repetitive permutation. Empirical results underline the beneficial performance properties of MTR methods. Our ensemble of regressor chain with repetitive permutation scheme approach achieved most frequently the highest accuracies compared to the other MTR methods, whereby mean improvements across the experiments of 14.5% compared to initial single-target models could be achieved.

TI  - Mapping of Dwellings in IDP/Refugee Settlements from Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Using a Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth-observation-based mapping plays a critical role in humanitarian responses by providing timely and accurate information in inaccessible areas, or in situations where frequent updates and monitoring are required, such as in internally displaced population (IDP)/refugee settlements. Manual information extraction pipelines are slow and resource inefficient. Advances in deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are providing state-of-the-art possibilities for automation in information extraction. This study investigates a deep convolutional neural network-based Mask R-CNN model for dwelling extractions in IDP/refugee settlements. The study uses a time series of very high-resolution satellite images from WorldView-2 and WorldView-3. The model was trained with transfer learning through domain adaptation from nonremote sensing tasks. The capability of a model trained on historical images to detect dwelling features on completely unseen newly obtained images through temporal transfer was investigated. The results show that transfer learning provides better performance than training the model from scratch, with an MIoU range of 4.5 to 15.3%, and a range of 18.6 to 25.6% for the overall quality of the extracted dwellings, which varied on the bases of the source of the pretrained weight and the input image. Once it was trained on historical images, the model achieved 62.9, 89.3, and 77% for the object-based mean intersection over union (MIoU), completeness, and quality metrics, respectively, on completely unseen images.

TI  - Pathological Response in the Breast and Axillary Lymph Nodes after Neoadjuvant Systemic Treatment in Patients with Initially Node-Positive Breast Cancer Correlates with Disease Free Survival: An Exploratory Analysis of the GeparOcto Trial
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The extent of axillary surgery has been reduced in recent years to minimize side effects. However, a negative impact of reduced surgery on outcome must be avoided. We investigated for whom the extent of surgery can be safely reduced by examining early-stage breast cancer patients converting from lymph node (LN)-positive to LN-negative disease after neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST). Of 242 initially LN-positive patients treated within the GeparOcto trial, 54.5% were classified as LN-negative after NAST, 31.8% as LN-positive, and for 13.6% data were missing. Overall, 92.1% of patients underwent complete axillary LN dissection, with 6.6% undergoing sentinel LN dissection only. At surgery, 55.4% of patients had no signs of cancer in the LN, 45.0% had no signs of cancer in the breast (of those 8.3% had involved LN), and 41.3% had no signs of cancer at all. Patients with involved LN still had a bad prognosis. Conversion from LN-positive to LN-negative after NAST is of highest prognostic value. Surgical axillary staging after NAST is essential in these patients to offer tailored treatment. Background: The conversion of initially histologically confirmed axillary lymph node-positive (pN+) to ypN0 after neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST) is an important prognostic factor in breast cancer (BC) patients and may influence surgical de-escalation strategies. We aimed to determine pCR rates in lymph nodes (pCR-LN), the breast (pCR-B), and both (tpCR) in women who present with pN+ BC, to assess predictors for response and the impact of pCR-LN, pCR-B, and tpCR on invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). Methods: Retrospective, exploratory analysis of 242 patients with pN+ at diagnosis from the multicentric, randomized GeparOcto trial. Results: Of 242 patients with initially pN+ disease, 134 (55.4%) had a pCR-LN, and 109 (45.0%) a pCR-B. Of the 109 pCR-B patients, 9 (8.3%) patients had involved LN, and 100 (41.3%) patients had tpCR. Those with involved LN still had a bad prognosis. As expected, pCR-B and intrinsic subtypes (TNBC and HER2+) were identified as independent predictors of pCR-LN. pCR-LN (ypN0; hazard ratio 0.42; 95%, CI 0.23-0.75; p = 0.0028 for iDFS) was the strongest independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: In initially pN+ patients undergoing NAST, the conversion to ypN0 is of high prognostic value. Surgical axillary staging after NAST is still essential in these patients to offer tailored treatment.

TI  - Calculating net radiation of freshwater reservoir to estimate spatial distribution of evaporation using satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporation over freshwater bodies is one of the main sources of water loss. However, evaporation estimation models using net radiation (Rn) over water bodies have not yet provided proper efficiency, the fact which has led to several attempts to improve such models using satellite images. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to introduce a model for estimation of Rn through using satellite images, and to utilize such model in evaporation calculation models in order to produce an evaporation map for freshwater bodies. In this regard, two reservoirs of Taleghan and Amirkabir dams in Iran were selected as the areas under study. Thirty-three Landsat satellite images from the years 2010 to 2018 along with the corresponding meteorological data were used in the implementations. A new simplified equation was introduced for calculating Rn and the subsequent estimation of potential evaporation over freshwater bodies using remote sensing images. Evaporation was generally estimated using FAO56-PM, Priestley-Taylor, Kimberly-Penman, and Hargreaves-Samani models, and the results were then compared with Pan evaporation data. The obtained results were also compared with the results of two energy balance models, including Surface Energy Balance System (SEBAL) and Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration (METRIC). The results of this study indicated that Kimberly-Penman model with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.29 (mm), and NashSutcliffe (NSE) of 0.65, and FAO56-PM model with R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.76 (mm), and NSE = 0.36 outperformed when compared to other similar methods. Moreover, the proposed model proved higher performance in estimating evaporation over freshwater bodies compared with SEBAL and METRIC models.

TI  - Monitoring spatial-temporal variations of surface areas of small reservoirs in Ghana's Upper East Region using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and machine learning
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Small reservoirs are one of the most important sources of water for irrigation, domestic and livestock uses in the Upper East Region (UER) of Ghana. Despite various studies on small reservoirs in the region, information on their spatial-temporal variations is minimal. Therefore, this study performed a binary Random Forest classification on Sentinel-2 images for five consecutive dry seasons between 2015 and 2020. The small reservoirs were then categorized according to landscape positions (upstream, midstream, and downstream) using a flow accumulation process. The classification produced an average overall accuracy of 98% and a root mean square error of 0.087 ha. It also indicated that there are currently 384 small reservoirs in the UER (of surface area between 0.09 and 37 ha), with 20% of them newly constructed between the 2016-17 and 2019-20 seasons. The study revealed that upstream reservoirs have smaller sizes and are likely to dry out during the dry season while downstream reservoirs have larger sizes and retain substantial amounts of water even at the end of the dry season. The results further indicated that about 78% of small reservoirs will maintain an average of 54% of their water surface area by the end of the dry season. This indicates significant water availability which can be effectively utilized to expand dry season irrigation. Overall, we demonstrate that landscape positions have significant impact on the spatial-temporal variations of small reservoirs in the UER. The study also showed the effectiveness of remote sensing and machine learning algorithms as tools for monitoring small reservoirs.

TI  - Designing a European-Wide Crop Type Mapping Approach Based on Machine Learning Algorithms Using LUCAS Field Survey and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most challenging aspects of obtaining detailed and accurate land-use and land-cover (LULC) maps is the availability of representative field data for training and validation. In this manuscript, we evaluate the use of the Eurostat Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS) 2018 data to generate a detailed LULC map with 19 crop type classes and two broad categories for woodland and shrubland, and grassland. The field data were used in combination with Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data covering Europe. First, spatially and temporally consistent S2 image composites of (1) spectral reflectances, (2) a selection of spectral indices, and (3) several bio-geophysical indicators were created for the year 2018. From the large number of features, the most important were selected for classification using two machine-learning algorithms (support vector machine and random forest). Results indicated that the 19 crop type classes and the two broad categories could be classified with an overall accuracy (OA) of 77.6%, using independent data for validation. Our analysis of three methods to select optimum training data showed that by selecting the most spectrally different pixels for training data, the best OA could be achieved, and this already using only 11% of the total training data. Comparing our results to a similar study using Sentinel-1 (S1) data indicated that S2 can achieve slightly better results, although the spatial coverage was slightly reduced due to gaps in S2 data. Further analysis is ongoing to leverage synergies between optical and microwave data.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing data, GIS analysis and field studies for mapping alteration zones at Wadi Saqia area, central Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data, spectral analyses, Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and field work were integrated for detecting the spatial distribution of the alteration zones in the study area. Remote sensing studies including; spectral signatures analyses and satellite image processing, were used for identifying the alteration minerals setting of the study area then extracting the alteration zones. A field study was carried out to the study area and several tens of samples were collected. The spectral behavior of the col-lected samples was obtained using the "Advanced Spectral Devices (ASD) TerraSpec Halo mineral iden-tifier" handheld spectro-radiometer. Spectral analyses were carried out on signatures of selected samples to obtain the characterizing absorption features and to reveal the identity of the alteration min-erals (end-members) representing the alteration zones in the area. The identified end-members included; Clay minerals, white Mica, Epidote and Iron oxides. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Spectral Feature Fitting (SFF), Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), and Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) alteration mapping techniques were used to map the abundance of the identified alteration minerals from ASTER satellite image data. Lineaments were extracted automatically using combined hill-shade images obtained at multi-azimuths derived from Allos PALSAR 12.5 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. The alteration and lineament data were integrated together using the GIS "Weighted Overlay Analysis" tool to delineate the most potential areas for alteration zones existence. The results were validated through plotting the field observation points on the resulted final alteration map; the accuracy was esti-mated by about 80%.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Gaussian Process Regression Model for Crop Biophysical Parameter Retrieval from Multi-Polarized C-Band SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biophysical parameter retrieval using remote sensing has long been utilized for crop yield forecasting and economic practices. Remote sensing can provide information across a large spatial extent and in a timely manner within a season. Plant Area Index (PAI), Vegetation Water Content (VWC), and Wet-Biomass (WB) play a vital role in estimating crop growth and helping farmers make market decisions. Many parametric and non-parametric machine learning techniques have been utilized to estimate these parameters. A general non-parametric approach that follows a Bayesian framework is the Gaussian Process (GP). The parameters of this process-based technique are assumed to be random variables with a joint Gaussian distribution. The purpose of this work is to investigate Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models to retrieve biophysical parameters of three annual crops utilizing combinations of multiple polarizations from C-band SAR data. RADARSAT-2 full-polarimetric images and in situ measurements of wheat, canola, and soybeans obtained from the SMAPVEX16 campaign over Manitoba, Canada, are used to evaluate the performance of these GPR models. The results from this research demonstrate that both the full-pol (HH+HV+VV) combination and the dual-pol (HV+VV) configuration can be used to estimate PAI, VWC, and WB for these three crops.

TI  - 4D U-Nets for Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral sensors constitute a core earth observation imaging technology generating massive high-dimensional observations acquired across multiple time instances. The collected multi-temporal remote sensed data contain rich information for Earth monitoring applications, from flood detection to crop classification. To easily classify such naturally multidimensional data, conventional low-order deep learning models unavoidably toss away valuable information residing across the available dimensions. In this work, we extend state-of-the-art convolutional network models based on the U-Net architecture to their high-dimensional analogs, which can naturally capture multi-dimensional dependencies and correlations. We introduce several model architectures, both of low as well as of high order, and we quantify the achieved classification performance vis-a-vis the latest state-of-the-art methods. The experimental analysis on observations from Landsat-8 reveals that approaches based on low-order U-Net models exhibit poor classification performance and are outperformed by our proposed high-dimensional U-Net scheme.

TI  - Measuring Spatial and Temporal Gravelled Forest Road Degradation in the Boreal Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Degradation of forest roads in Canada has strong negative effects on access to forestlands, together with economic (e.g., increased maintenance costs), environmental (e.g., erosion of materials and subsequent habitat contamination), and social (e.g., use risks) impacts. Maintaining sustainable and safe access to forestland requires a better understanding and knowledge of forest road degradation over time and space. Our study aimed to identify relevant spatiotemporal variables regarding the state of eastern Canadian forest road networks by (1) building predictive models of gravel forest road degradation and assessing effects of the slope, time, loss of the road surface, and road width (field approach), and (2) evaluating the potential of topography, roughness and vegetation indices obtained from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and Sentinel-2 optical images to estimate degradation rates (remote sensing approach). The field approach (n = 207 sample plots) confirmed that only four variables were efficient to estimate degradation rates (pseudo-R-2 = 0.43 with +/- 8% error). Simulations that were conducted showed that after about five years without maintenance, the rate of degradation on a road, regardless of its width, increased exponentially, exacerbated by a high slope gradient and loss of road surface. The narrowest roads tended to degrade more rapidly over time. The remote sensing approach performed quite well (pseudo-R-2 = 0.34 with +/- 9% error) in terms of predicting road degradation, giving us the valuable tools to spatialise the state of gravel forest road degradation in eastern Canadian forest. This study provided new knowledge and tools that are critical for maintaining and sustaining access to Canada's boreal forest territory in both the short- and the long-term.

TI  - Akan Religious Ontology and Environmental Sustainability in Ghana
T2  - WORLDVIEWS-GLOBAL RELIGIONS CULTURE AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, using ethnographic field data from three indigenous Akan communities, we show that Akan religious ontology about the natural world provides a formidable resource and framework for managing the environmentally destructive tendencies of the human being. We further prove that while these ontologies about the natural world emerge from the intense religiosity of the Akan and the metaphysical worldview of the indigenous Akan, they contain strong environmental ethical norms and values worth resourcing for environmental sustainability in Ghana. We, consequently, argue that sig-nificant attention ought to be paid to these religious ontologies-beliefs, norms and practices-of the indigenous Akan, as an effective means of achieving environmen-tal sustainability. We, therefore, propose the resourcing and adoption of indigenous religious ontologies on the natural world that have the potential of informing and enhancing environmental policies and initiatives towards environmental sustainabil-ity in Ghana.

TI  - Recent trends in adult body mass index and prevalence of excess
T2  - CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To explore recent body mass index (BMI) trends over time among Canadian adults seen in primary care to identify the best target groups for preventive interventions.Design Retrospective descriptive cohort design.Setting Data for this study were derived from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network database.Participants All patients aged 18 years and older who had BMI measurements available between 2011 and 2016 were identified. A closed cohort (N = 243 078 unique patients) with a start date of January 1, 2011, was defined. Patients were excluded if key variables were missing or if BMI measurements were 15 kg/m2 or less or 50 kg/m2 or greater.Main outcome measures The dependent variable for this study was BMI (kg/m2). Measured BMI values recorded in electronic medical records were used. A linear mixed-effect estimate was fit to model changes in BMI over time with control of baseline age and sex.Results Patients in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network database experienced a modest increase in mean (95% CI) BMI by 2.1% from 28.5 (28.4 to 28.6) kg/m2 in 2011 to 29.1 (28.9 to 29.2) kg/m2 in 2016 (P< .0001). This increase is not a measured difference in BMI in the same individual but reflects the difference in the average BMI of the population in 2011 versus 2016. Male patients had BMI values that were on average 1.02 kg/m2 higher than those of female patients (P < .0001). Mean BMI values increased most rapidly in young adults (18 to 34 years) compared with older adults.Conclusion The findings indicate that current obesity management in primary care is failing to moderate weight trajectories in different groups by age and sex. The results also suggest that younger age groups, in whom accelerated weight gain occurred, should be the target of prevention initiatives.

TI  - Exposome mapping in chronic respiratory diseases: the added value of digital technology
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThe development and progression of chronic respiratory diseases are impacted by a complex interplay between genetic, microbial, and environmental factors. Here we specifically summarize the effects of environmental exposure on asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. We furthermore discuss how digital health technology may aid in the assessment of the environmental exposure of patients and how it may be of added value for them.Recent findingsIt is well established that one gets allergic symptoms if sensitized and exposed to the same allergen. Viruses, bacteria, pollutants, irritants, and lifestyle-related factors modify the risk of getting sensitized and develop symptoms or may induce symptoms themselves. Understanding these processes and how the various factors interact with each other and the human body require big data and advanced statistics. Mobile health technology enables integration of multiple sources of data of the patients' exposome and link these to patient outcomes. Such technologies may contribute to the increased understanding of the development of chronic respiratory disease.SummaryImplementation of digital technologies in clinical practice may in future guide the development of preventive strategies to tackle chronic respiratory diseases and eventually improve outcomes of the patient.

TI  - Change Detection in Remote Sensing Image Data Comparing Algebraic and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has penetrated all the natural resource segments as it provides precise information in an image mode. Remote sensing satellites are currently the fastest-growing source of geographic area information. With the continuous change in the earth's surface and the wide application of remote sensing, change detection is very useful for monitoring environmental and human needs. So, it is necessary to develop automatic change detection techniques to improve the quality and reduce the time required by manual image analysis. This work focuses on the improvement of the classification accuracy of the machine learning techniques by reviewing the training samples and comparing the post-classification comparison with the image differencing in the algebraic technique. Landsat data are medium spatial resolution data; that is why pixel-wise computation has been applied. Two change detection techniques have been studied by applying a decision tree algorithm using a separability matrix and image differencing. The first change detection, e.g., the separability matrix, is a post-classification comparison in which individual images are classified by a decision tree algorithm. The second change detection is, e.g., the image differencing change detection technique in which changed and unchanged pixels are determined by applying the corner method to calculate the threshold on the changing image. The performance of the machine learning algorithm has been validated by 10-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that the change detection using the post-classification method produced better results when compared to the image differencing of the algebraic change detection technique.

TI  - Land Cover Changes in Selected Areas Next to Lagoons Located on the Southern Coast of the Baltic Sea, 1984-2021
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study is the evaluation of land cover changes in selected areas next to three lagoons (the Curonian Lagoon, the Vistula Lagoon and the Szczecin Lagoon) located on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea (in Lithuania, Russia, Poland and Germany) from 1984 to 2021. The changes are evaluated using multispectral (visible light-RGB and near infrared-NIR) satellite images from the Landsat 5 and Sentinel-2 sensors. Due to their high importance for ecosystem services, two main land cover types are evaluated, i.e., forest area and inland water reservoirs. The classification of the images is performed using a random forest algorithm. Areas of water bodies and forests are evaluated for the years 1984 and 2021. During period 1984-2021, positive changes in land cover are observed in all three regions included in the study. In almost all parts, with the exception of the Polish part of the area located next to the Szczecin Lagoon, of these regions, an increase in forest area is observed. The increase ranges from 0.1% (Poland, area next to the Vistula Lagoon) to 1.2% (Germany, area next to the Szczecin Lagoon). The area of inland water reservoirs has not changed significantly in the long term. Despite the global warming, no reduction in the area of these water reservoirs is observed, even new seminatural reservoirs have been created in some parts of the study area.

TI  - Multitemporal Change Detection Analysis in an Urbanized Environment Based upon Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The German Ruhr area is a highly condensed urban area that experienced a tremendous structural change over recent decades with the replacement of the coal and steel industries by other sectors. Consequently, a lot of major land cover changes happened. To retrospectively quantify such land cover changes, this study analysed synthetic aperture radar images of the Sentinel-1 satellites by applying the Google Earth Engine. Three satellite images are analysed by the multitemporal difference-adjusted dispersion threshold approach to capture land cover changes such as demolished buildings and new buildings by applying a threshold. This approach uses synthetic aperture radar data that are rarely considered in previously existing land cover change services. Urbanization or urban sprawl leads to changes in the urban form globally. These can be caused, for example, by migration or regionally by structural change, etc., such as in the study area presented here. The results are validated with reference data sets, which are publicly available nationally (e.g., house contour lines, normalized digital terrain model, digital orthophotos) or which are publicly available globally like the Global Urban Footprint and the World Settlement Footprint. Based on this, land cover changes could be identified for 21 locations within the study area of the city of Bochum.

TI  - Estimating the seasonal relationship between land surface temperature and normalized difference bareness index using Landsat data series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study analyzes the seasonal variability of the relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI) on different land use/land cover (LULC) in Raipur City, India by using sixty-five Landsat images of four seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter) of 1991-1992, 1995-1996, 1999-2000, 2004-2005, 2009-2010, 2014-2015, and 2018-2019. The mono-window algorithm was used to retrieve LST and Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to generate the LST-NDBaI relationship. The post-monsoon season builds the best correlation (0.59) among the four seasons. The water bodies builds a moderate to strong positive correlation (>0.50) in all the four seasons. On green vegetation, this correlation is moderate to strong positive (>0.54) in the three seasons, except the pre-monsoon season. The built-up area and bare land generate a moderate positive correlation (>0.34) in all the four seasons. Among the four seasons, the post-monsoon season builds the best correlation for all LULC types, whereas the pre-monsoon season has the least correlation. This research work is useful for environmental planning of other citieswith similar climatic conditions.

TI  - Management of Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: A Literature Review
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Despite being a preventable disease, cervical cancer still causes morbidity and deaths worldwide. In the early stages (FIGO IA1 with lymph-vascular space invasion-IIA1), the disease is highly curable. The primary treatment for early-stage cervical cancer is radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. This surgical treatment has changed during the past decades, and we aimed to review and discuss the advances in the literature. We performed a literature review through PubMed focusing on English articles about the topic of surgical management of early-stage cervical cancer. The emergent topics considered here are the FIGO 2018 staging system update, conservative management for selected patients, sentinel lymph node mapping, fertility preservation, surgical approach, and management of tumors up to 2 cm. These topics show an evolvement to a more tailored treatment to prevent morbidity and assure oncologic safety. Cervical cancer (CC) remains a public health issue worldwide despite preventive measures. Surgical treatment in the early-stage CC has evolved during the last decades. Our aim was to review the advances in the literature and summarize the ongoing studies on this topic. To this end, we conducted a literature review through PubMed focusing on English-language articles on the surgical management of early-stage CC. The emergent topics considered here are the FIGO 2018 staging system update, conservative management with less radical procedures for selected patients, lymph node staging, fertility preservation, preferred surgical approach, management of tumors up to 2 cm, and prognosis. In terms of updating FIGO, we highlight the inclusion of lymph node status on staging and the possibility of imaging. Regarding the preferred surgical approach, we emphasize the LACC trial impact worldwide in favor of open surgery; however, we discuss the controversial application of this for tumors < 2 cm. In summary, all topics show a tendency to provide patients with tailored treatment that avoids morbidity while maintaining oncologic safety, which is already possible in high-income countries. We believe that efforts should focus on making this a reality for low-income countries as well.

TI  - A Scalable Computing Resources System for Remote Sensing Big Data Processing Using GeoPySpark Based on Spark on K8s
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of Earth observation (EO) entering the era of big data, a significant challenge relating to by the storage, analysis, and visualization of a massive amount of remote sensing (RS) data must be addressed. In this paper, we proposed a novel scalable computing resources system to achieve high-speed processing of RS big data in a parallel distributed architecture. To reduce data movement among computing nodes, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is established on nodes of K8s, which are also used for computing. In the process of RS data analysis, we innovatively use the tile-oriented programming model instead of the traditional strip-oriented or pixel-oriented approach to better implement parallel computing in a Spark on Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. A large RS raster layer can be abstracted as a user-defined tile format of any size, so that a whole computing task can be divided into multiple distributed parallel tasks. The computing resources applied by users would be immediately assigned in the Spark on K8s cluster by simply configuring and initializing SparkContext through a web-based Jupyter notebook console. Users can easily query, write, or visualize data in any box size from the catalog module in GeoPySpark. In summary, the system proposed in this study can provide a distributed scalable resources system for assembling big data storage, parallel computing, and real-time visualization.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations in Satellite-Derived Vegetation Phenological Parameters in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology does not only serve as a key index of terrestrial ecosystem response to worldwide climate change but also has a major influence on plant productivity and the carbon cycle. In the current research, the change of vegetation phenological parameters was studied and the impact exerted by climate change on phenological phases in northeast China for 1982-2014 was explored using the latest edition of the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GIMMS NDVI3g) dataset. The results showed that the start of the growing season (SOS) slightly advanced, the end of the growing season (EOS) showed a significant delay, and the length of the growing season (LOS) exhibited a significant prolonging at the regional scale. At the different vegetation types scale, there existed diverse responses of vegetation phenological phases to climate change for forest, grassland, and cultivated land. Significant decreasing trends in the SOS occupied 19.1% of the entire research area, whereas pixels with significantly increasing trends in the SOS accounted for 13.1%. The EOS was delayed in most of the study region (approximately 72.1%). As the result of the variations of SOS and EOS, the LOS was obviously enhanced (p < 0.05) in 29.7% of the research area. According to the correlation of vegetation phenology with climate factors, the SOS had a significant negative relationship with the average temperature in springtime, while the EOS was notably negatively connected to summer total precipitation at the regional scale. At the pixel scale, the correlation of phenological parameters with climate variables showed strong spatial heterogeneities. This study contributes to the comprehension of the responses of vegetation phenology to climate change.

TI  - Variability of Chlorophyll-a and Secchi Disk Depth (1997-2019) in the Bohai Sea Based on Monthly Cloud-Free Satellite Data Reconstructions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean colour data are crucial for monitoring and assessing marine ecosystems. In this study, the Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) approach was applied to the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Secchi disk depth (Zsd) to completely reconstruct the missing pixels in the Bohai Sea during 1997-2019. The results of cross-validation demonstrate that the DINEOF reconstructed data have a good agreement with the satellite-measured data. Based on monthly cloud-free satellite data reconstructions, the Zsd series showed high negative correlation with log10 (Chl-a). The Zsd as a function of log10 (Chl-a) can be well fitted by the cubic polynomial in the offshore waters. The Chl-a in the entire Bohai Sea showed a significant decreasing trend (-0.013 mg/m(3)/year), while the Zsd exhibited a significant increasing trend (0.0065 m/year), and both had regional-seasonal variations. In addition, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) results reveal highly nonlinear trends of Chl-a and Zsd. The linear and nonlinear trends of Chl-a and Zsd suggest the deterioration of water quality in the Bohai Sea was not continued over the past two decades. This study presents the first simultaneous investigation of Chl-a and Zsd using the 23 years of cloud-free reconstructions in the Bohai Sea.

TI  - Remote Sensing Inversion of Suspended Matter Concentration Using a Neural Network Model Optimized by the Partial Least Squares and Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended matter concentration is an important index for the assessment of a water environment and it is also one of the core parameters for remote sensing inversion of water color. Due to the optical complexity of a water body and the interaction between different water quality parameters, the remote sensing inversion accuracy of suspended matter concentration is currently limited. To solve this problem, based on the remote sensing images from Gaofen-2 (GF-2) and the field-measured suspended matter concentration, taking a section of the Haihe River as the study area, this study establishes a remote sensing inversion model. The model combines the partial least squares (PLS) algorithm and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model, i.e., the PLS-PSO-BPNN model. The partial least squares algorithm is involved in screening the input values of the neural network model. The particle swarm optimization algorithm optimizes the weights and thresholds of the neural network model and it thus effectively overcomes the over-fitting of the neural network. The inversion accuracy of the optimized neural network model is compared with that of the partial least squares model and the traditional neural network model by determining the coefficient, the mean absolute error, the root mean square error, the correlation coefficient and the relative root mean square error. The results indicate that the root mean squared error of the PLS-PSO-BPNN inversion model was 3.05 mg/L, which is higher than the accuracy of the statistical regression model. The developed PLS-PSO-BPNN model could be widely applied in other areas to better invert the water quality parameters of surface water.

TI  - Multi-decadal analysis of high-resolution albedo changes induced by urbanization over contrasted Chinese cities based on Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is a key parameter in the surface energy balance and has been identified as a primary essential climate variable (ECV). Variations in surface albedo can be used as a diagnostic tool for local climate change. This is particularly true in urban areas, where the impacts of land cover conversion due to increasing anthropogenic demands can be examined using surface albedo changes. Most of the previous studies of albedo in cities have relied on coarse-resolution datasets with short time spans and have disregarded continuous monitoring. In addition, it is still unclear which urbanization processes are involved and what effects they have on surface albedo over long time periods. This study aimed to identify the contribution of increasing urbanization to the regional climate by analyzing spatial and temporal changes in surface albedo. Assigning albedo values to land cover types is useful for determining the level of transformation and their impacts in various Chinese cities that underwent specific evolutions between 1986 and 2018. The Direct Estimation (DE) approach was modified to estimate the daily mean surface albedo at 30 m based on Landsat observations. It resulted root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of less than 0.044 and bias about 0.006 between observations and model estimations. Such accuracy obtained after correcting the orbital drift of the Landsat satellite, was deemed satisfactory for detecting potential changes in albedo. Major findings are: 1) A notable trend was found over the past 33 years of 11 major Chinese cities, i.e. population about 10 million and more, with a general albedo increase from satellite observations. The higher resolution Landsat dataset showed a trend 3 times larger than the Global Land Surface Satellites (GLASS) product, which outlines the need for analyzing high resolution imagery in priority for reliable estimate of albedo over heterogeneous urban landscapes. 2) An increase in albedo infers a negative radiative forcing at an average rate of -2.771 W/m2 per decade, thereby indicating a cooling effect for most Chinese cities. 3) Changes in surface albedo were also closely linked to landscape transformation, clearly observed using the 30 m resolution of the Landsat data. 4) Throughout the study period, surface albedo exhibited a temporal U-shaped curve in built-up areas under development, with albedo peaks in old and newly built districts and a decrease in albedo between the two eras.

TI  - Evaluating the Potential of Different Evapotranspiration Datasets for Distributed Hydrological Model Calibration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET), a key component of the hydrological cycle, has a direct impact on runoff and water balance. Various global satellite-based and numerical datasets provide continuous and high spatiotemporal resolution data, which makes it possible to calibrate hydrological parameters against ET. However, the accuracy of ET datasets varies with region and algorithm, introducing uncertainties in hydrological parameter calibration. This study focused on evaluating the potential of different ET datasets in the calibration of distributed hydrological model parameters. Five different ET datasets (PML, SEBAL, EB-ET, GLASS, REA-ET) were evaluated using the water balance method to explore the effect of intrinsic dataset accuracy on applications. The benchmark calibration scheme calibrated parameters by using observed streamflow data from the outlet. Two calibration schemes were proposed to take advantage of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of the raw ET datasets. The results show that the model parameters calibrated by all selected ET datasets produced satisfactory results in streamflow simulations. These results were dependent on the calibration schemes and accuracy of ET datasets. Overall, the scheme calibrated by using temporal dynamics of ET at the grid scale provided better streamflow simulations at the basin outlet than the scheme calibrated by using spatial patterns of ET at the basin scale. Three metrics (bias, root mean square error [RMSE], and correlation coefficient [R]) showed that there is a high potential for selected ET datasets to improve soil moisture simulations, as compared to the benchmark scheme. Parameters calibrated by EB-ET and PML datasets provided the best performance in the simulation of streamflow at the outlet and the sub-basin scale. The calibration case with the SEBAL dataset showed the highest potential to improve soil moisture simulation. The annual average ET estimates of these three datasets were closest to the water balance-based ET values.

TI  - Mapping the Northern Limit of Double Cropping Using a Phenology-Based Algorithm and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Double cropping is an important cropping system in China, with more than half of China's cropland adopting the practice. Under the background of global climate change, agricultural policies, and changing farming practices, double-cropping area has changed substantially. However, the spatial-temporal dynamics of double cropping is poorly understood. A better understanding of these dynamics is necessary for the northern limit of double cropping (NLDC) to ensure food security in China and the world and to achieve zero hunger, the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Here, we developed a phenology-based algorithm to identify double-cropping fields by analyzing time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images during the period 2000-2020 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We then extracted the NLDC using the kernel density of pixels with double cropping and analyzed the spatial-temporal dynamics of NLDC using the Fishnet method. We found that our algorithm accurately extracted double-cropping fields, with overall, user, and producer accuracies and Kappa coefficients of 95.97%, 96.58%, 92.21%, and 0.91, respectively. Over the past 20 years, the NLDC generally trended southward (the largest movement was 66.60 km) and eastward (the largest movement was 109.52 km). Our findings provide the scientific basis for further development and planning of agricultural production in China.

TI  - Siamese Detail Difference and Self-Inverse Network for Forest Cover Change Extraction Based on Landsat 8 OLI Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of carbon neutrality, forest cover change detection has become a key topic of global environmental monitoring. As a large-scale monitoring technique, remote sensing has received obvious attention in various land cover observation applications. With the rapid development of deep learning, remote sensing change detection combined with deep neural network has achieved high accuracy. In this paper, the deep neural network is used to study forest cover change with Landsat images. The main research ideas are as follows. (1) A Siamese detail difference neural network is proposed, which uses a combination of concatenate weight sharing mode and subtract weight sharing mode to improve the accuracy of forest cover change detection. (2) The self-inverse network is introduced to detect the change of forest increase by using the sample data set of forest decrease, which realizes the transfer learning of the sample data set and improves the utilization rate of the sample data set. The experimental results on Landsat 8 images show that the proposed method outperforms several Siamese neural network methods in forest cover change extraction.

TI  - The Promise of Jewish Theistic Naturalism for Jewish Environmental Ethics
T2  - WORLDVIEWS-GLOBAL RELIGIONS CULTURE AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper seeks to explain the greater appeal of Jewish naturalistic theologies given our greater appreciation today of the ecological vulnerability of our world. By examining the theological writings of two prominent twentieth-century Jewish thinkers-Hans Jonas and Arthur Green. The paper demonstrates that their espousal of naturalistic yet theistic worldview in their interpretations and reconstructions of Jewish tradition shares significant affinities and promotes an ethical attitude toward the environment. First, I show that Jonas and Green reject reductive forms of naturalism and embrace a non reductive or "expansive" style of naturalism. Then, I argue that their theologies intend to stimulate a sense of responsibility toward all creation by envisioning humans as partners of a non-omnipotent God. I conclude by noting the metaphysical, epistemological, and moral promises of theistic naturalism to Jewish environmental ethics.

TI  - Quantifying Hail Damage in Crops Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hailstorms are a frequent natural weather disaster in the Canadian Prairies that can cause catastrophic damage to field crops. Assessment of damage for insurance claims requires insurance inspectors to visit individual fields and estimate damage on individual plants. This study computes temporal profiles and estimates the severity of hail damage to crops in 54 fields through the temporal analysis of vegetation indices calculated from Sentinel-2 images. The damage estimation accuracy of eight vegetative indices in different temporal analyses of delta index (pre-and post-hail differences) or area under curve (AUC) index (time profiles of index affected by hail) was compared. Hail damage was accurately quantified by using the AUC of 32 days of Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Plant Senescence Radiation Index (PSRI). These metrics were well correlated with ground estimates of hail damage in canola (r = -0.90, RMSE = 8.24), wheat (r = -0.86, RMSE = 12.27), and lentil (r = 0.80, RMSE = 17.41). Thus, the timeseries changes in vegetation indices had a good correlation with ground estimates of hail damage which may allow for more accurate assessment of the extent and severity of hail damage to crop land.

TI  - Interpolation-Based Fusion of Sentinel-5P, SRTM, and Regulatory-Grade Ground Stations Data for Producing Spatially Continuous Maps of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Nationwide over Thailand
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric pollution has recently drawn significant attention due to its proven adverse effects on public health and the environment. This concern has been aggravated specifically in Southeast Asia due to increasing vehicular use, industrial activity, and agricultural burning practices. Consequently, elevated PM2.5 concentrations have become a matter of intervention for national authorities who have addressed the needs of monitoring air pollution by operating ground stations. However, their spatial coverage is limited and the installation and maintenance are costly. Therefore, alternative approaches are necessary at national and regional scales. In the current paper, we investigated interpolation models to fuse PM2.5 measurements from ground stations and satellite data in an attempt to produce spatially continuous maps of PM2.5 nationwide over Thailand. Four approaches are compared, namely the inverse distance weighted (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), random forest (RF), and random forest combined with OK (RFK) leveraging on the NO2, SO2, CO, HCHO, AI, and O-3 products from the Sentinel-5P satellite, regulatory-grade ground PM2.5 measurements, and topographic parameters. The results suggest that RFK is the most robust, especially when the pollution levels are moderate or extreme, achieving an RMSE value of 7.11 mu g/m(3) and an R-2 value of 0.77 during a 10-day long period in February, and an RMSE of 10.77 mu g/m(3) and R-2 and 0.91 during the entire month of March. The proposed approach can be adopted operationally and expanded by leveraging regulatory-grade stations, low-cost sensors, as well as upcoming satellite missions such as the GEMS and the Sentinel-5.

TI  - Extraction of Landslide Information Based on Object-Oriented Approach and Cause Analysis in Shuicheng, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In China, landslides are abundant, widespread, and regular, destroying villages and agriculture and sometimes posing a threat to people's lives. The question of how to rapidly detect and attain landslide data is a significant topic of research, yet traditional measurement using medium-resolution remote sensing data is problematic. Object-oriented categorization is utilized in this research to extract landside data from high-resolution GF-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Data preprocessing begins with orthophoto correction, image matching, and data fusion, followed by band enhancement, which comprises band synthesis, principal component analysis, and filtering, and finally landside extraction using an object-oriented technique. The impact of geology, lithology, rainfall, and human activities on the occurrence of landslides in the study area is explored utilizing DEM data, visualization tools, remote sensing interpretation map, and other associated data. The studies are conducted in Shuicheng County, Guizhou Province, China, with a segmentation scale of 25 pixels and 14 classification feature parameters. Following that, the landslide mass is extracted and categorization findings of nearby characteristics are acquired. Finally, the destructiveness of the landslide is determined by comparing the results of object-oriented classification before and after the landslide. With a Kappa coefficient of 0.76 and a landslide extraction accuracy of 79.8%, the overall classification accuracy is 87%. Combined with the geological structure, rock lithology, spatial location, landslide occurrence process, elevation of the study area, precipitation and the impact of human activities, the causes of the landslide are discussed and analyzed. The early warning of other unknown landslides can be obtained by analyzing the features of the aforementioned components.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Lake Taihu from <i>Gaofen-1</i> Wide-Field-of-View Data through a Machine Learning Trained Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide-field-of-view (WFV) imager that observes the earth environment with four solar reflective bands in a spatial resolution of 16 m is equipped on board Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in Lake Taihu, China from 2018 to 2019 is collected and collocated with GF-1 satellite data. This study develops a general and reliable estimation of Chl-a concentration from GF-1 WFV data under turbid inland water conditions. The collocated data are classified according to season and used in random forest (RF) regression to train models for retrieving the lake Chl-a concentration. A composite index is developed to select the most important variables in the models. The models trained for each season show a better performance than the model trained by using the whole year data in terms of the coefficient of determination (R-2) between retrievals and observations. Specifically, the R-2 values in spring, summer, autumn, and winter are 0.88, 0.88, 0.94, and 0.74, respectively; whereas that using the whole year data is only 0.71. The Chl-a concentration in Lake Taihu exhibits an obvious seasonal change with the highest in summer, followed by autumn and spring, and the lowest in winter. The Chl-a concentration also displays an obvious spatial variation with season. A high concentration occurs mainly in the northwest of the lake. The temporal and spatial changes of Chl-a concentration are almost consistent with the changes in the areas and times of cyanobacteria blooms based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The proposed algorithm can be operated without a priori knowledge on atmospheric conditions and water quality. Our study also demonstrates that GF-1 data are increasingly valuable for monitoring the Chl-a concentration of inland water bodies in China at a high spatial resolution.

TI  - Mapping and Analyzing the Park Cooling Intensity in Mitigation of Urban Heat Island Effect in Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect has been widely studied as a global concern of the 21st century. Heat generation from urban built-up structures and anthropogenic heat sources are the main factors to create UHIs. Unfortunately, both factors are expanding rapidly in Lahore and accelerating UHI effects. The effects of UHI are expanding with the expansion of impermeable surfaces towards urban green areas. Therefore, this study was arranged to analyze the role of urban cooling intensity in reducing urban heat island effects. For this purpose, 15 parks were selected to analyze their effects on the land surface temperature (LST) of Lahore. The study obtained two images of Landsat-8 based on seasons: the first of June-2018 for summer and the second of November-2018 for winter. The LST of the study area was calculated using the radiative transfer equation (RTE) method. The results show that the theme parks have the largest cooling effect while the linear parks have the lowest. The mean park LST and PCI of the samples are also positively correlated with the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). So, it is concluded that urban parks play a positive role in reducing and mitigating LST and UHI effects. Therefore, it is suggested that the increase of vegetation cover should be used to develop impervious surfaces and sustainable landscape planning.

TI  - Diversity-accuracy assessment of multiple classifier systems for the land cover classification of the Khumbu region in the Himalayas
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification of mountainous environments continues to be a challenging remote sensing problem, owing to landscape complexities exhibited by the region. This study explored a multiple classifier system (MCS) approach to the classification of mountain land cover for the Khumbu region in the Himalayas using Sentinel-2 images and a cloud-based model framework. The relationship between classification accuracy and MCS diversity was investigated, and the effects of different diversification and combination methods on MCS classification performance were comparatively assessed for this environment. We present ten MCS models that implement a homogeneous ensemble approach, using the high performing Random Forest (RF) algorithm as the selected classifier. The base classifiers of each MCS model were developed using different combinations of three diversity techniques: (1) distinct training sets, (2) Mean Decrease Accuracy feature selection, and (3) 'One-vs-All' problem reduction. The base classifier predictions of each RF-MCS model were combined using: (1) majority vote, (2) weighted argmax, and (3) a meta RF classifier. All MCS models reported higher classification accuracies than the benchmark classifier (overall accuracy with 95% confidence interval: 87.33%+/- 0.97%), with the highest performing model reporting an overall accuracy (+/- 95% confidence interval) of 90.95%+/- 0.84%. Our key findings include: (1) MCS is effective in mountainous environments prone to noise from landscape complexities, (2) problem reduction is indicated as a stronger method over feature selection in improving the diversity of the MCS, (3) although the MCS diversity and accuracy have a positive correlation, our results suggest this is a weak relationship for mountainous classifications, and (4) the selected diversity methods improve the discriminability of MCS against vegetation and forest classes in mountainous land cover classifications and exhibit a cumulative effect on MCS diversity for this context.

M3  - Article
AB  - Band rationing, principal component analysis (PCA) and decorrelation stretch (DS) techniques of Landsat-8 with Sentinel-2 data successfully used in the discrimination of the lithological units and the surface structure features of Wadi Al-Miyah area in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) were processed to identify the hydrothermal mineralized alteration zones related to the radioactive minerals. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS) has been used to determine the naturally occurring radioactive anomalous zones such as potassium (K), equivalent uranium (eU) and equivalent thorium (eTh) and to follow their spatial distribution in Wadi Al-Miyah area. The analysis of AGRS data revealed that, the study area owns a wide range of radioelement concentrations ranging from 15.5 to 98.4 lR/h, 5.9-37.1 ppm, 17.2-95.4 ppm, and 0.53%-10.29% of total count (TC), (eU), (eTh), and (K), respectively. The interpretation of the Radioelements Composite Image (RCI) successfully delineated the enrichment zones with radioelement concentrations within the alkali feldspar granite, biotite-muscovite schist, granodiorite and the hydrothermal alteration areas within the diorite of Gabal Al-Bakriyah. The results concluded that the integrated remote sensing and airborne AGRS data are promising in detecting the potential areas enriched with K, eU and eTh.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Exploring Park Visit Variability Using Cell Phone Data in Shenzhen, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the spatiotemporal characteristics of park visitors and the "push and pull" factors that shape this mobility is critical to designing and managing urban parks to meet the demands of rapid urbanization. In this paper, 56 parks in Shenzhen were studied in 2019. First, cell phone signaling data were used to extract information on visitors' departure locations and destination parks. Second, the bivariate Moran's I and bivariate local Moran's I (BiLISA) methods were used to identify the statistical correlation between the factors of the built environment and the park recreation trips. Finally, linear regression models were constructed to quantify the factors influencing the attractiveness of the park. Our study showed the following: (1) Recreation visitors at large parks varied significantly among population subgroups. Compared with younger adults, teenagers and older adults traveled lower distances and made fewer trips, and in particular, older adults of different genders differed significantly in park participation. (2) Recreational trips in large parks were related to the functional layout of the built environment around their residence. In areas with rich urban functions (e.g., southern Shenzhen), trips to large parks for leisure are more aggregated. (3) The findings reinforce the evidence that remote sensing data for urban vegetation can be an effective factor in characterizing park attractiveness, but the explanatory power of different vegetation data varies widely. Our study integrated the complementary human activity and remote sensing data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of urban park use and preferences. This will be important for future park planning.

TI  - Generating 2m fine-scale urban tree cover product over 34 metropolises in China based on deep context-aware sub-pixel mapping network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrast to the global forest, few trees live in cities but contribute significantly to urban environment and human health. However, the classical satellite-derived land cover/forest cover products with limited resolution are not fine enough for the identification of urban tree, which is usually appeared in small size and intersected with infrastructure. To relieve the dilemma, this study developed an urban tree specific sub-pixel mapping (SPM) architecture with deep learning approach, which aimed to generate 2m fine-scale urban tree cover product from 10 m Sentinel-2 images for large-scale area of 34 metropolises in China. The proposed approach has remarkable reconstruction ability for delineating the contextual characteristic of the urban tree patterns, and reliable generalization ability to large-scale area. In addition, this study creates a large-volume urban tree cover dataset (UTCD) with 0.13 billion urban tree samples at 2 m resolution, which fills the deficiency of standard dataset in urban tree cover research field. Quantitative analysis of our products was conducted on two typical study sites of Beijing and Wuhan. The results show that our products recover averagely more than 58.72% of urban tree covers that have been underestimated in the existing land cover/forest cover products, and outperforms the state-of-theart approach both visually and quantitatively, by averagely 11.31% improvement in overall accuracy. From our annual products during 2016-2020, we found an evolution characteristic of urban tree cover: it is more stable in developed cities like Beijing, while more fluctuated in developing cities like Wuhan, and the alteration are usually concentrated at the outer-ring of downtown, which may be caused by the municipal planning and the land development of real estate industry.

TI  - Influence of Energy and Water Cycle Key Parameters on Drought in Mongolian Plateau during 1979-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought in the Mongolian Plateau (MP) has gradually intensified in recent decades. The energy and water cycles are key factors affecting drought. However, there are few quantitative studies on the mechanism of aridity change in this region. This study uses the ERA5, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Himawari 8 datasets and investigated the mechanism of drought change over the MP. The aridity index (the ratio of potential evaporation and total precipitation) is employed to detect drought changes. The results showed that the annual mean of aridity index increased by 0.73% per year (increased significantly since 1999) during the period 1979-2020. Moreover, the drought was most severe in the January to April of 2016-2020, mainly concentrated in the central and western parts of the MP. The potential evaporation increased (0.72% per year) and total precipitation decreased (0.16% per year) from 1979 to 2020. However, the surface temperature continued increasing from August to December in the period 2016-2020 (1.67% per year). This may result in an increase in potential evaporation and a decrease in volumetric soil water from August to December last year. The decrease of volumetric soil water resulted in the decrease of total cloud cover (0.25% per year) and total precipitation from January to April. The surface net radiation (increased by 0.42% per year) and the potential evaporation increased, which may aggravate the drought from January to April. The evaporation paradox is studied over the MP. The results show that the variation in evaporation is consistent with that of total precipitation, and the surface temperature will promote an increase in evaporation and potential evaporation. This study reveals that global warming, desertification and increased surface net radiation contribute to the increase in potential evaporation and reduced volumetric soil water, which together contribute to drought.

TI  - China's Terrestrial Carbon Sink Over 2010-2015 Constrained by Satellite Observations of Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and Land Surface Variables
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude and distribution of China's terrestrial carbon sink remain uncertain due to insufficient constraints at large scales, whereby satellite data offer great potential for reducing the uncertainty. Here, we present two carbon sink estimates for China constrained either by satellite CO2 column concentrations (XCO2) within the Global Carbon Assimilation System or by remotely sensed soil moisture and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) in addition to in situ CO2 observations within the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System. They point to a moderate size of carbon sinks of 0.34 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- unc.) and 0.43 +/- 0.09 PgC/yr during 2010-2015, which are supported by an inventory-based estimate for forest and soil carbon sink (0.26 PgC/yr) and fall in the range of contemporary ensemble atmospheric inversions (0.25-0.48 PgC/yr). They also agree reasonably well on interannual variations, which reflect the carbon sink anomalies induced by regional droughts in southwest China. Furthermore, their spatial distributions are broadly consistent that of the forest inventory-based estimate, indicating that the largest carbon sinks locate in central and eastern China. Their estimates for forest carbon sink coincide fairly well with the inventory-based estimate across different regions, especially when aggregated to the north and south of China. Although enhanced recently by afforestation, China's carbon sink was also significantly weakened by regional droughts, which were often not fully represented in previous in situ CO2-based inversions due to insufficient observations. Our results suggest that satellite-based atmospheric CO2 and land surface observations are vital in characterizing terrestrial net carbon fluxes at regional scales.

TI  - Long-term morphodynamic evolution in the Modaomen Estuary of the Pearl River Delta, South China
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities and natural disturbances will cause large-scale changes in the morphology of estuarine systems. Studies of estuarine morphology tended to focus on a single driving factor, however, the intertwined ef-fects (e.g., land reclamation, sand excavation, tides, waves, runoff) are rarely mentioned in the literature. This work characterizes and conceptualizes the morphodynamics of the Modaomen Estuary (ME), the largest estuary in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, based on Landsat satellite imagery, high-resolution bathymetry survey data, and in situ hydrographic measurements. The morphodynamic evolution of the ME since the 1970s-2010s is analyzed with respect to planform configuration and bathymetry. Quantification of estuarine hydrodynamic and sediment parameters for the most recent years indicates that the ME has transformed from a traditional fluvial-and tide-dominated estuary into a fluvial-and wave-dominated estuary. Ocean currents intrude along the eastern channel and draw down along the western channel, in which estuarine flow deflection is induced by the combined effect of upstream runoff, coastal waves, and littoral currents. Furthermore, a life-cycle model of the morphological migration of the ME is presented by synthesizing hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. This conceptual model of three geomorphological states clearly shows that the main channel experiences a life cycle covering several decades, from the origin of the main channel to its bifurcation into two distributaries, and finally a recovery and westward deflection of the main channel. The cognition of the appearance and disappearance with one sandbar and two channels will be helpful in numerical modeling of estuary evolution, and it also has important implications for the regulation of estuarine regions, hazard prevention and channel navigability.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - ClassHyPer: ClassMix-Based Hybrid Perturbations for Deep Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inspired by the tremendous success of deep learning (DL) and the increased availability of remote sensing data, DL-based image semantic segmentation has attracted growing interest in the remote sensing community. The ideal scenario of DL application requires a vast number of annotation data with the same feature distribution as the area of interest. However, obtaining such enormous training sets that suit the data distribution of the target area is highly time-consuming and costly. Consistency-regularization-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have gained growing popularity thanks to their ease of implementation and remarkable performance. However, there have been limited applications of SSL in remote sensing. This study comprehensively analyzed several advanced SSL methods based on consistency regularization from the perspective of data- and model-level perturbation. Then, an end-to-end SSL approach based on a hybrid perturbation paradigm was introduced to improve the DL model's performance with a limited number of labels. The proposed method integrates the semantic boundary information to generate more meaningful mixing images when performing data-level perturbation. Additionally, by using implicit pseudo-supervision based on model-level perturbation, it eliminates the need to set extra threshold parameters in training. Furthermore, it can be flexibly paired with the DL model in an end-to-end manner, as opposed to the separated training stages used in the traditional pseudo-labeling. Experimental results for five remote sensing benchmark datasets in the application of segmentation of roads, buildings, and land cover demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. It is particularly encouraging that the ratio of accuracy obtained using the proposed method with 5% labels to that using the purely supervised method with 100% labels was more than 89% on all benchmark datasets.

TI  - Effects of Mixture Mode on the Canopy Bidirectional Reflectance of Coniferous-Broadleaved Mixed Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main initiatives for China to achieve the goal of being carbon neutral before 2060 is transforming monocultures into mixed plantations in subtropical China, because mixed forests possess a higher quality than monocultures in various ways. Very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite imagery is very promising to precisely monitor the transformation process under the premise of clarifying the canopy reflectance anisotropy of mixed plantations. However, it is almost impossible to understand the canopy reflectance anisotropy of mixed plantations with real satellite data due to the extreme lack of multiangular VHR satellite images. In this study, the effects of the mixture mode on the canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) were comprehensively analyzed with simulated VHR images. The three-dimensional (3D) Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer model (DART) was used to construct a pure coniferous scene, a pure broadleaved scene, and 27 coniferous-broadleaved mixed plantation scenes containing 3 mixture patterns (i.e., mixed by single trees, mixed by stripes, and mixed by patches) and 9 mixing proportions (i.e., from 10% to 90% with the interval of 10%), and to simulate red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) VHR images for these 3D scenes at both the solar principal plane (SPP) and perpendicular plane (PP) under different solar-viewing geometries. Negative correlations were generally found between the canopy BRF and the ratio of conifers in a mixed stand. The anisotropy of conifer dominated plantations is more prominent than broadleaf dominated plantations, especially for the single tree mixture. Although the level of anisotropy is much lower for PP than SPP, it should not be ignored, especially for the R band. Observations under large viewing zenith angles at PP are more preferred to study the effect of mixing proportions, followed by forward observations at SPP. The R band image has higher potential to distinguish mixture patterns for broadleaf-dominated situations, while the NIR band image has a higher potential for conifer-dominated situations. Furthermore, the canopy BRF generally increases with the solar zenith angle, and one meter can be considered as the optimal spatial resolution for the optical monitoring of the mixture mode. The findings of the current study add some valuable theoretical knowledge for the accurate monitoring of coniferous-broadleaved mixed plantations with VHR imagery.

TI  - Geospatial Applications of Cave Resource Data to Better Understand Epikarst and Unsaturated Zone Groundwater Flow Path Development
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The unsaturated zone is a critical component of karstic groundwater systems and is shown to provide substantial storage capacities. Understanding the spatial patterns and controls on flow path activation is often a challenge. Previous research focused on remotely sensed data or inferential analyses to quantify these patterns. Here, we use two cave systems-one in Arizona, USA and a second in Kentucky, USA-to show the value of the cave survey and inventory data in the direct observation of speleogenesis and unsaturated zone processes. Using geospatial statistical analyses, we show that passage size varies with distance from some faults, indicating that these faults play a major role in transporting fluid into the limestone and creating increased permeability in the form of cave passages. Additionally, the close relationship between water, calcite resources and geology provide clear evidence for the activation of unsaturated zone flow paths through these cave systems. While both cave systems represent a large area of greatly increased permeability, only isolated sections of the caves show evidence of this active flow. In both cases, modern vadose zone flow occurs proximal to faults and contacts with overlying insoluble lithology. These results suggest that an expanded use of cave survey and inventory data may provide a greater insight into unsaturated zone processes.

TI  - Predicting Wildfire Fuels and Hazard in a Central European Temperate Forest Using Active and Passive Remote Sensing
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change causes more extreme droughts and heat waves in Central Europe, affecting vegetative fuels and altering the local fire regime. Wildfire is projected to expand into the temperate zone, a region traditionally not concerned by fire. To mitigate this new threat, local forest management will require spatial fire hazard information. We present a holistic and comprehensible workflow for quantifying fuels and wildfire hazard through fire spread simulations. Surface and canopy fuels characteristics were sampled in a small managed temperate forest in Northern Germany. Custom fuel models were created for each dominant species (Pinus sylvestris, Fagus sylvatica, and Quercus rubra). Canopy cover, canopy height, and crown base height were directly derived from airborne LiDAR point clouds. Surface fuel types and crown bulk density (CBD) were predicted using random forest and ridge regression, respectively. Modeling was supported by 119 predictors extracted from LiDAR, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data. We simulated fire spread from random ignitions, considering eight environmental scenarios to calculate fire behavior and hazard. Fuel type classification scored an overall accuracy of 0.971 (Kappa = 0.967), whereas CBD regression performed notably weaker (RMSE = 0.069; R-2 = 0.73). Higher fire hazard was identified for strong winds, low fuel moisture, and on slopes. Fires burned fastest and most frequently on slopes in large homogeneous pine stands. These should be the focus of preventive management actions.

TI  - Relationship analysis between the spread of COVID-19 and the multidimensional poverty index in the city of Manizales, Colombia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 has forced government and health agencies to take measures to mitigate the spread of the disease and thus safeguard as many lives as possible. These measures have initially impacted the economy of many countries, and therefore they have been forced to gradually return to a new normalcy, in what they have called reopening. For reopening policies to be effective, it is necessary that the people in charge of drawing up these policies know the local behavior of the propagation of COVID-19, and beyond this they can understand that between the cases of COVID-19 and the socioeconomic conditions of their population there is a relationship. For this reason, in this article a case study is presented, which allowed to evaluate the relationship between positive cases of COVID-19 and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) in the city of Manizales, Colombia. The results of an exploratory analysis, obtained with the use of remote sensing data, are presented, which allowed to confirm the relationship in mention, and it is hoped that this can serve the municipal administration in its decision making.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Role of Hormonal Receptor in Predicting Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer.
T2  - Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is one of the minimally invasive techniques that can confirm the presence of metastasis of regional lymph nodes in cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be done with a lymph mapping technique using blue-dye, radiotracer, or a combination of both. In developing countries, sentinel lymph node biopsy is often done with a single agent, which is the blue dye. The limitation of conducting SLNB in Indonesia is the availability of patent blue dye and radioisotope tracer. To overcome that, a hormonal receptor is expected to aid in predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the hormonal receptor as a prognostic factor of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.Methods: This study was conducted in Universitas Sumatera Utara Teaching Hospital with the acknowledgment from the Ethics Committee of the respected hospital by the number of 116/KEP/USU/2020. Total of 51 patients participated in this research.Results: Statistically, the p-value in each immunohistochemistry group is > 0.05 in all ER (+) / PR (+); ER (+) / PR (-); ER (-) / PR (+) groups. This shows that there is no significant relationship between hormonal receptors on sentinel lymph node metastases.Conclusion: The statistical evaluation showed that there is no significant correlation between the hormonal receptor and sentinel lymph node metastasis (p>0.05), but is found clinically significant. Therefore, hormonal receptors should be considered as a predicting factor for sentinel lymph node metastasis.

M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Management of the regional lymph nodes is an essential element of breast cancer care and has changed dramatically over the years. At its beginning in the last century, radical axillary lymph node dissection was the only type of surgery accepted. Due to the high and significant morbidity associated with the radical procedure, the magnitude of the dissection was decreased by omitting level III resection. Nevertheless, the morbidity was still significant. With the beginning of mass screening along with improvements in the understanding of the biology of the disease and improvements in medical treatments and radiotherapy, the importance of axillary lymph node dissection decreased together with the decrease in the number of patients needing this procedure for node-positive disease. This prompted the development of sentinel lymph node biopsy as a more selective approach for defining the nodal status and need for dissection. The accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy was validated, omitting the need for axillary dissection in node-negative women, leaving the need for dissection mainly for locally advanced disease and following primary medical treatment. However, in recent years some new large scale controlled studies have shed further information that may permit avoiding axillary dissection in some node-negative patients and following neoadjuvant therapy for node-positive patients. Here, we will review the history of regional lymph node surgery and the modern approach in breast cancer.

TI  - Study of Planetary Boundary Layer, Air Pollution, Air Quality Models and Aerosol Transport Using Ceilometers in New South Wales (NSW), Australia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is one of the key factors in influencing the dispersion of the air pollutants in the troposphere and, hence, the air pollutant concentration on ground level. For this reason, accurate air pollutant concentration depends on the performance of PBLH prediction. Recently, ceilometers, a lidar instrument to measure cloud base height, have been used by atmospheric scientists and air pollution control authorities to determine the mixing level height (MLH) in improving forecasting and understanding the evolution of aerosol layers above ground at a site. In this study, ceilometer data at an urban (Lidcombe) and a rural (Merriwa) location in New South Wales, Australia, were used to investigate the relationship of air pollutant surface concentrations and surface meteorological variables with MLH, to validate the PBLH prediction from two air quality models (CCAM-CTM and WRF-CMAQ), as well as to understand the aerosol transport from sources to the receptor point at Merriwa for the three case studies where high PM10 concentration was detected in each of the three days. The results showed that surface ozone and temperature had a positive correlation with MLH, while relative humidity had negative correlation. For other pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2), no clear results were obtained, and the correlation depended on the site and regional emission characteristics. The results also showed that the PBLH prediction by the two air quality models corresponded reasonably well with the observed ceilometer data and the cause and source of high PM10 concentration at Merriwa can be found by using ceilometer MLH data to corroborate back trajectory analysis of the transport of aerosols to the receptor point at Merriwa. Of the three case studies, one had aerosol sources from the north and north west of Merriwa in remote NSW, where windblown dust is the main source, and the other two had sources from the south and south east of Merriwa, where anthropogenic sources dominate.

TI  - Active Fire Mapping on Brazilian Pantanal Based on Deep Learning and CBERS 04A Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire in Brazilian Pantanal represents a serious threat to biodiversity. The Brazilian National Institute of Spatial Research (INPE) has a program named Queimadas, which estimated from January 2020 to October 2020, a burned area in Pantanal of approximately 40,606 km2. This program also provides daily data of active fire (fires spots) from a methodology that uses MODIS (Aqua and Terra) sensor data as reference satellites, which presents limitations mainly when dealing with small active fires. Remote sensing researches on active fire dynamics have contributed to wildfire comprehension, despite generally applying low spatial resolution data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) associated with high- and medium-resolution remote sensing data may provide a complementary strategy to small active fire detection. We propose an approach based on object detection methods to map active fire in the Pantanal. In this approach, a post-processing strategy is adopted based on Non-Max Suppression (NMS) to reduce the number of highly overlapped detections. Extensive experiments were conducted, generating 150 models, as five-folds were considered. We generate a public dataset with 775-RGB image patches from the Wide Field Imager (WFI) sensor onboard the China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) 4A. The patches resulted from 49 images acquired from May to August 2020 and present a spatial and temporal resolutions of 55 m and five days, respectively. The proposed approach uses a point (active fire) to generate squared bounding boxes. Our findings indicate that accurate results were achieved, even considering recent images from 2021, showing the generalization capability of our models to complement other researches and wildfire databases such as the current program Queimadas in detecting active fire in this complex environment. The approach may be extended and evaluated in other environmental conditions worldwide where active fire detection is still a required information in fire fighting and rescue initiatives.

TI  - The Black Desert Drone Survey: New Perspectives on an Ancient Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a large scale, drone-based aerial survey in northeastern Jordan. Drones have rapidly become one of the most cost-effective and efficient tools for collecting high-resolution landscape data, fitting between larger-scale, lower-resolution satellite data collection and the significantly more limited traditional terrestrial survey approaches. Drones are particularly effective in areas where anthropogenic features are visible on the surface but are too small to identify with commonly and economically available satellite data. Using imagery from fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, along with photogrammetric processing, we surveyed an extensive archaeological landscape spanning 32 km(2) at the site of Wadi al-Qattafi in the eastern badia region of Jordan, the largest archaeological drone survey, to date, in Jordan. The resulting data allowed us to map a wide range of anthropogenic features, including hunting traps, domestic structures, and tombs, as well as modern alterations to the landscape including road construction and looting pits. We documented thousands of previously unrecorded and largely unknown prehistoric structures, providing an improved understanding of major shifts in the prehistoric use of this landscape.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes of land use land cover and ecosystem service values in coastal Bangladesh
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased human activity and dynamic climate variables have radically altered the global land use land cover (LULC) pattern and the ecosystem services (ES) they offer. However, assessing the impact of such LULC dynamics on ecological resources has rarely been attempted, especially in Bangladesh. Here, we assessed the dynamics of LULC change and associated ecosystem service values (ESVs) of coastal Bangladesh during 1999-2019 by analyzing historical Landsat LULC images and economic valuation techniques, respectively. Findings revealed a high prevalence of rural settlement-based Tree Outside Forest (TOF) land sprawl over agricultural land. Besides, LULC transition analysis revealed an increase in built-up, mangrove forest, water bodies, and saltpan/aquaculture areas and a decrease in agricultural and bare land areas. Overall, the ESV of coastal Bangladesh decreased by 0.47 billion US dollars, from US$ 25.18 billion in 1999 to US$ 24.71 billion in 2019. However, the values of different ES functions, such as food (-10.7%) and raw materials (-7.7%), were found most affected, while slight progress was evident in biodiversity protection (+2.2%), and water regulation (+1.1%) functions. Strong spatial dynamics of ESV changes were observed, with the largest decreases in the districts of Satkhira (-7.90%), Cox'sbazar (-5.75%), and Noakhali (-4.61%), and the highest increases in the districts of Lakshmipur (+4.65%) and Patuakhali (+3.18%). The findings regarding mangrove and TOF growth have important implications for building a buffer against ESV degradation due to the substantial decline in agricultural lands in other parts of the world with related socio-geographical and environmental problems.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Assessment of a photon recollision probability based forest reflectance model in European boreal and temperate forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a new version and an empirical evaluation of a forest reflectance model based on photon recollision probability (p). For the first time, a p-based approach to modeling forest reflectance was tested in a wide range of differently structured forests from different biomes. To parameterize the model, we measured forest canopy structure and spectral characteristics for 50 forest plots in four study sites spanning from boreal to temperate biomes in Europe (48 degrees -62 degrees N). We compared modeled forest reflectance spectra against airborne hyperspectral data at wavelengths of 450-2200 nm. Large overestimation occurred, especially in the near-infrared region, when the model was parameterized considering only leaves or needles as plant elements and assuming a Lambertian canopy. The model root mean square error (RMSE) was on average 80%, 80%, 54% for coniferous, broadleaved, and mixed forests, respectively. We suggest a new parameterization that takes into account the nadir to hemispherical reflectance ratio of the canopy and contribution of woody elements to the forest reflectance. We evaluated the new parameterization based on inversion of the model, which resulted in average RMSE of 20%, 15%, and 11% for coniferous, broadleaved, and mixed forests. The model requires only few structural parameters and the spectra of foliage, woody elements, and forest floor as input. It can be used in interpretation of multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing data, as well as in land surface and climate modeling. In general, our results also indicate that even though the foliage spectra are not dramatically different between coniferous and broadleaved forests, they can still explain a large part of reflectance differences between these forest types in the near-infrared, where sensitivity of the reflectance of dense forests to changes in the scattering properties of the foliage is high.

TI  - A Field-Deployable Insulated Isothermal PCR (iiPCR) for the Global Surveillance of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> Infection in Cetaceans
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Since high trophic levels marine mammal species share the coastal environments and diets with humans, cetaceans provide an indication of contaminant bioaccumulation in humans and may serve as sentinels for public health problems. Parasite monitoring in marine sentinels can assist in evaluating the quality of the aquatic ecosystem's health. T. gondii infection in cetaceans is an indicator of land-to-sea coastal pollution. Although T. gondii infection cases in cetaceans have been reported in several countries, an information gap still exists in some areas. The present study employs a portable insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) with an automatic extraction device as a rapid, affordable, user-friendly, and field-deployable platform to rapidly detect nucleic acid of T. gondii in stranded cetaceans. The platform utilizes duplex iiPCR designed to simultaneously detect T. gondii and a housekeeping gene of cetacean on the samples, which can prevent the false-negative results of pathogen detection and improve the accuracy of surveillance. This study would contribute to improving the environment through the warning of the sentinel animals and building new strategies by detecting the occurrence of land-based biological pollution. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease with veterinary and public health importance worldwide. Toxoplasma gondii infection in cetaceans is an indicator of land-to-sea oocyst pollution. However, there is a critical knowledge gap within the distribution of the T. gondii infection in cetaceans. To facilitate the global surveillance of this important zoonotic pathogen, we developed a field-deployable duplex insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) with automated magnetic bead-based DNA extraction for the on-site detection of T. gondii in stranded cetaceans. It targets the B1 gene of T. gondii combined with beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) gene of cetaceans as an internal control. Compared with the conventional qPCR assay, B1/B2M duplex iiPCR assay showed comparable sensitivity (21~86 bradyzoites in 25 mg of tissue) to detect spike-in standard of T. gondii DNA in cerebrum, cerebellum, skeletal muscle and myocardium tissues. Moreover, the overall agreement between the duplex iiPCR and qPCR was in almost perfect agreement (92%; 95% CI: 0.78-0.90; kappa = 0.84) in detecting a synthetic spike-in standards. The B1/B2M iiPCR assay coupled with a field-deployable system provides a prompt (~1.5 h), feasible, highly sensitive and specific on-site diagnostic tool for T. gondii in stranded cetaceans. This platform provides one approach to evaluating aquatic ecosystem health and developing early warnings about negative impacts on humans and marine animals.

TI  - Spectral characteristics of sea snot reflectance observed from satellites: Implications for remote sensing of marine debris
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2021, coastal communities in the Sea of Marmara were impacted by large sea snot events. Based on data collected by several satellite sensors, we analyze and present the spectral reflectance characteristics of sea snots in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Sea snots often form elongated image slicks in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) or false-colour RGB (FRGB) images. Most reflectance spectra of sea snots show largely featureless spectral shapes, with continuous reflectance increases from the blue to the red, which then become flat toward the near infrared wavelengths. Some reflectance spectra show a local trough around 670 nm, indicating presence of chlorophyll a pigment, and thereby live algae. A 20-year time series of satellite data also reveals large-scale sea snot events in the Sea of Marmara before 2021. These results suggest that it might be possible to develop algorithms to search and map sea snots at a global scale, as sea snot events also occur in other regions. The results also indicate that remote differentiation of sea snots and marine debris using multi-band sensors may be difficult because of the spectral similarity between them.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved understanding of urban heat island (UHI) is important in urban ecological and environmental studies. In this study, we investigated footprint (FP) and intensity of surface UHI (SUHI) from 2003 to 2020 in 141 China cities using a Gaussian model and multi-source remote sensing data. Results showed that annual daytime FP in 79% cities was larger than nighttime FP. There were more cities having larger daytime FP than nighttime FP in summer compared to other seasons. With the increase of city size, FP showed an increasing tendency in median or small cities, while plateaued in large cities. We also found that high SUHI intensity occurred in cities with warm climate in daytime but occurred in cities with cold climate in nighttime. Moreover, SUHI intensity in daytime was higher than that of nighttime in all climatic zones in summer, while in other seasons, SUHI intensity in daytime was higher than that of nighttime only in warm climatic zones. Finally, 96% cities showed higher SUHI intensity in daytime than that of nighttime in summer, while proportion of such cities was only 45% in winter. Findings of this study are helpful for mitigating UHI effect in cities with different urbanized levels or climatic background.

TI  - A Methodology to Generate Integrated Land Cover Data for Land Surface Model by Improving Dempster-Shafer Theory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover type is a key parameter for simulating surface processes in many land surface models (LSMs). Currently, the widely used global remote sensing land cover products cannot meet the requirements of LSMs for classification systems, physical definition, data accuracy, and space-time resolution. Here, a new fusion method was proposed to generate land cover data for LSMs by fusing multi-source remote sensing land cover data, which was based on improving Dempster-Shafer evidence theory with mathematical models and knowledge rules optimization. The new method has the ability to deal with seriously disagreement information, thereby improving the robustness of the theory. The results showed the new method can reduce the disagreement between input data and realized the conversion of multiple land cover classification systems to into a single land cover classification system. China Fusion Land Cover data (CFLC) in 2015 generated by the new method maintained the classification accuracy of the China land use map (CNLULC), which is based on visual image interpretation and further enriched land cover classes of input data. Compared with Geo-Wiki observations in 2015, the overall accuracy for CFLC is higher than other two global land cover data. Compared with the observations, the 0-10 cm soil moisture simulated by the CFLC in Noah-MP LSM during the growing season in 2014 had better performance than that simulated by initial land cover data and MODIS land cover data. Our new method is highly portable and generalizable to generate higher quality land cover data with a specific land cover classification system for LSMs by fusing multiple land cover data, providing a new approach to land cover mapping for LSMs.

TI  - Cloud Detection in ZY-3 Multi-Angle Remote Sensing Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud pollution on remote sensing images seriously affects the actual use rate of remote sensing images. Therefore, cloud detection of remote sensing images is an indispensable part of image preprocessing and image availability screening. Aiming at the lack of short wave infrared and thermal infrared bands in ZY-3 high-resolution satellite images resulting in the poor detection effect, considering the obvious difference in geographic height between cloud and ground surface objects, this paper proposes a thick and thin cloud detection method combining spectral information and digital height model (DHM) based on multi-scale features-convolutional neural network (MF-CNN) model. To verify the importance of DHM height information in cloud detection of ZY-3 multi-angle remote sensing images, this paper implements cloud detection comparison of the data set with and without DHM height information based on the MF-CNN model. The experimental results show that the ZY-3 multi-angle image with DHM height information can effectively improve the confusion between highlighted surface and thin cloud, which also means the assistance of DHM height information can make up for the disadvantage of high-resolution image lacking short wave infrared and thermal infrared bands.

TI  - Trans-lymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound with sentinel lymph node biopsy for detecting cervical skip metastasis to lymph nodes in early-stage oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - DENTOMAXILLOFACIAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess whether trans-lymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy can be used to assess the status of cervical lymph nodes and skip metastasis in patients with early squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral tongue.Methods: This study included 21 subjects with early oral tongue SCC who received multiple intramucosal peritumoral injections of Sonazoid. CEUS examinations were performed immediately after Sonazoid injection to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The SLNs were excised for histological examination to determine if the lymph nodes has metastases.Results: Thirty-five SLNs were detected by CEUS after Sonazoid injection in the subjects. SLNs were identified in 20 of the total 21 subjects. Four participants had metastasis to lymph nodes, and one had skip metastasis in level III. In one subject, SLNs were successfully detected in level IV without skip metastasis.Conclusions: Trans-lymphatic CEUS combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy showed high accuracy for evaluating cervical lymph node status. This could be a reliable approach for detecting cervical skip metastases of lymph nodes in early-stage oral cancer patients.

TI  - Accurate Identification of Pine Wood Nematode Disease with a Deep Convolution Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine wood nematode disease is a devastating pine disease that poses a great threat to forest ecosystems. The use of remote sensing methods can achieve macroscopic and dynamic detection of this disease; however, the efficiency and accuracy of traditional remote sensing image recognition methods are not always sufficient for disease detection. Deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs), a technology that has emerged in recent years, have an excellent ability to learn massive, high-dimensional image features and have been widely studied and applied in classification, recognition, and detection tasks involving remote sensing images. This paper uses Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing images of areas with pine wood nematode disease to construct a D-CNN sample dataset, and we train five popular models (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, SqueezeNet, ResNet-18, and VGG16) through transfer learning. Finally, we use the "macroarchitecture combined with micromodules for joint tuning and improvement" strategy to improve the model structure. The results show that the transfer learning effect of SqueezeNet on the sample dataset is better than that of other popular models and that a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 1 x 10(-4) are suitable for SqueezeNet's transfer learning on the sample dataset. The improvement of SqueezeNet's fire module structure by referring to the Slim module structure can effectively improve the recognition efficiency of the model, and the accuracy can reach 94.90%. The final improved model can help users accurately and efficiently conduct remote sensing monitoring of pine wood nematode disease.

TI  - Stepwise Fusion of Hyperspectral, Multispectral and Panchromatic Images with Spectral Grouping Strategy: A Comparative Study Using GF5 and GF1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since hyperspectral satellite images (HSIs) usually hold low spatial resolution, improving the spatial resolution of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an effective solution to explore its potential for remote sensing applications, such as land cover mapping over urban and coastal areas. The fusion of HSIs with high spatial resolution multispectral images (MSIs) and panchromatic (PAN) images could be a solution. To address the challenging work of fusing HSIs, MSIs and PAN images, a novel easy-to-implement stepwise fusion approach was proposed in this study. The fusion of HSIs and MSIs was decomposed into a set of simple image fusion tasks through spectral grouping strategy. HSI, MSI and PAN images were fused step by step using existing image fusion algorithms. According to different fusion order, two strategies ((HSI+MSI)+PAN and HSI+(MSI+PAN)) were proposed. Using simulated and real Gaofen-5 (GF-5) HSI, MSI and PAN images from the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) PMS sensor as experimental data, we compared the proposed stepwise fusion strategies with the traditional fusion strategy (HSI+PAN), and compared the performances of six fusion algorithms under three fusion strategies. We comprehensively evaluated the fused results through three aspects: spectral fidelity, spatial fidelity and computation efficiency evaluation. The results showed that (1) the spectral fidelity of the fused images obtained by stepwise fusion strategies was better than that of the traditional strategy; (2) the proposed stepwise strategies performed better or comparable spatial fidelity than traditional strategy; (3) the stepwise strategy did not significantly increase the time complexity compared to the traditional strategy; and (4) we also provide suggestions for selecting image fusion algorithms using the proposed strategy. The study provided us with a reference for the selection of fusion strategies and algorithms in different application scenarios, and also provided an easy-to-implement solution and useful references for fusing HSI, MSI and PAN images.

TI  - Effects of of China's pilot low-carbon city policy on carbon emission reduction: A quasi-natural experiment based on satellite data
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic development has brought about global greenhouse gas emissions and thus global climate change, which is a common challenge for all mankind that urgently needs to be addressed. As the focal points of national economic development, cities have major responsibilities with regard to low-carbon development and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Countries around the world are actively exploring low-carbon development. In response to climate change, China has actively explored and adopted pilot policies for low-carbon cities, to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. In this study, we used a differences-in-differences approach to explore the effects of emission reduction and conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the pilot cities. The empirical results showed that pilot cities reduced carbon emissions annually by approximately 2.72%. Additionally, the associated gross domestic product loss from 2013 to 2017 was approximately 1.19 trillion yuan. Mechanism analysis elucidated that pilot cities reduced emissions by adjusting their industrial structure, promoting technological innovation of enterprises to increase their total-factor productivity, and stimulating research and development of low-carbon technologies. The results of this study provide examples, supported by data, for the government to further promote the low-carbon city construction policy.

TI  - Urban land use land cover mapping in tropical savannah using Landsat-8 derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Generation of land use/land cover map at different spatial scales using satellite remote sensing data has been in practice as far back as early 1970s. Since then, research focus has been on the development of classification steps and improving the quality of the resulting maps. In recent times, the demand for detailed high accuracy land-use and land-cover (LULC) data has been on the increase due to the growing complexity of earth processes, while, at the same time, processing step is becoming more complex. This paper explores Landsat 8 derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold for the purpose of simplifying land cover classification process. NDVI images of January, May and December, 2018, representing dry, wet and harmattan seasons were generated. Thereafter, NDVI values corresponding to the location of a set of training data representing the target urban land covers (water, built-up area, soil, grassland and shrub) were extracted. Using the statistics of the extracted values, NDVI threshold for the respective land cover type were determined for the classification process. Finally, the classification accuracy was evaluated using the unbiased matrix coefficient technique which produced overall accuracy of 71.3%, 46.4% and 75.6% at 95% confidence limit for the months of January, May and December of the year review respectively. The result has shown that NDVI threshold is a simple and practical alternative to obtain LULC map at a reasonable time with a few data.

TI  - Monitoring the available forage using Sentinel 2-derived NDVI data for sustainable rangeland management
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Management problems could cause rangeland degradation worldwide. Monitoring the seasonal variation of available forage may help to prevent vegetation from deterioration and help to ensure sustainable animal pro-duction. Therefore, seasonal variations in the amounts of available forage, and the contents of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and digestible dry matter (DDM) were monitored for two years via both ground sampling and Sentinel 2A-derived NDVI data at semi-arid Bozdag Rangelands, Turkey. Available forage significantly varied between 374.4 and 936.4 kg ha(-1) through the season and all quality pa-rameters showed significant seasonal variations. Available forage was estimated in strong accuracy only in dry season (r(2) = 0.72, P & LE; 0.01), but the seasonal variations of CP, ADF, and DDM contents were estimated in moderate accuracy (r(2) = 0.56, 0.40, 0.41 respectively) by the satellite-derived NDVI data. Free Sentinel 2A-derived NDVI values gave promising results for monitoring the forage quality of these semi-arid rangelands, but further research is needed to develop new vegetation indexes for considering woody tissues in vegetation, and higher resolution for greater monitoring accuracy.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Spatiotemporal Variation in Crude Protein of Shortgrass Steppe Forage
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Great Plains of central North America, sustainable livestock production is dependent on matching the timing of forage availability and quality with animal intake demands. Advances in remote sensing technology provide accurate information for forage quantity. However, similar efforts for forage quality are lacking. Crude protein (CP) content is one of the most relevant forage quality determinants of individual animal intake, especially below an 8% threshold for growing animals. In a set of shortgrass steppe paddocks with contrasting botanical composition, we (1) modeled the spatiotemporal variation in field estimates of CP content against seven spectral MODIS bands, and (2) used the model to assess the risk of reaching the 8% CP content threshold during the grazing season for paddocks with light, moderate, or heavy grazing intensities for the last 22 years (2000-2021). Our calibrated model explained up to 69% of the spatiotemporal variation in CP content. Different from previous investigations, our model was partially independent of NDVI, as it included the green and red portions of the spectrum as direct predictors of CP content. From 2000 to 2021, the model predicted that CP content was a limiting factor for growth of yearling cattle in 80% of the years for about 60% of the mid-May to October grazing season. The risk of forage quality being below the CP content threshold increases as the grazing season progresses, suggesting that ranchers across this rangeland region could benefit from remotely sensed CP content to proactively remove yearling cattle earlier than the traditional October date or to strategically provide supplemental protein sources to grazing cattle.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> and changes in DNA methylation and telomere length in cord blood
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Air pollution exposure in pregnancy can cause molecular level alterations that might influence later disease susceptibility.Objectives: We investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) and telomere length (TL) in the cord blood in relation to gestational PM10 exposure and explored potential gestational windows of susceptibility.Methods: Cord blood epigenome-wide DNAm (N = 384) and TL (N = 500) were measured in children of the Italian birth cohort Piccolipin, using the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip and qPCR, respectively. PM10 daily exposure levels, based on maternal residential address, were estimated for different gestational periods using models based on satellite data. Epigenome-wide analysis to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) was conducted, followed by a pathway analysis and replication analysis in an second Piccolipiu dataset. Distributed lag models (DLMs) using weekly exposures were used to study the association of PM10 exposure across pregnancy with telomere length, as well as with the DMPs that showed robust associations.Results: Gestational PM10 exposure was associated with the DNA methylation of more than 250 unique DMPs, most of them identified in early gestation, and 1 DMR. Out of 151 DMPs available in the replication dataset, ten DMPs showed robust associations: eight were associated with exposure during early gestation and 2 with exposure during the whole pregnancy. These exposure windows were supported by the DLM analysis. The PM10 exposure between 15th and 20th gestational week seem to be associated with shorter telomeres at birth, while exposure between 24th and 29th was associated with longer telomeres.Discussion: The early pregnancy period is a potential critical window during which PM10 exposure can influence cord blood DNA methylation. The results from the TL analysis were consistent with previous findings and merit further exploration in future studies. The study underlines the importance of considering gestational windows outside of the predefined trimesters that may not always overlap with biologically relevant windows of exposure.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Status epilepticus (SE) is a common life-threatening neurological emergency that can cause long-term impairments. Overall outcomes remain poor. Major efforts are required to clarify the epidemiology of SE and the determinants of outcomes, thereby identifying targets for improved management.Methods and analysis ICTAL Registry is a multicentre open cohort of critically ill patients with convulsive, non-convulsive or psychogenic non-epileptic SE. Observational methods are applied to collect uniform data. The goal of the ICTAL Registry is to collect high-quality information on a large number of patients, thereby allowing elucidation of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in mortality and morbidity. The registry structure is modular, with a large core data set and the opportunity for research teams to create satellite data sets for observational or interventional studies (eg, cohort multiple randomised controlled trials, cross-sectional studies and short-term and long-term longitudinal outcome studies). The availability of core data will hasten patient recruitment to studies, while also decreasing costs. Importantly, the vast amount of data from a large number of patients will allow valid subgroup analyses, which are expected to identify patient populations requiring specific treatment strategies. The results of the studies will have a broad spectrum of application, particularly given the multidisciplinary approach used by the IctalGroup research network.Ethics and dissemination The ICTAL Registry protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the French Intensive Care Society (#CE_SRLF 19-68 and 19-68a). Patients or their relatives/proxies received written information to the use of the retrospectively collected and pseudonymised data, in compliance with French law. Prospectively included patients receive written consent form as soon as they recover decision-making competency; if they refuse consent, they are excluded from the registry. Data from the registry will be disseminated via conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.

TI  - Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy in Patients With Minimally Involved Lymph Nodes: A Review of the Current Data and Future Directions
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Radiation therapy for patients with pN1mi or pN1 disease breast cancer undergoing mastectomy has been debated for a long time. Even in low metastatic burden in sentinel node biopsy, occult non-sentinel axillary nodal involvement can exist. Radiotherapy can sterilize axillary metastatic burden and seems to contribute a very low local recurrence rate in mastectomy patients with minimally involved lymph nodes. However, it should be considered that systemic therapy is evolving and the local recurrence difference between radiotherapy and no radiotherapy is relatively small. Regarding postmastectomy radiotherapy in patients pN1mi or pN1 cancer, published prospective clinical trial results should be considered; however, there are no such relevant results of clinical trials yet. Consideration of postmastectomy radiation therapy in pN1mi or pN1 patients should be based on identifying the high-risk group in terms of recurrence, stage, or tumor biology. When radiotherapy is determined, radiation oncologists should attempt individualized treatment approaches, such as irradiation field, and consider specific settings, such as neoadjuvant therapy. In this review, the role of radiotherapy in mastectomy patients with minimally involved lymph nodes and the relevant considerations are discussed.

TI  - A Novel Approach to Validate Satellite Snowfall Retrievals by Ground-Based Point Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method has been proposed for validating satellite radar snowfall retrievals using surface station observations over the western United States mountainous region, where the mean snowfall rate at a station depends on its elevation. First, all station data within a 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid are used to develop a snowfall rate versus elevation relation. This relation is then used to compute snowfall rate in other locations within the 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid, as if surface observations were available everywhere in the grid. Grid mean snowfall rates are then derived, which should be more representative to the mean snowfall rate of the grid than using data at any one station or from a simple mean of all stations in the grid. Comparison of the so-derived grid mean snowfall rates with CloudSat retrievals shows that the CloudSat product underestimates snowfall by about 65% when averaged over all the 768 grids in the western United States mountainous regions. The bias does not seem to have clear dependency on elevation but strongly depends on snowfall rate. As an application of the method, we further estimated the snowfall to precipitation ratio using both ground and satellite measured data. It is found that the rates of increase with elevation of the snowfall to precipitation ratio are quite similar when calculating from ground and satellite data, being about 25% per kilometer elevation up or approximately 4% per every degree Cuisses of temperature drop.

TI  - Monitoring Rock Desert Formation Caused by Ice-Snow Melting in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using an Optimized Remote Sensing Technique: A Case Study of Yushu Prefecture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and effective identification of the spatial distribution of rock deserts in ice- snow melting areas can provide useful information for the prevention of natural disasters. In this study, Landsat TM/OLI were used to track the evolution of snow lines in the snow melting areas of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (hereinafter referred to as Yushu Prefecture) during the last 30 years. A total of seven extraction schemes were used to classify the rock desert in the ice-snow melting area by remote sensing. Our results show that: (1) The accuracy of the multi-index factor compound analysis and object-oriented classification compound method was the highest. This method can provide a rapid and efficient reference scheme for rock desert extraction in the plateau ice-snow melting area. (2) The combinations of two single methods with higher accuracy can further improve the total accuracy. If a single method with lower accuracy is involved in the multi-method fusion, the accuracy of the method with lower accuracy can be improved. (3) In the past 30 years, there has been a large amount of ice-snow melting in Yushu Prefecture. The ice-snow melting area accounts for 53.78% (1451.04 km(2)) of the ice-snow area, and the bare rock and bare stone in the rock desert account for 63.77% of the total area of the ice-snow melting area. Bare sand and bare soil area account for 30.27% of the total area of ice and snow melting area.

TI  - Vegetation Monitoring of Protected Areas in Rugged Mountains Using an Improved Shadow-Eliminated Vegetation Index (SEVI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is significant to study the vegetation of protected areas in rugged mountains where the vegetation grows naturally with minimal eco-society environmental stress from anthropogenic activities. The shadow-eliminated vegetation index (SEVI) was used to monitor the vegetation of protected areas, since it successfully removes topographic shadow effects. In order to auto achieve the best adjustment factor for SEVI calculation from regional area images, we developed a new calculation algorithm using block information entropy (BIE-algorithm). The BIE-algorithm auto-detected typical blocks (subareas) from slope images and achieved the best adjustment factor from a block where the SEVI obtained the highest information entropy in an entire scene. Our obtained regional SEVI result from two scenes of Landsat 8 OLI images using the BIE-algorithm exhibited an overall flat feature with the impression of the relief being drastically removed. It achieved balanced values among three types of samples: Sunny area, self-shadow, and cast shadow, with SEVI means of 0.73, 0.77, and 0.75, respectively, and the corresponding SEVI relative errors of self-shadow and cast shadow were only 4.99% and 1.84%, respectively. The linear regression of SEVI vs. the cosine of the solar incidence angle was nearly horizontal, with an inclination of -0.0207 and a coefficient of determination of 0.0042. The regional SEVI revealed that the vegetation growth level sequence of three protected areas was Wuyishan National Park (SEVI mean of 0.718) > Meihuashan National Nature Reserve (0.672) > Minjiangyuan National Nature Reserve (0.624) > regional background (0.572). The vegetation growth in the protected areas was influenced by the terrain slope and years of establishment of the protected area and by the surrounding buffer zone. The homogeneous distribution of vegetation in a block is influenced by many factors, such as the actual vegetation types, block size, and shape, which need consideration when the proposed BIE-algorithm is used.

AB  - Zhongguo dangdai shaoshu minzu ertong wenxue yuanchuang shuxi [A contemporary Chinese ethnic minority children's literature series] is a collection of ten novels published in 2017 describing the life of young children from a variety of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities in China generally live in rural areas and hold holistic and animistic world views. While this series contains abundant descriptions of distinctive landscapes and animals, these natural elements are not meant to be mysterious or sacred, but a tangible part of everyday life. The nature writing in the series plays with new possibilities and manifests a shift from a transcendent and metaphysical worldview to one that is epistemologically imminent and empirical, which suggests the new generation's readiness to embrace modernity in an ecologically harmonious way.

M3  - Article
AB  - In order to reveal the characteristics of pre-seismic deformation and co-seismic rupture of the 2021 Qinghai Madoi M(w)7. 4 earthquake, we systematically collect the GNSS data from Qinghai CORS and Crustal Movement Observation Network of China and the SAR data from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellites, and obtain the dynamic deformation field of the Madoi earthquake by the integrated processing of multi-source data. The pre-seismic GNSS deformation field shows that the Madoi focal area is located at the edge of the high-value region of shear deformation in the north of the earthquake, and sinistral shear strain was accumulated there before the earthquake. The 3-D co-seismic deformation field shows that the KunlunshanPass-Jiangcuo fault has a significant sinistral rupture, and the co-seismic deformation mainly occurs within 100 km from the fault with a maximum horizontal component of 2.4 m. The vertical co-seismic deformation mainly occurs in the vicinity of the fault, and shows alternately positive and negative variation from one side of the fault to the other, which reveals the spatial diversity of dip angles of the ruptured fault. The result of the joint inversion of GNSS and InSAR shows that the rupture of the Madoi earthquake reaches the surface, which is mainly distributed above 15 km depth, with the maximum slip value at about 4 m, and the moment magnitude is about 7.4. The rupture along the fault strike shows an obvious segmental characteristic, and five regions with significant slip values are distributed discontinuously.

TI  - Reconstruction of daily evapotranspiration under cloudy sky constrained by soil water budget balance
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a significant role in fields of agriculture, hydrology, and meteorology, including the irrigation water allocation, water resources management, drought monitoring and climate change studies. However, because of contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daily ET from thermal infrared remote sensing data under cloudy sky bristles with difficulties. In this paper, we proposed a physical and practical method for daily ET reconstruction under cloudy sky that was constrained by soil water budget balance with investigation of the soil water stress relationship between available water fraction and potential ET ratio. This method was tested on both totally field data from 2001 to 2015 at 10 AmeriFlux sites and MODIS remote sensing data from 2009 to 2010 at the Yucheng site in China. Results showed that the reconstructed daily ET under cloudy sky agreed well with the in-situ eddy covariance measurements, with the mean average error (MAE) ranging from -12.20 W/m(2) to 16.77 W/m(2), the mot mean square error (RMSE) varying from 9.47 W/m(2) to 28.97 W/m(2) at the 10 AmeriFlux sites, the MAE of 2.62 W/m(2), and the RMSE of 35.21 W/m(2) at the Yucheng site. Overall, the proposed method is promising in reconstructing daily ET under cloudy sky and can be a good alternative to the conventional interpolating/extrapolating methods. Future work may focus on the further investigation of the proposed method over a wider range of atmospheric, soil and vegetation conditions.

TI  - Remote Sensing Pansharpening by Full-Depth Feature Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is an important yet challenging remote sensing image processing task, which aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) multispectral (MS) image by fusing a HR panchromatic (PAN) image and a low-resolution (LR) MS image. Though deep learning (DL)-based pansharpening methods have achieved encouraging performance, they are infeasible to fully utilize the deep semantic features and shallow contextual features in the process of feature fusion for a HR-PAN image and LR-MS image. In this paper, we propose an efficient full-depth feature fusion network (FDFNet) for remote sensing pansharpening. Specifically, we design three distinctive branches called PAN-branch, MS-branch, and fusion-branch, respectively. The features extracted from the PAN and MS branches will be progressively injected into the fusion branch at every different depth to make the information fusion more broad and comprehensive. With this structure, the low-level contextual features and high-level semantic features can be characterized and integrated adequately. Extensive experiments on reduced- and full-resolution datasets acquired from WorldView-3, QuickBird, and GaoFen-2 sensors demonstrate that the proposed FDFNet only with less than 100,000 parameters performs better than other detail injection-based proposals and several state-of-the-art approaches, both visually and quantitatively.

TI  - Assessment of Zoonotic Risk following Diagnosis of Canine Tularemia in a Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tularemia is a rare zoonotic disease found worldwide. The agent responsible for disease, Francisella tularensis, is one of the most highly infectious pathogens known, one that is capable of causing life-threatening illness with inhalation of <50 organisms. High infectivity explains concerns of its use in bioterrorism. This case describes a 4-year-old male neutered Australian shepherd presented for evaluation of hyporexia and fever. Physical examination revealed marked enlargement of the right superficial cervical lymph node. Tularemia lymphadenitis was diagnosed by lymph node aspiration cytology and culture. Public health officials were advised of the isolation of this zoonotic pathogen, and contact tracing was instituted. Seven individuals associated with the aspiration event were screened for tularemia and treated with prophylactic ciprofloxacin. All were negative, and none became sick. The dog was treated with doxycycline for 3 weeks, and clinical signs and physical examination abnormalities were resolved fully. The owner, a solid organ transplant recipient, was also screened for disease and received prophylactic doxycycline due to a history of shared exposure. The owner remained well throughout the course of his dog's disease and has heightened awareness of potential zoonoses. This case highlights the importance of animals as a sentinel for human health threats and for coordination of human and veterinary care.

TI  - Bridging the Gap of the Afri-Eurocentric Worldview Divide in a Postcolonial South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This paper is an attempt to bridge the gap between Africentric and Eurocentric worldviews through the lens of positive psychology's second wave of attaining pathways to well-being. Methods: The overcoming of existential suffering with indigenous understandings has been addressed through photo-elicitation in retrospective timelines with students Lihile+, Tanaka+, and Diana+, +Pseudonyms to protect identity Thematic analysis with semi-structured virtual interviews has also been utilized to gain insights into Africentric and Eurocentric worldviews. All students come from different contexts of cultural complexity. Lihile was raised by her maternal Xhosa family, with a traditional Sotho father. Tanaka is Shona, born and schooled in Zimbabwe, studying in South Africa. Diana was born in England and is now living in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Findings: Students' worldviews were shaped by their primary caregivers' multicultural influences, as well as their exposure to educational and religious contact zones. Despite having to survive the traumatic legacy of social injustices, the students managed to pursue positive goals and transcend challenges and achieve well-being. Conclusions: This study attempted to transcend the divide of Afri-Eurocentric worldviews towards a shared responsibility to develop an improved social science in Africa. Positive psychology offered a space to accommodate well-being as a healing process, not only for the oppressed but also the oppressors of past social injustices.

TI  - Monitoring and evaluation Al-Razzaza lake changes in Iraq using GIS and remote sensing technology q
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses remote sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems GIS to monitor and evaluate the changes in the shoreline and the surface water area of Al-Razzazah Lake in Iraq from the year 1989 until 2020. Based on six satellite Landsat images of the study area for the years 1989, 1999, 2002, 2015, 2019, and 2020, changes were evaluated and mapped. Two methods; Support Vector Machine SVM and ISO cluster classifiers have been used to classify and extract the surface water area. The results showed the great change and the heavy loss that this lake was exposed until the year 2019. The surface water area decreased by 84.1% from 1631.72 km2 in 1989 to 259.65 km2 in 2019. Also, the shoreline was decreased by 63.4% from 451.98 km in 1989 to 165.46 km in 2019. Most changes happened in the north part and east part of the lake. Otherwise, an increase in the surface area of the lake was observed in the year 2020. This indicates the lake's recovery again, which forces the responsible authorities to take the necessary management to maintain the lake's continuity and prevent drought. The retraction ratio of the shoreline and surface water area of Al-Razzazah Lake was in ascending values from the year 1989 up to 2019 at an extreme rate. This retraction negatively affects Iraq; socially, economically, and environmentally alike. It determines the quantity available to the lake and its default age.

TI  - High-Resolution Seamless Daily Sea Surface Temperature Based on Satellite Data Fusion and Machine Learning over Kuroshio Extension
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea SurfaceTemperature (SST) is a critical parameter for monitoring the marine environment and understanding various ocean phenomena. While SST can be regularly retrieved from satellite data, it often suffers from missing data due to various reasons including cloud contamination. In this study, we proposed a novel two-step data fusion framework for generating high-resolution seamless daily SST from multi-satellite data sources. The proposed approach consists of (1) SST reconstruction based on Data Interpolate Convolutional AutoEncoder (DINCAE) using the SSTs derived from two satellite sensors (i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2(AMSR2)), and (2) SST improvement through data fusion using random forest for consistency with in situ measurements with two schemes (i.e., scheme 1 using the reconstructed MODIS SST variables and scheme 2 using both MODIS and AMSR2 SST variables). The proposed approach was evaluated over the Kuroshio Extension in the Northwest Pacific, where a highly dynamic SST pattern can be found, from 2015 to 2019. The results showed that the reconstructed MODIS and AMSR2 SSTs through DINCAE yielded very good performance with Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of 0.85 and 0.60 degrees C and Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) of 0.59 and 0.45 degrees C, respectively. The results from the second step showed that scheme 2 and scheme 1 produced RMSEs of 0.75 and 0.98 degrees C and MAEs of 0.53 and 0.68 degrees C, respectively, compared to the in situ measurements, which proved the superiority of scheme 2 using multi-satellite data sources. Scheme 2 also showed comparable or even better performance than two operational SST products with similar spatial resolution. In particular, scheme 2 was good at simulating features with fine resolution (~50 km). The proposed approach yielded promising results over the study area, producing seamless daily SST products with high quality and high feature resolution.

TI  - The evolution of the thematic zone "Age" in Marina Tsvetaeva's poetic worldview
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an analysis of the development of the thematic zone "Age" in Marina Tsvetaeva's conceptual sphere. The study is based on the thematic classification of text paradigms of the antonymic type, taking into account contrast as a lexical regulatory universal in the poet's work. Lexical regulatory universals are understood as peculiarities of authorial thinking and way of interacting with the addressee verbalized in author's characteristic means and methods of lexical regulation. The research methodology is complex; it includes the method of observation; contextological, quantitative, biographical analyses, etc. The material for the study was 1098 textual paradigms of the antonymic type, identified in 586 poems and 82 cycles in Tsvetaeva's lyrics of the 1910s-1940s. The analysis of the dynamics of Tsvetaeva's attitude to the concept of age aims to trace not only changes in the author's views, but also the development of personality, changes in the poet's worldview. The thematic classification of text paradigms of the antonymic type is based on the concept of R. Hallig and W. Wartburg, which consists in systematizing the lexical system of the language by distributing words into three main categories: "Human", "Universe", "Universe and Human", which are clarified in the article based on the study of Tsvetaeva's works. Examples of antonymic paradigms reflecting the authorial perception of age in the early, mature and late lyrics of Tsvetaeva are given. The opposition "youth" - "old age", which is characteristic of Tsvetaeva's early and mature lyrics, is among the key paradigms of the antonymic type. In the late lyrics, this paradigm is replaced by the contrasting pair "old" - "older". In the 1920s, the antonymic paradigms of "grandfathers" - "grandchildren", "grandchildren" - "great-grandchildren", "ancestor" - "great-grandson", etc. are actualized in Tsvetaeva's works, which is associated with the understanding of the periodization of the poet's own life, the emergence of a natural interest in the past and future. In the 1930s, the connection between the "Age" category and the "Time" category is becoming stronger in Tsvetaeva's works. The poet considers herself to be the outgoing generation, experiences worries for future generations, for children. The article examines the peculiarities of the poet's attitude to her own age at different periods of her life, assesses the correlation between the chronological age and its subjective perception by the poet. Taking into account the tendency towards a discrepancy between the chronological and subjective age of Tsvetaeva in adulthood in favor of exaggerating the latter, a conclusion is made about the poet's self-awareness, about the possible despondency, a depressive psychological state of Tsvetaeva in the last years of her life.

TI  - Monitoring Particulate Matter with Wearable Sensors and the Influence on Student Environmental Attitudes
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The mobile monitoring of air pollution is a growing field, prospectively filling in spatial gaps while personalizing air-quality-based risk assessment. We developed wearable sensors to record particulate matter (PM), and through a community science approach, students of partnering Chicago high schools monitored PM concentrations during their commutes over a five- and thirteen-day period. Our main objective was to investigate how mobile monitoring influenced students' environmental attitudes and we did this by having the students explore the relationship between PM concentrations and urban vegetation. Urban vegetation was approximated with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. While the linear regression for one partner school indicated a negative correlation between PM and vegetation, the other indicated a positive correlation, contrary to our expectations. Survey responses were scored on the basis of their environmental affinity and knowledge. There were no significant differences between cumulative pre- and post-experiment survey responses at Josephinum Academy, and only one weakly significant difference in survey results at DePaul Prep in the Knowledge category. However, changes within certain attitudinal subscales may possibly suggest that students were inclined to practice more sustainable behaviors, but perhaps lacked the resources to do so.

TI  - Evaluation of ecosystem stability against climate changes via satellite data in the eastern sandy area of northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive and frequent climate change events (e.g., droughts or extreme weather) significantly affect vulnerable water-limited ecosystems. Until now, the ecosystem stability against climate changes in regional scale sandy lands remain unclear. In this study, the AutoRegression (ARx) model was combined with time-series Net Primary Productivity (NPP) data to extract stability metrics (e.g., temporal stability, resilience, drought-resistance, and temperature-resistance) to evaluate the stability of the main sandy land regions of Northern China. Strong correlations among ecosystem stability metrics were found in the study area, such as the significant negative correlation between resilience and resistance (r =-0.49, p < 0.01), the strong positive correlation between drought-resistance and temperature-resistance, (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), except for the uncorrelation between resilience and temporal stability. Meanwhile, more unstable regions were found in the western low-or moderate -cover sandy grassland. Due to the differences of factors (e.g. hydrothermal conditions, vegetation species composition, and other disturbances or anthropogenic impacts), the unstable grasslands and barren regions, Otindag and Hulun Buir sandy lands, and slightly desertified area (SL) presented more resilience but less resistance and variance than the forest and cropland, Horqin Sandy Land, and Moderate (M) or Severe desertified areas (S), respectively. Thus, the unstable low-or moderate-cover grassland and SL area should be paid much more attention to meet the challenges of more intense climate extremes in the future.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and determining the amount of water in reservoirs is of great importance in terms of water planning and management. This study proposes a geographic information system (GIS)-based methodology to estimate the water volume changes in water reservoirs. Two specific methods are proposed using Australian National University's Digital Elevation Model (ANUDEM) raster surface and Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) surface models, both utilizing normalized difference water index (NDWI) of Sentinel 2A satellite images for water-covered area and coastline and digital elevation model (DEM) for 3D modelling of the reservoir. The most crucial part of this study is the comprehensive evaluation of the model findings considering hydrological, meteorological and anthropogenic factors, simultaneously. Application of the proposed methods is provided for the analysis of the multi-temporal water volume changes of Bayramic Dam Lake (canakkale, Turkey) in two hydrological periods covering the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 water years. The results indicate that the TINS model produced water volume values much closer to the in situ Turkish General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) values than the ANUDEM model. The performance of these methods was also assessed by the temporal dynamics of surface hydrological processes. Regarding the water storage dynamics, hydro-meteorological factors influence the water input, while anthropogenic factors strongly influence the water output. Water consumption for irrigation and electricity generation was found to be the most important water budget components of the total water consumption.

TI  - High Cadence Monitoring of Reservoir Volume Fluctuations Using PlanetScope Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images, which are effectively used to monitor changes in water areas, water management and planning, and to determine the measures to be taken against possible natural disasters, provide data with high temporal and spatial resolution. This study represents the monitoring of temporal surface water dynamics and estimating the volume fluctuations by combining the in-situ data with remotely sensed area data for Kemer Dam, containing the Arapapis,ti Canyon (Turkey). Also, it demonstrates the production of the underwater topography in the water reservoir areas of absent or difficult to obtain bottom topography by integrating the in-situ water level and the PlanetScope Remote Sensing data in GIS environment. The temporal changes of dynamic volume of the reservoir above the lowest water level were estimated by the Hypsometric Relationship equation, Pyramidal Frustum Model and TIN-based Calculation method and their accuracy were evaluated using in-situ data. The simplicity and ease of application of the Pyramidal Frustum method, as well as its relatively low RMSE and Standard Error Rate of the Regression (SER) values, compared to other methods in this study, increase its usability in such studies. PlanetScope Imagery will make an important contribution to hydrological studies by producing daily images in high-resolution. Mission characteristics of satellite images (e.g. spatial, temporal and spectral resolution and, geometric accuracy), data sparseness, concurrency in parameters, chosen volume calculation method and linearity of hypsometry are important components that affect the performance of the Volume Fluctuation Monitoring studies using satellite images.

TI  - Using ensemble learning to take advantage of high-resolution radar backscatter in conjunction with surface features to disaggregate SMAP soil moisture product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based retrieved of soil moisture from low frequency passive microwave observations is preferred in different aspects such as better spatial coverage and more measurement compared to traditional ground-based measurements. However, due to coarse spatial resolution of the observations, their applications are limited in local to regional studies. This paper provides a framework using random forest regression to disaggregate the daily SMAP enhanced soil moisture (SPL3SMP_E) utilizing several ancillary data to overcome the spatial resolution limits and cloudiness effects. Ancillaries were acquired from sentinel-1 radar, MODIS monthly NDVI, land cover, topography, and surface soil properties. To validate the downscaled results with 1-km spatial resolution, the OZNET soil moisture measurements and sparse TDR ground soil moisture measurements were collected from Murrumbidgee catchment (Australia) and Firozabad catchment (Iran), respectively. Downscaled soil moisture product unbiased root-mean-square error (UnbRMSE) of ensemble learning demonstrated a range of 0.023 and -0.07 cm(3)/cm(3). The produced downscaled soil moisture exhibited better local heterogeneity when compared to the coarse data and tracked the dynamics of temporal changes in soil moisture. Furthermore, cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis showed good accuracy of downscaled soil moisture in grassland and cropland. Taken together, the findings supported usefulness of the suggested methodology in downscaling the medium- resolution SMAP soil moisture product.

TI  - Environmental Impact on Harmful Species <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp. and <i>Phaeocystis globosa</i> Phenology and Niche
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environmental change modifies the phytoplankton community, which leads to variations in their phenology and potentially causes a temporal mismatch between primary producers and consumers. In parallel, phytoplankton community change can favor the appearance of harmful species, which makes the understanding of the mechanisms involved in structuring phytoplankton ecological niches paramount for preventing future risk. In this study, we aimed to assess for the first time the relationship between environmental conditions, phenology and niche ecology of harmful species Phaeocystis globosa and the complex Pseudo-nitzschia along the French coast of the eastern English Channel. A new method of bloom detection within a time-series was developed, which allowed the characterization of 363 blooms by 22 phenological variables over 11 stations from 1998 to 2019. The pairwise quantification of asymmetric dependencies between the phenological variables revealed the implication of different mechanisms, common and distinct between the taxa studied. A PERMANOVA helped to reveal the importance of seasonal change in the environmental and community variables. The Outlying Mean and the Within Outlying Mean indexes allowed us to position the harmful taxa niche among the rest of community and quantify how their respective phenology impacted the dynamic of their subniches. We also discussed the possible hypothesis involved and the perspective of predictive models.

TI  - Beyond land cover: How integrated remote sensing and social media data analysis facilitates assessment of cultural ecosystem services
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coupled usage of remote sensing and geotagged social media data responds to the growing interest in the spatially explicit operationalisation of cultural ecosystem services (CES). However, synergies of integrated usage of these data sources have not yet been unveiled to improve CES accessibility. This study aimed at applying the integrated remote sensing-social media framework to analyse the suitability of landscape pattern for CES use and explore CES availability in Estonia. We first spatially analysed the demand for selected CES-landscape watching, outdoor recreation, and wildlife watching-depicted in geotagged photographs. Second, we modelled CES supply as relative environmental suitability for the presence of CES related photographs, performing a proxy to the potential capacity of landscapes to provide opportunities for CES use. Third, we estimated the population density in spatial clusters of relatively low and high CES supply. We revealed the discrepancies between pop-ulation density and accessibility of CES supply and CES providing areas within this integrative framework. As a result, we detected populated areas requiring in-depth CES assessment and prioritisation to restore, preserve, and, where necessary, enhance CES stocks. Our replicable and spatially explicit methodology improves rapid CES assessment across scales, given the nearly global character of remote sensing and social media data.

TI  - Model of the Equatorial Anomaly in <i>foF</i>2 Based on Interkosmos-19 Data for High Solar Activity
T2  - GEOMAGNETISM AND AERONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - An empirical model of the equatorial anomaly in the critical frequency foF2 of the ionospheric F2 layer is constructed. The model is based on Interkosmos-19 satellite data obtained in 1979-1981 for quiet conditions under high solar activity. The model reproduces the latitudinal, longitudinal, diurnal, and seasonal foF2 variations within +/- 70 degrees of magnetic inclination. The equatorial anomaly predicted by the model for any season begins to develop from similar to 08 LT. The anomaly is clearly expressed until 02 LT and completely disappears at 04-06 LT. The foF2 distribution in the region of equatorial anomaly has been studied in detail for different seasons and local time hours and was corrected against Interkosmos-19 data earlier; therefore, the model more adequately reproduces the longitudinal variations in foF2 than the IRI model, especially at the equator and over oceans. As a result, the model also more accurately reproduces the latitudinal foF2 variations; specifically, the structure of the Weddell Sea anomaly, than the IRI model. The discrepancies between the new model and IRI-2016 for any season peak in the Pacific longitudinal sector, which contains few ground-based stations. The discrepancies are large at midnight (the decay of the equatorial anomaly according to the IRI model begins earlier than it starts according to satellite data) and in the morning at 06 LT (according to IRI, the foF2 begins to increase much earlier than the sunrise time). The new model is presented in the form of a program on the site of IZMIRAN: https://www.izmiran.ru/ionosphere/eia/. The program makes it possible to calculate the foF2 values at each point; the longitudinal, latitudinal, diurnal, and seasonal variations in foF2; and the foF2 distribution for fixed LT and UT times.

TI  - Mapping Co-Cr-Cu and Fe Occurrence in a Legacy Mining Waste Using Geochemistry and Satellite Imagery Analyses
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Abandoned mining wastes are both an environmental challenge and a possible secondary raw material source. The characterization and monitoring of these sites are often expensive and cumbersome because of the need of repeated field surveys. Remote sensing data are a cost-effective alternative that helps in producing multiscale maps of mining wastes. These maps can be used to investigate and monitor the spatial patterns of different elements within the mining wastes. In this work, Sentinel-2 images are combined with the geochemical samples in order to map the distribution of iron, copper, chromium, and cobalt. The target area was the Vigonzano mining wastes in Northern Apennines (Italy) where there are a small number of geochemical analyses but a large amount of satellite image data. We used the multivariate geostatistical estimation method (Co-Kriging) that exploit the meaningful spatial correlation between the elements of interest and band ratios (obtained from Sentinel-2 images). The concentration maps highlighted subareas for Cu and Cr with an estimated grade of about 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. In addition, the critical element Co showed an enrichment in the south-east part of the mining wastes, in a similar pattern as Cr. Instead, the obtained maps show Ce, La, Rb, and Nb depletion compared to the surrounding agricultural areas. The concentration maps were intended as a prefeasibility study to determine enriched areas for further detailed investigation.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy of MODIS MCD64A1 C6 and FireCCI51 Burned Area Products in Mediterranean Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The catastrophic impact of wildfires on the economy and ecosystems of Mediterranean countries in recent years, along with insufficient policies that favor disproportionally high funding for fire suppression, demand a more comprehensive understanding of fire regimes. Satellite remote sensing products support the generation of relevant burned-area (BA) information, since they provide the means for the systematic monitoring of large areas worldwide at low cost. This research study assesses the accuracy of the two publicly available MODIS BA products, MCD64A1 C6 and FireCCI51, at a national scale in a Mediterranean country. The research period covered four fire seasons, and a comparison was conducted against a higher-resolution Sentinel-2 dataset. The specific objectives were to assess their performance in detecting fire events occurring primarily in forest and semi-natural lands and to investigate their spatial and temporal uncertainties. Monthly fire observations were processed and analyzed to derive a comprehensive set of accuracy metrics. We found that fire size has an impact on their detection accuracy, with higher detection occurring in fires larger than 100 ha. Detection of smaller (<100 ha) fires was favored by the 250 m FireCCI51 product, but not from MCD64A1 C6, which exhibited less than 50% detection probability in the same range. Their spatial estimates of burned area exhibited a fairly satisfactory agreement with the reference data, reaching an average of 78% in detection rate. MCD64A1 C6 exhibited a more consistent spatial performance overall and better temporal accuracy, whereas FireCCI51 did not substantially outperform the former despite its finer resolution. Additional research is required for a more rigorous assessment of the variability of these burned area products, yet this research provides further insight and has implications for their use in fire-related applications at the local to the national scale.

TI  - Developments of GNSS buoy for a synthetic geohazard monitoring system
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE JAPAN ACADEMY SERIES B-PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - A global navigation satellite system (GNSS) buoy system for early tsunami warnings has been developed for more than 20 years. The first GNSS buoy system using a real-time kinematic algorithm (RTK) was implemented in the Nationwide Ocean Wave information network for Ports and HArbourS (NOWPHAS) wave monitoring system in Japan in 2008. The records of NOWPHAS were used to update the tsunami alert by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), owing to the tsunami generated by the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw9.0). However, considering that the distance limit is less than 20km for the RTK algorithm, a new system was designed by introducing a new positioning algorithm and satellite data transmission to place the buoy much farther from the coast. A new technique for the continuous monitoring of ocean-bottom crustal movements was also implemented in the new system. The new buoy system can be used for weather forecasting and ionospheric monitoring as well.

TI  - Whole Genome Sequence Analysis of the Plasma Proteome in Black Adults Provides Novel Insights Into Cardiovascular Disease
T2  - CIRCULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Plasma proteins are critical mediators of cardiovascular processes and are the targets of many drugs. Previous efforts to characterize the genetic architecture of the plasma proteome have been limited by a focus on individuals of European descent and leveraged genotyping arrays and imputation. Here we describe whole genome sequence analysis of the plasma proteome in individuals with greater African ancestry, increasing our power to identify novel genetic determinants. Methods: Proteomic profiling of 1301 proteins was performed in 1852 Black adults from the Jackson Heart Study using aptamer-based proteomics (SomaScan). Whole genome sequencing association analysis was ascertained for all variants with minor allele count >= 5. Results were validated using an alternative, antibody-based, proteomic platform (Olink) as well as replicated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the HERITAGE Family Study (Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training and Genetics). Results: We identify 569 genetic associations between 479 proteins and 438 unique genetic regions at a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of 3.8x10(-11). These associations include 114 novel locus-protein relationships and an additional 217 novel sentinel variant-protein relationships. Novel cardiovascular findings include new protein associations at the APOE gene locus including ZAP70 (sentinel single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs7412-T, beta=0.61 +/- 0.05, P=3.27x10(-30)) and MMP-3 (beta=-0.60 +/- 0.05, P=1.67x10(-32)), as well as a completely novel pleiotropic locus at the HPX gene, associated with 9 proteins. Further, the associations suggest new mechanisms of genetically mediated cardiovascular disease linked to African ancestry; we identify a novel association between variants linked to APOL1-associated chronic kidney and heart disease and the protein CKAP2 (rs73885319-G, beta=0.34 +/- 0.04, P=1.34x10(-17)) as well as an association between ATTR amyloidosis and RBP4 levels in community-dwelling individuals without heart failure. Conclusions: Taken together, these results provide evidence for the functional importance of variants in non-European populations, and suggest new biological mechanisms for ancestry-specific determinants of lipids, coagulation, and myocardial function.

TI  - Effect of Time Window on Satellite and Ground-Based Data for Estimating Chlorophyll-a in Reservoirs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms in freshwater ecosystems can negatively impact aquatic and human health. Satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) is often used to help determine the severity of algal blooms. However, satellite revisit flyover schedules may not match the erratic nature of algal blooms. Studies have paired satellite and ground-based data that were not collected on the same day, assuming Chl-a concentrations did not change significantly by the flyover date. We determined the effects of an increasing time window between satellite overpass dates and field-based collection of Chl-a on algorithms for Landsat 5, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2, using 14 years (2006-2020) of Chl-a data from 10 Oklahoma reservoirs. Multiple regression models were built, and selected statistics were used to rank the time windows. The Sentinel-2 results showed strong relationships between Chl-a and satellite data collected up to a +/- 5-day window. The strength of these relationships decreased beyond a +/- 3-day time window for Landsat 8 and a +/- 1-day time window for Landsat 5. Our results suggest that the time window between field sampling and satellite overpass can impact the use of satellite data for Chl-a monitoring in reservoirs. Furthermore, longer time windows can be used with higher resolution (spatial, spectral) satellites.

TI  - Iceberg-Induced Tsunamis Near Dalk Glacier, Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A unique local tsunami had a very large impact on the coastal stations near Dalk Glacier; this kind of tsunami is related to iceberg activity. To provide a reference for tsunami warning and disaster prevention at these coastal research stations, a total of 41 abnormal water-surface oscillations caused by iceberg-induced tsunamis have been recorded and analyzed since February 2010. The seasonal and interannual variations in the tsunamis were determined by analyzing meteorological data and Landsat imagery. Based on these variation characteristics, double exponential smoothing was employed to fit the historical records and predict the next occurrence of an iceberg-induced tsunami, including the time and maximum absolute value of elevation of water-surface oscillation. The results showed that the date prediction error could be within a week, and the mean relative error of prediction for the elevation of water-surface oscillation was approximately 36.8%. Despite instability of prediction accuracies, this study provides an important clue to iceberg-induced tsunami warning and disaster prevention at coastal stations near calving glaciers, as well as for safe berthing and unloading of research vessels near these stations.

TI  - Monitoring standing herbaceous biomass and thresholds in semiarid rangelands from harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to support within-season adaptive management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Adaptive management requires rangeland managers to respond to changing forage conditions (e.g., standing herbaceous biomass) within the grazing season at the scale of individual pastures. While within-season biomass can be measured or estimated in the field, it is often impractical to make field measurements in extensive rangeland systems with adequate frequency and spatial representation for responsive decision-making by rangeland managers. We sought to develop a single model to accurately predict daily herbaceous biomass across seasonally and annually varying conditions from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel satellite time series. We also sought to assess how information about plant community composition derived from a high-spatial resolution map would improve model performance. We used herbaceous biomass data from 1764 ground observations collected over 8 years in North American shortgrass steppe for training in a cross-validated model selection approach to evaluate (1) predictive performance of candidate models both spatially and temporally, (2) relative variable importance of individual spectral bands, vegetation indices, and recently developed broadband spectral angle indices, and (3) the degree to which including plant community composition improved model performance. All 11 candidate models identified in the model selection procedure contained a band angle index and an individual spectral band, and 6 contained one of each input feature type, demonstrating the benefit of combining spectral features for predicting herbaceous biomass across varying conditions. The spatial and temporal cross-validation and selection procedures produced the same top model with similar performance (mean absolute error = 151-182 kg ha(-1); R-2 = 0.75-0.79), suggesting that a single model performs well over space and time. Including plant community composition in the model reduced mean absolute error by 11-13%. Bootstrapping revealed that -six to seven years of training data were required to achieve consistent model performance across years with varying environmental conditions (e.g., wet, average, dry). The top model could accurately detect (70-87% accuracy) the week that biomass dropped below management-related thresholds as low as 450 kg ha(-1) in an independent dataset (n = 950) with modest commission error (10-26%). We discuss how maps showing the probability that herbaceous biomass is below a given threshold can support adaptive management in extensive semiarid rangelands across differing scenarios of risk perception and avoidance. In addition to producing maps to support precision rangeland management strategies, this study demonstrates the importance of combining complementary vegetation indices and acquiring long-term training datasets to achieve reliable predictions of herbaceous standing biomass in highly variable systems.

TI  - Compact Midwave Imaging System: Results from an Airborne Demonstration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Compact Midwave Imaging System (CMIS) is a wide field of view, multi-angle, multi-spectral pushframe imager that relies on the forward motion of the satellite to create a two-dimensional (2D) image swath. An airborne demonstration of CMIS was successfully completed in January-February 2021 on the NASA Langley Research Center Gulfstream III. The primary objective of the four-flight campaign was to demonstrate the capability of this unique instrument to perform stereo observations of clouds and other particulates (e.g., smoke) in the atmosphere. It is shown that the midwave infrared (MWIR) spectral bands of CMIS provide a unique 24/7 capability with high resolution for accurate stereo sensing. The instrument relies on new focal plane array (FPA) technology, which provides excellent sensitivity at much warmer detector temperatures than traditional technologies. This capability enabled a compact, low-cost design that can provide atmospheric motion vectors and cloud heights to support requirements for atmospheric winds in the 2017-2027 Earth Science Decadal Survey. Applications include day/night observations of the planetary boundary layer, severe weather, and wildfires. A comparison with current space-based earth science instruments demonstrates that the SWIR/MWIR multi-spectral capability of CMIS is competitive with larger, more expensive instrumentation. Imagery obtained over a controlled burn and operating nuclear power plant demonstrated the sensitivity of the instrument to temperature variations. The system relies on a mature stereoscopic imaging technique applied to the same scene from two independent platforms to unambiguously retrieve atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) with accurate height assignment. This capability has been successfully applied to geostationary and low-earth orbit satellites to achieve excellent accuracy. When applied to a ground-point validation case, the accuracy for the CMIS aircraft observations was 20 m and 0.3 m/s for cloud heights and motion vectors, respectively. This result was confirmed by a detailed error analysis with analytical and covariance models. The results for CMIS cases with underflights of Aeolus, CALIPSO, and Aqua provided a good validation of expected accuracies. The paper also showed the feasibility of accommodating CMIS on CubeSats to enable multiple instruments to be flown in a leader-follower mode.

TI  - Trends and projections of land use land cover and land surface temperature using an integrated weighted evidence-cellular automata (WE-CA) model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) change has become a major concern for biodiversity, ecosystem alteration, and modifying the climatic pattern especially land surface temperature (LST). The present study assessed past and predicted future LULC and LST change in the Swabi District of Pakistan. LULC maps were generated from satellite data for years 1987, 2002, and 2017 using supervised classification. Mean LST and its areal change were estimated for different LULC classes from thermal bands of satellite images. LULC and LST were projected for the year 2047 using the integrated weighted evidence-cellular automata (WE-CA) model and a regression equation developed in this study, respectively. LULC change revealed an increase of > 5% in the built-up while a decrease in the agricultural area by similar to 9%. There was an increase of similar to 63% area in the LST class >= 27 degrees C which may create urban heat island (UHI). Simulation results indicated that the built-up area will further be increased by similar to 3% until 2047. Area associated with LST class > 30 degrees C indicated a further increase of similar to 38% till 2047 with reference to year 2017. Findings of this study suggested proper utilization of LULC in order to mitigate the creation of UHIs associated with urbanization and built-up areas.

TI  - Assimilation of Satellite-Derived Soil Moisture and Brightness Temperature in Land Surface Models: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The correction of Soil Moisture (SM) estimates in Land Surface Models (LSMs) is considered essential for improving the performance of numerical weather forecasting and hydrologic models used in weather and climate studies. Along with surface screen-level variables, the satellite data, including Brightness Temperature (BT) from passive microwave sensors, and retrieved SM from active, passive, or combined active-passive sensor products have been used as two critical inputs in improvements of the LSM. The present study reviewed the current status in correcting LSM SM estimates, evaluating the results with in situ measurements. Based on findings from previous studies, a detailed analysis of related issues in the assimilation of SM in LSM, including bias correction of satellite data, applied LSMs and in situ observations, input data from various satellite sensors, sources of errors, calibration (both LSM and radiative transfer model), are discussed. Moreover, assimilation approaches are compared, and considerations for assimilation implementation are presented. A quantitative representation of results from the literature review, including ranges and variability of improvements in LSMs due to assimilation, are analyzed for both surface and root zone SM. A direction for future studies is then presented.

TI  - Preneoplastic Low-Risk Mammary Ductal Lesions (Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia and Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Spectrum): Current Status and Future Directions
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Overtreatment which means providing a patient with unnecessary medical intervention has recently become the center of attention in breast diseases. One of these lesions is low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), for which the standard of treatment is wide local excision/mastectomy, with or without radiation therapy, with or without hormonal therapy. There are many worldwide ongoing clinical trials aiming to de-escalate this therapy by examining whether active surveillance (AS) is sufficient. These trials vary in pathology inclusion and exclusion criteria. There is lack of consensus on the definition of low-risk DCIS, in particular the overlap with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), DCIS grading, and lack of definition of comedonecrosis. This review discusses AS trial from pathology standpoint and provides few recommendations. Intraepithelial mammary ductal neoplasia is a spectrum of disease that varies from atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), low-grade (LG), intermediate-grade (IG), to high-grade (HG) ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). While ADH has the lowest prognostic significance, HG-DCIS carries the highest risk. Due to widely used screening mammography, the number of intraepithelial mammary ductal neoplastic lesions has increased. The consequence of this practice is the increase in the number of patients who are overdiagnosed and, therefore, overtreated. The active surveillance (AS) trials are initiated to separate lesions that require active treatment from those that can be safely monitored and only be treated when they develop a change in the clinical/radiologic characteristics. At the same time, the natural history of these lesions can be evaluated. This review aims to evaluate ADH/DCIS as a spectrum of intraductal neoplastic disease (risk and histomorphology); examine the controversies of distinguishing ADH vs. DCIS and the grading of DCIS; review the upgrading for both ADH and DCIS with emphasis on the variation of methods of detection and the definitions of upgrading; and evaluate the impact of all these variables on the AS trials.

AB  - Mesoscale spatiotemporal variations with periods of 3-60 days are studied based on the remote sensing data from the GLONASS GPS receiver network in 2012-2015. The main modes of mesoscale variations are found; empirical distributions of their amplitudes, phase velocities, and spatial scales are constructed. The seasonal dependences of these parameters are found. Using independent data from meteorological stations and ERA5 reanalysis, it is shown that variations in the zenith tropospheric delay of radio waves, integral moisture content of the atmosphere, surface refractive index, and wind speed in the troposphere are determined by the same mesoscale atmospheric processes, with the most probable wavelengths of no more than 8000 km.

TI  - Statistical Analyses of the Flowering Dates of Cherry Blossom and the Peak Dates of Maple Leaves in South Korea Using ASOS and MODIS Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we aimed to examine the flowering dates of cherry blossom and the peak dates of maple leaves in South Korea, by the combination of temperature observation data from ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The more recent years, the faster the flowering dates and the slower the peak dates. This is because of the impacts of climate change with the increase of air temperature in South Korea. By reflecting the climate change, our statistical models could reasonably predict the plant phenology with the CC (Correlation Coefficient) of 0.870 and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 3.3 days for the flowering dates of cherry blossom, and the CC of 0.805 and the MAE of 3.8 for the peak dates of maple leaves. We could suppose a linear relationship between the plant phenology DOY (day of year) and the environmental factors like temperature and NDVI, which should be inspected in more detail. We found that the flowering date of cherry blossom was closely related to the monthly mean temperature of February and March, and the peak date of maple leaves was much associated with the accumulated temperature. A more sophisticated future work will be required to examine the plant phenology using higher-resolution satellite images and additional meteorological variables like the diurnal temperature range sensitive to plant phenology. Using meteorological grid can help produce the spatially continuous raster maps for plant phenology.

TI  - Assessment of the Carbon Budget of Local Governments in South Korea
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to assess the carbon budget of local governments in South Korea. The carbon budget was obtained from the difference between net ecosystem productivity (NEP) that the natural ecosystem displays, and carbon dioxide emissions calculated from energy consumption in each local government. NEP was obtained from the difference between net primary productivity, measured by an allometric method, and soil respiration, measured with EGM-4 in natural forests and artificial plantations. Heterotrophic respiration was adjusted to 55% level of the total soil respiration based on existing research results. A field survey to obtain information for components of the carbon cycle was conducted in Cheongju (central Korea) and Yeosu (southern Korea). Pinus densiflora, Quercus acutissima, and Quercus mongolica (central Korea) and P. densiflora and Q. acutissima (southern Korea) forests were selected as the natural forests. Pinus rigida and Larix kaempferi (central Korea) and P. rigida (southern Korea) plantations were selected as the artificial plantations. Vegetation types were classified by analyzing LandSat images by applying a GIS program. CO2 emissions were the highest in Pohang, Gwangyang, and Yeosu, where the iron and the petrochemical industrial complexes are located. CO2 emissions per unit area were the highest in Seoul, followed by Pohang and Gwangyang. CO2 absorption was the highest in the Gangwon province, where the forest area ratio to the total area is the highest, and the lowest in the metropolitan areas such as Seoul, Incheon, Daegu, Daejeon, and Gwangju. The number of local governments in which the amount of absorption is more than the emission amount was highest in Gangwon-do, where 10 local governments showed a negative carbon budget. Eight, seven, five, five, three, and three local governments in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, Jeollabuk-do, Gyeonggi-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do, respectively, showed a negative carbon budget where the amount of carbon absorption was greater than the emission amount. The carbon budget showed a very close correlation with carbon emission, and the carbon emission showed a significant correlation with population size. Moreover, the amount of carbon absorption showed a negative correlation with population size, population density, and non-forest area, and a positive correlation with the total area of the forest, coniferous forest area, and broad-leaved forest area. Considering the reality that carbon emissions exceed their absorption, measures to secure absorption sources should be considered as important as measures to reduce carbon emissions to achieve carbon neutrality in the future. As a measure to secure absorption sources, it is proposed to improve the quality of existing absorption sources, secure new absorption sources such as riparian forests, and efficiently arrange absorption sources.

TI  - The Survey of Lava Tube Distribution in Jeju Island by Multi-Source Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lava tubes, a major geomorphic element over volcanic terrain, have recently been highlighted as testbeds of the habitable environments and natural threats to unpredictable collapse. In our case study, we detected and monitored the risk of lava tube collapse on Jeju, an island off the Korean peninsula's southern tip with more than 200 lava tubes, by conducting Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis and a synthesized analysis of its outputs fused with spatial clues. We identified deformations up to 10 mm/year over InSAR Persistent Scatterers (PSs) obtained with Sentinel-1 time series processing in 3-year periods along with a specific geological unit. Using machine learning algorithms trained on time series deformations of samples along with clues from the spatial background, we classified candidates of potential lava tube networks primarily over coastal lava flows. What we detected in our analyses was validated via comparison with geophysical and ground surveys. Given that cavities in the lava tubes could pose serious risks, a detailed physical exploration and threat assessment of potential cave groups are required before the planned intensive construction of infrastructure on Jeju Island. We also recommend using the approach established in our study to detect undiscovered potential risks of collapse in the cavities, especially over lava tube networks, and to explore lava tubes on planetary surfaces using proposed terrestrial and planetary InSAR sensors.

TI  - Accuracy Comparison of TOA and TOC Reflectance Products of KOMPSAT-3, WorldView-2 and Pleiades-1A Image Sets Using RadCalNet BTCN and BSCN Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of the classical theme of how the Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) and Top-of-Canopy (TOC) reflectance of high-resolution satellite images match the actual atmospheric reflectance and surface reflectance has been emphasized. Based on the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) BTCN and BSCN data, this study compared the accuracy of TOA and TOC reflectance products of the currently available optical satellites, including KOMPSAT-3, WorldView-2, and Pleiades-1A image sets calculated using the absolute atmospheric correction function of the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) tool. The comparison experiment used data in 2018 and 2019, and the Landsat-8 image sets from the same period were applied together. The experiment results showed that the product of TOA and TOC reflectance obtained from the three sets of images were highly consistent with RadCalNet data. It implies that any imagery may be applied when high-resolution reflectance products are required for a certain application. Meanwhile, the processed results of the OTB tool and those by the Apparent Reflection method of another tool for WorldView-2 images were nearly identical. However, in some cases, the reflectance products of Landsat-8 images provided by USGS sometimes showed relatively low consistency than those computed by the OTB tool, with the reference of RadCalNet BTCN and BSCN data. Continuous experiments on active vegetation areas in addition to the RadCalNet sites are necessary to obtain generalized results.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Cloud-Net with Cross-sensor Training Dataset for Satellite Image-based Cloud Detection
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since satellite images generally include clouds in the atmosphere, it is essential to detect or mask clouds before satellite image processing. Clouds were detected using physical characteristics of clouds in previous research. Cloud detection methods using deep learning techniques such as CNN or the modified U-Net in image segmentation field have been studied recently. Since image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image, precise pixel-based dataset is required for cloud detection. Obtaining accurate training datasets is more important than a network configuration in image segmentation for cloud detection. Existing deep learning techniques used different training datasets. And test datasets were extracted from intra-dataset which were acquired by same sensor and procedure as training dataset. Different datasets make it difficult to determine which network shows a better overall performance.To verify the effectiveness of the cloud detection network such as Cloud-Net, two types of networks were trained using the cloud dataset from KOMPSAT-3 images provided by the AIHUB site and the L8-Cloud dataset from Landsat8 images which was publicly opened by a Cloud-Net author. Test data from intra-dataset of KOMPSAT-3 cloud dataset were used for validating the network. The simulation results show that the network trained with KOMPSAT-3 cloud dataset shows good performance on the network trained with L8-Cloud dataset. Because Landsat8 and KOMPSAT-3 satellite images have different GSDs, making it difficult to achieve good results from cross-sensor validation. The network could be superior for intra-dataset, but it could be inferior for cross-sensor data. It is necessary to study techniques that show good results in cross-senor validation dataset in the future.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Sentinel-2 Images Using Enhanced AOD Information
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate atmospheric correction is essential for the analysis of land surface and environmental monitoring. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) information is particularly important in atmospheric correction because the radiation attenuation by Mie scattering makes the differences between the radiation calculated at the satellite sensor and the radiation measured at the land surface. Thus, it is necessary to use high-quality AOD data for an appropriate atmospheric correction of high-resolution satellite images. In this study, we examined the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S)-based atmospheric correction results for the Sentinel 2 images in South Korea using raster AOD (MODIS) and single-point AOD (AERONET). The 6S result was overall agreed with the Sentinel-2 level 2 data. Moreover, using raster AOD showed better performance than using single-point AOD. The atmospheric correction using the single-point AOD yielded some inappropriate values for forest and water pixels, whereas the atmospheric correction using raster AOD produced stable and natural patterns in accordance with the land cover map. Also, the Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) after the 6S correction had similar patterns to the upscaled drone NDVI, although Sentinel-2 NDVI had relatively low values. Also, the spatial distribution of both images seemed very similar for growing and harvest seasons. Future work will be necessary to make efforts for the gap-filling of AOD data and an accurate bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model for high-resolution atmospheric correction. These methods can help improve the land surface monitoring using the future Compact Advanced Satellite 500 in South Korea.

TI  - Evaluation and Prediction of Column Aerosol by Using the Time Series Machine Learning Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Column aerosol observation has the advantage of obtaining microphysicai information of aerosols present in the vertical atmospheric column at a given point. In this study, in order to predict column aerosol loads in the local atmosphere, time series machine learning technique was applied by using Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE) data acquired from the selected ground-based Sun-sky radiometer observation network. For the determination of the best time series machine learning model, the independent optional properties including three regression models (glmnet, Im, and spark), four training period (1-4 years), and five regularization parameters (0-0.08) were tested in time series modelling. The results showed that spark model with the 1 year training period and regularization constant of 0.08 has the highest accuracy (RMSE=0.302, bias=0.213) for the AOD prediction. In the case of AE prediction, the highest accuracy (RMSE=0.356, bias=0.238) was obtained by the glmnet model with 1 year training period and the regularization constant of 0.08. In addition, machine learning clustering results shows that urban/industrial aerosol types occurred at a rate of 63.7% in Korea. The methodology and results of this study can be used for short-term aerosol prediction models and remote sensing data.

TI  - Whole Blood Transcriptional Fingerprints of High-Grade Glioma and Longitudinal Tumor Evolution under Carbon Ion Radiotherapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Particle therapy with carbon ions is a promising novel option for the treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG). Lack of initial and sequential biopsies limits the investigation of rHGG evolution under therapy. We hypothesized that peripheral blood transcriptome derived from liquid biopsies (lbx) as a minimal invasive method may provide a useful decision support for identification of glioma grade and provide novel means for longitudinal molecular monitoring of tumor evolution under carbon ion irradiation (CIR). We demonstrate feasibility and report patient, tumor and treatment fingerprints in whole blood transcriptomes of rHGG patients with pre-CIR and three post-CIR time points. Purpose: To assess the value of whole blood transcriptome data from liquid biopsy (lbx) in recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG) patients for longitudinal molecular monitoring of tumor evolution under carbon ion irradiation (CIR). Methods: Whole blood transcriptome (WBT) analysis (Illumina HumanHT-12 Expression BeadChips) was performed in 14 patients with rHGG pre re-irradiation (reRT) with CIR and 3, 6 and 9 weeks post-CIR (reRT grade III:5, 36%, IV:9, 64%). Patients were irradiated with 30, 33, 36 GyRBE (n = 5, 6, 3) in 3GyRBE per fraction. Results: WTB analysis showed stable correlation with treatment characteristics and patients tumor grade, indicating a preserved tumor origin specific as well as dynamic transcriptional fingerprints of peripheral blood cells. Initial histopathologic tumor grade was indirectly associated with TMEM173 (STING), DNA-repair (ATM, POLD4) and hypoxia related genes. DNA-repair, chromatin remodeling (LIG1, SMARCD1) and immune response (FLT3LG) pathways were affected post-CIR. Longitudinal WTB fingerprints identified two distinct trajectories of rHGG evolution, characterized by differential and prognostic CRISPLD2 expression pre-CIR. Conclusions: Lbx based WTB analysis holds the potential for molecular stratification of rHGG patients and therapy monitoring. We demonstrate the feasibility of the peripheral blood transcriptome as a sentinel organ for identification of patient, tumor characteristics and CIR specific fingerprints in rHGG.

TI  - Examining the temporal and spatial distribution of potential urban heat island formations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to urbanization worldwide, gradual increase in construction and use of irregular urban topography affect urban climate negatively, triggering urban heat island (UHI) formations in cities and thereby causing them to become uninhabitable places for human comfort. This study, which covers the province of Diyarbakir in Turkey, aims to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of areas with potential urban heat island (UHI) by using remote sensing methods and satellite/terrain data available between 2001 and 2019. According to the Landsat 7 satellite, an area with a potential of 27.4 km(2) in 2001, 20.8 km(2) in 2006, 27.4 km(2) in 2008, 16.7 km(2) in 2010, and 12.2 km(2) in 2012 was determined. According to the Landsat 8 satellite, it was measured as 14.49 km(2) in 2017 and 15.67 km(2) in 2018. According to Landsat 8 satellite data, areas with UHI potential increased by 14.6% over a 3-year period. According to Landsat 7 data, there has been a continuous fluctuation over the years. One of the important results of this study is that between 2001 and 2019, the higher the rate of change according to the surface temperature, the larger the area with the potential of the heat island. At the same time, it has been determined that spatially potential UHIs have a great potential not in the city center, but in the surrounding areas close to the center and in the topographically hollow areas.

TI  - Mapping invasive strawberry guava (<i>Psidium cattleianum</i>) in tropical forests of Mauritius with Sentinel-2 and machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive flora alien species (IAS) pose a serious threat to biodiversity in tropical forests. This study evaluated different classification approaches for remote sensing of the target IAS, strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum), using open-access satellite imagery to aid research and understanding of IAS impacts in tropical forests. This is likely the first study using freely available open-access imagery to map strawberry guava, and the first mapping of invasive species in Mauritius using remote sensing. Ground-based observations in Black River Gorges National Park (BRGNP), Mauritius, resulted in 4670 'ground truth' samples across three land cover classes representing different levels of strawberry guava canopy cover; 70% of these ground truth data were used for training and model tuning, and 30% were held-out for testing. Classification was performed using Sentinel-2 MSI images and Google Earth Engine. Computation of Jeffries-Matusita distance supported the addition of Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix texture measures, and spectral indices (ARI1, and ReNDVI) for classification, since these features increased separability of strawberry guava cover classes substantially over using spectral bands alone. Higher than 80% overall and individual class accuracies were achieved with both Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of strawberry guava in BRGNP. RF is recommended for similar future applications for its higher overall accuracy (97.60% +/- .20% at 95% confidence), lower variation, and prediction of more homogenous class regions. This study found that strawberry guava canopy cover in BRGNP was highest in central regions and correlated to steeper slopes, with little overall change from 2016 to 2020.

TI  - Web-Based Decision Support System for Managing the Food-Water-Soil-Ecosystem Nexus in the Kolleru Freshwater Lake of Andhra Pradesh in South India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the world's freshwater lake ecosystems are endangered due to intensive land use conditions. They are subjected to anthropogenic stress and severely degraded because of large-scale aquafarming, agricultural expansion, urbanization, and industrialization. In the case of India's largest freshwater lake, the Kolleru freshwater ecosystem, environmental resources such as water and soil have been adversely impacted by an increase in food production, particularly through aquaculture. There are numerous instances where aqua farmers have indulged in constructing illegal fishponds. This process of aquafarming through illegal fishponds has continued even after significant restoration efforts, which started in 2006. This underlines the necessity of continuous monitoring of the state of the lake ecosystem in order to survey the effectiveness of restoration and protection measures. Hence, to better understand the processes of ecosystem degradation and derive recommendations for future management, we developed a web mapping application (WMA). The WMA aims to provide fishpond data from the current monitoring program, allowing users to access the fishpond data location across the lake region, demanding lake digitization and analysis. We used a machine learning algorithm for training the composite series of Landsat images obtained from Google Earth Engine to digitize the lake ecosystem and further analyze current and past land use classes. An open-source geographic information system (GIS) software and JavaScript library plugins including a PostGIS database, GeoServer, and Leaflet library were used for WMA. To enable the interactive features, such as editing or updating the latest construction of fishponds into the database, a client-server architecture interface was provided, finally resulting in the web-based model application for the Kolleru Lake aquaculture system. Overall, we believe that providing expanded access to the fishpond data using such tools will help government organizations, resource managers, stakeholders, and decision makers better understand the lake ecosystem dynamics and plan any upcoming restoration measures.

TI  - The Port-Franco of Odessa of the North: Alexander Den'gin's Development Project of the Mouth of the Pechora River in the 1820s to 1840s
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to a little-known episode in the history of the development of the Russian North, one that is associated with the name of the Vologda merchant Alexander Ivanovich Den'gin. The contribution brings together the available biographical information about A.I. Den'gin and characterizes his project concerning the economic development of the territory adjacent to the mouth of the Pechora River. This project he elaborated in the 1820s to 1840s; it aimed at the development of both the Pechora Region and Western Siberia by establishing regular water communication between the European and Asian parts of Russia. The article reviews the various stages in the drafting of this document, and traces its way through different instances. Filled with patriotic rhetoric, the source under consideration emphasizes not only Den'gin's personal interest - to derive material benefits from the exploitation of the Pechora estuary - but also reflects that entrepreneurs were fully aware of the necessity to develop the northern territories in order to integrate these regions fully into the Russian Empire. A close cooperation between state authorities and representatives of private capital was considered an indispensable condition for achieving this goal. A.I. Den'gin's note also reveals how the Russian merchant class of the pre-Reform period viewed the world. They had a very high opinion of their professional activities, which they thought were indispensable not only for the successful functioning of the economy but also for raising the general level of culture and education among the population. Commerce was seen as the most important means for achieving progress and common welfare.

TI  - Algorithm of Additional Correction of Level 2 Remote Sensing Reflectance Data Using Modelling of the Optical Properties of the Black Sea Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction of satellite optical data is based on an assessment of the optical characteristics of the atmosphere, such as the aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere and the spectral slope of its spectrum, the so-called Angstrom parameter. Inaccurate determination of these parameters is one of the causes of errors in the retrieval of the remote sensing reflectance spectra. In this work, the obtained large array of field and satellite data for the northeastern part of the Black Sea is used, including ship-based measurements of atmospheric characteristics and sea reflectance, MODIS Aqua/Terra and OLCI Sentinel-3 A/B Level 2 remote sensing reflectance and atmospheric data. The purpose of this study is to show the numerical differences between the atmospheric parameters measured from the surface level and from the satellite and demonstrate their relationship with the differences between in situ and satellite remote sensing reflectance. Based on the information received, we propose an algorithm for the additional correction of satellite Level 2 data that uses a two-parametric model of the Black Sea remote sensing reflectance as a first approximation. This method does not require any in situ information. It is shown that additional correction significantly reduces the discrepancy between in situ and retrieved remote sensing reflectance, especially in short-wave spectral bands.

TI  - Cloud Processing for Simultaneous Mapping of Seagrass Meadows in Optically Complex and Varied Water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved development of remote sensing approaches to deliver timely and accurate measurements for environmental monitoring, particularly with respect to marine and estuarine environments is a priority. We describe a machine learning, cloud processing protocol for simultaneous mapping seagrass meadows in waters of variable quality across Moreton Bay, Australia. This method was adapted from a protocol developed for mapping coral reef areas. Georeferenced spot check field-survey data were obtained across Moreton Bay, covering areas of differing water quality, and categorized into either substrate or >= 25% seagrass cover. These point data with coincident Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery (30 m resolution; pulled directly from Google Earth Engine's public archive) and a bathymetric layer (30 m resolution) were incorporated to train a random forest classifier. The semiautomated machine learning algorithm was applied to map seagrass in shallow areas of variable water quality simultaneously, and a bay-wide map was created for Moreton Bay. The output benthic habitat map representing seagrass presence/absence was accurate (63%) as determined by validation with an independent data set.

TI  - Assessing the Dynamics of Plant Species Invasion in Eastern-Mediterranean Coastal Dunes Using Cellular Automata Modeling and Satellite Time-Series Analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasion is a major contributor to local and global biodiversity loss, in particular in dune ecosystems. In this study we evaluated current and future cover expansion of the invasive plant species, Heterotheca subaxillaris, and Acacia saligna, in the Mediterranean coastal plain of Israel. This is the first effort to quantify current surface cover of the focal species in this area. We reconstructed plant cover for 1990-2020 using Landsat time series and modeled future potential expansion using cellular automata (CA) modeling. The overall accuracy of the results varied in the range 85-95% and the simulated plant growth using CA varied between 74% and 84%, for A. saligna and H. subaxillaris, respectively. The surface area covered by H. subaxillaris in 2020, 45 years since its introduction, was approximately 81 km(2). Acacia saligna covered an area of 74.6 km(2), while the vacant area available for potential spread of these two species was 630 km(2). Heterotheca subaxillaris showed a mean expansion rate of 107% per decade from 2000 to 2020, while the mean expansion rate of A. saligna was lower, ranging between 48% and 54% within the same time period. Furthermore, based on the plant expansion model simulation we estimated that A. saligna and H. subaxillaris will continue to spread by 60% per decade, on average, from 2020 to 2070, with a maximum growth rate of 80% per decade during 2040-2050. According to future expansion projections, the species will cover all open vacant areas by 2070 (95% of the total vacant area) and most areas will be shared by both species.

TI  - Dimensionality Reduction for the Feature System in Classification of Hyperspectral Earth Remote Sensing Data by Use of Neural Networks
T2  - OPTOELECTRONICS INSTRUMENTATION AND DATA PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyperspectral method of analyzing the Earth's surface is very effective in solving classification problems as applied to both objects located on it and the state of these objects (e.g., agricultural crops). However, full-scale hyperspectral analysis is a very expensive procedure and looking for ways of cheapening it are quite explicable. The most consistent way is to reduce the number of spectral components (classification features) by selection (or formation from them) of the most informative ones. It is proposed to implement it by using neural network technologies. By an example of processing a 200-channel hyperspectral image, it is shown that the high accuracy achieved in classification due to reducing the dimensionality of the feature space by these technologies exceeds the accuracy obtained by other known methods.

TI  - Managing Moose from Home: Determining Landscape Carrying Capacity for <i>Alces alces</i> Using Remote Sensing
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In temperate forests of the northeastern U.S., moose (Alces alces) populations are adapted for mixed-age heterogeneous landscapes that provide abundant herbaceous forage in warm months and coniferous forage during winter. Heterogeneity of forest stands is driven by management activities or natural disturbance, resulting in a multi-age forest at a landscape scale. Here, we present a method to estimate landscape carrying capacity of moose by combining remote sensing classification of forest cover class with literature or field-based estimates of class-specific forage abundance. We used Landsat imagery from 1991 to 2013 for the Allegheny National Forest and 2013-2018 for the Adirondack Park, and associated training polygons, to predict based on NDVI and SWI whether a forested landscape fit into one of three cover classes: mature forest, intermediate timber removal, or overstory timber removal. Our three-classes yielded a mean land cover prediction accuracy of 94.3% (Khat = 0.91) and 86.9% (Khat = 0.76) for ANFR and AP, respectively. In the AP, we applied previously calculated summer crude protein values to our predicted cover types, resulting in an estimated average carrying capacity of 760 moose (SD +/- 428) across all sampling years, similar in magnitude to a density estimate of 716 moose (95% CI = 566-906) calculated during the same time. Our approach was able to accurately identify forest timber treatments across landscapes at differing spatial and temporal scales and provide an alternative method to estimate landscape-level ungulate carrying capacity. The ability to accurately identify areas of potential conflict from overbrowsing, or to highlight areas in need of land cover treatments can increase the toolset for ungulate management in managed forest landscapes.

TI  - Assessment of the Usability of SAR and Optical Satellite Data for Monitoring Spatio-Temporal Changes in Surface Water: Bodrog River Case Study
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping watercourses and their surroundings through remote sensing methods is a fast, continuous, and effective method and is a crucial tool for capturing change and possibly predicting hazards. Thanks to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology and the ability of its backscattered and emitted radiation to penetrate the atmosphere under any conditions, this type of mapping of water surfaces is of particular importance. This paper presents the possibility of using SAR technology for long-term observations of changes in the behaviour of rivers and river systems, combined with optical multispectral images Sentinel-2. Additionally, it aims to demonstrate the suitability of satellite SAR and multispectral data implementation for mapping changes in watercourses, caused not only by their natural development but especially by inundation processes in their catchment area. Appropriate Sentinel-1 image processing evaluation procedures demonstrate that the usage of vertical-vertical (VV) type polarisation configuration is a suitable methodology for documenting water bodies, and a Lee filter is an acceptable tool for radar noise filtering. The extraction process of water surfaces is based on the determination of threshold values using the "Otsu" principle. Subsequently, the comparison of the results is realised by the spectral indices of water-the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), a pair of Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) indices, and supervised classification method Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). The results are numerical and graphical evaluated. In assessing the accuracy of SAR extraction, the highest values achieved in Overall Accuracy (OA) were a maximum of 98.6%. On average, the lower values were in User Accuracy (UA) with a maximum of 93.1%, where VV polarisation also dominates. However, vertical-horizontal (VH) polarisation dominates in Producer Accuracy (PA) with a maximum of 84.9%.

TI  - Internal structure and recent dynamics of a moraine complex in an alpine glacier forefield revealed by geophysical surveying and Sentinel-1 InSAR time series
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents results on the internal structure and recent dynamics of a thrust moraine complex in the Zay Valley (Italian Alps) by means of geophysical surveying and remote sensing time series. Results from electrical resistivity tomography, seismic refraction tomography, ground-penetrating radar as well as a four-phase modeling approach provided detailed information on the internal moraine structure and confirmed the presence of partly ice-rich permafrost within the moraine complex as well as buried massive ice of sedimentary origin within the proximal moraine flank. The use of Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) enabled the derivation of detailed surface displacement patterns showing subsidence rates of up to 5 cm within a 30-day period (August/September 2020) over the central part of the moraine complex. Further, preliminary InSAR results indicated an eastward displacement back towards the glacier forefield. The comparison of the results from geophysical measurements and InSAR time series suggested a strong relationship between the subsurface conditions and the surface displacement, as highest displacement rates were found over locations with highest ice content. The consistency of the results enables an area wide estimation of subsurface conditions and highlights the benefits from combining geophysical and remote sensing methods. (c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Afforestation of Transformed Savanna and Resulting Land Cover Change: A Case Study of Zaria (Nigeria)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the effects of actions aiming at tree planting, and thus protection of the land belonging to Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) in Zaria (Nigeria) from erosion. This area is located within the northern limits of the Guinea savanna belt, which has been considerably transformed primarily for agricultural purposes. For years this area has been subjected to the destructive surface and gully erosion processes, which were documented both by field work and the analysis of high-resolution images presented by Google Earth. Land erosion leads to the silting of an impounding reservoir (Kubanni)-the primary water source for the university campus and the basis for its existence. Since 2000, the university has been actively involved in tree-planting efforts in the campus vicinity, executed mainly through the establishment of small plantations ranging in area from approximately 1 ha to 56 ha. Today, these measures have brought tangible effects such as increment of tree-planted expanses, as evidenced in the multitemporal analysis of the Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI satellite images. The increasing planted area protects both the soil and the reservoir. A marked stand increment (almost doubled) has been recorded, which is evident from the satellite imageries, and is presented on the land-use map produced with GIS technique for this project.

TI  - Land Cover and Vegetation Coverage Changes in the Mining Area-A Case Study from Slovakia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dealing with landscape changes in space and time is an important activity in terms of the process of future development of the selected area. In particular, it is necessary to focus on territories that are exposed to the effects of extraction activities. The main objective of the paper was the mapping of spatio-temporal changes in the landscape in connection with the extraction of minerals due to mining activities on the landscape using satellite images and data from the Corine land cover (CLC) database in the environment of geographic information systems. The selected study area is specific to the presence of four mineral deposits (three of which are under active mining). The Rohoznik-Konopiska deposit was abandoned and the area was subsequently reclaimed. The study used Corine land cover (CLC) data and Landsat 5, 7, 8 satellite images for selected years in the period 1990-2021. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated for vegetation cover analysis, which was further combined with the forest spatial division units (FSDU) layer. Areas in the immediate vicinity of the open-pit mine were selected for detailed analysis of vegetation changes. Using the FSDU data, an average NDVI index value was calculated using the Zonal statistics function for each plot. The results showed that over the selected period there have been changes indicating an improvement in the landscape condition by reclamation operations at two deposits, Rohoznik-Konopiska (inactive) and Solosnica-Hrabnik (active). The analyzed CLC data detected the change at the Rohoznik-Konopiska deposit, but the active deposit Solosnica-Hrabnik was not detected in these data. The loss of vegetation on the other two deposits is mainly due to pre-mining preparatory work, which causes the removal of soil and vegetation layers.

TI  - Assessment of Nighttime Cloud Cover Products from MODIS and Himawari-8 Data with Ground-Based Camera Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparing cloud cover (CC) products from different satellites with the same ground-based CC dataset provides information on the similarities or differences of values among satellite products. For this reason, 42-month CC products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer's (MODIS) Collection 6.1 daily cloud cover products (MOD06_L2, MYD06_L2, MOD08_D3, and MYD08_D3) and Himawari-8 are compared with the ground-based camera datasets. The comparison shows that CC from MODIS differs from ground measurement CC by as much as 57% over Chiba, Japan, when low CC is observed by the camera. This indicates MODIS's ability to capture high-level clouds that are not effectively seen from the ground. When the camera detects high CC, an indication of the presence of low-level clouds, CC from MODIS is relatively higher than the CC from the camera. In the case of Himawari-8 data, when the camera observes low CC, this difference is around 0.7%. This result indicates that high-level clouds are not effectively observed, but the Himawari-8 data correlates well with camera observations. When the camera observes high CC, Himawari-8-derived CC is lower by around 10% than CC from the camera. These results show the potential of continuous observations of nighttime clouds using the camera to provide a dataset that can be used for intercomparison among nighttime satellite CC products.

TI  - Data Gap Filling Using Cloud-Based Distributed Markov Chain Cellular Automata Framework for Land Use and Land Cover Change Analysis: Inner Mongolia as a Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With advances in remote sensing, massive amounts of remotely sensed data can be harnessed to support land use/land cover (LULC) change studies over larger scales and longer terms. However, a big challenge is missing data as a result of poor weather conditions and possible sensor malfunctions during image data collection. In this study, cloud-based and open source distributed frameworks that used Apache Spark and Apache Giraph were used to build an integrated infrastructure to fill data gaps within a large-area LULC dataset. Data mining techniques (k-medoids clustering and quadratic discriminant analysis) were applied to facilitate sub-space analyses. Ancillary environmental and socioeconomic conditions were integrated to support localized model training. Multi-temporal transition probability matrices were deployed in a graph-based Markov-cellular automata simulator to fill in missing data. A comprehensive dataset for Inner Mongolia, China, from 2000 to 2016 was used to assess the feasibility, accuracy, and performance of this gap-filling approach. The result is a cloud-based distributed Markov-cellular automata framework that exploits the scalability and high performance of cloud computing while also achieving high accuracy when filling data gaps common in longer-term LULC studies.

TI  - What Works to Improve Nutrition and Food Sustainability across the First 2000 Days of Life: A Rapid Review
T2  - NUTRIENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Informed by the Innocenti framework, this rapid review of systematic reviews (n = 60) and sentinel grey literature (n = 27) synthesises the evidence of what works to improve nutrition and food sustainability across the first 2000 days. Most systematic reviews focused on interventions targeting the behaviour of parents and caregivers (n = 49), with fewer reviews focusing on the personal (n = 7) and external (n = 4) food environments. No reviews focused on food supply-chain activities. Most reviews were rated as critically low (n = 28, 47%) or low (n = 21, 35%) quality using AMSTAR 2. Evidence supports the effectiveness of multi-component breastfeeding interventions, interventions delivered in home and child-care settings, particularly when involving parents, interactive skill building and repeated exposure to vegetables. Food vouchers and access to local farmers markets and community gardens have potential for improving access and availability to healthier foods, while evidence supports interventions improving the external food environment, including fiscal strategies such as the SSB tax, restrictions on marketing and advertising of discretionary products and improved food labelling. Overall, this review highlights the importance of action across a range of settings and sectors at the international, national and local levels to improve young children's diets.

TI  - Multiscale framework for rapid change analysis from SAR image time series: Case study of flood monitoring in the central coast regions of Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the frequency of natural and environmental disasters has increased significantly, causing constant changes on the Earth's surface. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been proved to be useful for operational change monitoring tasks. The multiscale framework presented in this paper aims at detecting and analyzing changes using SAR image time series composed of large-size images. Spatio-temporal changes are initially detected at the subimage scale analysis stage to determine regions and image acquisition dates related to the change occurrence. Detailed changes are then identified at the pixel scale analysis stage between selected acquisitions at each recognized region. This framework was used for flood monitoring over a large area along the central coast of Vietnam (from Thua Thien Hue province to Quang Nam province). We exploited a Sentinel-1 image time series acquired during two rainy seasons and typhoon seasons in the Western Pacific (from September to December of the two years 2017 and 2018). The proposed framework detected flooded areas with a high overall accuracy of 90.4% and could analyze different types of changes that occurred in this time series, i.e. dirac, periodic, chaotic changes, and temporal stability.

TI  - Melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles mediate lymphatic remodelling and impair tumour immunity in draining lymph nodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumour-draining lymph nodes (LNs) undergo massive remodelling including expansion of the lymphatic sinuses, a process that has been linked to lymphatic metastasis by creation of a pre-metastatic niche. However, the signals leading to these changes have not been completely understood. Here, we found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from melanoma cells are rapidly transported by lymphatic vessels to draining LNs, where they selectively interact with lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) as well as medullary sinus macrophages. Interestingly, uptake of melanoma EVs by LN-resident LECs was partly dependent on lymphatic VCAM-1 expression, and induced transcriptional changes as well as proliferation of those cells. Furthermore, melanoma EVs shuttled tumour antigens to LN LECs for cross-presentation on MHC-I, resulting in apoptosis induction in antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. In conclusion, our data identify EV-mediated melanoma-LN LEC communication as a new pathway involved in tumour progression and tumour immune inhibition, suggesting that EV uptake or effector mechanisms in LECs might represent a new target for melanoma therapy.

TI  - A Simple Cloud-Native Spectral Transformation Method to Disentangle Optically Shallow and Deep Waters in Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a novel method to identify optically deep water using purely spectral approaches. Optically deep waters, where the seabed is too deep for a bottom reflectance signal to be returned, is uninformative for seabed mapping. Furthermore, owing to the attenuation of light in the water column, submerged vegetation at deeper depths is easily confused with optically deep waters, thereby inducing misclassifications that reduce the accuracy of these seabed maps. While bathymetry data could mask out deeper areas, they are not always available or of sufficient spatial resolution for use. Without bathymetry data and based on the coastal aerosol blue green (1-2-3) bands of the Sentinel-2 imagery, this study investigates the use of band ratios and a false colour HSV transformation of both L1C and L2A images to separate optically deep and shallow waters across varying water quality over four tropical and temperate submerged sites: Tanzania, the Bahamas, the Caspian Sea (Kazakhstan) and the Wadden Sea (Denmark and Germany). Two supervised thresholds based on annotated reference data and an unsupervised Otsu threshold were applied. The band ratio group usually featured the best overall accuracies (OA), F1 scores and Matthews correlation coefficients, although the individual band combination might not perform consistently across different sites. Meanwhile, the saturation and hue band yielded close to best performance for the L1C and L2A images, featuring OA of up to 0.93 and 0.98, respectively, and a more consistent behaviour than the individual band ratios. Nonetheless, all these spectral methods are still susceptible to sunglint, the Sentinel-2 parallax effect, turbidity and water colour. Both supervised approaches performed similarly and were superior to the unsupervised Otsu's method-the supervised methods featuring OA were usually over 0.70, while the unsupervised OA were usually under 0.80. In the absence of bathymetry data, this method could effectively remove optically deep water pixels in Sentinel-2 imagery and reduce the issue of dark pixel misclassification, thereby improving the benthic mapping of optically shallow waters and their seascapes.

TI  - Effects of Urban Landscape and Sociodemographic Characteristics on Heat-Related Health Using Emergency Medical Service Incidents
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that extremely hot weather causes heat-related health issues. Health problems, especially in urban areas, are becoming increasingly important due to urban heat island effect. Understanding the impact of neighborhood characteristics is important for research into the relationship between thermal environment and human health. The objectives of this study were to explore the urban landscape and sociodemographic characteristics affecting heat-related health and identify spatial inequalities for vulnerable groups. A total of 27,807 heat-related EMS incidents were used at the census block group level (N = 285). We used land cover database and Landsat satellite images for urban landscape variables and used 2019 U.S. Census data for sociodemographic variables. Negative binomial regression was used to identify the neighborhood variables associated with the heat-related EMS incidents in each block group. Heat-related health has been alleviated in block groups with high green areas. However, the negative effects of thermal environments on human health were higher in areas with a high percentage of impervious surface, over 65 years, non-white people, no high school diploma, or unemployment. The results indicate that heat-related health problems can be addressed through prevention strategies for block group variables. Local intervention efforts to solve health issues should be targeted at more vulnerable areas and groups.

T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A lymphocele is a common complication that occurs following pelvic lymph node dissection. However, the complication of lymphoceles following sentinel pelvic lymph node biopsy has not been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge. A 49-year-old female patient had undergone radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node biopsy for stage IB1 cervical cancer 5 months previously and presented with a profuse watery vaginal discharge of liters per day. A fistula connecting the lymphocele and the vaginal stump was identified using lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission CT/CT. Transvaginal lymphatic embolization was successfully performed through the vaginal fistulous tract, resulting in immediate reduction of the vaginal discharge. In conclusion, the case of fistula formation between pelvic lymphocele and vaginal stump was encountered at our department and was reported with a literature review. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports on lymphoceles with direct communication to the vaginal mucosa, particularly following sentinel pelvic lymph node biopsy. The present study reported the case of a patient who was successfully treated for a pelvic lymphocele with direct communication to the vaginal mucosa.

TI  - Deep Learning for Vegetation Health Forecasting: A Case Study in Kenya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - East Africa has experienced a number of devastating droughts in recent decades, including the 2010/2011 drought. The National Drought Management Authority in Kenya relies on real-time information from MODIS satellites to monitor and respond to emerging drought conditions in the arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya. Providing accurate and timely information on vegetation conditions and health-and its probable near-term future evolution-is essential for minimising the risk of drought conditions evolving into disasters as the country's herders directly rely on the conditions of grasslands. Methods from the field of machine learning are increasingly being used in hydrology, meteorology, and climatology. One particular method that has shown promise for rainfall-runoff modelling is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. In this study, we seek to test two LSTM architectures for vegetation health forecasting. We find that these models provide sufficiently accurate forecasts to be useful for drought monitoring and forecasting purposes, showing competitive performances with lower resolution ensemble methods and improved performances over a shallow neural network and a persistence baseline.

TI  - Convolution neural network with edge structure loss for spatiotemporal remote sensing image fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion technology provides a feasible, economical solution for generating remote sensing images with high spatiotemporal resolution. The recently proposed learning-based method achieved high accuracy; however, its network structure is relatively simple, and the deep features of the input image cannot be obtained, so that the fused image cannot restore good landform details and the quality is not very good. Moreover, most methods use a single pixel-level (MSE) loss, which makes recovering high-frequency details difficult, resulting in a reduction in the fusion accuracy. In this paper, we propose an edge structure loss, which is added to a spatiotemporal fusion network without pre training model. To fully extract the spectral information and spatial details of the image, we propose a DenseNet-BC module for image fusion tasks, which makes the features more easily transmittable in the whole network. This improvement also enables the network to perform spatiotemporal fusion with better generalizability and robustness. In addition, we propose an edge loss to further improve the accuracy of the model fusion results. Experiments with existing spatiotemporal fusion algorithms in different regions show that our proposed method is more fault tolerant and achieve a higher accuracy in terms of quality evaluation indicators and better visual effects.

TI  - A Spatiotemporal Fusion Method Based on Multiscale Feature Extraction and Spatial Channel Attention Mechanism
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellite images with a high spatial and temporal resolution play a crucial role in Earth science applications. However, due to technology and cost constraints, it is difficult for a single satellite to achieve both a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. The spatiotemporal fusion method is a cost-effective solution for generating a dense temporal data resolution with a high spatial resolution. In recent years, spatiotemporal image fusion based on deep learning has received wide attention. In this article, a spatiotemporal fusion method based on multiscale feature extraction and a spatial channel attention mechanism is proposed. Firstly, the method uses a multiscale mechanism to fully utilize the structural features in the images. Then a novel attention mechanism is used to capture both spatial and channel information; finally, the rich features and spatial and channel information are used to fuse the images. Experimental results obtained from two datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing fusion methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

TI  - Exploring the Effects of Roadside Vegetation on the Urban Thermal Environment Using Street View Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Roadsides are important urban public spaces where residents are in direct contact with the thermal environment. Understanding the effects of different vegetation types on the roadside thermal environment has been an important aspect of recent urban research. Although previous studies have shown that the thermal environment is related to the type and configuration of vegetation, remote sensing-based technology is not applicable for extracting different vegetation types at the roadside scale. The rapid development and usage of street view data provide a way to solve this problem, as street view data have a unique pedestrian perspective. In this study, we explored the effects of different roadside vegetation types on land surface temperatures (LSTs) using street view images. First, the grasses-shrubs-trees (GST) ratios were extracted from 19,596 street view images using semantic segmentation technology, while LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were extracted from Landsat-8 images using the radiation transfer equation algorithm. Second, the effects of different vegetation types on roadside LSTs were explored based on geographically weighted regression (GWR), and the different performances of the analyses using remotely sensed images and street view images were discussed. The results indicate that GST vegetation has different cooling effects in different spaces, with a fitting value of 0.835 determined using GWR. Among these spaces, the areas with a significant cooling effect provided by grass are mainly located in the core commercial area of Futian District, which is densely populated by people and vehicles; the areas with a significant cooling effect provided by shrubs are mainly located in the industrial park in the south, which has the highest industrial heat emissions; the areas with a significant cooling effect provided by trees are mainly located in the core area of Futian, which is densely populated by roads and buildings. These are also the areas with the most severe heat island effect in Futian. This study expands our understanding of the relationship between roadside vegetation and the urban thermal environment, and has scientific significance for the planning and guiding of urban thermal environment regulation.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Aboveground Biomass of Two Major Conifers in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, from PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is a crucial component of the global carbon budget in climate change studies. Therefore, it is essential to develop a credible way to estimate forest biomass as carbon stock. Our study used PALSAR-2 (ALOS-2) and Sentinel-2 images to drive the Random Forest regression model, which we trained with airborne lidar data. We used the model to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) of two significant coniferous trees, Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress, in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. We used 48 variables derived from the two remote sensing datasets to predict forest AGB under the Random Forest algorithm, and found that the model that combined the two datasets performed better than models based on only one dataset, with R-2 = 0.31, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 54.38 Mg ha(-1), mean absolute error (MAE) = 40.98 Mg ha(-1), and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 0.35 for Japanese cedar, and R-2 = 0.37, RMSE = 98.63 Mg ha(-1), MAE = 76.97 Mg ha(-1), and rRMSE of 0.33 for Japanese cypress, over the whole AGB range. In the satellite AGB map, the total AGB of Japanese cedar in 17 targeted cities in Ibaraki Prefecture was 5.27 Pg, with a mean of 146.50 Mg ha(-1) and a standard deviation of 44.37 Mg ha(-1). The total AGB of Japanese cypress was 3.56 Pg, with a mean of 293.12 Mg ha(-1) and a standard deviation of 78.48 Mg ha(-1). We also found a strong linear relationship with between the model estimates and Japanese government data, with R-2 = 0.99 for both species and found the government information underestimates the AGB for cypress but overestimates it for cedar. Our results reveal that combining information from multiple sensors can predict forest AGB with increased accuracy and robustness.

TI  - <i>A</i><SUP>3</SUP>CLNN: Spatial, Spectral and Multiscale Attention ConvLSTM Neural Network for Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of effectively exploiting the information multiple data sources has become a relevant but challenging research topic in remote sensing. In this article, we propose a new approach to exploit the complementarity of two data sources: hyperspectral images (HSIs) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Specifically, we develop a new dual-channel spatial, spectral and multiscale attention convolutional long short-term memory neural network (called dual-channel A(3)CLNN) for feature extraction and classification of multisource remote sensing data. Spatial, spectral, and multiscale attention mechanisms are first designed for HSI and LiDAR data in order to learn spectral- and spatial-enhanced feature representations and to represent multiscale information for different classes. In the designed fusion network, a novel composite attention learning mechanism (combined with a three-level fusion strategy) is used to fully integrate the features in these two data sources. Finally, inspired by the idea of transfer learning, a novel stepwise training strategy is designed to yield a final classification result. Our experimental results, conducted on several multisource remote sensing data sets, demonstrate that the newly proposed dual-channel A(3) CLNN exhibits better feature representation ability (leading to more competitive classification performance) than other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Hierarchical Transmission Tower Detection from High-Resolution SAR Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The small scale of transmission towers and the environmental diversity around their situations make their detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images a challenging task. This paper presents a new hierarchical detection algorithm for transmission towers. First, Signal-to-Clutter Ratios (SCRs) of pixels are calculated. Afterwards, a SCR threshold is set. Since transmission towers possess strong scattering characteristics, pixels with SCRs above the threshold are considered as potential transmission tower pixels. Second, spatial densities of potential transmission tower pixels are calculated. According to the aggregation characteristics of transmission tower pixels, some potential transmission tower pixels with small spatial densities are removed. The remained potential transmission tower pixels are considered as candidate transmission tower pixels. The candidate transmission tower pixels are grouped by the nearest neighbour scheme such that in each group the distance between pixels is under a given threshold. Thus, each of the groups is viewed as a quasi-transmission tower. Convex-hulls of quasi-transmission towers are built, and then Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) for each convex-hull is generated. According to the rectangle aspect ratios of MBRs, the real transmission towers are extracted. C-band HH-polarization GaoFen-3 (GF-3) amplitude images are used for experiments and four of the most popular transmission tower detection algorithms are selected as comparing algorithms to validate the proposed algorithms. The detection performance of transmission towers is evaluated with detection rate and quality factor. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can efficiently and accurately detect transmission towers while maintaining the transmission tower geometry to a certain extent, which indicates that the proposed algorithm is efficient and promising.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud coverage hinders the effective range of Earth observation by optical remote sensing satellites. Rapid and accurate cloud detection is an important step in the product generation process of remote sensing applications. Given the lack of suitable and high-quality cloud detection models in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, this study takes tropical cloudy Sri Lanka as the study area and constructs a Sentinel-2 image cloud detection model coupled with support vector machines and Cloud-Score algorithm. Through experiments, the cloud detection accuracy of this method was compared to the QA60 method, Cloud-Score algorithm, and Function of mask (Fmask) from the point of view of visual interpretation and quantitative analysis. Compared with the other three cloud detection methods, the cloud detection model proposed in this study has the highest overall accuracy, reaching 98.21%, with an extremely low omission and commission errors. The model can accurately identify the cloud boundary and meet the cloud detection pre-processing requirements of Sentinel-2 remote sensing products.

TI  - Assessment of the Effectiveness of Sand-Control and Desertification in the Mu Us Desert, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The first successful sand-control was achieved in the Mu Us Desert by local people in the 1950-1960s, and their experience and approach have been extended to the whole Ordos and Northern China since then. The objective of this paper is to assess comprehensively the effectiveness of sand-control in 15 counties in and around Mu Us using multitemporal satellite images and socioeconomic data. After atmospheric correction, Landsat TM and OLI images were harnessed for land cover classification based on the ground-truth data and for derivation of the GDVI (generalized difference vegetation index) to extract the biophysical changes of the managed desert and desertification. Climatic, socioeconomic, environmental and spatial factors were selected for coupling analysis by multiple linear and logistic regression models to reveal the driving forces of desertification and their spatial determinants. The results show that from 1991 to 2020, 8712 km(2) or 63% of the desert has been converted into pastures and shrublands with a greenness increase of 0.3509 in GDVI; the effectiveness of sand-control is favored by the rational agropastoral activities and policies; though desertification occurs locally, it is associated with both climatic and socioeconomic factors, such as wind speed, precipitation, water availability, distance to roads and animal husbandry.

TI  - Long Term Observation of Fractional Vegetation Cover in Qingyang of Gansu Province and Its Response to Climate Change
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is seen as a sensitive indicator of global change because of its crucial role in connecting the atmosphere, soil, and water. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC), in turn, is an important indicator of vegetation status. Qingyang is a typically ecologically sensitive region, with a range of changes in vegetation in the last decade as a result of climatic and non-climatic factors. However, the exact impact of climate change and human activities remains unclear. Satellite observations can help to clarify that impact, allowing us to assess trends in vegetation change in the last two decades (2000-2019). In this study, daily and composite time series vegetation variations were derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the impact of climate and human activity factors was examined for different administrative districts. By deploying multiple regression models, the research revealed that human activity has contributed 46% to the FVC variation, while the remaining 54% was led by climate factors. In areas where FVC was increasing, human activity contributed 55.89% while climate factors contributed 44.11%. In areas where FVC was decreasing, human activity and climate factors contributed 24.58% and 75.42%, respectively. The study also looks at the impacts of El Nino/IOD events in FVC dynamics in the study site. The FVC inversion result from MODIS proved capable of capturing long-term and seasonal vegetation patterns and thus provide a valuable archive for decadal-scale vegetation dynamics in the study area. Moreover, the improvement in FVC was a dual effect of climatic and human activities, while the latter owns a higher contribution especially for the implementation of ecological construction projects.

TI  - Geographic range size patterns across plants and animals of Xinjiang, China
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Patterns in species geographic range size are relatively well-known for vertebrates, but still poorly known for plants. Contrasts of these patterns between groups have rarely been investigated. With a detailed flora and fauna distribution database of Xinjiang, China, we used regression methods, redundancy analysis and random forests to explore the relationship of environment and body size with the geographic range size of plants, mammals and birds in Xinjiang and contrast these patterns between plants and animals. We found positive correlations between species range size and body size. The range size of plants was more influenced by water variables, while that of mammals and birds was largely influenced by temperature variables. The productivity variable, i. e., Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was far more correlated with range size than climatic variables for both plants and animals, suggesting that vegetation productivity inferred from remote sensing data may be a good predictor of species range size for both plants and animals.

TI  - Monitoring Post-Flood Recovery of Croplands Using the Integrated Sentinel-1/2 Imagery in the Yangtze-Huai River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasingly frequent flooding imposes tremendous and long-lasting damages to lives and properties in impoverished rural areas. Rapid, accurate, and large-scale flood mapping is urgently needed for flood management, and to date has been successfully implemented benefiting from the advancement in remote sensing and cloud computing technology. Yet, the effects of agricultural emergency response to floods have been limitedly evaluated by satellite-based remote sensing, resulting in biased post-flood loss assessments. Addressing this challenge, this study presents a method for monitoring post-flood agricultural recovery using Sentinel-1/2 imagery, tested in three flood-affected main grain production areas, in the middle and lower Yangtze and Huai River, China. Our results indicated that 33~72% of the affected croplands were replanted and avoided total crop failures in summer 2020. Elevation, flood duration, crop rotation scheme, and flooding emergency management affect the post-flood recovery performance. The findings also demonstrate rapid intervention measures adjusted to local conditions could reduce the agricultural failure cost from flood disasters to a great extent. This study provides a new alternative for comprehensive disaster loss assessment in flood-prone agricultural regions, which will be insightful for worldwide flood control and management.

TI  - An Analysis of Arctic Sea Ice Leads Retrieved from AMSR-E/AMSR2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we retrieve an Arctic sea ice lead fraction from AMSR2 passive microwave data in winter from 2012 to 2020 based on an algorithm developed for AMSR-E data. The derived AMSR2 sea ice lead fraction is validated against MODIS images. The results show that the derived AMSR2 sea ice lead detects approximately 50% of the ice leads shown in the MODIS images, which is close to the amount of sea ice lead detected from the AMSR-E data from 2002 to 2011. Utilizing the retrievals from both the AMSR-E and AMSR2, our analysis shows no significant trend, but moderate interannual variation exists for the ice lead fraction in the Arctic basin scale over the past two decades. The maximum width and total length of sea ice lead show a significant decreasing trend for the whole Arctic, but the mean width does not exhibit a significant change over the studied period. In the Beaufort Sea the lead fraction varies from 2.06% to 12.35%, with a mean value of 5.72%. In the Greenland Sea the mean lead fraction over the studied period is 5.77%, and there is a significant increase in the lead fraction, with a rate of 0.13% per year. The maximum width in the Greenland Sea is substantially higher than that of other regions, and the mean width increases significantly.

TI  - Numerical Simulation of SAR Image for Sea Surface
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the simulated signal, a numerical simulation method of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging for time-varying sea surfaces is proposed, which is helpful to study the SAR imaging mechanism of time-varying sea surfaces so as to better extract ocean wave parameters from SAR images. Not only are the modulation of ocean waves, speckle noise, and temporal decorrelation of the small-scale waves considered, but the velocity bunching (VB) effect caused by the motion of large-scale waves is also effectively added to the simulation of the SAR echo signal. To verify the reliability of the simulation method, the simulated SAR images using the parameters of the RADARSAT-2 SAR, the corresponding wind wave information measured by an in-situ buoy, and the reanalysis wave spectra have been compared with the actual RADARSAT-2 SAR images. The comparisons demonstrate that the characteristics of simulated SAR images, such as the intensity distribution and the image spectra, are consistent with those of actual RADARSAT-2 SAR images. Based on the numerical simulation method proposed by us, SAR images of ocean waves for different marine environments and radar platform parameters are simulated. The imaging results indicate that the texture feature of the wind waves would be severely damaged due to the VB effect, while the texture of swells in the simulated SAR images may not be damaged or even becomes clearer. From the simulated SAR image spectrum, it can be found that the azimuth wavenumber is cut off when the VB effect is considered in the simulation process, and the azimuth cut-off wavelength increases with the range-to-velocity ratio.

TI  - Data-Driven Selection of Land Product Validation Station Based on Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation is a crucial technique used to strengthen the application capabilities of earthobservation satellite data and solve the quality problems of remote-sensing products. Observing land-surface parameters in the field is one of the key steps of validation. Therefore, the demand for long-term stable validation stations has gradually increased. However, the current location-selection procedure of validation stations lacks a systematic and objective evaluation system. In this research, a data-driven selection of a land product validation station (DSS-LPV) based on Machine Learning is proposed. Firstly, we construct an evaluation indicator system in which all factors affecting the location of validation stations are divided into surface characteristics, atmospheric conditions and the social environment. Then, multi-scale evaluation grids are constructed and indicators are allocated for spatial evaluation. Finally, four Machine Learning (ML) methods are used to learn the established reliable stations, and different data-driven scoring models are constructed to explore the intrinsic relationship between evaluation indicators and station locations. In this article, the reliability of DSS-LPV is effectively validated by the example of China using the national-level land product validation station that has been established. After a comparison between the four ML models, the random forest (RF) with the highest accuracy was selected as the modeling method of DSS-LPV. The correlation between the regression value of test stations and the target value is 0.9133. The average score of test stations is 0.8304. The test stations are generally located within the calculated hot-spot area of the score density map, which means that it is highly consistent with the location of the built stations. Research results indicate that DSS-LPV is an effective method that can provide a reasonable geographical distribution of the stations. The location-selection results can provide scientific decision-making support for the construction of land product validation stations.

TI  - Pan-Sharpening Based on CNN plus Pyramid Transformer by Using No-Reference Loss
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of existing deep learning pan-sharpening methods often use simulated degraded reference data due to the missing of real fusion labels which affects the fusion performance. The normally used convolutional neural network (CNN) can only extract the local detail information well which may cause the loss of important global contextual characteristics with long-range dependencies in fusion. To address these issues and to fuse spatial and spectral information with high quality information from the original panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images, this paper presents a novel pan-sharpening method by designing the CNN+ pyramid Transformer network with no-reference loss (CPT-noRef). Specifically, the Transformer is used as the main architecture for fusion to supply the global features, the local features in shallow CNN are combined, and the multi-scale features from the pyramid structure adding to the Transformer encoder are learned simultaneously. Our loss function directly learns the spatial information extracted from the PAN image and the spectral information from the MS image which is suitable for the theory of pan-sharpening and makes the network control the spatial and spectral loss simultaneously. Both training and test processes are based on real data, so the simulated degraded reference data is no longer needed, which is quite different from most existing deep learning fusion methods. The proposed CPT-noRef network can effectively solve the huge amount of data required by the Transformer network and extract abundant image features for fusion. In order to assess the effectiveness and universality of the fusion model, we have trained and evaluated the model on the experimental data of WorldView-2(WV-2) and Gaofen-1(GF-1) and compared it with other typical deep learning pan-sharpening methods from both the subjective visual effect and the objective index evaluation. The results show that the proposed CPT-noRef network offers superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our method has the strongest generalization capability by testing the Pleiades and WV-2 images on the network trained by GF-1 data. The no-reference loss function proposed in this paper can greatly enhance the spatial and spectral information of the fusion image with good performance and robustness.

TI  - Correcting remote-sensed shaded image with urban surface radiative transfer model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Shaded areas reduce the quality of digital images, bring many difficulties to image interpretation, especially in the high-resolution remote-sensed images. In order to improve the urban application capability, shadow correction should be performed. In this article, a new methodology for shadow correction was proposed applying the Urban Solar Radiative Transfer (USRT)1 model, which was a shadow correction scheme based on physical model. The sky view factor (SVF)2 was selected as one factor to quantify the morphological and structural characteristics of urban underlying surface, and then each radiation component was expressed quantitatively at pixel-level scale. Finally, the shadow correction was performed by calculating the actual reflectance of the urban materials in shadow areas. To validate the proposed scheme, three different spatial-resolution remote-sensed images were applied to perform shadow correction, including samples of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Worldview-3 satellite image data. The results showed the following: (1) The shadow correction method can better improve the reflectance of the shadow area to the level of the illuminated area. There was a positive effect on the spectral reconstruction of different materials in the shadow areas after correction, and the spectral curves of corrected results coincided with the illuminated areas. (2) With the increase of spatial resolution, there was an increasing trend in the accuracy of shadow correction. In fact, the difference in the reflectance between the shadow corrected region and the illumination region decreased with the spatial resolution increasing. For example, after USRT shading correction, the rRMSE values of vegetation in the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Worldview-3 images was 20.4%, 13.2%, and 9.8%, respectively. Generally, this proposed scheme can restore the spectral characteristics in the shadow areas and improve image quality, and there is a good application prospect in the field of high-resolution remote-sensed image processing.

TI  - Using radiant intensity to characterize the anisotropy of satellite-derived city light at night
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have described the anisotropy of ALAN based on statistical analysis of a quadratic model-based relationship between radiances derived from the VIIRS Day/Night Band sensor onboard Suomi-NPP and viewing zenith angle (VZA) (Li et al., 2019). Contrary to conventional wisdom, the satellite-observed radiance of ALAN always decreases at first and then increase with VZA, especially for high building areas. This leads to a socalled 'cold-spot' effect (i.e. radiance reaches local minimum in a specific VZA) in the VZA-radiance relationship, one that has not been understood using existing remote sensing methods. In this paper, we propose using radiant intensity - a measure of light power in a specific direction- to characterize the anisotropy of satellite-observed artificial lights at night (ALAN). Accordingly, we propose a new study design based on analysis across fourteen global cities. A linear regression model describing the relationship between VZA and radiant intensity resulted in an averaged regression R-2 between 0.26 and 0.73 for the cities, suggesting a decay of radiant intensity with increased VZA. We then introduced a cosine-corrected linear model to describe the VZA-radiance relationship, which is mathematically transformed from the linear VZA-intensity model. Our results suggest that the 'cold spot' effect in the VZA-radiance relationship is consistent with the revealed phenomenon that the radiant intensity decays with increased VZA. We also constructed indexes related to urban morphology derived from LiDAR data, including the Blocking Index (BI), the Standard Deviation of Building Height (SDBI) and Average Building Height (ABH). These variables were all moderately or strongly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient < -0.45) to the Change Index (CI), which describes the anisotropic pattern of ALAN in the VZA-intensity relationship, in the four U.S. cities where LiDAR data is accessible. We conclude that radiant intensity is a suitable physical index to characterize the directional distribution of ALAN that can help understand the anisotropy of ALAN.

TI  - Coseismic Deformation Field Extraction and Fault Slip Inversion of the 2021 Yangbi M<sub>W</sub> 6.1 Earthquake, Yunnan Province, Based on Time-Series InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An earthquake of moderate magnitude (M-W 6.1) occurred in Yangbi County, Dali, Yunnan Province, China, on 21 May 2021. Compared to strong earthquakes, the measurement of the deformation fields of moderate earthquakes is more susceptible to errors associated with atmospheric, orbital, and topographic features. We adopted a new time-series InSAR method to process preseismic and postseismic Sentinel-1A SAR time-series images and separated the coseismic deformation signals from various error signals. This method uses preseismic time-series interferograms to estimate the spatially correlated look angle error induced by the digital elevation model and the atmospheric and orbital errors in the master image. The preseismic and postseismic time-series interferograms were then segmented for spatio-temporal filtering to provide a precise estimate of the atmospheric and orbital errors in slave images. Such time-series processing accurately separates various errors from the coseismic deformation signal and prevents the coseismic deformation signal from being included as noise in the error estimation during filtering. Based on this approach, we effectively eliminated the masking of the deformation signal by the errors and extracted coseismic deformation field of the Yangbi M-W 6.1 earthquake with high precision. The maximum LOS displacement in the ascending and descending tracks were determined to be -74 and -62 mm, respectively. Subsequently, we used the Geodetic Bayesian Inversion Software to invert the fault geometric parameters of this earthquake, and based on this inverted the rupture slip distribution using the least-squares method. The results showed that the fault orientation is 133.43 degrees, dip angle is 76.98 degrees, source depth is 5.5 km, fault sliding mode is right-lateral strike-slip. The moment magnitude (M-W) was calculated to be 6.07.

TI  - Surface meltwater runoff routing through a coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system, Inglefield Land, northwest Greenland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The northwest Greenland Ice Sheet (NW GrIS) is rapidly losing mass, and its ablation zone has expanded over the past two decades. Numerous supraglacial streams flowing directly over the NW GrIS surface drain a large lobe of grounded ice at Inglefield Land, into the proglacial Minturn River and the Nares Strait. Owing to the absence of moulins and crevasses, this continuous supraglacial-proglacial drainage system regulates the evacuation of surface meltwater from the ice sheet to the ocean. We examine this Inglefield Land coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system during the 2016-2019 melt seasons (July to August), using 137 Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 visible/near-infrared satellite images. Two surface water metrics (supraglacial meltwater area fraction A(m) and proglacial river effective width W-e) are used to track spatio-temporal variations of surface meltwater moving through this drainage system. Satellite-derived A(m) and W-e are also compared with daily surface runoff simulations from the MAR v3.11 and MERRA-2 climate/SMB models, to estimate meltwater routing lag times and assess model performance. Satellite-derived A(m) and W-e are highly correlated (r(2) = 0.85, p < 0.01), indicating that the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system evacuates meltwater directly from the ice surface to the ocean with negligible subglacial storage or delays. Both remotely sensed metrics are positively correlated with modeled runoff, especially MAR (r(2) = 0.81 and 0.77 for A(m) and W-e, vs. 0.66 and 0.64 for MERRA-2). Lagged MAR runoff (2 days, r(2) = 0.87 and 0.82) match both metrics better than simultaneous MAR runoff and the optimal time lag for both metrics are 2 d. We conclude that 1) unlike the southwest GrIS, the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system at Inglefield Land routes surface meltwater runoff directly off the ice surface to the proglacial zone, with virtually no subglacial capture of runoff by moulins; 2) most of the similar to 2 d transit time occurs on the ice surface rather than in the proglacial zone; and 3) multi-temporal satellite imaging facilitates holistic, source-to-sink tracking of NW GrIS meltwater from the ice surface to the global ocean.

TI  - An enhanced spatiotemporal fusion method - Implications for DNN based time-series LAI estimation by using Sentinel-2 and MODIS
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The consequent and accurate monitoring of the seasonal dynamics of crop leaf area index (LAI) is critical to yield estimation and agriculture policy development. It is difficult for a single sensor to balance spatial and temporal resolution. Spatiotemporal fusion is an effective way to meet the need for high spatial and temporal applications. Among the fusion methods, regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation (Fit-FC) may be recommended for vegetation dynamic monitoring because of its outperformance for the cases with considerable phenological changes. However, it is not good at capturing image structure and textures. To overcome the limitations, an enhanced version of Fit-FC, referred as Enhanced-Fit-FC (EFF), was developed. The EFF method can be applied with one (unidirectional prediction, Uni-EFF) or two (bidirectional prediction, Bi-EFF) coarse-fine image pairs as input for near real-time or post-growth applications. The visual and quantitative assessments indicated that EFF mitigated the blurring effect of Fit-FC and generated accurate reflectance, especially Bi-EFF contributed to capturing land cover changes. Compared with Fit-FC, the correlation coefficient (CC) and quality index (QI) of EFF increased by more than 0.12, and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 0.16 at the maximum. Further, we identified the robustness and adaptability of deep neural network (DNN) model for time-series LAI estimation. The results substantiated the effectiveness of DNN in dealing with nonlinear problems and alleviating spectral saturation with higher CC and lower RMSE and relative RMSE (rRMSE) at whole growth-stages (CC=0.91, RMSE=0.28, and rRMSE=7.18%) and vegetative stage (CC=0.94, RMSE=0.24, and rRMSE=5.81%). In conclusion, the EFF method proposed in this study is competent in constructing time-series synthetic images for near real-time or post-growth applications. Moreover, the DNN model shows the potential for LAI estimation at whole growth-stages. This research not only contributes to dense time-series remote sensing-based applications (e.g., land cover change monitoring, yield forecast), but also is valuable for high-spatial-precision farmland management.

TI  - Systematic method for mapping fine-resolution water cover types in China based on time series Sentinel-1 and 2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans have been transforming natural surface water bodies into various types of artificial water cover to meet the growing demand for food, energy, and flood protection in recent decades. These changes have exerted cumulative impacts on the water cycle, environment, and ecology. Although the geographical distribution of and changes in water cover types is essential to understanding these changes, timely and accurate acquisition and updating are difficult to accomplish, mainly because of the lack of a practical and effective classification method, especially at the global and national scales. From the perspective of water cover, first we suggest a comprehensive water cover classification system in terms of water sources, water body shapes, and water usage, including rivers, reservoirs, lakes, agricultural ponds, seasonal wetlands, and rice fields. An automatic and operational classification method based on shape features and flooding frequency (AuCoSaFF) is developed accordingly. Then, we employ this method to produce an unprecedented 10-meter spatial resolution China Water Cover Map (CWaC) using time series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2020 and obtained from the Google Earth Engine. The validation shows that this dataset has an overall accuracy of 86% and a kappa coefficient of 0.83. The CWaC is the first thematic mapping on water cover types over all of China, and it provides information on the complete water cover types. It indicates that China's water cover area is 240,383 km(2 ) of which natural water accounts for 56.3%. China's water bodies are mainly distributed in Heilongjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai provinces. A comparison with seven other water-related data products highlights the advantages of the AuCoSaFF in acquiring high spatial and temporal resolution information about the complete water cover types at large scales. The shape-based and inundation frequency-based automatic method underlines the potentials of fast water cover type mapping at large scales using existing water datasets. We also anticipate that this freely available dataset will provide evidence of the states of and changes in wetlands, help to improve our understanding of human influences on the hydrologic cycle, and inform water-management decision-making.

TI  - Improving Dengue Forecasts by Using Geospatial Big Data Analysis in Google Earth Engine and the Historical Dengue Information-Aided Long Short Term Memory Modeling
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Forecasting dengue cases often face challenges from (1) time-effectiveness due to time-consuming satellite data downloading and processing, (2) weak spatial representation due to data dependence on administrative unit-based statistics or weather station-based observations, and (3) stagnant accuracy without historical dengue cases. With the advance of the geospatial big data cloud computing in Google Earth Engine and deep learning, this study proposed an efficient framework of dengue prediction at an epidemiological week basis using geospatial big data analysis in Google Earth Engine and Long Short Term Memory modeling. We focused on the dengue epidemics in the Federal District of Brazil during 2007-2019. Based on Google Earth Engine and epidemiological calendar, we computed the weekly composite for each dengue driving factor, and spatially aggregated the pixel values into dengue transmission areas to generate the time series of driving factors. A multi-step-ahead Long Short Term Memory modeling was used, and the time-differenced natural log-transformed dengue cases and the time series of driving factors were considered as outcomes and explantary factors, respectively, with two modeling scenarios (with and without historical cases). The performance is better when historical cases were used, and the 5-weeks-ahead forecast has the best performance. Timely and accurate forecasts of dengue cases are of great importance for guiding disease prevention strategies, but still face challenges from (1) time-effectiveness due to time-consuming satellite data downloading and processing, (2) weak spatial representation capability due to data dependence on administrative unit-based statistics or weather station-based observations, and (3) stagnant accuracy without the application of historical case information. Geospatial big data, cloud computing platforms (e.g., Google Earth Engine, GEE), and emerging deep learning algorithms (e.g., long short term memory, LSTM) provide new opportunities for advancing these efforts. Here, we focused on the dengue epidemics in the urban agglomeration of the Federal District of Brazil (FDB) during 2007-2019. A new framework was proposed using geospatial big data analysis in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and long short term memory (LSTM) modeling for dengue case forecasts over an epidemiological week basis. We first defined a buffer zone around an impervious area as the main area of dengue transmission by considering the impervious area as a human-dominated area and used the maximum distance of the flight range of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus as a buffer distance. Those zones were used as units for further attribution analyses of dengue epidemics by aggregating the pixel values into the zones. The near weekly composite of potential driving factors was generated in GEE using the epidemiological weeks during 2007-2019, from the relevant geospatial data with daily or sub-daily temporal resolution. A multi-step-ahead LSTM model was used, and the time-differenced natural log-transformed dengue cases were used as outcomes. Two modeling scenarios (with and without historical dengue cases) were set to examine the potential of historical information on dengue forecasts. The results indicate that the performance was better when historical dengue cases were used and the 5-weeks-ahead forecast had the best performance, and the peak of a large outbreak in 2019 was accurately forecasted.The proposed framework in this study suggests the potential of the GEE platform, the LSTM algorithm, as well as historical information for dengue risk forecasting, which can easily be extensively applied to other regions or globally for timely and practical dengue forecasts.

TI  - Accurate Monitoring of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in a Macrophytic Lake Using Time-Series Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is one of the most important biological groups in shallow lakes ecosystems, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing the structure and function of water ecosystems. The study area of this research is Baiyangdian, which is a typical macrophytic lake with complex land cover types. This research aims to solve the low accuracy problem of the remote sensing extraction of SAV, which is mainly caused by water level fluctuations, differences in life-history characteristics, and mixed-pixel phenomena. Here, we developed a phenology-pixel method to determine the spatial distribution of SAV and the start and end dates of its growing season by using all Sentinel-2 images collected over a year on the Google Earth Engine platform. The experimental results show the following: (1) The phenology-pixel algorithm can effectively identify the maximum spatial distribution and growth period of submerged aquatic vegetation in Baiyangdian Lake throughout the year. The unique normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) peak characteristics of Potamogeton crispus from March to May were used to effectively distinguish it from the low Phragmites australis population. Textural features based on the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) index effectively removed the mixed-pixel phenomenon of macrophytic lakes (such as dikes and sparse reeds). (2) A complete five-day interval NDVI time-series dataset was obtained, which removes potential noise on the temporal scale and fills in noisy observations by the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) method. We determined the two phenological periods of typical SAV by analyzing the intrayear variation characteristics of NDVI and MNDWI. (3) Using field-survey data for accuracy verification, the overall accuracy of our method was determined to be 94.8%, and the user's accuracy and producer's accuracy were 93.3% and 87.3%, respectively. Determining the temporal and spatial distribution of different SAV populations provides important technical support for actively promoting the maintenance and reconstruction of lake and reservoir ecosystems.

TI  - Applicability of the multispectral remote sensing on determining the natural rock complexes distribution and their evaluability on the radiation protection applications
T2  - RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mafic and ultramafic rocks of Mettupalayam belong to Southern Granulite Terrain (SGT), and it is prominent with economically valuable resources. The radiation shielding properties of the rock types, along with the remote sensing aspects, are considered in the study. The image processing techniques like Principal Component Analysis, Band ratio, Minimum Noise Fraction are performed using Landsat data to discriminate the litho units. The spectral characters derived from Landsat data identified with the significant absorptions of Fe2+, Fe3+ and OPx. The Monte Carlo simulation was applied to evaluate the radiation protection ability of the studied rock samples. The examination showed a high shielding capacity for Gabbro rocks compared to the other studied rocks. The linear attenuation coefficient of the mentioned Gabbro rocks varied among 47.838 and 0.075 cm(-1) when the gamma-ray energy increases in the energy interval 0.015 and 15 MeV. Moreover, the Radiation defensive capacity of the Gabbro samples decreased from 100 to 20.095% while the halve value layer increases from 0.014 to 9.269 cm with raising the gamma photon energy among 0.015 and 15 MeV, correspondingly.

TI  - Large-Scale Rice Mapping Using Multi-Task Spatiotemporal Deep Learning and Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate cropland information at large spatial scales can improve crop management and support the government in decision making. Mapping the spatial extent and distribution of crops on a large spatial scale is challenging work due to the spatial variability. A multi-task spatiotemporal deep learning model, named LSTM-MTL, was developed in this study for large-scale rice mapping by utilizing time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data. The model showed a reasonable rice classification accuracy in the major rice production areas of the U.S. (OA = 98.3%, F1 score = 0.804), even when it only utilized SAR data. The model learned region-specific and common features simultaneously, and yielded a significant improved performance compared with RF and AtBiLSTM in both global and local training scenarios. We found that the LSTM-MTL model achieved a regional F1 score up to 10% higher than both global and local baseline models. The results demonstrated that the consideration of spatial variability via LSTM-MTL approach yielded an improved crop classification performance at a large spatial scale. We analyzed the input-output relationship through gradient backpropagation and found that low VH value in the early period and high VH value in the latter period were critical for rice classification. The results of in-season analysis showed that the model was able to yield a high accuracy (F1 score = 0.746) two months before rice maturity. The integration between multi-task learning and multi-temporal deep learning approach provides a promising approach for crop mapping at large spatial scales.

TI  - Development of an App and Teaching Concept for Implementation of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data into School Lessons Using Augmented Reality
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the purpose of expanding STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) education with remote sensing (RS) data and methods, an augmented reality (AR) app was developed in combination with a worksheet and lesson plan. Data from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) was searched for topics applicable to STEM curricula, which was found in the example of a harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie, USA, in 2011. Spectral shape algorithms were applied to differentiate between less harmful green and more harmful blue algae in the lake. The data was pre-processed to reduce its size significantly without losing too much information and then integrated into an app that was developed in Unity with the Vuforia extension. It was designed to let students browse and understand the raw data in RGB and a tangible hyperspectral cube, as well as to analyze algae maps derived from it. The app runs on Android smartphones with minimized data usage to make it less dependent on school funding and the socioeconomic background of students. Using educational concepts, such as active and collaborative learning, moderate constructivism, and scientific inquiry, the data was integrated into a lesson about environmental problems that was enhanced by the AR app. The app and worksheet were evaluated in two advanced geography courses (n = 36) and found to be complex, but doable and understandable, for the target group of German high school students in their final two school years. Thus, hyperspectral data can be used for STEM lessons using AR technology on students' smartphones with several limitations both in the technology used and gainable knowledge.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy of Forest Phenological Extraction from Sentinel-1 C-Band Backscatter Measurements in Deciduous and Coniferous Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is an important method for forest phenological studies at continental or global scales. Sentinel-1 (S1), a polar orbit satellite with a spatial resolution of 10 m, provides an opportunity to observe high-resolution forest phenology. The sensitivities of S1 C-band backscatter measurements to vegetation phenology, such as crops, meadows, and mixed forests, have been discussed, whereas their performance for different forest types has not yet been quantitatively assessed. It is necessary to evaluate accuracy before adapting S1 datasets in forest phenological studies. This study discusses the seasonal variations in S1 backscatter measurements and assesses the accuracy of S1-based forest phenological metrics in two types of typical forests: deciduous and coniferous. S1 C-band SAR dual-polarization backscatter measurements for the period 2017-2019 were used to extract forest phenology metrics using the Fourier transform (FT) and double logistic (DL) functions. Phenological metrics from the ground-based PhenoCam dataset were used for evaluation. The S1 backscatter VV-VH signal peaks for deciduous and coniferous forests occur in the winter and summer, respectively. The S1 backscatter could reasonably characterize the start of season (SOS) of deciduous forests, with R-2 values up to 0.8, whereas the R-2 values for coniferous forest SOS were less than 0.30. Moreover, the retrieved end of season (EOS) was less accurate than the SOS. The differences in accuracy of S1 backscatter phenological metrics between deciduous and coniferous forests can be explained by the differences in seasonal changes in their corresponding canopy structures. To conclude, S1 C-band backscatter has a reasonable performance when monitoring the SOS of deciduous broadleaf forests (R-2 = 0.8) and relatively poor performance when extracting EOS of deciduous broadleaf forests (R-2 = 0.25) or phenology of evergreen needleleaf forests (R-2 = 0.2).

TI  - Activity Analysis of the Fuyu North Fault, China: Evidence from the Time-Series InSAR, GNSS, Seismic Reflection Profile, and Plate Dynamics
T2  - LITHOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake disasters are frequent, and the seismic intensity is large in Northeast China. Earthquake activity research is an important aspect of earthquake disaster management. We chose some unconventional means to study fault activity, to find updated activity evidence. The Ms 5.3 earthquake occurred near the Fuyu North Fault (FNF) of China on May 27, 2018. Using the Sentinel-1B descending orbit data from 2016 to 2019, the line-of-sight (LOS) surface deformation in the study area was calculated by using the small baseline subset (SBAS) method. After transforming to the horizontal EW deformation, the variance component estimation method was used for fusion reconstruction with the EW data of the surrounding GNSS stations. The polynomial least square method is used to fit the fault slip rate of three EW data on the surface trace of the FNF. The fitting results of the three regions show that the horizontal eastward distribution rate of the upper plate is significantly greater than that of the lower plate, which is left-lateral clockwise torsion. The vertical structural deformation caused by the growth strata of the upper and lower plates of the upper SYT2 seismic profile of the FNF is quantitatively calculated, and the thrust rate of the upper plate is 0.2 mm/y relative to that of the lower plate. Based on the Li Siguang chessboard structure model, we found that the compression stress in the north-south direction is gradually weakened, and the compression stress in the east-west direction is gradually enhanced. Through the Coulomb stress analysis, the three events of CMT only induced the historical focal location of the surrounding part. The events of 2017 did not induce the events of 2018, but the events of 2019 were related to the induced effects of 2017 and 2018.

T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Shore zone information is essential for coastal habitat assessment, environmental hazard monitoring, and resource conservation. However, traditional coastal zone classification mainly relies on in situ measurements and expert knowledge interpretation, which are costly and inefficient. This study classifies a shore zone area using satellite remote sensing data only and investigates the effect of the statistical indicators from Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) information with the Sentinel-2 data-derived spectral variables on the prediction results. Google Earth Engine was used to synthesize long time-series Sentinel-2 images, and different features were calculated for this synthetic image. Then, statistical indicators reflecting the characteristics of the shore zone profile were extracted from ICESat-2. Finally, a random forest algorithm was used to develop characteristics and shore zone classification. Comparing the results with the data measured shows that the proposed method can effectively classify the shore zone; it has an accuracy of 83.61% and a kappa coefficient of 0.81.

TI  - Research on the Planning of an Urban Ventilation Corridor Based on the Urban Underlying Surface Taking Kaifeng City as an Example
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, various urban problems such as air pollution, urban heat islands, poor ventilation, and so on have followed. Ventilation corridors can improve the internal ventilation conditions of a city and can effectively alleviate these urban problems. Taking Kaifeng as an example of a medium-sized city, this study used meteorological analysis and remote sensing (RS) technology and a geographical information system (GIS) to plan ventilation corridors. Through analysis of the thermal environment, the influential factors of the underlying surface (building density, road length, water length, vegetation coverage) and wind environment in Kaifeng, the compensation space and action space, and the comprehensive values of the ventilation potential in each region were determined. The results show that with the use of the single-window algorithm and Landsat8 data, high-resolution ground temperature can be retrieved. Moreover, although the ventilation potential value of Kaifeng in the northern part is better than that in the southern part, the temperature in the north is higher than that in the south. Through comparison and analysis of the location of the low-temperature zone, the air duct opening of the ventilation corridor can be determined and the source areas of three ecological ventilation corridors identified. According to the ventilation corridor air duct opening, the urban underlying surface and the dominant wind direction of Kaifeng city, two ventilation corridors located on the eastern and western sides of Kaifeng city were planned. This urban ventilation corridor planning method, which is based on temperature difference analysis and determination of the source area of the ventilation corridor, can provide a reference for the construction of an ecologically livable city.

AB  - Danjiangkou Reservoir is water source of Middle Route Project of the South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) Project, research on the dynamic changes in vegetation cover and its influencing factors is of great significance for understanding the ecological environment of the water diversion area and formulating protection measures. In this study, the normalized difference in vegetation index (NDVI) was used to analyze the dynamic changes and influencing factors of vegetation in the upstream and downstream of Danjiangkou Dam from 1982 to 2018. The results showed that the NDVI exhibited an upward trend of 0.017 year(-1) (P < 0.05), and that the significantly increased area was located near the valley upstream of the dam, while the significantly decreased area was mainly distributed in the basin downstream of the dam and around the central city. The comprehensive contributions of climate and human activity factors to NDVI changes were 92.03% and 7.97%, respectively. The human activities in the upstream of the dam were mainly reflected in the ecological measures such as returning farmland to forest; the human activities at the downstream of the dam were mainly reflected in urban expansion, occupation of cultivated land and forest land by construction land.

TI  - Precipitation Retrieval from Fengyun-3D Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder Data Using Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important component of the Earth system, precipitation plays a vital role in regional and global water cycles. Based on Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) onboard FY-3D satellite, four machine learning models, random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), are implemented to retrieve precipitation rate, and verified with Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG). This paper determines the optimal hyperparameters of the machine models and proposes three linear combinations of MWHTS channels (183.31 & PLUSMN; 1.0-183.31 & PLUSMN; 3.0 GHz, 183.31 & PLUSMN; 1.0-183.31 & PLUSMN; 7.0 GHz, and 183.31 & PLUSMN; 3.0-183.31 & PLUSMN; 7.0 GHz), which can better characterize precipitation of different intensities. With the inclusion of three linear combinations, the performances of all four machine learning models are significantly improved. It is concluded that the RFR and GBRT have the best retrieval accuracy. Over ocean, the MSE, MAE, and R-2 values of precipitation estimates using RFR are 1.75 mm/h, 0.44 mm/h, and 0.80, respectively, and are 1.80 mm/h, 0.45 mm/h, and 0.78 for GBRT. Simultaneously, this paper analyzes the retrieval results from the perspective of the different rain rates and temporal matching difference between MWHTS and IMERG data. The RFR and GBRT also maintain the best retrieval accuracy under the condition of Gaussian noise, indicating the relatively strong robustness and antinoise performance of ensemble learning models for precipitation retrieval.

TI  - Soil Moisture Content Retrieval from Remote Sensing Data by Artificial Neural Network Based on Sample Optimization
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an essential role in geoscience research. The SMC can be retrieved using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on remote sensing data. The quantity and quality of samples for ANN training and testing are two critical factors that affect the SMC retrieving results. This study focused on sample optimization in both quantity and quality. On the one hand, a sparse sample exploitation (SSE) method was developed to solve the problem of sample scarcity, resultant from cloud obstruction in optical images and the malfunction of in situ SMC-measuring instruments. With this method, data typically excluded in conventional approaches can be adequately employed. On the other hand, apart from the basic input parameters commonly discussed in previous studies, a couple of new parameters were optimized to improve the feature description. The Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat-8 images were adopted to retrieve SMC in the study area in eastern Austria. By the SSE method, the number of available samples increased from 264 to 635 for ANN training and testing, and the retrieval accuracy could be markedly improved. Furthermore, the optimized parameters also improve the inversion effect, and the elevation was the most influential input parameter.

TI  - The Accuracy of Winter Wheat Identification at Different Growth Stages Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the differences in the accuracy of winter wheat identification using remote sensing data at different growth stages using the same methods. Part of northern Henan Province, China was taken as the study area, and the winter wheat growth cycle was divided into five periods (seeding-tillering, overwintering, reviving, jointing-heading, and flowering-maturing) based on monitoring data obtained from agrometeorological stations. With the help of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, the separability between winter wheat and other land cover types was analyzed and compared using the Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance method. Spectral features, vegetation index, water index, building index, texture features, and terrain features were generated from Sentinel-2 remote sensing images at different growth periods, and then were used to establish a random forest classification and extraction model. A deep U-Net semantic segmentation model based on the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands of Sentinel-2 imagery was also established. By combining models with field data, the identification of winter wheat was carried out and the difference between the accuracy of the identification in the five growth periods was analyzed. The experimental results show that, using the random forest classification method, the best separability between winter wheat and the other land cover types was achieved during the jointing-heading period: the overall identification accuracy for the winter wheat was then highest at 96.90% and the kappa coefficient was 0.96. Using the deep-learning classification method, it was also found that the semantic segmentation accuracy of winter wheat and the model performance were best during the jointing-heading period: a precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and IoU of 0.94, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.88, respectively, were achieved for this period. Based on municipal statistical data for winter wheat, the accuracy of the extraction of the winter wheat area using the two methods was 96.72% and 88.44%, respectively. Both methods show that the jointing-heading period is the best period for identifying winter wheat using remote sensing and that the identification made during this period is reliable. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for accurately obtaining the area planted with winter wheat and for further studies into winter wheat growth monitoring and yield estimation.

TI  - Dynamic changes in lakes and potential drivers within the Selin Co basin, Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Prevailing lake changes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) have occurred. Selin Co, a representative saline lake in the central region of the QTP, has had the largest increase and become the largest endorheic lake in Tibet, but the main cause for its dramatic expansion is still under debate. Based on Landsat images, meteorological data and glacier and permafrost data, the dynamic changes in Selin Co and its surrounding small lakes were systematically discussed, and the driving factors behind these changes were further explored. The results suggest that during 1988-2017, the areas of Bange Co and Cuoe Lake showed slow, overall increasing trends at the rates of 0.28 km(2)/year and 0.11 km(2)/year, respectively, and upward trends before 2005 but downward trends afterward. The area of Selin Co substantially increased by 685.8 km(2) with a growth rate of 30.39 km(2)/year, with a slow increase of 27.11 km(2) during the period of 1988-1997, a rapid increase of 510.53 km(2) during 1997-2005 and an increase of 148.16 km(2) during 2005-2017. Accordingly, the lake level and water volume of Bange Co slightly increased by 1.64 m and 0.088 km(3), respectively, whereas those of Selin Co significantly rose by 8.138 m and 17.47 km(3), respectively. The changes in the areas of Bange Co and Cuoe Lake were mostly related to annual precipitation (AP). The expansion of Selin Co may be partly explained as the discharge from the glacier retreat and permafrost degradation in the watershed. Glacial meltwater has enhanced owing to rising, with a rapid reduction of 165.1 km(2) (39%) in the glacier area in the basin between 1980 and 2010. Permafrost degradation has significantly accelerated, with increases in the active layer thickness (ALT) (7.44 cm/year) and soil temperatures at a 15-m depth (0.0346 degrees C/year).

TI  - Neural network guided interpolation for mapping canopy height of China's forests by integrating GEDI and ICESat-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially continuous estimates of forest canopy height at national to global scales are critical for quantifying forest carbon storage, understanding forest ecosystem processes, and developing forest management and restoration policies to mitigate global climate change. Spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) platforms, especially the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), can measure forest canopy height in discrete footprints globally. Their coverage provides a promising data source for national to global-scale forest canopy height estimates. However, previous studies usually used a regression-based approach to develop spatially continuous forest canopy height distribution through the aid of optical images, which cannot take full advantage of the dense spaceborne lidar footprints and may still suffer from the saturation effect of optical images. In this study, we developed a novel neural network guided interpolation (NNGI) method to map forest canopy height by fusing GEDI, ICESat-2 ATLAS, and Sentinel-2 images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed NNGI method, we generated a 30-m forest canopy height product of China for the year 2019. More than 140 km2 drone-lidar data were collected across the country to train and validate the NNGI method. The results showed that the average forest canopy height of China is 15.90 m with a standard deviation of 5.77 m. We evaluated the interpolated forest canopy height product of China by over 1,100,000 GEDI validation footprints (R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 5.32 m), about 33 km2 drone-lidar validation data (R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 4.93 m), and over 59,000 field plot measurements (R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 4.88 m). Benefiting from the interpolation-based mapping strategy, the resulting product had almost no saturation effect in areas with tall forest canopies. The high mapping accuracy demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed NNGI method for monitoring spatially continuous forest canopy height at national to global scales by integrating multi-platform spaceborne lidar data and optical images, enabling opportunities to provide more accurate quantification of terrestrial carbon storage and better understanding of forest ecosystem processes.

TI  - A neural networks based method for suspended sediment concentration retrieval from GF-5 hyperspectral images
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is an extremely important property for water monitoring. Since machine learning technology has been successfully applied in many domains, we combined the strengths of empirical algorithms and the artificial neural network (ANN) to further improve remote sensing retrieval results. In this study, the neural network calibrator (NNC) based on ANN was proposed to secondarily correct the empirical coarse results from empirical algorithms and generate fine results. A specialized regularization term has been employed in order to prevent overfitting problem in case of the small dataset. Based on the Gaofen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral remote sensing data and the concurrently collected SSC field measurements in the Yangtze estuarine and coastal waters , we systematically investigated 4 empirical baseline models and evaluated the improvement of accuracy after the calibration of NNC. Two typical applications of NNC models consisting baseline model calibration and temporal calibration have been tested on each baseline models. In both applications, results showed that the calibrated D'Sa model is of highest accuracy. By employing the baseline model calibration, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 0. 1495 g/L to 0. 1436 g/L, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreased from 0. 7821 to 0. 7580 and the coefficient of determination (R-2) increased from 0.6805 to 0.6926. After implementation of the temporal calibration , MAPE decreased from 0. 8657 to 0. 7817 and I2 2 increased from 0. 6688 to 0. 7155. Finally, the entire GF-5 hyperspectral images on target date were processed using the NNC calibrated model with the highest accuracy. Our work provides a universal double calibration method to minimize the inherent errors of the baseline models and a moderate improvement of accuracy can be achieved.

TI  - Evaluation of consistency among three NDVI products applied to High Mountain Asia in 2000-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study evaluates consistency among three Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets, namely GIMMS, MODIS and SPOT, to characterize alpine vegetation dynamics (greening and browning) across High Mountain Asia (HMA) in 2001-2015. The utility of these datasets is explored to evaluate the vegetation's variability at different spatial-temporal scales and, elevation, and to compare their spatial trends and distribution patterns. In addition to the Pearson correlation coefficients performed to quantitatively analyze the consistency and inconsistency of each dataset, an NDVI quality control (QC) layer and Landsat NDVI are also used to evaluate the findings. The results indicate that the GIMMS has the highest NDVI mean, while SPOT has the lowest. However, GIMMS also showed a browning trend for both Tianshan (TS) and the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (TP) at a rate of -0.3 x 10(-3) per year, whereas MODIS and SPOT exhibit a greening trend (TSMODIS = 0.5 x 10(-3) per year, TSSPOT = 0.6 x 10(-3) per year, TPMODIS = 0.9 x 10(-3) per year, TPSPOT = 1.6 x 10(-3) per year). Furthermore, MODIS-SPOT shows the highest correlation (R-GREEN = 0.73; R-BROWN = 0.47), followed by MODIS-GIMMS, and GIMMS-SPOT. The overall, NDVI trend consistency appears to be higher in TS. Finally, the consistent greening pixels mainly distributed in central TP stretching to the northeastern part, and in western stretching to eastern TS, account for 32.14%, while 8.32% of consistent browning pixels are concentrated in southwestern TP and central TS. The inconsistent pixels account for 59.54%, with 39.21% of inconsistent greening pixels being widely distributed across HMA, and 20.58% of inconsistent browning pixels being relatively pronounced in central TS and southern TP. This study provides baseline inferences for the selection and reconstruction of data in follow-up studies on vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Monitoring and Stability Analysis of the Deformation in the Woda Landslide Area in Tibet, China by the DS-InSAR Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Woda area in the upper Jinsha River has steep terrain and broken structures, causing landslide disasters frequently. Here, we used the distributed scatterer interferometric SAR (DS-InSAR) method to monitor and analyze the Woda landslide area. With the DS-InSAR method, we derived the deformation of the Woda landslide area from 106 Sentinel-1A ascending images acquired between 5 November 2014 and 4 September 2019 and 102 Sentinel-1A descending images acquired between 31 October 2014 and 11 September 2019. The obvious advantage of the DS-InSAR method compared to the persistent scatterer (PS) InSAR (PS-InSAR) method is that the densities of the monitoring points were increased by 25.1% and 22.9% in the ascending and descending images, respectively. The two-dimensional deformation of the landslide area shows that the maximum surface deformation rate in the normal direction was -80 mm/yr, and in the east-west direction, 118 mm/yr. According to the rescaled range (R/S) analysis, the Hurst index values of the deformation trends were all greater than 0.5, which means the deformation trend will continue for some time. In addition, we analyzed the influencing factors and the deformation mechanism of the Woda landslide area and found that the surface deformation is closely related to the geological structure and precipitation, among which precipitation is the main factor triggering the deformation. Our monitoring results will help the local government to conduct regular inspections and strengthen landslide disaster prevention in low-coherence mountainous areas.

TI  - The Potential of Fully Polarized ALOS-2 Data for Estimating Forest Above-Ground Biomass
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR data have a longer wavelength and stronger penetrating power compared with traditional optical remote sensing. Therefore, SAR data are more suitable for the estimation of the above-ground biomass (AGB) of forests. This study was aimed at evaluating the sensitivity of L-band full polarization data to AGB. L-band data were improved to estimate the saturation point produced by AGB, and were found to be suitable for estimating a wide range of AGB. This study extracted backscattering coefficients, polarization decomposition variables, and terrain factors. New parameters were constructed from these variables, and their performance in predicting AGB was evaluated. Significant variables found with AGB were added to the multivariate linear model. A statistical analysis showed the presence of multicollinearity between the variables. Therefore, ridge regression, random forest method (RF), and principal component analysis (PCA) were introduced to solve the problem of collinearity. In all the three methods, the saturation of the ridge regression model was low, reaching it at 150 t/ha. Better accuracy was obtained with the RF model. No obvious saturation incident was detected in the model established using the principal component analysis. This could be attributed to the low biomass levels observed in our study area. This model provided accurate results (adjusted r(2) = 0.90 rmse = 14.24 t/ha), indicating that L-band data have the potential to estimate AGB. Additionally, suitable variables and models were selected in this study, with the principal component analysis being more helpful in combining various SAR parameters. The achievement of these accurate results could be attributed to the synergy among variables.

TI  - Efficient Identification and Monitoring of Landslides by Time-Series InSAR Combining Single- and Multi-Look Phases
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and monitoring of unstable slopes across wide regions using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) can further help to prevent and mitigate geological hazards. However, the low spatial density of measurement points (MPs) extracted using the traditional time-series InSAR method in topographically complex mountains and vegetation-covered slopes makes the final result unreliable. In this study, a method of time-series InSAR analysis using single- and multi-look phases were adopted to solve this problem, which exploited single- and multi-look phases to increase the number of MPs in the natural environment. Archived ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets covering Zhouqu County were processed. The results revealed that nine landslides could be quickly identified from the average phase rate maps using the Stacking method. Then, the time-series InSAR analysis with single- and multi-look phases could be used to effectively monitor the deformation of these landslides and to quantitatively analyze the magnitude and dynamic evolution of the deformation in various parts of the landslides. The reliability of the InSAR results was further verified by field investigations and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) surveys. In addition, the precursory movements and causative factors of the recent Yahuokou landslide were analyzed in detail, and the application of the time-series InSAR method in landslide investigations was discussed and summarized. Therefore, this study has practical significance for early warning of landslides and risk mitigation.

TI  - Monitoring System for the Management of the Common Agricultural Policy Using Machine Learning and Remote Sensing
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Commission promotes new technologies and data generated by the Copernicus Programme. These technologies are intended to improve the management of the Common Agricultural Policy aid, implement new monitoring controls to replace on-the-spot checks, and apply up to 100% of the applications continuously for an agricultural year. This paper presents a generic methodology developed for implementing monitoring controls. To achieve this, the dataset provided by the Sentinel-2 time series is transformed into information through the combination of classifications with machine learning using random forest and remote sensing-based biophysical indices. This work focuses on monitoring the helpline associated with rice cultivation, using 13 Sentinel-2 images whose grouping and characteristics change depending on the event or landmark being sought. Moreover, the functionality to check, before harvesting the crop, that the area declared is equal to the area cultivated is added. The 2020 results are around 96% for most of the metrics analysed, demonstrating the potential of Sentinel-2 for controlling subsidies, particularly for rice. After the quality assessment, the hit rate is 98%. The methodology is transformed into a tool for regular use to improve decision making by determining which declarants comply with the crop-specific aid obligations, contributing to optimising the administrations' resources and a fairer distribution of funds.

TI  - Mapping the Abundance of Multipurpose Agroforestry <i>Faidherbia albida</i> Trees in Senegal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-purpose Faidherbia albida trees represent a vital component of agroforestry parklands in West Africa as they provide resources (fodder for livestock, fruits and firewood) and support water lifting and nutrient recycling for cropping. Faidherbia albida trees are characterized by their inverse phenology, growing leaf flowers and pods during the dry season, thereby providing fodder and shedding leaves during the wet season, which minimizes competition with pastures and crops for resources. Multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite systems and novel computational methods open new doors for classifying single trees and identifying species. This study used a Multi-Layer Perception feedforward artificial neural network to classify pixels covered by Faidherbia albida canopies from Sentinel-2 time series in Senegal, West Africa. To better discriminate the Faidherbia albida signal from the background, monthly images from vegetation indices were used to form relevant variables for the model. We found that NDI54/NDVI from the period covering onset of leaf senescence (February) until end of senescence (leaf-off in June) to be the most important, resulting in a high precision and recall rate of 0.91 and 0.85. We compared our result with a potential Faidherbia albida occurrence map derived by empirical modelling of the species ecology, which deviates notably from the actual species occurrence mapped by this study. We have shown that even small differences in dry season leaf phenology can be used to distinguish tree species. The Faidherbia albida distribution maps, as provided here, will be key in managing farmlands in drylands, helping to optimize economic and ecological services from both tree and crop products.

TI  - Biological Impact of Typhoon Wipha in the Coastal Area of Western Guangdong: A Comparative Field Observation Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of typhoons on the ecology of the ocean has been observed using high-accuracy satellite remote sensing data. However, few field observations in the ocean have been conducted to understand the effect of typhoons on the biogeochemistry because typhoon is furious, dangerous, and unpredictable. Here, we investigated the impact of Typhoon Wipha on the biogeochemistry of the coastal area of western Guangdong, northwest South China Sea. Our results show that the typhoon triggered phytoplankton blooms (the level of Chl a increased 3.25 times after the typhoon) nearshore (water depths <23 m); however, there was little change in the nutrients and Chl a offshore (water depths between 23 and 60 m). Terrestrial runoff and vertical seawater mixing were identified as the main processes that bring nutrients into the nearshore area and thus triggering phytoplankton blooms after the typhoon. Moreover, the positive apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and unsaturated DO contents during the posttyphoon period suggest significant oxygen consumption (i.e., degradation process and biological respiration) caused by Typhoon Wipha in both nearshore and offshore areas. The internal nutrient recirculation and biological respiration are responsible for little change in POC, PN and nutrients in the offshore area between the pre- and posttyphoon periods and thus did not cause phytoplankton blooms. Our results suggest that the potential oxygen consumption (i.e., decomposition and biological respiration) after the typhoon are important biogeochemical impacts induced by Typhoon Wipha in coastal waters.

TI  - Groundwater hydrocarbon contamination spatial pattern in Opuama, Western Niger-Delta, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of the phenomenon of incessant and protracted crude oil spillage into the subaerial environment of Opuama community in the Niger-Delta is an enduring concern. Of a greater concern is the possibility of deleterious hydrocarbon contamination of groundwater and the ensuing human health problems from consuming the same in this locality. An integrated data interpretation approach has been carried out through water sample analysis, terrain analysis, surface analysis and vegetation analysis using borehole water analysis data, Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data, field point data and multispectral satellite imageries (Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI data) in a view to model the spatial pattern of the hydrocarbon contamination of the groundwater in the study area. This was with a view to ascertain the quality and safety of groundwater as a water source for domestic purposes in the oil impacted community and environs. Water samples were collected from the seven (7) available boreholes and analyzed with Gas chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) detected showed exclusively light PAHs (up to four fused benzene rings) which are; Chrysene, Benzo(b)Fluoranthene, 2-MethylNaphthalene, Benzo(k)Fluoranthene and Phenanthrene. The total PAHs varied in concentration from 2958.4 to 27,508.0 mu g/L. These high levels of PAHs can be attributed to the incessant spillage of crude oil on the wetland and continual interaction of the groundwater with the surface water that is perpetually bearing an oil-phase. Vegetation spectral analysis showed that the vegetation health of the study area has been negatively impacted by the oil pollution. The low vegetation index corroborated the extreme values of PAHs recorded in boreholes. Terrain as well somewhat affected the manner of pollution spread. The study concluded that the groundwater in the community was contaminated with light PAHs and the total PAHs concentration in this area by far exceeded the WHO maximum permissible limit of 10 mu g/L and Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) limit of 7 mu g/L in drinking water. Hence the potability of the groundwater is compromised. The spatial variations in the levels of contamination in the study area determined by Kriging interpolation method are graded as mildly polluted (up to 28.6% of samples), very polluted (up to 14.3% of samples), highly polluted (up to 28.6% of samples), very highly polluted and extremely polluted (14.3% of samples above category). Another 14.3% of samples fall below the mildly polluted category.

TI  - Using an Administrative and Clinical Database to Determine the Early Spread of COVID-19 at the US Department of Veterans Affairs during the Beginning of the 2019-2020 Flu Season: A Retrospective Longitudinal Study
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Previous studies examining the early spread of COVID-19 have used influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) to determine the early spread of COVID-19. We used COVID-19 case definition to identify COVID-like symptoms (CLS) independently of other influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). Methods. Using data from Emergency Department (ED) visits at VA Medical Centers in CA, TX, and FL, we compared weekly rates of CLS, ILIs, and non-influenza ILIs encounters during five consecutive flu seasons (2015-2020) and estimated the risk of developing each illness during the first 23 weeks of the 2019-2020 season compared to previous seasons. Results. Patients with CLS were significantly more likely to visit the ED during the first 23 weeks of the 2019-2020 compared to prior seasons, while ED visits for influenza and non-influenza ILIs did not differ substantially. Adjusted CLS risk was significantly lower for all seasons relative to the 2019-2020 season: RR15-16 = 0.72, 0.75, 0.72; RR16-17 = 0.81, 0.77, 0.79; RR17-18 = 0.80, 0.89, 0.83; RR18-19 = 0.82, 0.96, 0.81, in CA, TX, and FL, respectively. Conclusions. The observed increase in ED visits for CLS indicates the likely spread of COVID-19 in the US earlier than previously reported. VA data could potentially help identify emerging infectious diseases and supplement existing syndromic surveillance systems.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring of the Dust Storm over Northern China on 15 March 2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern China was hit by a severe dust storm on 15 March 2021, covering a large area and bring devastating impact to a degree that was unprecedented in more than a decade. In the study, we carried out a day-and-night continuous monitoring to the path of the moving dust, using multi-spectral data from the Chinese FY-4A satellite combined with the Japanese Himawary-8 from visible to near-infrared, mid-infrared and far-infrared bands. We monitored the whole process of the dust weather from the occurrence, development, transportation and extinction. The HYSPLIT(Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) backward tracking results showed the following two main sources of dust affecting Beijing during the north China dust storm: one is from western Mongolia; the other is from arid and semi-arid regions of northwest of China. Along with the dust storm, the upper air mass, mainly from Siberia, brought a significant decrease in temperature. The transport path of the dust shown by the HYSPLIT backward tracking is consistent with that revealed by the satellite monitoring. The dust weather, which originated in western Mongolia, developed into the "3.15 dust storm" in north China, lasting more than 40 h, with a transport distance of 3900 km, and caused severe decline in air quality in northern China, the Korean peninsula and other regions. It is the most severe dust weather in the past 20 years in east Asia.

TI  - A Model for Expressing Industrial Information Based on Object-Oriented Industrial Heat Sources Detected Using Multi-Source Thermal Anomaly Data in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial heat sources have made a great contribution to Chinese economic development. However, it has also been found that emissions from industrial heat sources are the main contribution to regional air pollution. Therefore, the detection of industrial heat sources and the expression of related information is becoming important. In this paper, the detection of industrial heat sources was used to express industrial information, thus that the accuracy of the detection of industrial thermal anomalies could be improved and the problems of noise and missing parameters addressed. A model for expressing industrial information based on object-oriented industrial heat sources and using multi-source thermal anomaly data in China was, therefore, proposed. It was a new real-time, objective, and real way to describe the production operation status of industrial heat sources on a large-scale area. First, 4340 working industrial heat sources in mainland China were detected by applying an adaptive k-means algorithm to ACF (NPP VIIRS 375-m active fire/hotspot data) data from the period 19 January 2012 to 31 December 2020. Secondly, several features of working industrial heat sources were extracted from NPP VIIRS 375-m active fire/hotspot data (ACF), VIIRS Nightfire data (VNF), and the Fires product based on Landsat-8 AIRCAS (L8F) data. Areas containing working industrial heat sources were then identified based on these different types of fire data. Light, land-surface temperature, and CO2 and N2O emissions data related to the working industrial heat sources were also extracted. The results show that feature parameters extracted from the multi-source thermal anomaly data mostly have a good positive correlation with the other parameters.

TI  - Retrieval of Fine-Grained PM2.5 Spatiotemporal Resolution Based on Multiple Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the country's rapid economic growth, the problem of air pollution in China is becoming increasingly serious. In order to achieve a win-win situation for the environment and urban development, the government has issued many policies to strengthen environmental protection. PM2.5 is the primary particulate matter in air pollution, so an accurate estimation of PM2.5 distribution is of great significance. Although previous studies have attempted to retrieve PM2.5 using geostatistical or aerosol remote sensing retrieval methods, the current rough resolution and accuracy remain as limitations of such methods. This paper proposes a fine-grained spatiotemporal PM2.5 retrieval method that comprehensively considers various datasets, such as Landsat 8 satellite images, ground monitoring station data, and socio-economic data, to explore the applicability of different machine learning algorithms in PM2.5 retrieval. Six typical algorithms were used to train the multi-dimensional elements in a series of experiments. The characteristics of retrieval accuracy in different scenarios were clarified mainly according to the validation index, R-2. The random forest algorithm was shown to have the best numerical and PM2.5-based air-quality-category accuracy, with a cross-validated R-2 of 0.86 and a category retrieval accuracy of 0.83, while both maintained excellent retrieval accuracy and achieved a high spatiotemporal resolution. Based on this retrieval model, we evaluated the PM2.5 distribution characteristics and hourly variation in the sample area, as well as the functions of different input variables in the model. The PM2.5 retrieval method proposed in this paper provides a new model for fine-grained PM2.5 concentration estimation to determine the distribution laws of air pollutants and thereby specify more effective measures to realize the high-quality development of the city.

TI  - Identifying Dike-Pond System Using an Improved Cascade R-CNN Model and High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dike-pond system (DPS) is the integration of a natural or man-made pond and crop cultivation on dikes, widely distributed in the Pearl River Delta and Jianghan plain in China. It plays a key role in preserving biodiversity, enhancing the nutrient cycle, and increasing crop production. However, DPS is rarely mapped at a large scale with satellite data, due to the limitations in the training dataset and traditional classification methods. This study improved the deep learning algorithm Cascade Region Convolutional Neural Network (Cascade R-CNN) algorithm to detect the DPS in Qianjiang City using high-resolution satellite data. In the proposed mCascade R-CNN, the regular convolution layer in the backbone was modified into the deformable convolutional layer, which was more suitable for learning the features of DPS with variable shapes and orientations. The mCascade R-CNN yielded the most accurate detection of DPS, with an average precision (AP) value that was 2.71% higher than Cascade R-CNN and 11.84% higher than You Look Only Once-v4 (YOLOv4). The area of oilseed rape growing on the dikes accounted for 3.42% of the total oilseed rape planting area. This study demonstrates the potential of the deep leaning methods combined with high-resolution satellite images in detecting integrated agriculture systems.

TI  - Ionospheric Correction of L-Band SAR Interferometry for Accurate Ice-Motion Measurements: A Case Study in the Grove Mountains Area, East Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice motion is an essential element for accurately evaluating glacier mass balance. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been widely applied for monitoring ice motion with high precision and wide coverage in the Antarctic. However, the ionospheric effects can significantly impact InSAR-based ice-motion measurements. At low radar frequencies in particular, the ionospheric effects have been regarded as a serious source of noise in L-band SAR data. The split-spectrum method (SSM) is commonly used for correcting the ionospheric effects of the InSAR technique. However, it requires spatial filtering with the relatively large factors used to scale the sub-bands' interferograms, which often results in an unwrapped phase error. In this paper, a reformulation of the split-spectrum method (RSSM) is introduced to correct the ionospheric effects in the Grove Mountains of East Antarctica, which have slow ice flow and frequent ionosphere changes. The results show that RSSM can effectively correct the ionospheric effects of InSAR-based ice-motion measurements. To evaluate the ability of ionospheric correction using RSSM, the result of ionospheric correction derived from SSM is compared with the results of RSSM. In addition, ionosphere-corrected ice motion is also compared with GPS and MEaSUREs. The results show that the ionosphere-corrected ice velocities are in good agreement with GPS observations and MEaSUREs. The average ice velocity from the InSAR time series is compared to that from MEaSUREs, and the average ionosphere-corrected ice velocity error reduces 43.9% in SSM and 51.1% in RSSM, respectively. The ionosphere-corrected ice velocity error is the most significant, reducing 86.9% in SSM and 90.4% in RSSM from 1 November 2007 to 19 December 2007. The results show that the ability of RSSM to correct ionospheric effects is slightly better than that of SSM. Therefore, we deduce that the RSSM offers a feasible way to correct ionospheric effects in InSAR-based ice-motion measurements in Antarctica.

TI  - Investigating Spatial Distribution of Green-Tide in the Yellow Sea in 2021 Using Combined Optical and SAR Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing is limited to clouds and rain. It is difficult to obtain ground object images in severe weather. Microwave remote sensing can penetrate clouds and rain to obtain ground object images. Therefore, this paper combines optical and microwave data to analyze the time and space of the green-tide in the Yellow Sea in 2021. Compared with a single data source, the distribution characteristics increase the frequency of time observation and show the green-tide changes in more detail. The continuous remote sensing observation time is 80 days. Ulva prolifera has experienced discovery (mid-late May), development (mid-late May to early June), outbreak (early June to mid-late June), decline (late June to mid-July), and extinction (late July to mid-August) in five stages; the development period drifts along the northeast direction, the outbreak period drifts along the northwest direction, the decline and extinction periods are mainly in the Rizhao and Qingdao waters. Ulva prolifera has a tendency to drift northward as a whole, drifting through Yancheng, Lianyungang, Linyi, Rizhao and Qingdao waters eventually landing on the coast of Qingdao and gradually disappearing.

TI  - A review of statistical methods used for developing large-scale and long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> models from satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Research of PM2.5 chronic health effects requires knowledge of large-scale and long-term exposure that is not supported by newly established monitoring networks due to their sparse spatial coverage and lack of historical measurements. Estimating PM2.5 using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be used to fill the data gap left by the ground monitors and extend the PM2.5 data coverage to suburban and rural areas over long time periods. Two approaches have been applied in large-scale and long-term satellite remote sensing of PM2.5, i.e., the scaling and statistical approaches. Compared to the scaling method, the statistical approach has greater prediction accuracy and has been widely used. There is a gap in the current literature and review papers on how the statistical methods work and specific considerations to best utilize them, especially for large-scale and longterm estimates. In this critical review, we summarize the evolution of large-scale and long-term PM2.5 statistical models reported in the literature. We describe the framework and guidance of large-scale and long-term satellite based PM2.5 modeling in data preparation, model development, validation, and predictions. Sample computer codes are provided to expedite new model-building efforts. We also include useful considerations and recommendations in covariates selection, addressing the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of PM2.5-AOD relationships, and the usage of cross validation, to aid the determination of the final model.

TI  - Modelling Aboveground Biomass of Miombo Woodlands in Niassa Special Reserve, Northern Mozambique
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation plays a crucial role in forest management and carbon emission reporting, especially for developing countries wishing to address REDD+ projects. Both passive and active remote-sensing technologies can provide spatially explicit information of AGB by using a limited number of field samples, thus reducing the substantial budgetary cost of field inventories. The aim of the current study was to estimate AGB in the Niassa Special Reserve (NSR) using fusion of optical (Landsat 8/OLI and Sentinel 2A/MSI) and radar (Sentinel 1B and ALOS/PALSAR-2) data. The performance of multiple linear regression models to relate ground biomass with different combinations of sensor data was assessed using root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC). The mean AGB and carbon stock (CS) estimated from field data were estimated at 56 Mg ha(-1) (ranging from 11 to 95 Mg ha(-1)) and 28 MgC ha(-1), respectively. The best model estimated AGB at 63 +/- 20.3 Mg ha(-1) for NSR, ranging from 0.6 to 200 Mg ha(-1) (r(2) = 87.5%, AIC = 123, and BIC = 51.93). We obtained an RMSE % of 20.46 of the mean field estimate of 56 Mg ha(-1). The estimation of AGB in this study was within the range that was reported in the existing literature for the miombo woodlands. The fusion of vegetation indices derived from Landsat/OLI and Sentinel 2A/MSI, and backscatter from ALOS/PALSAR-2 is a good predictor of AGB.

TI  - Monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on climate change and the environment on Egypt using Sentinel-5P Images, and the Carbon footprint methodology
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which appeared in December 2019 and was declared by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, on climate change and the environment through such measures as imposing a partial curfew and maintaining social distance measures, as well as the suspension of aviation and lowering the electricity consumption for the in-site work sectors in Egypt. These measures hindered the rates of people's movements. These events have resulted in a decrease of Greenhouse Gas emissions and air pollutants, which have improved the environmental conditions and promoted the reduction of the causes of climate change in Egypt. The study depends on analyzing Remote sensing products "Sentinel-5P images" to monitor the change in the air pollutants of the Greater Cairo Region (GCR) before, during, and after the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic. It also depends on using the methodology of the Carbon footprint, according to the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), for determining the size of the GHGs emissions avoided, as a result of the curfew in Egypt during the period from January to August 2020 compared to the same in 2019.The study deduces that the partial curfew and social distance measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced GHGs emissions in Egypt by about 15% and about 17% for NO2 emissions in GCR, 15.6%for SO2, and about 7.7% for the CO emissions, compared to the same in 2019.

TI  - Using the MCRISP Network for Surveillance of Pediatric Exanthema in Child Care Centers
T2  - DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Systematic monitoring of exanthema is largely absent from public health surveillance despite emerging diseases and threats of bioterrorism. Michigan Child Care Related Infections Surveillance Program (MCRISP) is the first online program in child care centers to report pediatric exanthema. Methods: MCRISP aggregated daily counts of children sick, absent, or reported ill by parents. We extracted all MCRISP exanthema cases from October 1, 2014 through June 30, 2019. Cases were assessed with descriptive statistics and counts were used to construct epidemic curves. Results: 360 exanthema cases were reported from 12,233 illnesses over 4.5 seasons. Children ages 13-35 months had the highest rash occurrence (45%, n = 162), followed by 36-59 months (41.7%, n = 150), 0-12 months (12.5%, n = 45), and kindergarten (0.8%, n = 3). Centers reported rashes of hand-foot-mouth disease (50%, n = 180), nonspecific rash without fever (15.3%, n = 55), hives (8.1%, n = 29), fever with nonspecific rash (6.9%, n = 25), roseola (3.3%, n = 12), scabies (2.5%, n = 9), scarlet fever (2.5%, n = 9), impetigo (2.2%, n = 8), abscess (1.95, n = 7), viral exanthema without fever (1.7%, n = 6), varicella (1.7%, n = 6), pinworms (0.8%, n = 3), molluscum (0.6%, n = 2), cellulitis (0.6%, n = 2), ringworm (0.6%, n = 2), and shingles (0.2%, n = 1). Conclusion: Child care surveillance networks have the potential to act as sentinel public health tools for surveillance of pediatric exanthema outbreaks.

TI  - Data Fusion of GEO <i>FY</i>-<i>4A</i> GIIRS and LEO Hyperspectral Infrared Sounders with Surface Observations: A Hong Kong Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral infrared satellite observations from geostationary platforms allow for the retrieval of temperature and water vapor measurements with higher temporal and vertical resolution than was previously available. The Chinese satellite Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) includes the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), which has the ability to measure vertical profiles of temperature and water vapor from space at times when ground-based upper-air soundings are not available and can fill an important need in short-range weather prediction. In this study, convective available potential energy (CAPE) and lifted index (LI), which are used for forecasting atmospheric instability, were computed using the SHARPpy algorithm used by the NWS Storm Prediction Center. However, remote infrared and microwave sensing is lacking detailed information in the boundary layer, so the addition of the NOAA Meteorological Assimilation and Data Ingest System (MADIS) surface data may be necessary in order to get accurate temperature and moisture measurement near the surface. This study uses 10-16 May 2019 in the coastal region near Hong Kong for evaluating the use of hourly surface observations combined with satellite soundings from FY-4A GIIRS at 2-h intervals. The GIIRS plus MADIS surface-based CAPE and LI estimates are compared to estimates derived from low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) SNPP and NOAA-20 from NOAA, MetOp from EUMETSAT, NWP reanalysis, and local radiosondes. In the case study, the 2-h sampling interval of the GIIRS geostationary sounder was able to capture the rapid transition (16 h) from a stable to an unstable atmosphere in both CAPE and LI. The use of surface observations with satellite soundings gave mixed results, possibly due to the complex terrain near Hong Kong.

TI  - Marine Online Platforms of Services to Public End-Users-The Innovation of the ODYSSEA Project
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, various Earth Observation Networks (EONs) have been designed, developed and launched by in-situ, on-site and off-site collected data from fixed and moving marine sensors and remote sensing (RS) satellite data. This information can significantly help a wide range of public and private end-users better understand the medium- and high-resolution numerical models for regional, national and global coverage. In this context, such EON core services' operational numerical data can be seen of the growing demand result for marine sustainability development of developing countries and the European Union (EU). In this case, marine platforms can offer a wide range of benefits to users of human communities in the same environment using meticulous analyses. Furthermore, marine platforms can contribute to a deeper discourse on the ocean, given the required regulations, technical and legal considerations and users to a common typology using clear scientific terminology. In this regard, firstly, the following six steps have been used to develop a better understanding of the essential data structure that is commensurate with the efficiency of the marine end-user's service: (1) steps and challenges of collecting data, (2) stakeholder engagement to identify, detect and assess the specific needs of end-users, (3) design, develop and launch the products offered to meet the specific needs of users, (4) achieve sustainable development in the continuous provision of these products to end-users, (5) identify future needs and challenges, and (6) online platform architecture style related to providing these products to end-users. Secondly, the innovation of the ODYSSEA (Operating a Network of Integrated Observatory Systems in the Mediterranean Sea) platform project has been evaluated and reviewed as a successful project on marine online platforms to better understand how marine online platforms are being used, designed, developed and launched. The ODYSSEA platform provides a system that bridges the gap between operational oceanographic capabilities and the need for information on marine conditions, including for the end-user community. The project aims to develop a fully integrated and cost-effective cross-platform, multi-platform network of observation and forecasting systems across the Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - Detection of seasonal land use pattern and irrigated crops in drylands using multi-temporal sentinel images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is to detect seasonal agricultural land use and cropping pattern of irrigated crops during the 2017/2018 growing season in the Mujib basin in Jordan. The Mujib basin is considered as one of the major sources for water production in Jordan, while the agricultural production is the main consumer sector for water in the basin. High multi-temporal multi-spectral resolutions Sentinel-2b satellite images were used to identify the land use types using the supervised classification that applied on spring and summer growing season. The results show that the temporal NDVI curve is very useful in distinguishing between different crops type with high details, and is used in assisting the agricultural land use pattern. Multi-temporal NDVI images were used to identify the cropping pattern within the agricultural land using the unsupervised classification approach. The results show that the rainfed agriculture is confined in the high rainfall zones with one period of growing season, while the irrigated agricultural crops are spreading in the basin over the whole year with different periods of growing seasons. Irrigated vegetables and tree crops are the dominant agricultural crops in the basin with more than 70% of cultivated land. Most of the irrigated vegetables and trees are grown in the summer seasons under high temperatures conditions which consumes the highest percentage of irrigated water. These results show that the patterns of agricultural land use under Dryland regions are very essential issue in determining water consumption and management alternatives.

TI  - Mapping of Hydrothermal Alteration Zones in the Kelaat M'Gouna Region Using Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry and Remote Sensing Data: Mining Implications (Eastern Anti-Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of hydrothermal alteration zones associated with mineralization is of paramount importance in searching for metal deposits. For this purpose, targeting alteration zones by analyzing airborne geophysical and satellite imagery provides accurate and reliable results. In the Kelaat M'Gouna inlier, located in the Saghro Massif of the Moroccan Anti Atlas, natural gamma-ray spectrometry and ASTER satellite data were used to map hydrothermal alteration zones. Natural gamma-ray spectrometry data were processed to produce maps of Potassium (K in %), Uranium (eU in ppm), Thorium (eTh in ppm) and ratios of K/eTh and K/eU. In addition, four-band ratios were computed, on ASTER data, to map the distribution of clay minerals, phyllitic minerals, propylitic minerals, and iron oxides. The combined results obtained from geophysical and satellite data were further exploited by fuzzy logic modelling using the Geographic Information System (GIS) to generate a mineral prospectivity map. Seven hydrothermal alteration zones likely to be favorable for mineralization have been identified. They show a spatial correlation with (i) known surface prospects and mineral occurrences, (ii) the granite-encasing contact zone, and (iii) the fault zones (Sidi Flah and Tagmout faults). This research therefore provides important information on the prospecting of mineral potential in the study area.

TI  - Evaluation of the Urban Microclimate in Catania Using Multispectral Remote Sensing and GIS Technology
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the determination and examination of both the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the atmospheric temperature in the city of Catania Sicily (Italy), through freely available satellite remote sensing images from the Sentinel-2 and MODIS missions. Satellite images were processed as raster data in free and open-source GIS environments. The GIS software allows the retrieval, processing of the satellite images for the estimation of the LST and the atmospheric temperature with a very coarse spatial resolution. In particular, the proposed procedure allows increasing the spatial resolution of satellite images, from 250 m (LRES) to 10 m (HRES) through the principle of "Disaggregation of thermal images". The analysis provided georeferenced maps which show the LST, as well as the atmospheric temperature within the investigated area with a very fine resolution, 10 m. Such spatial resolution reveals evident correlations between areas with different urban densities and their microclimate. An important result of this study is that significant LST differences can be observed during both day (15-17 degrees C) and night (2-3 degrees C) between green and built-up areas. The outcomes of this study highlight the effectiveness of the combined use of satellite remote sensing and GIS for analyzing the thermal response of urbanized areas with different built density.

TI  - Assessment of Palm Jumeirah Island's Construction Effects on the Surrounding Water Quality and Surface Temperatures during 2001-2020
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change stressors like rising and warmer seas, increased storms and droughts, and acidifying oceans are rapidly threatening coastal zones, which are the world's most densely inhabited places. This research assesses the effects of Palm Jumeirah Island (PJI) construction on its surrounding water quality and temperature, using Landsat-7 and 8 spectral and thermal bands for the years 2001, 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2020. To aid in this goal, the changes in water spectral reflectance was observed and interpreted, based on previous research and measurements, to discover the correlation between water quality and its spectral reflectance. Then, the sea surface temperature (SST) was calculated for the years under review and changes in water temperature were evaluated. Finally, the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) were calculated to estimate water chlorophyll levels and water turbidity, respectively, and changes were observed and interpreted for the time period under review. The present study showed that the PJI construction not only increased the water reflectance in the 0.5-0.8 mu m of wavelength, which can be considered to be the increase of suspended sediments and chlorophyll but the water temperature also increased by 7.5 degrees C during the 19 years. In addition, a gradual increase in the values of GNDVI (by 0.097-0.129) and NDTI (by 0.118~0.172) were observed. A drop in chlorophyll and suspended sediment spectral reflectance and GNDVI and NDTI values were also observed in 2020 compared to 2019 which can be attributed to the 63 to 82% decrease in tourists in Dubai in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to draw attention to environmental issues by clarifying the effect of creating artificial islands in the sea and our analysis and results are a suitable reference for specialized hydrological and environmental studies based on spectral information and distance measurements, as presented in this paper.

TI  - Short-Term Recovery of the Aboveground Carbon Stock in Iberian Shrublands at the Extremes of an Environmental Gradient and as a Function of Burn Severity
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree to which burn severity influences the recovery of aboveground carbon density (ACD) of live pools in shrublands remains unclear. Multitemporal LiDAR data was used to evaluate ACD recovery three years after fire in shrubland ecosystems as a function of burn severity immediately after fire across an environmental and productivity gradient in the western Mediterranean Basin. Two large mixed-severity wildfires were assessed: an Atlantic site, dominated by resprouter shrubs and located at the most productive extreme of the gradient, and a Mediterranean site, dominated by obligate seeders and located at the less productive extreme. Initial assessment of burn severity was performed using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio index computed from Landsat imagery. Thresholds for low and high burn severity categories were established using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). LiDAR canopy metrics were calibrated with field measurements of mean shrub height and cover at plot level in a post-fire situation. Pre-fire and post-fire ACD estimates, and their ratio (ACDr) to calculate carbon stock recovery, were computed from the predictions of LiDAR grid metrics at landscape level using shrubland allometric relationships. Overall, ACDr decreased both with high burn severity and low productivity, although the burn severity impact was not homogeneous within the gradient. In the Atlantic site, ACDr was similar under low and high burn severity, whereas it decreased with burn severity in the Mediterranean site. These results suggest that carbon cycling models could be biased by not accounting for both fire severity and species composition of shrublands under different environmental conditions.

TI  - The Mechanism of High Butanol Acetone Ratio in ABE Fermentation with Fern Root as Substrate
T2  - BIORESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The butanol acetone ratio (B/A ratio) is a critical index to evaluate the process of ABE fermentation. In this article, fern root starch with yeast extract added (FY) was used as substrate for ABE fermentation. The final B/A ratio in a 5 L anaerobic fermentor reached the highest levels of 3.42, which signified an increment of 41% compared with corn. The mechanisms for the high B/A ratio of FY substrate were as follows: 1) the weakened organic acid circuit resulted in decreased acetone synthesis; 2) the NADH level of butanol synthesis was high; 3) coA transferase activity was low and butanol dehydrogenase activity was high. The final butanol concentration and substrate utilization were examined in a 5 L anaerobic fermentor, and the results validated the feasibility of ABE fermentation with FY as substrate.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations in fractional vegetation cover and its driving factors in the Hulun Lake region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities are critical to fractional vegetation cover (FVC). However, until now, their combined effects on FVC have not been well quantified. In this paper we analyze the temporal and spatial variations in the fractional vegetation cover in the Hulun Lake region from 1986 to 2017 and its response to changes in climate parameters and human activities; additionally, the impact of changes in climate parameters and human activities on FVC are discussed. The results showed that according to the Mann-Kendall (M-K) trend test analysis, 65.01% of the FVC in the Hulun Lake region decreased to varying degrees, of which 24.55% showed a significant decrease and only 8.61% increased significantly. Based on the M-K mutation test analysis of FVC and analysis of driving factors from 1986 to 2017, 1999 was the time point at which abrupt changes in FVC, annual precipitation and moisture index occurred in the Hulun Lake region, and water was an important factor affecting FVC. The regression analysis of FVC and the driving factors from 1986 to 2017 showed that the moisture index and the number of livestock could not be eliminated from the regression equation. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between the FVC and the climate livestock index (P < 0.001). Linear regression model constructed by FVC and climatic livestock index: y = 23.016ln(x)-31.454 (R-2 = 0.5941), FVC increased with the increase of climatic livestock index.

TI  - IoT Nodes Authentication and ID Spoofing Detection Based on Joint Use of Physical Layer Security and Machine Learning
T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide variety of services and applications that shall be supported by future wireless systems will lead to a high amount of sensitive data exchanged via radio, thus introducing a significant challenge for security. Moreover, in new networking paradigms, such as the Internet of Things, traditional methods of security may be difficult to implement due to the radical change of requirements and constraints. In such contexts, physical layer security is a promising additional means to realize communication security with low complexity. In particular, this paper focuses on node authentication and spoofing detection in an actual wireless sensor network (WSN), where multiple nodes communicate with a sink node. Nodes are in fixed positions, but the communication channels varies due to the scatterers' movement. In the proposed security framework, the sink node is able to perform a continuous authentication of nodes during communication based on wireless fingerprinting. In particular, a machine learning approach is used for authorized nodes classification by means of the identification of specific attributes of their wireless channel. Then classification results are compared with the node ID in order to detect if the message has been generated by a node other than its claimed source. Finally, in order to increase the spoofing detection performance in small networks, the use of low-complexity sentinel nodes is proposed here. Results show the good performance of the proposed method that is suitable for actual implementation in a WSN.

TI  - Temperature Variation and Climate Resilience Action within a Changing Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature change can have profound impacts on livelihood activities and human well-being. Specific factors such as land transitions and climate knowledge can influence temperature variation and actions for adaptation. In addition to meteorological data, this study integrates land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery and local temperature perceptions obtained through interviews to advance a deeper understanding of spatial temperature and its impacts, which is not often seen within climate studies. This study examines local temperature across three different land types (rural mountains, rural agricultural lowlands, urban areas) in the Greater Angkor Region of Cambodia to highlight important insights about temperature and climate resilience action. The results revealed that changes in temperature were most pronounced in Phnom Kulen National Park (rural mountain) and in the rural agricultural lowlands, where residents discussed direct impacts and disruptions to their lives. Temperature, in both the LST results and through local perceptions, demonstrated a strong correlation to ground features, where areas with low vegetation exhibited high temperatures and areas with high vegetation observed low temperatures. While climate action in the form of tree planting and forest conservation are major climate mitigation strategies being undertaken in this region, social awareness and the ability to adapt to changes in temperature was revealed to be uneven across the landscape, suggesting that local entities should mobilize around gaining more education and training for all residents.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - On December 20, 2020, a new eruption started at Kilauea volcano (Hawai'i, USA). During the eruption, the lava cascaded into the summit water lake, generating a vigorous steam plume and forming a new lava lake at the base of the crater. In this study, we investigate the lava lake through the Normalized Hot Spot Indices (NHI) algorithm. The latter runs operationally within a Google Earth Engine (GEE) App (NHI tool), using Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data, to map volcanic thermal anomalies at global scale. Results show that the used algorithm provided information about the lava lake and relative space-time variations in agreement with field observations. By correcting daytime data for the influence of the solar irradiation, we estimated values of the radiant flux in the range 1-5 GW from hottest pixels. This study opens some challenging scenarios about the quantitative characterization of volcanic thermal features through the NHI tool.

TI  - Modelling of Greek Lakes Water Quality Using Earth Observation in the Framework of the Water Framework Directive (WFD)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the great importance of lakes in Earth's environment and human life, continuous water quality (WQ) monitoring within the frame of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the most crucial aspect for lake management. In this study, Earth Observation (EO) data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors have been combined with co-orbital in situ measurements from 50 lakes located in Greece with the main objective of delivering robust WQ assessment models. Correlation analysis among in situ co-orbital WQ data (Chlorophylla, Secchi depths, Total phosphorus-TP-) contributed to distinguishing their inter-relationships and improving the WQ models' accuracy. Subsequently, stepwise multiple regression analysis (MLR) of the available TP and Secchi depth datasets was implemented to explore the potential to establish optimal quantitative models regardless of lake characteristics. Then, further MLR analysis concerning whether the lakes are natural or artificial was conducted with the basic aim of generating different remote sensing derived models for different types of lakes, while their combination was further utilized to assess their trophic status. Correlation matrix results showed a high and positive relationship between TP and Chlorophyll-a (0.85), whereas high negative relationships were found between Secchi depth with TP (-0.84) and Chlorophyll-a (-0.83). MLRs among Landsat data and Secchi depths resulted in 3 optimal models concerning the assessment of Secchi depth of all lakes (Secchi(general;) R = 0.78; RMSE = 0.24 m), natural (Secchi(natural;) R = 0.95; RMSE = 0.14 m) and artificial (Secchi(artificial;) R = 0.62; RMSE = 0.1 m), with reliable accuracy. Study findings showed that TP-related MLR analyses failed to deliver a statistically acceptable model for the reservoirs; nevertheless, they delivered a robust TPgeneral (R = 0.71; RMSE = 1.41 mg/L) and TPnatural model (R = 0.93; RMSE = 1.43 mg/L). Subsequently, trophic status classification was conducted herein, calculating Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI) initially throughout all lakes and then oriented toward natural-only and artificial-only lakes. Those three types of TSI (general, natural, artificial) were calculated based on previously published satellite-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) assessment models and the hereby specially designed WQ models (Secchi depth, TP). The higher deviation of satellite-derived TSI values in relation to in situ ones was detected in reservoirs and shallower lakes (mean depth < 5 m), indicating noticeable divergences among natural and artificial lakes. All in all, the study findings provide important support toward the perpetual WQ monitoring and trophic status prediction of Greek lakes and, by extension, their sustainable management, particularly in cases when ground truth data is limited.

TI  - Investigation of Turbulent Tidal Flow in a Coral Reef Channel Using Multi-Look WorldView-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The general topic here is the application of high-resolution satellite imagery to the study of ocean phenomena having horizontal length scales of several meters to a few kilometers. The present study investigates whether multiple images acquired quite closely in time can be used to derive a spatial map of the surface current in situations where the near-surface hydrodynamics are dominated by bed-generated turbulence and associated wave-current interaction. The approach is illustrated using imagery of turbulent tidal flow in a channel through the outer part of the Great Barrier Reef. The main result is that currents derived from the imagery are found to reach speeds of nearly 4 m/s during a flooding tide-three times larger than published values for other parts of the Reef. These new findings may have some impact on our understanding of the transport of tracers and particles over the shelf.

TI  - Concordance between the Clinical Diagnosis of Influenza in Primary Care and Epidemiological Surveillance Systems (PREVIGrip Study)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Health authorities use different systems of influenza surveillance. Sentinel networks, which are recommended by the World Health Organization, provide information on weekly influenza incidence in a monitored population, based on laboratory-confirmed cases. In Catalonia there is a public website, DiagnostiCat, that publishes the number of weekly clinical diagnoses at the end of each week of disease registration, while the sentinel network publishes its reports later. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is concordance between the number of cases of clinical diagnoses and the number of confirmed cases of influenza, in order to evaluate the predictive potential of a clinical diagnosis-based system. Methods: Population-based ecological time series study in Catalonia. The period runs from the 2010-2011 to the 2018-2019 season. The concordance between the clinical diagnostic cases and the confirmed cases was evaluated. The degree of agreement and the concordance were analysed using Bland-Altman graphs and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: There was greater concordance between the clinical diagnoses and the sum of the cases confirmed outside and within the sentinel network than between the diagnoses and the confirmed sentinel cases. The degree of agreement was higher when influenza rates were low. Conclusions: There is concordance between the clinical diagnosis and the confirmed cases of influenza. Registered clinical diagnostic cases could provide a good alternative to traditional surveillance, based on case confirmation. Cases of clinical diagnosis of influenza may have the potential to predict the onset of annual influenza epidemics.

TI  - A Numerical Study on Bank Erosion of a Braided Channel: Case Study of the "Tangail and Manikganj Districts Along the Brahmaputra River"
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Brahmaputra River comprises the characteristics of a braided channel and suspended sediment-dominant river. Frequent changes in the river course have led to severe bank erosion. In particular, Tangail and Manikganj districts have recently become bank erosion-prone areas. To predict vulnerable locations based on bank erosion, we aimed to understand the behavior of the braided channel by conducting a numerical simulation and satellite data analysis in this study. We employed a depth-integrated 2-D numerical model for water and sediment transport, which was originally proposed by Takebayashi et al. and modified by Harada et al. by introducing a new treatment of suspended sediment. In addition, bathymetry data were created using a series of satellite data information to successfully conduct the simulation. In this study, we focused on two aspects. The first point is the skewing of flow discharge along multiple channels, which belongs to the area of interest, as a large-scale phenomenon. The second point is changing the local geometry of the sand bar and changing the flow pattern, as a small-scale phenomenon. To consider the two different scales, we employed the computation domain as an entire channel. Our results indicate that the numerical model is successfully verified using satellite data information, and the two-scale phenomena are successfully described. Regarding the large-scale phenomenon, our results indicate that the distribution of higher flow rates activates various geomorphological changes, including riverbed evolution, channel changes, and bank erosion. On the other hand, small-scale phenomena, such as the rapid appearance of sand bars and changes in the water course, are directly related to bank erosion.

TI  - Do Satellite Data Correlate with In Situ Rainfall and Smallholder Crop Yields? Implications for Crop Insurance
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adverse weather is one of the most prevalent sources of risk in agriculture. Its impacts are aggravated by the lack of effective risk management mechanisms. That is why resource-poor farmers tend to respond to weather risks by adopting low-capital investment, low-return, and low-risk agricultural practices. This challenge needs to be addressed with innovative risk management strategies. One of the tools that is gaining traction, especially in the developing countries, is weather-index-based insurance (WII). However, WII uptake is still low because of several constraints, one of which is basis risk. This study attempts to address this problem by evaluating the suitability of TAMSAT, CHIRPS, MODIS, and Sentinel-2 data for WII. We evaluated the first three datasets against in situ rainfall measurements at different spatial and temporal scales over the maize-growing season in a smallholder farming area in South Africa. CHIRPS had higher correlations with in situ measured rainfall data than TAMSAT and MODIS NDVI. CHIRPS performed equally well at 10 km and 25 km spatial scales, and better at monthly than daily and 16-day time steps (maximum R = 0.78, mean R = 0.72). Due to the lack of reliable historical yield data, we conducted yield surveys over three consecutive seasons using an objective crop cut method. We then assessed how well rainfall and NDVI related with maize yield. There was a poor relationship between these variables and maize yield (R-2 <= 0.14). The study concludes by pointing out that crop yield does not always have a linear relationship with weather and vegetation indices, and that water is not always the main yield-limiting factor in smallholder farming systems. To minimize basis risk, the process of designing WII must include identification of main yield-limiting factors for specific localities. Alternatively, insurers could use crop water requirement methods to design WII.

TI  - An Overview of Groundwater Monitoring through Point-to Satellite-Based Techniques
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Groundwater supplies approximately half of the total global domestic water demand. It also complements the seasonal and annual variabilities of surface water. Monitoring of groundwater fluctuations is mandatory to envisage the composition of terrestrial water storage. This research provides an overview of traditional techniques and detailed discussion on the modern tools and methods to monitor groundwater fluctuations along with advanced applications. The groundwater monitoring can broadly be classified into three groups. The first one is characterized by the point measurement to measure the groundwater levels using classical instruments and electronic and physical investigation techniques. The second category involves the extensive use of satellite data to ensure robust and cost-effective real-time monitoring to assess the groundwater storage variations. Many satellite data are in use to find groundwater indirectly. However, GRACE satellite data supported with other satellite products, computational tools, GIS techniques, and hydro-climate models have proven the most effective for groundwater resources management. The third category is groundwater numerical modeling, which is a very useful tool to evaluate and project groundwater resources in future. Groundwater numerical modeling also depends upon the point-based groundwater monitoring, so more research to improve point-based detection methods using latest technologies is required, as these still play the baseline role. GRACE and numerical groundwater modeling are suggested to be used conjunctively to assess the groundwater resources more efficiently.

TI  - On the Retrieval of the Water Quality Parameters from Sentinel-3/2 and Landsat-8 OLI in the Nile Delta's Coastal and Inland Waters
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced water quality due to the eutrophication process causes large economic losses worldwide. Multi-source remotely-sensed water quality monitoring can help provide effective water resource management. The research evaluates the retrieval of the water quality parameters: chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), over optically different water types. Cross-sensor performance analysis of three satellite data sources: Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Color Imager (OLCI), Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), acquired during a 45 min overpass on the Nile Delta coast on 22 March 2020 was performed. Atmospheric correction using the case 2 Regional Coast Color (C2RCC) was applied using local water temperature and salinity averages. Owing to the lack of ground-truth measurements in the coastal water, results were inter-compared with standard simultaneous color products of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS), OLCI water full resolution (WFR), and the MODIS Aqua, in order to highlight the sensor data relative performance in the Nile Delta's coastal and inland waters. Validation of estimates was carried out for the only cloud-free MSI data available in the 18-20 September 2020 period for the Burullus Lake nearly contemporaneous with in situ measurements in the 22-25 September 2020. Inter-comparison of the retrieved parameters showed good congruence and correlation among all data in the coastal water, while this comparison returned low positive or negative correlation in the inland lake waters. In the coastal water, all investigated sensors and reference data showed Chl-a content average of 3.14 mg m(-3) with a range level of 0.39-4.81 mg m(-3). TSM averaged 7.66 g m(-3) in the range of 6.32-10.18 g m(-3). CDOM clarified mean of 0.18 m(-1) in the range level of 0.13-0.30 m(-1). Analysis of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) clarified that the MSI sensor was ranked first achieving the smallest MAE and RMSE for the Chl-a contents, while the EFR proved superior for TSM and CDOM estimates. Validation of results in Burullus Lake indicated a clear underestimation on average of 35.35% for the Chl-a induced by the land adjacency effect, shallow bottom depths, and the optical dominance of the TSM and the CDOM absorption intermixed in turbid water loaded with abundant green algae species and counts. The underestimation error increased at larger estimates of the algal composition/abundance (total counts, Chlorophyacea, Euglenophycaea, and Bacillariophycaea) and the biological contents (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins), arranged in decreasing order. The largest normalized RMSE estimates marked the downstream areas where the inflow of polluted water persistently brings nutrient loads of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds as well as substantial amounts of detrital particles and sediments discharged from the agricultural and industrial drains and the land use changes related to agricultural practices, resulting in the increase of water turbidity giving rise to inaccurate Chl-a estimates.

TI  - Objective delineation of persistent SST fronts based on global satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method is introduced to objectively and automatically identify persistent thermal fronts across the ocean from 60 degrees N to 60 degrees S: FROnt Delineation in the Ocean (FRODO), an algorithm developed to delineate sea surface temperature (SST) fronts, was applied to global satellite observations. By relying on long-term averaged frontal probability fields of SST, persistent SST fronts were located globally in an automated manner. The algorithm was applied to AVHRR Pathfinder and MODIS observations, spanning the period from 1982 through 2011, and resulted in new insights regarding frontal zones: new fronts were detected, the location of some fronts identified in the existing literature has been updated, the accuracy of the algorithm was tested through comparison with visible color and SST data, and the variability in frontal location over climatological seasons was explored. While significant spatial variability prevents the algorithm from accurately tracking some fronts, the results were found to agree very well with observations in the case of fronts associated with ocean bathymetry. The output of the algorithm consists of five digital global sets of persistent fronts: one based on the 30 year time series and four based on the climatological seasons derived from the same time series, which will facilitate the study of the links between SST fronts and other oceanic processes.

TI  - Detecting land use and land cover change for a 28-year period using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images in the Jukskei River catchment, Gauteng, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jukskei River catchment is one of the urban catchments in the central part of Gauteng province covering a large part of City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality and small part of Tshwane and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipalities that have witnessed tremendous land use/land cover (LULC) change over time. Jukskei River catchment is one of the fastest growing catchments in terms of population and change in LULC over time. Therefore, it is very important to detect the nature and extent of these changes in order to identify thethe direction and future expansion of LULC within the catchment area. To accomplish that, multi-temporal satellite remotely sensed data acquired from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 1987, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 2001 and Landsat-8 Operational Land imager (OLI) 2015 were used to detect LULC change in Jukskei River catchment area. The Jukskei River catchment was classified into four major LULC classes including: Built-up area, bare surface, sparse vegetation and intact vegetation. The analysis of the results revealed that for the past 28 years (i.e., 1987-2015), built-up and bare surface areas have increased by 56.2% (42713.1 ha) and 8,2% (6225.1 ha) while intact and sparse vegetation have decreased by 9.8% (7455.0 ha) and 25.8% (19659.6 ha), respectively. The overall accuracies for 1987, 2001, and 2015, were 85.9%, 87.5%, and 92.5% respectively, with Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA) of 81.3%, 83.3%, and 90% which indicates the accuracy of classified images with the reference images. The results revealed by this study can be used for decision-making activities and policy development regarding land use management within the catchment.

TI  - Relationships between Soil Electrical Conductivity and Sentinel-2-Derived NDVI with pH and Content of Selected Nutrients
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Site-specific crop management demands maps which present the content of the main macronutrients. Such maps are prepared based on optimized soil sampling within management zones, which should be quite homogenous according to nutrient content, especially the content of potassium and phosphorus. Delineation of management zones is very often conducted using soil apparent electrical conductivity (EC) or other variables related to soil condition, including satellite-derived vegetation indices. In this study conducted in North-Western Poland, relationships between soil electrical conductivity and the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of various crops (wheat, barley, and rapeseed) with soil pH and content of P, K, and Mg were evaluated. Strong relationships were observed between NDVI of cereals with potassium content in soil. Correlation coefficients for wheat ranged from 0.37 to 0.60 for average potassium content for three years and from 0.05 to 0.63 for barley. Stronger relationships were observed for the years 2018 and 2019 when NDVI was based on Sentinel-2 data, while weaker for year 2017 when Landsat 8 NDVI was used. Relationships between EC and macronutrients content were similar to those observed with NDVI. Satellite-derived NDVI of cereals can be used as a variable for the delineation of within-field management zones. The same relationships were much weaker and not consistent for winter rapeseed.

TI  - Are Small Animal Practitioners Occupationally Exposed to Leptospirosis? Results of a Serological Survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis frequently responsible for clinical disease in dogs and rarely reported in human people. The risk of human exposure to Leptospira has been investigated in a sample population working in the northeast of Italy, a geographical area with high endemicity of canine leptospirosis. Two-hundred twenty-one human serum samples were analyzed for Leptospira microagglutination test (MAT): 112 clinical freelance small animal practitioners (exposed subjects) and 109 people not occupationally exposed to Leptospira-infected animals (unexposed subjects) were voluntarily enrolled. Despite the previously reported serological detection of antibodies vs. Leptospira in people in different Italian regions, this study did not detect any reactivity in the investigated population. This study shows that veterinarians do not appear to be at a greater risk of leptospirosis than the reference population. This may be due to both veterinarian awareness of the Leptospira zoonotic risk and the efficiency of the preventive measures and management of patients. Moreover, it could be the result of the relatively low excretion of Leptospira in symptomatic dogs, which can be considered as an environmental sentinel for Leptospira presence rather than a vehicle of transmission.

TI  - Capacity of a Multiplex IgM Antibody Capture ELISA to Differentiate Zika and Dengue Virus Infections in Areas of Concurrent Endemic Transmission
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Serological cross-reactivity has proved to be a challenge to diagnose Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in dengue virus (DENV) endemic countries. Confirmatory testing of ZIKV IgM positive results by plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) provides clarification in only a minority of cases because most individuals infected with ZIKV were previously exposed to DENV. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of a ZIKV/DENV DUO IgM antibody capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) for discriminating between DENV and ZIKV infections in endemic regions. Our performance evaluation included acute and convalescent specimens from patients with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed DENV or ZIKV from the Sentinel Enhanced Dengue Surveillance System in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The ZIKV/DENV DUO MAC-ELISA specificity was 100% for DENV (N = 127) and 98.4% for ZIKV (N = 275) when specimens were tested during the optimal testing window (days post-onset of illness [DPO] 6-120). The ZIKV/DENV DUO MACELISA sensitivity of RT-PCR confirmed specimens reached 100% for DENV by DPO 6 and for ZIKV by DPO 9. Our new ZIKV/DENV DUO MAC-ELISA was also able to distinguish ZIKV and DENV regardless of previous DENV exposure. We conclude this novel serologic diagnostic assay can accurately discriminate ZIKV and DENV infections. This can potentially be useful considering that the more labor-intensive and expensive PRNT assay may not be an option for confirmatory diagnosis in areas that lack PRNT capacity, but experience circulation of both DENV and ZIKV.

TI  - Achieving sustainable development goals through the study of urban heat island changes and its effective factors using spatio-temporal techniques: The case study (Tehran city)
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is aimed at investigating the spatio-temporal structure of land surface temperature (LST) and its interrelationship with physical and biophysical land surface properties, such as land use, vegetation, the indicators of climate changes and air pollution, and the density of buildings in Tehran city of Iran, using Landsat 5, 7 and 8 thermal bands of satellite images in cold and hot seasons during the 1984-2020 period. The results indicate that the mean LST of Tehran city has gradually increased over time. LST results in a hot season, such as May showed that the changes in 1990 were between 6 and 44 degrees C, in 2000, between 20 and 44 degrees C, in 2013 between 14 and 42 degrees C and in 2020 the changes were between 15 and 51 degrees C. Also, the formation of hot spots in the west and south demonstrated the direct connection pattern of the distribution of space. According to the results, a strong negative LST-NDVI and positive LST-NDBI correlation are observed throughout the period. In addition, as to the other indices, the results indicate a positive correlation among LST, and air pollution indicators (NO2, SO2, CO, CO2, PM2.5, and PM10 ppm), a negative correlation with precipitation and a positive correlation with temperature in climatic indices and negative LST- Humidity, NDWI, and NDMI. These show the regions where water can weaken the UHI effect in the city. LST also has a positive correlation with buildings density and population centers, as well as industries concentrated in the western regions of Tehran that are subjected to rising LST. The mixed urban landscape of the city is closely related to the changes of the LST and the indicators, including NDVI, different land covers, and urban industrial and commercial activities. Finally, the regional vulnerability of Tehran as a metropolis was determined by using geographic information systems and spatio-temporal methods. Based upon the results, the western regions of Tehran had more urban vulnerabilities in terms of thermal phenomena and the northern regions remain with the least vulnerability.

TI  - Landsat-based monitoring of southern pine beetle infestation severity and severity change in a temperate mixed forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent northward expansion of Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) outbreaks associated with warming winters has caused extensive tree mortality in temperate pine forests, significantly affecting forest dynamics, structure, and functioning. Spatially-explicit early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality is critical for timely and sustainable forest management practices. The unique contributions of remote sensing technologies to mapping the location, extent, and severity of beetle outbreaks, as well as assisting in analyzing the potential drivers for outbreak predictions, have been well recognized. However, little is known about the performance of moderate resolution satellite multispectral imagery for early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality. Thus, we conducted this study, as the first attempt, to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of SPB infestation severity at the regional scale and to understand the underlying environmental drivers in a spatially-explicit manner. First, we explored the spectral signatures of SPB-killed trees based on 30-m plot measurements and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, to improve detection accuracy for areas with low-moderate SPB infestation severity, we added spectraltemporal anomaly information in the form of a linear trend of the spectral index trajectory to a previously developed approach. The best overall accuracy increased from 84.7% to 90.1% and the best Macro F1 value increased from 0.832 to 0.900. Next, we compared the performances of spectral indices in mapping SPB infestation severity (i.e., % red stage within the 30-m grid cell). The results showed that the combination of Normalized Difference Moisture Index and Tasseled Cap Greenness had the best performance for mapping SPB infestation severity (2016: R2 = 0.754; RSME = 15.7; 2017: R2 = 0.787; RSME = 12.4). Finally, we found that climatic and landscape variables can explain the detected patterns of SPB infestation from 2014 to 2017 in our study area (R2 = 0.751; RSME = 9.67), providing valuable insights on possible predictors for early warning of SPB infestation. Specifically, in our study area, winter dew point temperature was found to be one of the most important predictors, followed by SPB infestation locations in the previous year, canopy cover of host species, elevation, and slope. In the context of continued global warming, our study not only provides a novel framework for efficient, spatially-explicit, and quantitative measurements of forest damage induced by SPB infestation over large scales, but also uncovers opportunities to predict future SPB outbreaks and take precautions against it.

TI  - A Planted Forest Mapping Method Based on Long-Term Change Trend Features Derived from Dense Landsat Time Series in an Ecological Restoration Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Planted forests provide a variety of meaningful ecological functions and services, which is a major approach for ecological restoration, especially in arid areas. However, mapping planted forests with remote-sensed data remains challenging due to the similarities in canopy spectral and structure characteristics and associated phenology features between planted forests and other vegetation types. In this study, taking advantage of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and taking the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwestern China as an example, we developed an approach to map planted forests in an arid region by applying long-term features of the NDVI derived from dense Landsat time series. Our land cover map achieved a satisfactory accuracy and relatively low uncertainty, with an overall accuracy of 93.65% and a kappa value of 0.92. Specifically, the producer (PA) and user accuracies (UA) were 92.48% and 91.79% for the planted forest class, and 93.88% and 95.83% for the natural forest class, respectively. The total planted forest area was estimated as 3608.72 km(2) in 2020, accounting for 20.60% of the study area. The proposed mapping approach can facilitate assessment of the restoration effects of ecological engineering and research on ecosystem services and stability of planted forests.

TI  - Neural Network Pattern Recognition Experiments Toward a Fully Automatic Detection of Anomalies in InSAR Time Series of Surface Deformation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a neural network-based method to detect anomalies in time-dependent surface deformation fields given a set of geodetic images of displacements collected from multiple viewing geometries. The presented methodology is based on a supervised classification approach using combinations of line of sight multitemporal, multi-geometry interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series of displacements. We demonstrate this method with a set of 170 million time series of surface deformation generated for the entire Italian territory and derived from ERS, ENVISAT, and COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite constellations. We create a training dataset that has been compared with independently validated data and current state-of-the-art classification techniques. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the presented framework provides increased detection accuracy, precision, recall, and reduced processing times for critical infrastructure and landslide monitoring. This study highlights how the proposed approach can accelerate the anomalous points identification step by up to 147 times compared to analytical and other artificial intelligence methods and can be theoretically extended to other geodetic measurements such as GPS, leveling data, or extensometers. Our results indicate that the proposed approach would make the anomaly identification post-processing times negligible when compared to the InSAR time-series processing.

TI  - Satellite Survey of Offshore Oil Seep Sites in the Caspian Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a long-term survey of the Caspian Sea using satellite SAR and multispectral sensors. The primary environmental problem of the Caspian Sea is oil pollution which is determined by its natural properties, mainly by the presence of big oil and gas deposits beneath the seabed. Our research focuses on natural oil slicks (NOS), i.e., oil showings on the sea surface due to natural hydrocarbon emission from seabed seeps. The spatial and temporal variability of NOS in the Caspian Sea and the possibilities of their reliable detection using satellite data are examined. NOS frequency and detectability in satellite images depending on sensor type, season and geographical region are assessed. It is shown that both parameters vary significantly, and largely depend on sensor type and season, with season being most pronounced in visible (VIS) data. The locations of two offshore seep sites at the Iranian and Turkmenian shelves are accurately estimated. Statistics on individual sizes of NOS are drawn. The release rates of crude oil from the seabed to the sea surface are compared. Detailed maps of NOS are put together, and areas exposed to high risk of sea surface oil pollution are determined.

TI  - Impact of lockdown and crop stubble burning on air quality of India: a case study from wheat-growing region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of COVID-19 has brought the entire planet to a halt. Many countries, including India, were compelled to shut down most urban, industrial, social and other activities as a result of the pandemic. Due to a series of complete lockdowns imposed in India from March 24 to May 17, 2020, and state-wise local level restrictions afterward, have resulted in significant reduction of emissions of numerous atmospheric pollutants. The objective of this study is to analyse the change in concentration of various pollutants such as nitrogen oxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) due to lockdown and also to quantify the contribution of crop stubble burning to air pollution. The Sentinel-5P based NO2 and CO observations for 2019 and 2020 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based AOD observations for 2016-2020 were used for detecting the variations. The obtained results showed a significant decrease in NO2 levels during various stages of lockdown. Small decrease in CO levels was observed across most part of the India. With a few exceptions, such as coastal and desert regions, there was a moderate decrease in AOD levels. Furthermore, to study the contribution of NO2, CO and AOD from crop stubble burning, MODIS observations on active fire events were obtained from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The burning of crop stubble increased NO2 emissions by 22 to 80%. CO levels, on the other hand, have risen by 7 to 25%. A considerable variation in AOD was reported, ranging from 1 to 426%.

TI  - Marine Oil Pollution in an Area of High Economic Use: Statistical Analyses of SAR Data from the Western Java Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we analyze more than 2000 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of the Western Java Sea acquired by Sentinel-1 SAR-C and ENVISAT ASAR, with the aim to generate oil pollution statistics for a sea region of high economic use. The spatial distributions show that most oil pollution occurs along the major shipping routes and at oil production sites in that area. The majority of the spills have sizes of less than 1 km(2) and an axial ratio smaller than 10. For two sets of SAR images, we compared the results obtained by different operators, who analyzed the same images. While more than 50% of the spills were not found by both operators, the overall spatial patterns derived from their results are the same. Our results indicate that the observed differences are mainly due to lookalikes, which can easily be confused with oil spills, but also due to small oil spills that were overseen by one of the operators. These assumptions are supported by the fact that the percentage of spills jointly found by both operators increased when only oil spills were considered that were found on SAR images acquired at higher mean wind speeds.

TI  - Impacts of land use/land cover dynamics on land surface temperature using geospatial techniques in Anger River Sub-basin, Western Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is increasing due to land use land cover (LULC) conversion in the world. Global warming was caused by highly expansion of agricultural land, expansion of human settlements and removal of vegetation cover. Here, we analyzed the impacts of LULC dynamics on LST from the year 1991 to 2020 in the Anger River Sub-basin, western Ethiopia. The LST and LULC changes were derived from thermal infrared and multispectral band of Landsat 5 TM (1991), Landsat 7 ETM+ (2003) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2020), respectively. The LULC map of the study area was produced using the supervised classification method with the maximum likelihood algorithm. Our study results revealed that agricultural land was increased by the rate of 30.4 km(2)/year. Between 1991 and 2020, about 650.3 km(2) of grassland was converted to agricultural land while 305.4 km(2) was converted from forest to agricultural land. The mean minimum LST was 21.2 degrees C in 1991 and increased to 23.50 degrees C and 26.80 degrees C in the years 2003 and 2020, respectively. Thus, the mean LST of the study area was increased by 5.6 degrees C between 1991 and 2020. Consequently, the conversion of LULC is the main factor for the increment of the LST. The LST was highly increased when forestland and grassland were converted to agricultural land. Similarly, when forestland was converted to bare land, the LST was increased. Our results suggest the need for environmental protection to respond to the increasing trend of LST and rapid conversion of LULC change in the study area.

TI  - Multiple indices-based assessment of agricultural drought: A case study in Gilgel Gibe Sub-basin, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought seriously affects the economies of developing countries due to heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture. The present study aimed to assess agricultural drought based on vegetation condition index (VCI) and vegetation health index (VHI) using geospatial techniques, the case of Gilgel Gibe sub-basin southern Ethiopia. Landsat images of TM 1990, ETM+ of 2000 and OLI/TIRS of 2020 were used to calculate VCI and VHI for assessing agricultural drought. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were used to estimate agricultural drought through VCI and VHI. The result revealed that NDVI declined from 1990 to 2020 due to expansion of agricultural lands and other socioeconomic activities. The output of VCI values indicates that extreme drought was increased from 0.3 km(2) in 1990 to.4 km(2) and 0.7 km(2) in 2000 and 2020, respectively. In addition, severe drought occurred in 2020 on an area of 6 km (2) (0.1%). Consequently, moderate drought was increased by area of 3.3 km(2) , 22.2 km(2) and 1051.1 km(2) in 1990, 2000 and 2020, respectively, based on VHI in the study area. Thus, to minimize the negative effects of agricultural drought on socioeconomic and well-being of the society in the Gilgel Gibe sub-basin forest and other natural resources conservations are essentials not optional. To alleviate the detrimental consequences of agricultural drought on socioeconomic and well-being, forest and other natural resources conservation is necessary. Moreover, detailed research should be conducted in the study area by using high-resolution satellite data with ground control points.

TI  - Assessing climate and human activity effects on lake characteristics using spatio-temporal satellite data and an emotional neural network
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Different sensing methods provide valuable information for comprehensive monitoring strategies, which are crucial for the ecological management of lakes and watersheds. Subsequently, the resulting spatio-temporal information can be considered the fundamental knowledge for the water resources management of watersheds. Lake Urmia is deemed one of the most important aquatic habitats in Iran. It has been experiencing significant changes during recent years due to climate change, anthropogenic activities, and a lack of coherent management approaches. Hence, awareness of the hydro-ecological factors during the last few decades is critical for identifying the problems. In this research, the impacts of changes in key parameters such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, water surface temperatures, suspended sediment concentration, saline features, and vegetation are explored using satellite imagery. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the Lake Urmia crisis concerning human-involved and climate factors such as the agriculture sector and construction of the causeway. In this regard, a limbic-based Emotional Artificial Neural Network (EANN) is developed as a non-linear universal mapping and implemented for the first time to demonstrate the interactions between the considered hydro-ecological factors and the sensitivity of the two indicators the lake health. Providing a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis is another objective of this study to detect the onset of deterioration in the parameters. The values of the efficiency criteria were measured to evaluate the sensitivity of the EANN models to the related inputs. The results of the model in scenario 4 with evapotranspiration, precipitation, runoff and vegetation as input variables led to higher performance with the best efficiency criteria, including DC = 0.868 and RMSE = 0.096. The quantitative results confirm that the combination of both climate and anthropogenic factors, including the agricultural sector's overdraft, leads to the most efficient EANN model and, consequently, is considered the leading cause of the crisis.

M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between intraannual and interannual variations in the snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere, including Eurasia and North America and changes in surface air temperature was quantitatively estimated using satellite and reanalysis data for the period of 1979-2020. The estimates of the parameters of the snow cover extent sensitivity to temperature changes for the last four decades were compared with the estimates for the recent years (since 2005). The results of the correlation and cross-wavelet analysis indicate a general significant coherence and negative correlation between surface air temperature and the snow cover extent both for the entire Northern Hemisphere and separately for Eurasia and North America not only in the annual cycle but also in interannual variability for most months. Also, there is a positive correlation between the snow cover extent and surface air temperature in interannual variability, in particular, during the snow cover formation in the autumn months. It was found that the negative correlation between the snow cover extent and surface air temperature in Eurasia and North America for the recent years is higher than for the last four decades for most months except for the summer ones. The results indicate a weak coherence of interannual variations in the snow cover extent in Eurasia and North America, which is associated with the corresponding low coherence of interannual variations in surface air temperature for Eurasia and North America as a whole.

TI  - African Case Studies: Developing Pavement Temperature Maps for Performance-Graded Asphalt Bitumen Selection
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliable performance of roads is crucial for service delivery, and it is a catalyst for domestic and cross-border spatial development. Paved national roads are expected to carry higher traffic volumes over time as a result of urbanization and to support the economic development in the continent. Increased traffic levels combined with expected increases in air temperatures as a result of global warming highlight the need to appropriately select bituminous road materials for a reliable performance of asphalt roads. The objective of the paper is to present African case studies on the development of temperature maps necessary for performance-graded bitumen selection for road design and construction. A consistent approach, that caters for the variability of geographical, environmental and climatic conditions, does not currently exist within the continent. Therefore, this paper discusses a series of critical components in the development of temperature maps for performance-graded bitumen including (i) pavement temperature models and climatic zones in Africa; (ii) the effect of urban heat islands on pavement temperature; (iii) sources of weather data and (iv) the mapping procedure to produce temperature maps. Characterizing the thermal properties of the pavement was found to be an important factor for reliably calculating expected road temperatures as well as the consideration of the ambient climate for a given location. During this study, the urban heat island effect was found to have little influence on the maximum pavement temperatures but a significant effect on the minimum pavement temperatures. Some areas of the urban district assessed in this investigation were found to increase by two performance grades according to the minimum temperature criteria. The recent observed weather data from weather stations are the most accurate means of measurement of the ambient environmental conditions necessary for performance-based specifications, but they are not always easily accessible, and therefore other sources of data, such as satellite data, may need to be used instead. With the expected temperature increases expected as a result of climate change, the use of Global Climate Models also opens new avenues for performance-based material selection in the African continent for expected climates as an alternative to traditional approaches based on historically observed weather.

TI  - Application of the METRIC model for mapping evapotranspiration over the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is an attempt to estimate the spatial distribution of daily evapotranspiration (ET) in the Indian part of the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve by utilizing the (Mapping Evapo Transpiration at high resolution with internalized Calibration (METRIC) model. Landsat 8 OLI satellite image was used to run the METRIC model and calculate ET to explain the overall surface energy balance in the area under the present climatic conditions. The result obtained shows that, the ET minimum value ranges from 6.874 mm/day in cropland to a maximum of 12.321 mm/day in the forest and water bodies. We used a (ETrF) value of 1 for forests since the forest surface temperature was lower than the air temperature, resulting in a negative sensible heat flow. The use of METRIC energy balancing procedures for validation purposes using Landsat imagery shows that the per hourly, monthly, and yearly ET estimations acquired using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer) data may be effectively reproduced. The research includes a novel component that verifies the efficacy of this technique for water conservation, as well as satellite-based technology, which offers effective and efficient tools for integrated evapotranspiration estimation.

TI  - ENUNCIATIVE DEVICES AND ARGUMENTATION IN POETRY
T2  - HUMANIDADES & INOVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes to define the conditions allowing the emergence of an argumentative dimension in poetry. We take as our theoretical framework dialogism, the distinction between speaker and enunciator, and an extensive conception of argumentation including axiological and appreciative modalities. We begin with the more direct forms of argumentation, looking at the extent to which the use of connectors, polemical negation, or dialogue leads the reader to perceive an argumentative positioning. We then analyze more indirect forms in which the main speaker positions himself in relation to speakers internal to the text, or anticipates the reader's reactions, or constructs the text in such a way as to let it be understood to which perspective or worldview his preference goes. Such forms require the reader's perception of the implied conflicts between various points of view. The examples come from twentieth century French poetry, but the theory can be adapted to any poetic corpus.

TI  - Combining Citizen Science Data and Satellite Descriptors of Ecosystem Functioning to Monitor the Abundance of a Migratory Bird during the Non-Breeding Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Migratory birds are particularly exposed to habitat changes in their breeding and non-breeding grounds. Remote sensing technologies offer an excellent opportunity to monitor species' habitats from space at unprecedented spatiotemporal scales. We analyzed if remotely sensed ecosystem functioning attributes (EFAs) adequately predict the spatiotemporal variation of the Woodcock's (Scolopax rusticola) relative abundance in southwest Europe, during autumn migration and wintering periods. We used data gathered from Woodcock monitoring through citizen science (N = 355,654 hunting trips) between 2009 and 2018. We computed a comprehensive set of EFAs on a weekly basis from three MODIS satellite products: enhanced vegetation index (EVI), tasseled cap transformation (TCT), and land surface temperature (LST). We developed generalized linear mixed models to explore the predictive power of EFAs on Woodcock's abundance during the non-breeding season. Results showed that Woodcock abundance is correlated with spatiotemporal dynamics in primary productivity (measured through the EVI), water cycle dynamics (wetness component of TCT), and surface energy balance (LST) in both periods. Our findings underline the potential of combining citizen science and remote sensing data to monitor migratory birds throughout their life cycles-an issue of critical importance to ensure adequate habitat management in the non-breeding areas.

T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in melanoma is debated. This article presents a multicenter, retrospective study assessing the predictive and prognostic value of TILs. Methods The Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group database was queried from 1993 to 2018 for cases with known TIL data. TILs were categorized as absent or present, which included nonbrisk (NB), brisk (B), and present but unspecified TIL levels. Clinicopathologic factors were correlated with TILs, sentinel lymph node (SLN) status, and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Results Overall, 3203 patients were included. The median thickness was 1.5 mm, and 469 cases had SLN metastases. TILs were present in 2458 cases (76.7%), with NB, B, and unspecified TILs seen in 1691 (68.8%), 691 (28.1%), and 76 (3.1%), respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of TILs significantly predicted a negative SLN biopsy (P < .05). The median follow-up was 25.2 months. MSS was significantly better for cases with TILs than cases without TILs (P < .001). According to multivariable analysis, age, gender, thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, and SLN status were significantly prognostic of MSS (all P values < .05). Although TILs were not prognostic of MSS, when multiple imputation was used and the SLN status was excluded, the presence of TILs was significantly prognostic of improved MSS (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.95; P = .0154). Conclusions TILs are a favorable marker because their presence significantly predicts a negative SLN, and the absence of TILs may be a prognostic marker of worse survival in patients with a positive SLN but not a negative SLN. TILs may also serve as a prognostic marker of survival when the SLN status is not considered.

TI  - Upsilonoung Adults' Assertiveness in Relation to Parental Acceptance-Rejection in Greece and in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
T2  - Psychological reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study explored the relation between assertiveness and parental behavior as perceived by young adults through parental acceptance-rejection and behavioral and psychological control. Alphassertiveness is a mode of personal behavior and communication characterized by willingness to stand up for one's own needs and interests in an open and direct way. Inappropriate parenting may be associated with assertiveness difficulties and as evidence-based findings from many surveys have shown that assertive skills can be improved, it seems to be of great importance to examine the relation between assertiveness and parental rejection along with lack of support, and vice versa. In this study, assertiveness was investigated using the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule and parental behavior was studied using the Adult Parental Acceptance-Rejection/Control Questionnaire. Psychosocial personality traits and psychological control were assessed through the Adult Personality Assessment Questionnaire and the Psychological Control Scale, respectively. The sample consisted of 1,117 university students from Greek universities in Athens, Greece, and in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). For all measures and their psychometric structure, factor equivalence for the two countries was verified through congruence coefficients and through confirmatory factor analyses. Findings showed that in respect to the Greek sample (but not the B&H sample), assertive-behavior skills are more common among men than women. Assertiveness for all participants is correlated with maternal psychological control and paternal acceptance and also with self-evaluation and worldview. Apparently, maternal psychological control and paternal acceptance-rejection seemed to be associated with young adults' levels of assertiveness to a greater degree than with the other parental behavior parameters assessed in the present research.

TI  - Quantitatively Assessing the Impact of Driving Factors on Vegetation Cover Change in China's 32 Major Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After 2000, China's vegetation underwent great changes associated with climate change and urbanization. Although many studies have been conducted to quantify the contributions of climate and human activities to vegetation, few studies have quantitatively examined the comprehensive contributions of climate, urbanization, and CO2 to vegetation in China's 32 major cities. In this study, using Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) fractional vegetation cover (FVC) between 2001 and 2018, we investigated the trend of FVC in China's 32 major cities and quantified the effects of CO2, urbanization, and climate by using generalized linear models (GLMs). We found the following: (1) From 2001 to 2018, the FVC in China generally illustrated an increasing trend, although it decreased in 23 and 21 cities in the core area and expansion area, respectively. (2) Night light data showed that the urban expansion increased to varying degrees, with an average increasing ratio of approximately 168%. The artificial surface area increased significantly, mainly from cropland, forest, grassland, and tundra. (3) Climate factors and CO2 were the major factors that affected FVC change. The average contributions of climate factors, CO2, and urbanization were 40.6%, 39.2%, and 10.6%, respectively. This study enriched the understanding of vegetation cover change and its influencing factors, helped to explain the complex biophysical mechanism between vegetation and environment, and guided sustainable urban development.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ear, nose and throat (ENT) emergency clinic is managed by foundation year (FY) doctors from taking referrals to discharging patients, under the supervision of a registrar. FYs learn essential skills and knowledge on how to manage common ENT problems. The clinic is often overloaded because of a high patient demand, and this limits the opportunities for teaching. We hypothesised that the clinic bookings would be better managed if referrals from general practitioners (GPs) were triaged by registrars.METHODS: Telephone referrals from GPs for the ENT emergency clinic were directed to the on-call ENT registrar, between 8am and 1pm from Monday to Friday, and to the FY outside of this period. Consecutive referrals to the emergency clinic were analysed in a baseline audit and a post-intervention cycle.RESULTS: A total of 646 and 611 patients were given clinic appointments in the first and second cycles, respectively. Clinic session overbookings decreased from 85% to 46.3%. Appointments for referrals that were deemed inappropriate had reduced from 22% to 12.1%.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Involvement of a registrar in taking referrals for the ENT emergency clinic was associated with a reduction in clinic overbookings. It is feasible and productive to involve a senior decision maker in the operational management of the emergency clinic, while preserving the delivery of this service by FYs for its training value.

TI  - Evaluation of Agricultural Bare Soil Properties Retrieval from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and PRISMA Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The PRISMA satellite is equipped with an advanced hyperspectral Earth observation technology capable of improving the accuracy of quantitative estimation of bio-geophysical variables in various Earth Science Applications and in particular for soil science. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the ability of the PRISMA hyperspectral imager to estimate topsoil properties (i.e., organic carbon, clay, sand, silt), in comparison with current satellite multispectral sensors. To investigate this expectation, a test was carried out using topsoil data collected in Italy following two approaches. Firstly, PRISMA, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 spectral simulated datasets were obtained from the spectral resampling of a laboratory soil library. Subsequently, bare soil reflectance data were obtained from two experimental areas in Italy, using real satellites images, at dates close to each other. The estimation models of soil properties were calibrated employing both Partial Least Square Regression and Cubist Regression algorithms. The results of the study revealed that the best accuracies in retrieving topsoil properties were obtained by PRISMA data, using both laboratory and real datasets. Indeed, the resampled spectra of the hyperspectral imager provided the best Ratio of Performance to Inter-Quartile distance (RPIQ) for clay (4.87), sand (3.80), and organic carbon (2.59) estimation, for the spectral soil library datasets. For the bare soil reflectance obtained from real satellite imagery, a higher level of prediction accuracy was obtained from PRISMA data, with RPIQ +/- SE values of 2.32 +/- 0.07 for clay, 3.85 +/- 0.19 for silt, and 3.51 +/- 0.16 for soil organic carbon. The results for the PRISMA hyperspectral satellite imagery with the Cubist Regression provided the best performance in the prediction of silt, sand, clay and SOC. The same variables were better estimated using PLSR models in the case of the resampled hyperspectral data. The statistical accuracy in the retrieval of SOC from real and resampled PRISMA data revealed the potential of the actual hyperspectral satellite. The results supported the expected good ability of the PRISMA imager to estimate topsoil properties.

TI  - Remotely sensed image interpretation for assessment of land use land cover changes and settlement impact on allocated irrigation water in Multan, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial revolution and rapid population growth are responsible for alteration of land into different settlements. These changes may lead to change in land use (LU) and land cover (LC). The LULC changes have impact on hydrological regimes including streams flow pattern and allocated irrigation water (water allocation through Warabandi system). The present study aimed to identify the LULC changes and settlement impact on allocated water using the unsupervised classification and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of Landsat images for the years of 1990 to 2020 in Multan District. The accuracy assessment and Kappa coefficient were also investigated to evaluate quality of results derived from the classified images. The results show that the reduction in waterbody, spare, and dense vegetation was -7.6, -1.7, and -30.7%, respectively. The settlements, barren, and crop lands have increased to 25.2, 10.1, and 4.6%, respectively, from 1990 to 2020. The values of kappa coefficient (0.84-0.85) showed very good level of classification. In addition, the volume of water loss due to change of LULC from waterbody into settlements, barren land, crop land, spare, and dense vegetation was found approximately 472, 44, 133, 54, and 85 m(3), respectively, in last 30 years. This volume of water is not reaching equitably to the farming community because of the LU and LC changes and urban settlements. The results indicated that remotely sensed image interpretation technique may be a useful for reallocation of water among farmers in an equitable and efficient way.

TI  - Applying surface reflectance to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Northern Thailand
T2  - SCIENCEASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODIS surface reflectance (SR) product (MOD09) was used to predict PM2.5 concentrations with a regression model. The predicted results were compared with the MAIAC-AOD model and the ground based measurements. The output from the MODIS product is regularly employed to predict air pollution and emissions, while the AOD model is normally used to predict PM2.5 concentrations. This study investigated PM2.5 concentrations in Northern Thailand by using SR via a linear regression model. The results showed that the highest value of SR was observed in Band-2 (0.17-0.27), followed by Band-1 and Band-4 (0.10-0.14) and Band-3 (0.07-0.10). Moreover, the correlation coefficient between SR-band-2 versus the measured PM2.5 from the master stations with PM2.5 sensor was greater than those of the other bands. The correlation coefficients between the predicted PM2.5 by the MODIS-SR and by the MAIAC-AOD models and the measured PM2.5 from the master stations varied between 0.3871-0.8588 and 0.3913-0.7802, respectively. The range of prediction efficiency by the SR model was 10.8%-27.2%, which was greater than the AOD model. It should be concluded that the distribution of spatial PM2.5 concentrations obtained from surface reflectance and MAIAC-AOD predictions was similar.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of water use efficiency and its drivers in major forest formations in India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a significant role in mitigating the effects of climate change and regulating the biogeochemical cycles. Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator that links the carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. In the present study, WUE of major forest formations of India was calculated from 2003 to 2018 as the ratio of Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Gross Primary Productivity (GPP, MOD17A2H) to evapotranspiration (ET, MOD16A) using the Google Earth Engine platform. The spatial distribution of WUE was mapped and the inter-annual and monthly variations were analysed. The mean annual WUE of forests ranged from 1.78-2.02 gC kgH2O-1. It was observed that tropical thorn forests had the highest WUE (3.52 +/- 1.08 gC kgH2O-1) and moist alpine scrub had the lowest WUE (1.05 +/- 0.17gC kgH2O-1) among the forest type groups of India. WUE of forests showed an increasing trend with latitude and decreasing trend with elevation. To understand the influence of various bio-meteorological drivers on WUE and their importance in governing these influences, Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used. The bio-meteorological drivers were able to explain 65% of the variability in WUE. Temperature was identified as the most important driver in influencing the WUE of forests. Based on the findings of the study, it can be expected that the global increase in temperature would negatively affect the WUE of the major forest formations of India.

TI  - Application of "Observation Minus Reanalysis" Method towards LULC Change Impact over Southern India
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study performed a land use and land cover (LULC) change analysis over Southern India for the period 1981-2006 from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images of AVHRR data and applied the "observation minus reanalysis" (OMR) method to investigate the impact of the LULC change on the temperature of the region. The LULC change analysis indicated that the areas under agriculture/fallow land were significantly increased while the areas under shrubs/small vegetation were decreased during the period 1981-2006. The areas under forest cover and barren land were also decreased but relatively low compared to the other LULC types. The OMR results showed that the LULC changes over urban areas contributed to warming with a temperature of 0.02 degrees C during this period, while that over non-urban areas showed a cooling effect with a temperature reduction of 0.29 degrees C and that over the whole Southern India (looked at an average) indicated a cooling effect with a temperature reduction of 0.063 degrees C. The comparative analysis between the two (LULC change analysis and OMR) results showed that the cooling over Southern India was mostly due to the expansion of agriculture/fallow land and the decline of shrubs/small vegetation. The study suggests that the OMR method reasonably demonstrates the effect of LULC changes on the temperature over Southern India.

TI  - Mapping of Urban Vegetation with High-Resolution Remote Sensing: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Green space is increasingly recognized as an important component of the urban environment. Adequate management and planning of urban green space is crucial to maximize its benefits for urban inhabitants and for the urban ecosystem in general. Inventorying urban vegetation is a costly and time-consuming process. The development of new remote sensing techniques to map and monitor vegetation has therefore become an important topic of interest to many scholars. Based on a comprehensive survey of the literature, this review article provides an overview of the main approaches proposed to map urban vegetation from high-resolution remotely sensed data. Studies are reviewed from three perspectives: (a) the vegetation typology, (b) the remote sensing data used and (c) the mapping approach applied. With regard to vegetation typology, a distinction is made between studies focusing on the mapping of functional vegetation types and studies performing mapping of lower-level taxonomic ranks, with the latter mainly focusing on urban trees. A wide variety of high-resolution imagery has been used by researchers for both types of mapping. The fusion of various types of remote sensing data, as well as the inclusion of phenological information through the use of multi-temporal imagery, prove to be the most promising avenues to improve mapping accuracy. With regard to mapping approaches, the use of deep learning is becoming more established, mostly for the mapping of tree species. Through this survey, several research gaps could be identified. Interest in the mapping of non-tree species in urban environments is still limited. The same holds for the mapping of understory species. Most studies focus on the mapping of public green spaces, while interest in the mapping of private green space is less common. The use of imagery with a high spatial and temporal resolution, enabling the retrieval of phenological information for mapping and monitoring vegetation at the species level, still proves to be limited in urban contexts. Hence, mapping approaches specifically tailored towards time-series analysis and the use of new data sources seem to hold great promise for advancing the field. Finally, unsupervised learning techniques and active learning, so far rarely applied in urban vegetation mapping, are also areas where significant progress can be expected.

TI  - Impact of High-Cadence Earth Observation in Maize Crop Phenology Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For farmers, policymakers, and government agencies, it is critical to accurately define agricultural crop phenology and its spatial-temporal variability. At the moment, two approaches are utilized to report crop phenology. On one hand, land surface phenology provides information about the overall trend, whereas weekly reports from USDA-NASS provide information about the development of particular crops at the regional level. High-cadence earth observations might help to improve the accuracy of these estimations and bring more precise crop phenology classifications closer to what farmers demand. The second component of the proposed solution requires the use of robust classifiers (e.g., random forest, RF) capable of successfully managing large data sets. To evaluate this solution, this study compared the output of a RF classifier model using weather, two different satellite sources (Planet Fusion; PF and Sentinel-2; S-2), and ground truth data to improve maize (Zea mays L.) crop phenology classification using two regions of Kansas (Southwest and Central) as a testbed during the 2017 growing season. Our findings suggests that high temporal resolution (PF) data can significantly improve crop classification metrics (f1-score = 0.94) relative to S-2 (f1-score = 0.86). Additionally, a decline in the f1-score between 0.74 and 0.60 was obtained when we assessed the ability of S-2 to extend the temporal forecast for crop phenology. This research highlights the critical nature of very high temporal resolution (daily) earth observation data for crop monitoring and decision making in agriculture.

TI  - A Comprehensive Grading System for a Magnetic Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Procedure in Head and Neck Cancer Patients
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary With 30% of clinically negative early-stage oral cancer patients harboring occult metastasis, an accurate staging of metastatic lymph nodes (LN) is of utmost importance for treatment planning. A magnetic sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure is offered as an alternative to conventional SLNB in oral oncology, however, a grading system is missing. A proper grading system is preferred to connect the different components of the magnetic SLNB: preoperative imaging, intraoperative detection, and histopathological examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). This study aims to provide a first grading system based on the distribution of a magnetic tracer, by means of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intraoperative estimation of iron content, and histopathological assessment of resected nodes. Pre- and post-operative MRI and harvested SLNs of eight tongue cancer patients with successful magnetic SLNB procedure were used for analyses. A magnetic sentinel lymph node biopsy ((SLN)B) procedure has recently been shown feasible in oral cancer patients. However, a grading system is absent for proper identification and classification, and thus for clinical reporting. Based on data from eight complete magnetic SLNB procedures, we propose a provisional grading system. This grading system includes: (1) a qualitative five-point grading scale for MRI evaluation to describe iron uptake by LNs; (2) an ex vivo count of resected SLN with a magnetic probe to quantify iron amount; and (3) a qualitative five-point grading scale for histopathologic examination of excised magnetic SLNs. Most SLNs with iron uptake were identified and detected in level II. In this level, most variance in grading was seen for MRI and histopathology; MRI and medullar sinus were especially highly graded, and cortical sinus was mainly low graded. On average 82 +/- 58 mu g iron accumulated in harvested SLNs, and there were no significant differences in injected tracer dose (22.4 mg or 11.2 mg iron). In conclusion, a first step was taken in defining a comprehensive grading system to gain more insight into the lymphatic draining system during a magnetic SLNB procedure.

TI  - Research on Inversion of Water Conservation Distribution of Forest Ecosystem in Alpine Mountain Based on Spectral Features
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water conservation in forest ecosystems has ecological functions such as regulating climate and maintaining ecological water balance. As an alpine region, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau cannot manually observe water conservation on the spot due to its high altitude and harsh environment. In order to better obtain water conservation in alpine regions, remote sensing technology is introduced, and the value of water conservation in a specific area is obtained through remote sensing inversion. This study takes Nyingchi Bayi District as the study area. The study area uses four types of vegetation: Nyingchi Spruce, Alpine Quercus, Alpine Pine and Snow Rhododendron as the main tree species. Remote sensing images cannot directly obtain water conservation information, but the value of water conservation can be inverted by constructing a quantitative relationship between vegetation leaf spectral information and water conservation. To study the quantitative relationship between different vegetations and water conservation, collect 1 000 leaf samples and water conservation data from 10 sampling points for each vegetation, use ASD spectrometer to obtain hyperspectral data, select fitting parameters through correlation, and build a regression model of water conservation. The Sentinel-2 remote sensing image was used to invert the water conservation distribution of vegetation in the study area, and the inversion results were verified. The results show that the reflectance spectra of the four types of vegetation leave all show similar regularities. The difference is not obvious in the visible light band, and there are four obvious water absorption bands in the near-infrared to the mid-infrared band (700 similar to 1 400 nm) , and the reflectivity in the red to near-infrared band highest. The spectral reflectance showed the order of Alpine Quercus > Alpine Pine > Lingzhi Spruce approximate to Snow Rhododendron. Through experiments, the vegetation canopy interception, litter water holding capacity and soil water content are obtained. The sum of the three represents the water conservation capacity of the vegetation, and the relationship between the spectral characteristics of the vegetation and the water conservation capacity is analyzed. Moreover, through the Pearson coefficient to evaluate the quantitative relationship between band parameters and water conservation, it is determined that the four parameters R-540 R-1950 NDWI and NDVI are significantly related to water conservation. Based on the above parameters and the water conservation of the four types of vegetation, a regression model of water conservation was constructed. The vegetation water conservation in the study area was inverted through the model to verify the simulation accuracy. The overall inversion accuracy R-2 is greater than 0. 7, and the RMSE is less than 10. It shows that the prediction model has a good inversion effect, and the model can effectively estimate the water conservation of the forest ecosystem.

TI  - Correlation between Bruxism and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disorder and Their Effects on Tooth Wear. A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) can lead to wear of the dental tissues. Wear has a mechanical or chemical origin, and it is of extrinsic or intrinsic type. Bruxism and GERD are two etiological factors of dental wear. The intrinsic mechanical wear (abfraction) of Bruxism and intrinsic chemical wear (erosion) of GERD are both involved in sleep disorders; indeed, they could have associations and act in synergy in dental wear. The purpose of this review was to find out the possible associations between bruxism and GERD and their effects on tooth wear. The research was conducted on PubMed and the Cochrane Library using the following Keywords/Mesh Terms: Tooth wear, Bruxism, Sleep Bruxism, Sleep Disorders, or GERD. Only systematic reviews and clinical studies performed exclusively on human subjects were included in the review. Initially, the research gave more than 630 results on dental wear, bruxism and GERD and after application of the inclusion criteria irrelevant studies were excluded, and 5 studies were finally included in this review. It was possible to observe the presence of some associations between the two problems (reflux and GERD) and hypothesize negative effects on tooth wear. This research revealed the presence of an interconnection between these three problems (reflux, GERD and tooth wear) that can further act in synergy by attacking the hard dental tissues both from a chemical (reflux) and mechanical (bruxism) point of view. The dentist could play a role of "sentinel" in a multidisciplinary team, intercepting these problems early in order to treat them in the most appropriate way.

TI  - Urbanization influences small mammal composition, but not species richness in forest fragments in Accra, Ghana
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Accra Plain of Ghana is experiencing rapid urbanization, but there is scant information on its impact on local biodiversity. We assessed the changes in land use/land cover of the Accra Plain since 1991 and evaluated how the observed changes have influenced local small mammals in forest fragments. We applied supervised classification and intensity analysis time-series Landsat imagery data to assess land use/land cover changes between 1991 and 2017. Small mammals were surveyed in two forest fragments, the Pinkwae and Adumanya forests from June 2019 to January 2020, using capture-mark-recapture technique. We compared our data with baseline data gathered in 1991-1992, when large areas of the city remained mostly undeveloped. Our data revealed that the urban area has increased by 832%, while the forest area declined by 85% between 1991 and 2017. The Pinkwae and Adumanya forests, which covered 120 and 1.5 ha, respectively, in 1991 have each been reduced to < 1 ha. We found changes in the small mammal species composition in the forest fragments, but not species richness due to species turnover. Grammomys poensis and Dephomys defua are first records for the Accra Plain. Our data suggested that small forest fragments within the urbanizing landscape are important for maintaining the local small mammal species. For the conservation of local small mammals in urbanizing landscapes, it is important to maintain the greatest possible number of small forest fragments and establish policies that prevent forest remnants from being further depleted.

TI  - A combined GIS, remote sensing and geophysical methods for groundwater potential assessment of Ilora, Oyo central, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The unavailability of water has been a major threat to agricultural and commercial activities in Ilora, Oyo central, Nigeria. This study combined GIS, remote sensing, and geophysical methods for groundwater potential zone mapping within the area in an attempt to identify prospective zones for borehole drilling activities. Landsat 8 OLI, ASTER DEM, geological, geophysical, and soil data of the research area were acquired for this study. To map the groundwater potential of the area, eight thematic layers that influence groundwater occurrences and movement controlling factors such as, geology, elevation, slope, land use land cover (LULC), fault proximity, soil, lineament density, and drainage density were mapped out from the acquired data of the area. The influence of each theme and subunit/class on groundwater recharge based on previous studies were evaluated using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The groundwater potential of the area of study was qualitatively classified into five classes, namely: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low which account for 0.3%, 7.8%, 54.8%, 35.6%, and 1.5% of the total area, respectively. The results were cross validated using well data from the area and 88.9% correlation and 0.74 kappa coefficient were achieved. The groundwater potential map generated in this research could be used as a preliminary reference in selecting suitable sites for groundwater resource exploitation in the area to ameliorate the current scarcity of water in this region.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Soil Impermeability and Its Impact on the Hydrology of An Urban Basin
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of impervious surfaces in catchments interferes with the natural process of infiltration, which has a marked influence on the hydrological cycle, affecting the base flow in rivers and increasing the surface runoff and the magnitude of flood flows. Like many Latin American cities, Loja (located in southern Ecuador) has experienced significant rates of urban growth in recent years, increasing the impervious surfaces in the catchment where it belongs. The aim of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of imperviousness in the study area for the period 1989-2020, using the Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (NDISI) and the supervised classification of Landsat images. The effect on flood flows was studied for each timestep using HEC-HMS hydrological model. Additionally, a future scenario of impervious surfaces was generated considering the observed spatiotemporal variability, possible explanatory variables, and logistic regression models. Between 1989 and 2020, there was an increase of 144.12% in impervious surfaces, which corresponds to the population growth of 282.56% that occurred in the same period. The period between 2001 and 2013 was the one that presented the most significant increase (1.06 km(2)/year). A direct relationship between the increase in impervious surfaces and the increase in flood flows was observed, reaching a significant variation towards the horizon year that could affect the population, for which measures to manage the surface runoff is necessary.

TI  - Evaluation of MERRA-2 Aerosol Optical and Component Properties over China Using SONET and PARASOL/GRASP Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) is widely used as an advanced model dataset for the understanding of global climate change. However, independent validation and comparison of MERRA-2 are both insufficient and always desired. Therefore, in this study, the quantitative evaluation of MERRA-2 aerosol products was conducted over China for Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), absorbing AOD (AAOD) and chemical components (black carbon (BC) and dust (DU)) using Sun sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) ground-based measurements and POLDER-3/PARASOL satellite products generated by the GRASP algorithm. The available MERRA-2 monthly dataset and PARASOL/GRASP monthly and seasonal products were intercompared over China. MERRA-2 AOD (550 nm) show general good agreement with SONET and PARASOL/GRASP. For example, the correlation coefficients are usually 0.6-0.85 with SONET and 0.75-0.85 with PARASOL/GRASP, the bias is usually -0.293 to +0.008 with SONET. For AE and AAOD, the agreement is still reasonable. MERRA-2 is found to overestimate fine mode AE and to display a general underestimation of aerosol absorption over China. In addition, MERRA-2 BC and DU mass concentrations show spatial and quantitative consistency with PARASOL/GRASP components climatological products. The relatively high columnar BC mass concentration is observed around 1.5-2 mg/m(3) over the East China industrial region and high DU mass concentration is around 150 mg/m(3) near Taklimakan desert. MERRA-2 shows slightly higher BC and lower DU concentration than PARASOL/GRASP over East China. The evaluations with in situ BC measurements near surface verify the overestimation (MAE = +0.44 mu g/m(2)) of MERRA-2 and underestimation (MAE = -0.38 mu g/m(2)) of PARASOL/GRASP. The analysis demonstrates multi-source datasets, such as ground-based, space-borne remote sensing, in situ measurements, model simulation as well as reanalysis data, complement each other and can be used to refine aerosol characterization.

TI  - Diffuse nutrient export dynamics from accumulated litterfall in forested watersheds with remote sensing data coupled model
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrients exported from forest litterfall significantly contribute to the global cycling of elements and the water quality in watersheds. Simulating the watershed discharge load is challenging because of the combined effects of the decomposing litterfall and topographic heterogeneity. We quantified the contribution of diffuse nutrient export from forest litterfall in a low temperature watershed using artificial rainfall experiments and watershed territorial modeling with remote sensing data, and therefore, the critical spatial factors and corresponding nutrient export dynamics were identified. Rainfall intensity and terrain slope were found to be the key factors for nutrient export under different litterfall decomposition conditions. Based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data and field observations, the temporal patterns of litterfall biomass of two types of dominant forests (broad-leaved and mixed) were interpreted. The spatial patterns of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) exports from watershed litterfall were simulated by coupling the observed discharge parameters under artificial rainfall conditions and watershed surface flow modeling with the hydrological characteristics of the forested areas. The average watershed TOC, TN, and TP loads exported from the litterfall were approximately 58.22, 7.89, and 0.37 kg ha(-1) a(-1), respectively. The exported loads of TOC, TN, and TP varied with the forest types, and the loads from the litterfall of deciduous broad-leaved forest were found to be similar to 50-70% of loads from the litterfall of mixed forest. A comparison with similar studies worldwide also indicated that low temperature decreased the litterfall decomposition rate and diffuse nutrient export. This study indicated that litterfall nutrients were a key contributor to watershed water pollution, and their spatial discharge trend varied intensively with the terrestrial conditions. The modified simulation methods were found to accu-rately assess the cycling of nutrients from the forest litterfall on a watershed scale.

TI  - Near Real-Time Change Detection System Using Sentinel-2 and Machine Learning: A Test for Mexican and Colombian Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The commitment by over 100 governments covering over 90% of the world's forests at the COP26 in Glasgow to end deforestation by 2030 requires more effective forest monitoring systems. The near real-time (NRT) change detection of forest cover loss enables forest landowners, government agencies and local communities to monitor natural and anthropogenic disturbances in a much timelier fashion than the thematic maps that are released every year. NRT deforestation alerts enable the establishment of more up-to-date forest inventories and rapid responses to unlicensed logging. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide operational Earth observation (EO) data from multi-spectral optical/near-infrared wavelengths every five days at a global scale and at 10 m resolution. The amount of acquired data requires cloud computing or high-performance computing for ongoing monitoring systems and an automated system for processing, analyzing and delivering the information promptly. Here, we present a Sentinel-2-based NRT change detection system, assess its performance over two study sites, Manantlan in Mexico and Cartagena del Chaird in Colombia, and evaluate the forest changes that occurred in 2018. An independent validation with very high-resolution PlanetScope (similar to 3 m) and RapidEye (similar to 5 m) data suggests that the proposed NRT change detection system can accurately detect forest cover loss (> 87%), other vegetation loss (> 76%) and other vegetation gain (> 71%). Furthermore, the proposed NRT change detection system is designed to be attuned using in situ data. Therefore, it is scalable to larger regions, entire countries and even continents.

TI  - Water Hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) Detection Using Coarse and High Resolution Multispectral Data
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient detection and monitoring procedures of invasive plant species are required. It is of crucial importance to deal with such plants in aquatic ecosystems, since they can affect biodiversity and, ultimately, ecosystem function and services. In this study, it is intended to detect water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) using multispectral data with different spatial resolutions. For this purpose, high-resolution data (<0.1 m) acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and coarse-resolution data (10 m) from Sentinel-2 MSI were used. Three areas with a high incidence of water hyacinth located in the Lower Mondego region (Portugal) were surveyed. Different classifiers were used to perform a pixel-based detection of this invasive species in both datasets. From the different classifiers used, the results were achieved by the random forest classifiers stand-out (overall accuracy (OA): 0.94). On the other hand, support vector machine performed worst (OA: 0.87), followed by Gaussian naive Bayes (OA: 0.88), k-nearest neighbours (OA: 0.90), and artificial neural networks (OA: 0.91). The higher spatial resolution from UAV-based data enabled us to detect small amounts of water hyacinth, which could not be detected in Sentinel-2 data. However, and despite the coarser resolution, satellite data analysis enabled us to identify water hyacinth coverage, compared well with a UAV-based survey. Combining both datasets and even considering the different resolutions, it was possible to observe the temporal and spatial evolution of water hyacinth. This approach proved to be an effective way to assess the effects of the mitigation/control measures taken in the study areas. Thus, this approach can be applied to detect invasive species in aquatic environments and to monitor their changes over time.

TI  - The habitat suitability of Timor friarbird (Philemon inornatus) in Western Timor Island, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Timor friarbird is an endemic bird to Timor Island. The population of this bird has been declining due to land cover changes as a result of massive anthropogenic pressures. This study aimed to assess the suitability of Timor friarbird's habitat by using 12 ecogeographical variables. The sources of data included Sentinel 2A satellite imagery and remote sensing-based algorithms. The bird's presence was analyzed by using a combination of line transect with point count methods. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) model was applied to obtain habitat suitability value as well as coefficient of marginality (M) and specialization (S). These results showed that the Timor friarbird needs a habitat with a different value from the average of the entire habitat. High specialization value indicated that the species has a narrow ecological niche. Factors influencing habitat suitability included the distance from roads, the presence of mangroves, primary and secondary dryland forests, rivers, and low-density settlements. About 75% of the study area is classified as unsuitable habitat, and only 22% is suitable with range classes of suitability from marginal to optimal habitat. Areas with less anthropogenic pressure on the land cover will be preferred more by the bird. Improvement of unsuitable habitat and protection of suitable habitat, therefore, will be the most important strategy for Timor friarbird conservation.

TI  - Influence of Urban Areas on Surface Water Loss in the Contiguous United States
T2  - AGU ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is one of the main drivers of surface water loss, which implies a transition from water to land. However, it is still unclear how urban areas affect the spatial pattern of surface water loss. Here, we use remotely sensed data to analyze and model the decrease of surface water extent and, in particular, the frequency of surface water loss as a function of distance from urban areas across the contiguous United States (CONUS). We employ an exponential distance-decay model that confirms the presence of a higher frequency of surface water loss in the proximity of human settlements and provides innovative insights on surface water loss patterns at different spatial scales (i.e., river basins, water resource regions, and the CONUS). These spatial patterns are found to be influenced by climatic conditions, with more widely distributed losses in arid regions with respect to temperate and continental climates. Our results provide a new and deeper understanding of the spatial influence of urban areas on surface water loss, which could be effectively integrated in the definition of sustainable strategies for urbanization, water management, and surface water restoration, focused on both human and environmental water needs.

AB  - The Coastal Imaging Research Network (CIRN) is an international group of researchers who exploit signatures of phenomena in imagery of coastal, estuarine, and riverine environments. CIRN participants develop and implement new coastal imaging methodologies. The research objective of the group is to use imagery to gain a better fundamental understanding of the processes shaping those environments. Coastal imaging data may also be used to derive inputs for model boundary and initial conditions through assimilation, to validate models, and to make management decisions. CIRN was officially formed in 2016 to provide an integrative, multi-institutional group to collaborate on remotely sensed data techniques. As of 2021, the network is a collaboration between researchers from approximately 16 countries and includes investigators from universities, government laboratories and agencies, non-profits, and private companies. CIRN has a strong emphasis on education, exemplified by hosting annual "boot camps" to teach photogrammetry fundamentals and toolboxes from the CIRN code repository, as well as hosting an annual meeting for its members to present coastal imaging research. In this review article, we provide context for the development of CIRN as well as describe the goals and accomplishments of the CIRN community. We highlight components of CIRN's resources for researchers worldwide including an open-source GitHub repository and coding boot camps. Finally, we provide CIRN's perspective on the future of coastal imaging.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning for Simulation of Air Temperature at Dome A
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dome A is the summit of the Antarctic plateau, where the Chinese Kunlun inland station is located. Due to its unique location and high altitude, Dome A provides an important observatory site in analyzing global climate change. However, before the arrival of the Chinese Antarctic expedition in 2005, near-surface air temperatures had not been recorded in the region. In this study, we used meteorological parameters, such as ice surface temperature, radiation, wind speed, and cloud type, to build a reliable model for air temperature estimation. Three models (linear regression, random forest, and deep neural network) were developed based on various input datasets: seasonal factors, skin temperature, shortwave radiation, cloud type, longwave radiation from AVHRR-X products, and wind speed from MERRA-2 reanalysis data. In situ air temperatures from 2010 to 2015 were used for training, while 2005-2009 and 2016-2020 measurements were used for model validation. The results showed that random forest and deep neural network outperformed the linear regression model. In both methods, the 2005-2009 estimates (average bias = 0.86 degrees C and 1 degrees C) were more accurate than the 2016-2020 values (average bias = 1.04 degrees C and 1.26 degrees C). We conclude that the air temperature at Dome A can be accurately estimated (with an average bias less than 1.3 degrees C and RMSE around 3 degrees C) from meteorological parameters using random forest or a deep neural network.

TI  - Environmental Disasters and Property Values: Evidence from
T2  - LAND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article uses satellite data on real-time active fire locations to evaluate the effect of forest fires on property values in Nepal. Results show that an additional unit increase in fire radiative power from last month's forest fires causes a 0.61% decrease in residential property values. Property values decline by 4.48% for every additional unit increase in the number of forest fire incidents over the past year. These estimates suggest that policy makers should prioritize wildfire-risk awareness and fire-prevention programs in areas with higher levels of declined property values associated with recurring forest fire incidents.

TI  - A Propensity Score Matched Analysis of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide versus Radioisotope Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This Propensity Score Matched Analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and radioisotope sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) in breast cancer (BC) patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). One hundred and twenty-four patients were eligible for final analysis. In the SPIO group, the median of retrieved sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was significantly higher than in the RI group. The SPIO method was associated with a significantly higher chance of retrieving at least three SLNs when compared to the RI method. SPIO-guided SLNB allows efficient retrieval and detection of SLNs in BC patients after NAC when compared to RI. The standard method for nodal staging in breast cancer (BC) patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with a radioisotope (RI) injection. However, SLNB after NAC results in high false-negative rates (FNR), and the RI method is restricted by nuclear medicine unit dependency. These limitations resulted in the development of the superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) method, reducing FNR and presenting a comparable detection rate. This bi-institutional cohort comparison study aimed to assess the efficacy of SPIO and radioisotope SNLB in BC patients after NAC using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis. The study group comprised 508 patients who underwent SLNB after NAC for ycT1-4N0M0 BC between 2013 and 2021 in two high volume centers. Data were retrieved from prospectively conducted databases. In the SPIO group, the median of retrieved sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was significantly higher than in the RI group (3 vs. 2; p < 0.0001). The SPIO method was associated with a significantly higher chance of retrieving at least three lymph nodes when compared to the RI method (71% vs. 11.3%; p < 0.0001). None of the analyzed demographic and clinical variables had a statistically significant influence on the efficacy of SLNs retrieval in the RI group, while in the SPIO group, patients with >= three harvested SLNs had lower weight and decreased BMI. Based on this PSM analysis, SPIO-guided SLNB allowed the efficient retrieval and detection of SLNs in BC patients after NAC compared to RI.

TI  - Shallow Aseismic Slip in the Delaware Basin Determined by Sentinel-1 InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Delaware Basin, Texas is currently a hot-spot of induced seismicity and ground deformation due to fluid extraction and injection associated with horizontal drilling techniques; however, the driving mechanism behind the seismicity and deformation remains under debate. Using vertical and east-west horizontal surface deformation measurements derived from Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), we show that the subsurface responds differently to oil and gas activity in the northern and southeastern portions of the basin. In the north, where there is little seismicity, deformation patterns display long-wavelengths and equidimensional patterns. In contrast, the southeast region hosts most of the seismicity and displays spatial deformation patterns with narrow linear features that strike parallel to the maximum principal horizontal stress and to trends in seismicity, suggesting movement along normal faults. We model a linear deformation feature using edge dislocations and show that the InSAR observations can be reproduced by slip on normal faults contained within the Delaware Mountain Group (DMG), the formation that hosts local wastewater injection and the majority of earthquakes. Our model consists of three parallel, high-angle normal faults, with two dipping toward one another in a graben structure. Slip magnitudes reach up to 25 cm and are spatially correlated with injection wells. Measured seismicity can only explain similar to 2% of the fault motion predicted by our fault model, suggesting that slip leading to the deformation is predominantly aseismic. We conclude that seismic and aseismic fault motion in the southeastern Delaware Basin is likely driven by wastewater injection near critically-stressed normal faults within the DMG.

TI  - Predictive factors of non-sentinel lymph node disease in breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph node
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Management of positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to evaluate the incidence and identify predictive factors of non-sentinel lymph node metastases.Methods: Retrospective review of all cNO breast cancer patients treated between January 2013 and December 2017, with positive SLNB that were submitted to ALND.Results: Of the 328 patients included, the majority of tumors were cT1 or cT2, with lymphovascular invasion in 58.4% of cases. The mean isolated nodes in SLNB was 2.7, with a mean of 1.6 positive nodes, 60.7% with extracapsular extension. Regarding ALND, a mean of 13.9 nodes were isolated, with a mean of 2.1 positive nodes. There was no residual disease in the ALND in 50.9% of patients, with 18.9% having >= four positive nodes. In the multivariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion, extracapsular extension in SLN, largest SLN metastases size (>10 mm) and ratio of positive SNL (> 50%) were independent predictors of non-sentinel lymph node metastases. These four factors were used to build a non-pondered score to predict the probability of a positive ALND after a positive SLNB. The AUC of the model was 0.69 and 81% of patients with score = 0 and 65.6% with score = 1 had no additional disease in ALND.Conclusion: The absence of non-sentinel lymph node metastases in the majority of patients with 1-2 positive SLN with low risk score questions the need of ALND in this population. The identified predictive factors may help select patients in which ALND can be omitted. (C) 2020 AEC. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

TI  - Epidemiology of dementia onset captured in Canadian primary care electronic medical records
T2  - FAMILY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dementia is an increasing concern in many countries, especially in those experiencing rapid growth in the proportion of older adults in their population.Objective: This study aims to describe trends and demographic characteristics of incident dementia cases in community-dwelling older adults managed by primary care physicians.Methods: We used electronic medical records from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network database to conduct a retrospective analysis to determine the number of, and trends for, incident diagnoses of dementia. Age-standardized annual incidence rates were calculated. Participants in our cohort are Canadian community dwelling seniors aged 65+ years who were not diagnosed with dementia before baseline with at least six years of record at their primary care clinics.Results: The cohort consisted of 39 067 patients of whom 57% were females; the mean (SD) follow-up was 8.4 (1.5) years. During follow-up, 4935 patients were diagnosed with dementia. The risk for dementia diagnosis increased with increasing age but decreased in the last four years among people aged 80 and older at baseline (P < 0.001). People with dementia were more likely to be females (P = 0.001) and urban residents (P < 0.001), they are less likely to be classified into the least deprived group (P = 0.012).Conclusions: The incidence of dementia diagnosis increased with age except in the oldest old in both sexes. This may be attributed to the effect of mortality competing risk. Future research on the association between risk factors and dementia should consider studying dementia among the oldest old separately to minimize bias.Lay SummaryDementias are conditions that may cause mental symptoms such as forgetfulness, confusion, or disorientation. As the population gradually ages, the number of dementia cases is also increasing. Among people aged 65 and over, the rate of dementia onset increases as people get older. However, among people aged 85 and over, the rate of developing dementia is slower, which might reflect that people who reach the age of 85 are usually healthier in general. Since family practitioners are normally the first contact when patients and their family notice symptoms, primary care plays an important role in diagnosing and managing dementia. Early recognizing dementia for early support is very helpful. According to our study, health-related information recorded in primary care in Canada is sufficient to be used for research. It is a valuable opportunity to study the characteristics of people with dementia, including their health conditions, risks and protective factors that may contribute to the development of the disease.

TI  - Incidence Estimates of Acute Q Fever and Spotted Fever Group Rickettsioses, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, from 2007 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2014
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Q fever and spotted fever group rickettsioses (SFGR) are common causes of severe febrile illness in northern Tanzania. Incidence estimates are needed to characterize the disease burden. Using hybrid surveillance-coupling case-finding at two referral hospitals and healthcare utilization data-we estimated the incidences of acute Q fever and SFGR in Moshi, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, from 2007 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2014. Cases were defined as fever and a four-fold or greater increase in antibody titers of acute and convalescent paired sera according to the indirect immunofluorescence assay of Coxiella bumetii phase II antigen for acute Q fever and Rickettsia conorii (2007-2008) or Rickettsia africae (2012-2014) antigens for SFGR. Healthcare utilization data were used to adjust for underascertainment of cases by sentinel surveillance. For 2007 to 2008, among 589 febrile participants, 16 (4.7%) of 344 and 27 (8.8%) of 307 participants with paired serology had Q fever and SFGR, respectively. Adjusted annual incidence estimates of Q fever and SFGR were 80 (uncertainty range, 20-454) and 147 (uncertainty range, 52-645) per 100,000 persons, respectively. For 2012 to 2014, among 1,114 febrile participants, 52 (8.1%) and 57 (8.9%) of 641 participants with paired serology had Q fever and SFGR, respectively. Adjusted annual incidence estimates of Q fever and SFGR were 56 (uncertainty range, 24-163) and 75 (uncertainty range, 34-176) per 100,000 persons, respectively. We found substantial incidences of acute Q fever and SFGR in northern Tanzania during both study periods. To our knowledge, these are the first incidence estimates of either disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings suggest that control measures for these infections warrant consideration.

TI  - Ecoregion-wide, multi-sensor biomass mapping highlights a major underestimation of dry forests carbon stocks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests harbor major carbon stocks but are disappearing rapidly across the globe as agriculture expands into them. Unfortunately, carbon emissions from deforestation in dry forests remain poorly understood as high spatial-temporal and vertical heterogeneity complicate biomass mapping. Here, we use a novel Gradient Boosted Regression framework to test the relative gains of combining optical (MODIS) and radar (Sentinel 1) time series, as well as lidar-based (GEDI) canopy-height information, to map biomass in tropical dry forests. We apply our approach across the entire Dry Chaco ecoregion (about 800,000 km2), using an extensive ground dataset of forest inventory plots for training and validation, to map above-ground biomass (AGB) for the year 2019. Our best AGB model had an r2 of 0.89 (RMSE = 15.1 t/ha) with an estimated AGB in remaining natural vegetation of 4.65 Gt (+/- 0.9 Gt). Seasonal metrics from EVI time-series, combined with seasonal Sentinel 1 metrics, had the highest predictive power, while adding GEDI-based canopy height did not improve models. Our resulting AGB maps had a much higher level of agreement with independent ground-data than global AGB products (agreements between r2 = 0.07-0.41), which all suffer from a huge, up to 14-fold, underestimation of AGB in the Chaco. Most of the remaining AGB stored in Chaco woodlands is found in Argentina (2.4 Gt AGB), followed by Paraguay (1.13 Gt AGB) and Bolivia (1.11 Gt AGB). Our results also highlight that 71% of the remaining AGB is located outside protected areas, and around half of the remaining AGB occurs on land utilized by traditional communities. Together, our analyses reveal substantial risk of continued high carbon emissions should agricultural expansion progress. Considerable co-benefits appear to exist between protecting traditional livelihoods and carbon stocks. Our map, the most accurate and fine-scale AGB map for this global deforestation hotspot, can serve as a basis for land-use and conservation planning aimed at leveraging such co-benefits. More broadly, our analyses reveal the considerable potential of combining time series of optical and radar data for a more reliable mapping of above-ground biomass in tropical dry forests and savannas.

TI  - Leveraging Multi-Source Data and Digital Technology to Support the Monitoring of Localized Water Changes in the Mekong Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The limited availability of high-resolution monitoring systems for the drought phenomena and water dynamics affected by weather anomalies hinders policy decisions in a multitude of ways. This paper introduces the availability of the high-resolution Water Monitoring System (WMS) developed from a mix of sophisticated multi-spectral satellite imageries, analytic and data sciences, and cloud computing, for monitoring the changes in water levels and vegetation water stress at the local scale. The WMS was tested in the Lower Mekong Region (LMR) case basin, Thailand's Chi River Basin, in the period from January 2021 to April 2021, the dry season. The overall quality of the VHI, VCI, TCI, and NDVI drought simulation results showed a statistically positive Pearson correlation with the reservoir and dam water volume data (ranged between 0.399 and 0.575) but demonstrated a strong negative correlation with the groundwater level data (between -0.355 and -0.504). Further investigation and more detailed analysis of the influence of different physical environmental conditions related to change in groundwater level should be considered to increase scientific knowledge and understanding about the changing nature of the local system from local perspectives with the alternative use of drought indices in data-poor areas. Our result suggests that the WMS can provide quantitative spatiotemporal variations of localized and contextualized surface water changes as a preliminary analysis. The WMS results can offer guidance for finding a better smaller unit management that suits the local conditions, such as water resource management, disaster risk reduction measures (i.e., drought and flood), irrigation practice, land use planning, and crop management. The existing WMS is geared toward the early warning of water and agricultural development, progress on the SDGs, utilization of digital innovation, and improved abilities of decision-makers to monitor and foresee extreme weather events earlier and with high spatial accuracy.

TI  - Classification of Fire Damage to Boreal Forests of Siberia in 2021 Based on the dNBR Index
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire in Siberia is extensive, affecting up to 15 Mha annually. The proportion of the vegetation affected by severe fires is yet unknown, and it is a problem that requires a solution because post-fire mortality of tree stands in Siberian taiga has a strong effect on the global budget of carbon. The impact of fire in our area of interest in eastern Siberia was analyzed using the normalized burn ratio (NBR) and its pre- versus post-fire difference (dNBR) applied to Landsat-8 (OLI) collected in 2020-2021. In this paper, we present the classification of fire impact in relation to dominant tree stands and vegetation types in boreal forests of eastern Siberia. The dNBR of post-fire plots ranged widely (0.30-0.60) in homogeneous larch (Larix sibirica, L. gmelinii) forests, pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests, dark coniferous stands (Pinus sibirica, Abies sibirica, Picea obovata), sparse larch stands, and Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) stands. We quantified the proportions of low, moderate, and high fire severity (37%, 39%, and 24% of the total area burned, respectively) in dense tree stands, which were varied to 30%, 57%, and 13%, respectively, for sparse stands and tundra vegetation dominated in the north of eastern Siberia. The proportion of severe fires varied according to the transition from dominant larch stands (33.2% of the area burned) to pine (12.6%) and dark coniferous (up to 26.4%). The current proportion of stand-replacement fires in eastern Siberia is 12-33%, depending on vegetation type and tree density, which is about 2500 thousand hectares in 2021 in the region. According to our findings, the "healthy/unburned vegetation" class was quantified as well at least 700 thousand hectares in 2021.

TI  - Systematic Propagation of AVHRR AOD Uncertainties-A Case Study to Demonstrate the FIDUCEO Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The AVHRR aerosol optical depth (AOD) is inverted from measured reflectances in the red band using a statistical correlation of surface reflectance with mid-infrared channel reflectances and a modelling climatology of the aerosol type. For such a sensor not specifically designed for AOD retrieval, propagating uncertainties is crucial because the sensitivity of the retrieved AOD to the measured signal varies largely with retrieval conditions (AOD itself, surface brightness, aerosol optical properties/aerosol type, observing geometry). In order to quantify the different contributions to the AOD uncertainties, we have undertaken a thorough analysis of the retrieval operator and its sensitivities to the used input and auxiliary variables. Uncertainties are then propagated from measured reflectances to geophysical retrieved AOD datasets at the super-pixel level and further to gridded daily and monthly products. The propagation uses uncertainty correlations of separate uncertainty contributions from the FIDUCEO easyFCDR level1b products (common fully correlated, independent random, and structured parts) and estimated uncertainty correlation structures of other major effects in the retrieval (surface brightness, aerosol type ensemble, cloud mask). The pixel-level uncertainties are statistically validated against true error estimates versus AERONET ground-based AOD measurements. It is shown that a 10-year time record over Europe compares well to a merged multi-satellite record and that pixel-level uncertainties provide a meaningful representation of error distributions. The study demonstrates the benefits of new recipes for uncertainty characterization from the Horizon-2020 project FIDUCEO ("Fidelity and uncertainty in climate data records from Earth Observations") and extends them further with recent additions developed within the ESA Climate Change Initiative.

TI  - Remote sensing satellite data and spectral indices: an initial evaluation for the sustainable development of an urban area
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral indices help in modeling, predicting, or infer surface processes. Indices are derived for many different combinations of satellite spectral bands. There are various applications of the satellite indices that are explored in the past studies includes agriculture, water resources, urban development, forest ecology, geology, soil sciences, vegetation, and other applications. In the literature, a few studies have been conducted majorly from the perspective to evaluate/compare/explore Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 images. Spectral, statistical, and the image analysis techniques have been used. However, there has not been any study focusing on Nava Raipur Atal Nagar, India till date. Not many studies have used GIS-based tools even though neither considered the spectral nor spatial consistency of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A data using criteria sets methodology performed as in this work. In the current research, the ensuing indices were derived: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Built-up Index, Bare Soil Index and Built-up Index. The comparative evaluation of the spectral and spatial consistency of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and the correlation coefficients for each pair of indices are derived, and plotted the outcomes with scatter plots. In addition, linear model is compared with several alternative fitting curvilinear models such as Reciprocal-x, Square root-y reciprocal-x, Squared-y reciprocal-x, S-curve model, Squared-y logarithmic-x, Logarithmic-x, Squared-y square root-x, Square root-y logarithmic-x, Square root-x, Squared-y, Double reciprocal, Multiplicative, Double square root, Logarithmic-y square root-x, Square root-y, Double squared, Reciprocal-y logarithmic-x, Exponential, Squared-x, Reciprocal-y square root-x, Square root-y squared-x, Reciprocal-y, Logarithmic-y squared-x, Reciprocal-y squared-x, Logistic, and Log probit. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, Normalized Difference Built-up Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index indices have got the better correlation coefficients of 72.02%, 70%, and 69.81%, and Bare Soil Index takes the minimum at 54.4%. Outcomes establish a good correlation between derived satellite indices of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. Comparing this research to other research in the Indian region with satellite-based indices demonstrates that our model accuracies are significant although the difference between them is low. These data have multiple applications that are essential in sustainable development as much research are focusing attention on indices from multiple sensors and more research is underway. Present paper will come in handy for the initial evaluation for the sustainable development of an urban area.

TI  - Dust cycle and soiling issues affecting solar energy reductions in Australia using multiple datasets
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust plays a vital role in the Earth's climate system and can also modulate solar energy yield from photovoltaics due to soiling and it also impacts concentrated solar power outputs by up to 30%. Research examining decreased energy production on solar panels due to dust accumulation is limited. This is particularly important for dry arid regions of Australia, which are prone to dust storms. Thus, this paper examines the dust characteristics over Australia by comparing two reanalysis products, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) with the satellite data (Himawari-8) to ascertain the capabilities of the reanalysis products in capturing dust cycles over Australia. The results are then used to explore the seasonal variability and trends in the radiative impacts, emissions, and depositions of dust. The energy reductions from seasonal averaged dust accumulations without natural removal or cleaning and later the impact of soiling with removal from precipitation bursts on selected operational solar farms are presented. Results show that MERRA-2 outperforms CAMS in capturing Dust Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) near the Lake Eyre Basin in all seasons, consistent with satellite observations. The radiative trends showed contrasting differences during the Spring and Summer, whereas seasonal dust emissions and depositions peaked at 1.4 gm(-2). Similarly, seasonal dust accumulations without natural removal on panels showed significant reductions in the energy of up to 3% around the Lake Eyre Basin, but most operational solar farms in Australia depicted energy reductions of 8-9% due to accumulated dust of up to 2.5-3 gm(-2), which was naturally removed from regular seasonal rainfall bursts.

TI  - Outcomes of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Primary Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Limited data exist on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the head and neck. OBJECTIVE To review the results of SLNB for patients with cSCC of the head and neck at the authors' institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was completed for patients who underwent SLNB for cSCC of the head and neck over 19 years. Patient demographics, immune status, tumor stage, total patients with positive SLNB, local recurrence, nodal recurrence, in-transit metastasis, and disease-specific death were recorded. RESULTS Sixty patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy, and an SLN was identified in 58 patients. The mean follow-up was 3.2 years (range, 15 days-16 years). Four patients (6.9%) had a positive SLNB. All were Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) stage T2b tumors. Three of these patients were immunosuppressed, 3 patients underwent neck dissection, and 2 patients received adjuvant radiation. None developed local or regional recurrence. Of the 53 patients with a negative SLNB, there were 4 local recurrences, 2 in-transit metastases, and no nodal recurrences. CONCLUSION Immunosuppressed patients with tumors BWH stage T2b or greater may be a reasonable cohort to focus future prospective studies on the utility of SLNB in cSCC of the head and neck.

TI  - Bamboo Forest Mapping in China Using the Dense Landsat 8 Image Archive and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to understand the extent and distribution of bamboo for its valuable ecological services and economic benefits. However, it is challenging to map bamboo using remote sensing images over a large area because of the similarity between bamboo and other vegetation types, the availability of clear optical images, huge workload of image processing, and sample collection. In this study, we use the Landsat 8 times series images archive to map bamboo forests in China via the Google Earth engine. Several spectral indices were calculated and used as classification features, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and textural features of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). We found that the bamboo forest covered an area of 709.92 x 10(4) hectares, with the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang containing the largest area concentrations. The bamboo forest map was accurate and reliable with an average producer's accuracy of 89.97%, user's accuracy of 78.45% and kappa coefficient of 0.7789. In addition, bamboo was mainly distributed in forests with an elevation of 300-1200 m above sea level, average annual precipitation of 1200-1500 mm and average day land surface temperature of 19-25 degrees C. The NDMI is particularly useful in differentiating bamboo from other vegetation because of the clear difference in canopy moisture content, whilst NDVI and elevation are also helpful to improve the bamboo classification accuracy. The bamboo forest map will be helpful for bamboo forest industry planning and could be used for evaluating the ecological service of the bamboo forest.

TI  - Impacts of 319 wind farms on surface temperature and vegetation in the United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of wind energy is essential for decarbonizing energy production. However, the construction of wind farms changes land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation by modifying land surface properties and disturbing land-atmosphere interactions. In this study, we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite data to quantify the impacts on local climate and vegetation of 319 wind farms in the United States. Our results indicated insignificant impacts on LST during the daytime but significant warming of 0.10 degrees C of annual mean nighttime LST averaged over all wind farms, and 0.36 degrees C for those 61% wind farms with warming. The nighttime LST impacts exhibited seasonal variations, with stronger warming in winter and autumn, up to 0.18 degrees C, but weaker effects in summer and spring. We observed a decrease in peak normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for 59% of wind farms due to infrastructure construction, with an average reduction of 0.0067 compared to non-wind farm areas. The impacts of wind farms depended on wind farm size, with winter LST impacts for large and small wind farms ranging from 0.21 degrees C to 0.14 degrees C, and peak NDVI impacts ranging from -0.009 to -0.006. The LST impacts declined with the increasing distance from the wind farm, with detectable impacts up to 10 km. In contrast, the vegetation impacts on NDVI were only evident within the wind farm locations. Wind farms built in grassland and cropland showed larger warming effects but weaker vegetation impact than those built on forests. Furthermore, spatial correlation analyses with environmental factors suggest limited geographical controls on the heterogeneous wind farm impacts and highlight the important role of local factors. Our analyses based on a large sample offer new evidence for wind farm impacts with improved representativeness compared to previous studies. This knowledge is important to fully understand the climatic and environmental implications of energy system decarbonization.

TI  - Automatic and Accurate Extraction of Sea Ice in the Turbid Waters of the Yellow River Estuary Based on Image Spectral and Spatial Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is an important part of the global cryosphere and an important variable in the global climate system. Sea ice also presents one of the major natural disasters in the world. The automatic and accurate extraction of sea ice extent is of great significance for the study of climate change and disaster prevention. The accuracy of sea ice extraction in the Yellow River Estuary is low due to the large dynamic changes in the suspended particulate matter (SPM). In this study, a set of sea ice automatic extraction method systems combining image spectral information and textural information is developed. First, a sea ice spectral information index that can adapt to sea areas with different turbidity levels is developed to mine the spectral information of different types of sea ice. In addition, the image's textural feature parameters and edge point density map are extracted to mine the spatial information concerning the sea ice. Then, multi-scale segmentation is performed on the image. Finally, the OTSU algorithm is used to determine the threshold to achieve automatic sea ice extraction. The method was successfully applied to Gaofen-1 (GF1), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 images, where the extraction accuracy of sea ice was over 93%, which was more than 5% higher than that of SVM and K-Means. At the same time, the method was applied to the Liaodong Bay area, and the extraction accuracy reached 99%. These findings reveal that the method exhibits good reliability and robustness.

TI  - The Role of Remote Sensing Data and Methods in a Modern Approach to Fertilization in Precision Agriculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The precision fertilization system is the basis for upgrading conventional intensive agricultural production, while achieving both high and quality yields and minimizing the negative impacts on the environment. This research aims to present the application of both conventional and modern prediction methods in precision fertilization by integrating agronomic components with the spatial component of interpolation and machine learning. While conventional methods were a cornerstone of soil prediction in the past decades, new challenges to process larger and more complex data have reduced their viability in the present. Their disadvantages of lower prediction accuracy, lack of robustness regarding the properties of input soil sample values and requirements for extensive cost- and time-expensive soil sampling were addressed. Specific conventional (ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighted) and modern machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, decision trees) were evaluated according to their popularity in relevant studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection over the past decade. As a shift towards increased prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, an overview of state-of-the-art remote sensing methods for improving precise fertilization was completed, with the accent on open-data and global satellite missions. State-of-the-art remote sensing techniques allowed hybrid interpolation to predict the sampled data supported by remote sensing data such as high-resolution multispectral, thermal and radar satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imagery in the analyzed studies. The representative overview of conventional and modern approaches to precision fertilization was performed based on 121 samples with phosphorous pentoxide (P2O5) and potassium oxide (K2O) in a common agricultural parcel in Croatia. It visually and quantitatively confirmed the superior prediction accuracy and retained local heterogeneity of the modern approach. The research concludes that remote sensing data and methods have a significant role in improving fertilization in precision agriculture today and will be increasingly important in the future.

TI  - The Joint Assimilation of Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index and Surface Soil Moisture into a Land Surface Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work tests the hypothesis that jointly assimilating satellite observations of leaf area index and surface soil moisture into a land surface model improves the estimation of land vegetation and water variables. An Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to test this hypothesis across the Contiguous United States from April 2015 to December 2018. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed for several modeled vegetation and water variables (evapotranspiration, net ecosystem exchange, and soil moisture) in terms of random errors and anomaly correlation coefficients against a set of independent validation datasets (i.e., Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model, FLUXCOM, and International Soil Moisture Network). The results show that the assimilation of the leaf area index mostly improves the estimation of evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange, whereas the assimilation of surface soil moisture alone improves surface soil moisture content, especially in the western US, in terms of both root mean squared error and anomaly correlation coefficient. The joint assimilation of vegetation and soil moisture information combines the results of individual vegetation and soil moisture assimilations and reduces errors (and increases correlations with the reference datasets) in evapotranspiration, net ecosystem exchange, and surface soil moisture simulated by the land surface model. However, because soil moisture satellite observations only provide information on the water content in the top 5 cm of the soil column, the impact of the proposed data assimilation technique on root zone soil moisture is limited. This work moves one step forward in the direction of improving our estimation and understanding of land surface interactions using a multivariate data assimilation approach, which can be particularly useful in regions of the world where ground observations are sparse or missing altogether.

TI  - Assessment and Prediction of Sea Level Trend in the South Pacific Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise is an important and topical issue in the South Pacific region and needs an urgent assessment of trends for informed decision making. This paper presents mean sea level trend assessment using harmonic analysis and a hybrid deep learning (DL) model based on the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) technique, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA) to build a highly accurate sea level forecasting model for three small islands (Fiji, Marshall Island and Papua New Guinea (PNG)) in the South Pacific. For a 20-year period, the estimated mean sea level rise per year from the harmonic computation is obtained: 112 mm for PNG, 98 mm for Marshall Island and 52 mm for Fiji. The DL procedure uses climate and environment-based remote sensing satellite (MODIS, GLDAS-2.0, MODIS TERRA, MERRA-2) predictor variables with tide gauge base mean sea level (MSL) data for model training and development for forecasting. The developed CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU as the objective model is benchmarked by comparison to the hybrid model without data decomposition, CNN-GRU and standalone models, Decision Trees (DT) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). All model performances are evaluated using reliable statistical metrics. The CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU shows superior accuracy when compared with other standalone and hybrid models. It shows an accuracy of >96% for correlation coefficient and an error of <1% for all study sites.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) of the terrain is the result of thermal energy received from the sun as the source. The study site was Trichy district of Tamil Nadu state in India wherein the LST values pertaining to all the belonging pixels have been calculated using generalized split window (GSW) algorithm from the Landsat-8 satellite images on two different dates with a gap of 5 years between them. Along with the LST calculation on these 2 dates, corresponding NDWI, NDVI, NDBI, NDMI, BSI, DBI, DBSI, LSE, and albedo values have also been calculated. Then, changes in the dependent variable (LST) and in the each of the respective explanatory or independent variables have been undergone through the process of multiple linear and non-linear regression analysis to find out the best-fitting model set of explanatory variables that best describes the variation in LST values at a location. In this research, it has been found that a non-linear model set comprising five independent variables like change in BSI, LSE, NDWI, NDBI, and albedo seem to be the best-fitting model for predicting the variations in the dependent variable to the maximum degree and also with acceptable redundancy. Also, it has been observed that changes in LSE or albedo values at any place within the study-site could play the most significant role in having an influence in the LST value change that could be recorded in the same over any given time period, thus proving the vastness of the effect that could be made by an increase in urbanization or structural development on the extent of positive change in LST.

TI  - Multi-Hazard Susceptibility Assessment Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process and Frequency Ratio Techniques in the Northwest Himalayas, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, natural hazards have become more destructive in recent times because of rapid urban development and exposure. Consequently, significant human life loss, the damage to property and infrastructure, and the collapse of the environment directed the attention of geoscientists to control the consequences and risk management in relation to geo-hazards. In this research, an effort was made to produce a compound map, geo-visualizing the susceptibility of multi-hazards, to select suitable sites for sustainable future development and other economic activities in the region. Muzaffarabad District was chosen as a case research area due to the high magnitude of hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. On the one hand, both selected geo-hazard inventories were developed using the field survey and remote sensing data. The subjective and objective weight of all the causative factors and their classes were calculated using the assembled geospatial techniques, such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Frequency Ratio (FR) in the Geographic Information System (GIS). The results reveal that the most suitable areas are distributed in the southern and northwestern parts, which can be used for future sustainable development and other economic activities. In contrast, the eastern and western regions, including Muzaffarabad City, are within high and very susceptibility zones. Finally, more than 50% of the land area is located in very low and low susceptibility zones. The validation of the proposed model was checked by using three different techniques: the Receiver Operative Characteristic (ROC) curve, Seed Cell Area Index (SCAI), and Frequency Ratio (FR). Both ROCs, the Success Rate Curve (SRC) and the Predictive Rate Curve (PRC), showed the goodness of fit for both the selected geo-hazards: landslides (81.3%) and floods (93.2%), at 80.1% and 91.7%, respectively. All the validation techniques showed good fitness for both the individual and multi-hazard maps. The proposed model sets a baseline for policy implementation for all the stakeholders to minimize the risk and sustainable future development in areas of high frequent geo-hazards.

TI  - Smallholder Crop Type Mapping and Rotation Monitoring in Mountainous Areas with Sentinel-1/2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop type mapping and rotation monitoring play a critical role in crop yield estimation, soil management, and food supplies. To date, to our knowledge, accurate mapping of crop types remains challenging due to the intra-class variability of crops and labyrinthine natural conditions. The challenge is further complicated for smallholder farming systems in mountainous areas where field sizes are small and crop types are very diverse. This bottleneck issue makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to use remote sensing in monitoring crop rotation, a desired and required farm management policy in parts of China. This study integrated Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for crop type mapping and rotation monitoring in Inner Mongolia, China, with an extensive field-based survey dataset. We accomplished this work on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results indicated that most crop types were mapped fairly accurately with an F1-score around 0.9 and a clear separation of crop types from one another. Sentinel-1 polarization achieved a better performance in wheat and rapeseed classification among different feature combinations, and Sentinel-2 spectral bands exhibited superiority in soybean and corn identification. Using the accurate crop type classification results, we identified crop fields, changed or unchanged, from 2017 to 2018. These findings suggest that the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 proved effective in crop type mapping and crop rotation monitoring of smallholder farms in labyrinthine mountain areas, allowing practical monitoring of crop rotations.

TI  - Performance of Cloud 3D Solvers in Ice Cloud Shortwave Radiation Closure Over the Equatorial Western Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - For retrieving cloud optical properties from satellite images or computing these properties from climate model output, computationally efficient treatments of cloud horizontal inhomogeneity include the Monte Carlo Independent Column Approximation (McICA) and the Tripleclouds method. Computationally efficient treatment of cloud horizontal radiation exchanges includes the SPeedy Algorithm for Radiative TrAnsfer through CloUd Sides (SPARTACUS). As a test to derive properties from satellite images, we collocate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud retrievals with near-nadir Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) footprints in July 2008 over an equatorial western Pacific Ocean region to compare the performance of the McICA, Tripleclouds, and SPARTACUS solvers to the conventional plane-parallel homogeneous (PPH) treatment. PPH overestimates cloud albedo, and the three solvers effectively reduce overestimation with root mean square error of shortwave upwelling irradiance decreasing between 15.72 and 18.53 W m(-2), or about 22%-25%. Although cloud top variability does not get fed into the simulations, all three solvers also reduce the effect of cloud top variability on cloud albedo. Entrapment (energy reflected downward from clouds) and horizontal radiation transfer have opposite effects on the SPARTACUS cloud albedo simulation. The net effect depends on the cloud vertical extent, the unawareness of which limits the performance of the SPARTACUS solver.

TI  - Effects of Climate Change on Vegetation Growth in the Yellow River Basin from 2000 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A changing climate has been posing significant impacts on vegetation growth, especially in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) where agriculture and ecosystems are extremely vulnerable. In this study, the data for normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors and climate data (precipitation and temperature) derived from the national meteorological stations were employed to examine the spatiotemporal differences in vegetation growth and its reaction to climate changes in the YRB from 2000-2019, using several sophisticated statistical methods. The results showed that both NDVI and climatic variables exhibited overall increasing trends during this period, and positive correlations at different significant levels were found between temperature/precipitation and NDVI. Furthermore, NDVI in spring had the strongest response to temperature/precipitation, and the correlation coefficient of NDVI with temperature and precipitation was 0.485 and 0.726, respectively. However, an opposite situation was detected in autumn (September to November) since NDVIs exhibited the weakest responses to temperatures/precipitation, and the NDVI's correlation with both temperature and precipitation was 0.13. This indicated that, compared to other seasons, increasing the temperature and precipitation has the most significant effect on NDVI in spring (March to May). Except for a few places in the northern, southern, and southwestern regions of the YRB, NDVI was positively correlated with precipitation in most areas. There was an inverse relationship between NDVI and temperature in most parts of the central YRB, especially in summer (June to August) and growing season (May to September); however, there was a positive correlation in most areas of the YRB in spring. Finally, continuous attention must be given to the influence of other factors in the YRB.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing Tools to Assess the Land Use and Land Cover Change in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change has become an important research topic for global environmental change and sustainable development. As an important part of worldwide land conservation, sustainable development and management of water resources, developing countries must ensure the use of innovative technology and tools that support their various decision making systems. This study provides the most recent LULC change analysis for the last six years (2015-2021) of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, one of the most important petrochemical cities in the world and host of the ongoing Interoceanic Corridor project. The analysis was carried out using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images, ancillary data and ground-based surveys and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify and to ameliorate the discrimination between four main macro-classes and fourteen classes. The LULC classification was performed using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) to produce maps for each year, as it was found to be the best approach when compared to minimum distance (MDM) and spectral angle mapping (SAM) methods. The macro-classes were water, built-up, vegetation and bare soil, whereas the classes were an improved classification within those. Our study achieved both user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) above 90% for the proposed macro-classes and classes. The average Kappa coefficient for macro-classes was 0.93, while for classes it was 0.96, both comparable to previous studies. The results from the LULC analysis show that residential, industry and commercial areas slowed down their growth throughout the study period. These changes were associated with socio-economical drivers such as insecurity and lack of economic investments. Groves and trees presented steady behaviors, with small increments during the five-year period. Swamps, on the other hand, significantly degraded, being about 2% of the study area in 2015 and 0.93% in 2021. Dunes and medium and high vegetation densities (& SIM;80%) transitioned mostly to low vegetation densities. This behavior is associated with rainfall below the annual reference and increments of surface runoff due to the loss of vegetation cover. Lastly, the present study seeks to highlight the importance of remote sensing for a better understanding of the dynamics between human-nature interactions and to provide information to assist planners and decision-makers for more sustainable land development.

TI  - Atmospheric precipitable water vapor over Iran using MODIS products: climatology and intercomparison
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a statistical evaluation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric precipitable water vapor (PWV) products over Iran. Long-term level 3 monthly (2003-2020) and level 2 daily (January 2004 and July 2008) MODIS PWV data were compared with ERA5 as the latest ECMWF re-analysis and radiosonde data sets, respectively. Among the factors that are causing errors in the MODIS retrieval PWV value, the effect of weather conditions including cloudiness and aerosols is investigated. On a monthly scale, our analysis shows that the Cloud Fraction (CF) and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) have a strong relationship with the distribution of MODIS percentage errors (compared to ERA5), especially during the summer season. However, the average annual PWV values from MODIS and ERA5 are close to each other (13 and 13.3 mm, respectively). In addition, the MODIS PWV data have a significant negative correlation coefficient with the topography data. This suggests that MODIS level-3 monthly PWV data are valuable to calculate the monthly long-term climatology of PWV over Iran. On a daily scale, the comparison was carried out in two different weather conditions. Results show that in a clear sky with high visibility (despite the time lag between two data sets), MODIS and radiosonde PWV have a close relationship (R-2 = 0.73 in July 2008), while R-2 is reduced significantly during cloudy conditions with low visibility (lower than 10 KM) in all stations (R-2 = 0.05 in July 2008). These results confirm that the accuracy of the MODIS PWV data is strongly dependent on weather conditions, both in summer and winter time.

TI  - Macrophage-Specific MCPIP1/Regnase-1 Attenuates Kidney Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Shaping the Local Inflammatory Response and Tissue Regeneration
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sterile inflammation either resolves the initial insult or leads to tissue damage. Kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is associated with neutrophilic infiltration, enhanced production of inflammatory mediators, accumulation of necrotic cells and tissue remodeling. Macrophage-dependent microenvironmental changes orchestrate many features of the immune response and tissue regeneration. The activation status of macrophages is influenced by extracellular signals, the duration and intensity of the stimulation, as well as various regulatory molecules. The role of macrophage-derived monocyte chemoattractant protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1), also known as Regnase-1, in kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and recovery from sterile inflammation remains unresolved. In this study, we showed that macrophage-specific Mcpip1 deletion significantly affects the kidney phenotype. Macrophage-specific Mcpip1 transgenic mice displayed enhanced inflammation and loss of the tubular compartment upon IRI. We showed that MCPIP1 modulates sterile inflammation by negative regulation of Irf4 expression and accumulation of IRF4+ cells in the tissue and, consequently, suppresses the post-ischemic kidney immune response. Thus, we identified MCPIP1 as an important molecular sentinel of immune homeostasis in experimental acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal fibrosis.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network on Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Images for Urban Flood Potential Mapping in Jakarta
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding in urban areas is counted as a significant disaster that must be correctly mitigated due to the huge amount of affected people, material losses, hampered economic activity, and flood-related diseases. One of the technologies available for disaster mitigation and prevention is satellites providing image data on previously flooded areas. In most cases, floods occur in conjunction with heavy rain. Thus, from a satellite's optical sensor, the flood area is mostly covered with clouds which indicates ineffective observation. One solution to this problem is to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors by observing backscatter differences before and after flood events. This research proposes mapping the flood-prone areas using machine learning to classify the areas using the 3D CNN method. The method was applied on a combination of co-polarized and cross-polarized SAR multi-temporal image datasets covering Jakarta City and the coastal area of Bekasi Regency. Testing with multiple combinations of training/testing data proportion split and a different number of epochs gave the optimum performance at an 80/20 split with 150 epochs achieving an overall accuracy of 0.71 after training in 283 min.

TI  - Comparing Clinician Consensus Recommendations to Patient-reported Opioid Use Across Multiple Hospital Systems
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: : We compare consensus recommendations for 5 surgical procedures to prospectively collected patient consumption data. To address local variation, we combined data from multiple hospitals across the country. Summary of Background Data: One approach to address the opioid epidemic has been to create prescribing consensus reports for common surgical procedures. However, it is unclear how these guidelines compare to patient-reported data from multiple hospital systems. Methods: Prospective observational studies of surgery patients were completed between 3/2017 and 12/2018. Data were collected utilizing post-discharge surveys and chart reviews from 5 hospitals (representing 3 hospital systems) in 5 states across the USA. Prescribing recommendations for 5 common surgical procedures identified in 2 recent consensus reports were compared to the prospectively collected aggregated data. Surgeries included: laparoscopic cholecystectomy, open inguinal hernia repair, laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, partial mastectomy without sentinel lymph node biopsy, and partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Results: Eight hundred forty-seven opioid-naive patients who underwent 1 of the 5 studied procedures reported counts of unused opioid pills after discharge. Forty-one percent did not take any opioid medications, and across all surgeries, the median consumption was 3 5 mg oxycodone pills or less. Generally, consensus reports recommended opioid quantities that were greater than the 75th percentile of consumption, and for 2 procedures, recommendations exceeded the 90th percentile of consumption. Conclusions: Although consensus recommendations were an important first step to address opioid prescribing, our data suggests that following these recommendations would result in 47%-56% of pills prescribed remaining unused. Future multi-institutional efforts should be directed toward refining and personalizing prescribing recommendations.

TI  - Unique characteristics of ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in Sundarban mangrove forest and their relationship with environmental factors
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sundarban mangroves, known to be the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest globally, covers a significant portion of the world's mangroves and contributes substantially to the global mangrove carbon budget. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of long-term continuous monitoring of CO2 fluxes over this crucial ecosystem and their dynamics in response to climatic variations. This study presents the carbon balance and seasonal dynamics of this oldest and undisturbed mangrove ecosystem using quasi-continuous eddy covariance measurements from April 2012 to March 2016. These tidal forests are found to be net C sink with a mean net primary production (NEP) of 276 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (+/- 35; +/- 1 Standard deviation amongst the four years). The NEP is partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration indicate gross sequestration of 1581 (+/- 152) g C m(-2) yr(-1) with a respiratory loss of 1305 (+/- 184) g C m(-2) yr(-1). We have observed that inter- and intra-annual variations in CO2 fluxes are primarily controlled by environmental factors such as temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), rainfall and photosynthetic active radiation. At the study site, the photosynthetic activity and light use efficiency decreased with an increase in temperature and VPD. Though minimal seasonal fluctuations in CO2 fluxes were observed, a strong linkage has been observed between C fluxes and satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (MODIS EVI) during the study period. Further, the carbon assimilation rates were found to be higher under diffused sky than normal conditions due to the increased photosynthetic activity by penetration of diffused radiation within the mangrove canopies. Additionally, ecosystem productivity during the study period was higher during the wet periods than dry periods. Our findings show that ecosystem productivity rates are strongly related to temperature, vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, and radiation, implying that global warming could have a significant impact on these environmental factors and other underlying parameters (such as salinity, tidal inundation patterns etc.) and potentially reduce the C sequestration potential of these tropical mangroves of India.

TI  - Active Fire Detection from Landsat-8 Imagery Using Deep Multiple Kernel Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active fires are devastating natural disasters that cause socio-economical damage across the globe. The detection and mapping of these disasters require efficient tools, scientific methods, and reliable observations. Satellite images have been widely used for active fire detection (AFD) during the past years due to their nearly global coverage. However, accurate AFD and mapping in satellite imagery is still a challenging task in the remote sensing community, which mainly uses traditional methods. Deep learning (DL) methods have recently yielded outstanding results in remote sensing applications. Nevertheless, less attention has been given to them for AFD in satellite imagery. This study presented a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) "MultiScale-Net" for AFD in Landsat-8 datasets at the pixel level. The proposed network had two main characteristics: (1) several convolution kernels with multiple sizes, and (2) dilated convolution layers (DCLs) with various dilation rates. Moreover, this paper suggested an innovative Active Fire Index (AFI) for AFD. AFI was added to the network inputs consisting of the SWIR2, SWIR1, and Blue bands to improve the performance of the MultiScale-Net. In an ablation analysis, three different scenarios were designed for multi-size kernels, dilation rates, and input variables individually, resulting in 27 distinct models. The quantitative results indicated that the model with AFI-SWIR2-SWIR1-Blue as the input variables, using multiple kernels of sizes 3 x 3, 5 x 5, and 7 x 7 simultaneously, and a dilation rate of 2, achieved the highest F1-score and IoU of 91.62% and 84.54%, respectively. Stacking AFI with the three Landsat-8 bands led to fewer false negative (FN) pixels. Furthermore, our qualitative assessment revealed that these models could detect single fire pixels detached from the large fire zones by taking advantage of multi-size kernels. Overall, the MultiScale-Net met expectations in detecting fires of varying sizes and shapes over challenging test samples.

TI  - Dynamics of Land and Water Resources and Utilization of Cultivated Land in the Yellow River Beach Area of China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Image analysis of the Yellow River beach area since 1987 provided land use and water body patterns to support effective agricultural and environmental management. Landsat and Sentinel-2A/B images, and data from the Third National Land Survey, were used to examine the water body and land use patterns. The continuous beach land since 1987 was calculated from annual vegetation and water body indexes while that of cultivated land was extracted from the Third National Land Survey. Object-Oriented Feature Extraction was used to extract staple crops. The results showed that 58.26% of the beach area was cultivated land. Continuous beach land covered an area of 1630.98 km(2) and was consisted of scattered patches that were unevenly distributed between the north and south banks of the Yellow River. The staple crop types in the beach area, winter wheat and summer corn accounted for 72.37% and 68.03% of the total cultivated land. Affected by the strategy on the Yellow River basin in China, as the ecological space and protection continue to increase, this study provides basic scientific references for the correct use of cultivated land resources and protection of the balance of soil and water resources dynamic utilization and balance of cultivated land protection and ecological protection.

TI  - Detection of Invasive Black Locust (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>) in Small Woody Features Using Spatiotemporal Compositing of Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recognition of invasive species and their distribution is key for managing and protecting native species within both natural and man-made ecosystems. Small woody features (SWF) represent fragmented patches or narrow linear tree features that are of high importance in intensively utilized agricultural landscapes. Simultaneously, they frequently serve as expansion pathways for invasive species such as black locust. In this study, Sentinel-2 products, combined with spatiotemporal compositing approaches, are used to address the challenge of broad area black locust mapping at a high granularity. This is accomplished by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the classification performance of various compositing approaches and multitemporal classification settings throughout four vegetation seasons. The annual, seasonal (bi-monthly), and monthly median values of cloud-masked Sentinel-2 reflectance products are aggregated and stacked into varied time-series datasets per given year. The random forest algorithm is trained and output classification maps validated based on field-based reference datasets across Danubian lowlands (Slovakia). The main results of the study proved the usefulness of spatiotemporal compositing of Sentinel-2 products for mapping black locust in small woody features across wide area. In particular, temporally aggregated monthly composites stacked to seasonal time series datasets yielded consistently high overall accuracies ranging from 89.10% to 91.47% with balanced producer's and user's accuracies for each year's annual series. We presume that a similar approach could be used for a broader scale species distribution mapping, assuming they are spectrally or phenologically distinctive, as is often the case for many invasive species.

TI  - Incorporating Aleatoric Uncertainties in Lake Ice Mapping Using RADARSAT-2 SAR Images and CNNs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing availability of SAR imagery in recent years, more research is being conducted using deep learning (DL) for the classification of ice and open water; however, ice and open water classification using conventional DL methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is not yet accurate enough to replace manual analysis for operational ice chart mapping. Understanding the uncertainties associated with CNN model predictions can help to quantify errors and, therefore, guide efforts on potential enhancements using more-advanced DL models and/or synergistic approaches. This paper evaluates an approach for estimating the aleatoric uncertainty [a measure used to identify the noise inherent in data] of CNN probabilities to map ice and open water with a custom loss function applied to RADARSAT-2 HH and HV observations. The images were acquired during the 2014 ice season of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, two of the five Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. Operational image analysis charts from the Canadian Ice Service (CIS), which are based on visual interpretation of SAR imagery, are used to provide training and testing labels for the CNN model and to evaluate the accuracy of the model predictions. Bathymetry, as a variable that has an impact on the ice regime of lakes, was also incorporated during model training in supplementary experiments. Adding aleatoric loss and bathymetry information improved the accuracy of mapping water and ice. Results are evaluated quantitatively (accuracy metrics) and qualitatively (visual comparisons). Ice and open water scores were improved in some sections of the lakes by using aleatoric loss and including bathymetry. In Lake Erie, the ice score was improved by similar to 2 on average in the shallow near-shore zone as a result of better mapping of dark ice (low backscatter) in the western basin. As for Lake Ontario, the open water score was improved by similar to 6 on average in the deepest profundal off-shore zone.

AB  - Each year more than 20,000 hectares of forest are destroyed by fire in Algeria. Fires are costly in terms of human lives and property. The objective of the present work is to establish a forest fire risk map focused on the Sdamas Chergui state forest (Wilaya of Tiaret) through the application of the model established by Dagorne et al (1994), which consists in calculating the risk index of sensitivity to forest fires. Through a practical case, we tried to show that GIS combined with data from the LANDSAT earth observation satellite are effective and constantly evolving management tools for characterising forest areas at risk of fire.

TI  - An Investigation on the Morphological and Mineralogical Characteristics of Posidonius Floor Fractured Lunar Impact Crater Using Lunar Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lunar floor-fractured craters (FFCs) are a distinguished type of crater found on the surface of the Moon with radial, concentric, and/or polygonal fractures. In the present study, we selected the Posidonius FCC to explore the mineralogy, morphology and tectonic characteristics using remote sensing datasets. The Posidonius crater is vested with a wide moat of lava separating the crater rim inner wall terraces from the fractured central floor. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's (LRO) images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used to map the tectonics and morphology of the present study. The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M-3) data of Chandrayaan-1 were used to investigate the mineralogy of the region through specified techniques such as integrated band depth, band composite and spectral characterization. The detailed mineralogical analysis indicates the noritic-rich materials in one massif among four central peak rings and confirm intrusion (mafic pluton). Spectral analysis from the fresh crater of the Posidonius moat mare unit indicates clinopyroxene pigeonite in nature. Integrated studies of the mineralogy, morphology and tectonics revealed that the study region belongs to the Class-III category of FFCs. The lithospheric loading by adjacent volcanic load (Serenitatis basin) generates a stress state and distribution of the fracture system.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in High-Grade Endometrial Cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is becoming an acceptable alternative to full lymphadenectomy for evaluating lymphatic spread in clinical stage I endometrial cancer (EC). While the assessment of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes is part of the surgical staging of EC, there is a long-standing debate over the therapeutic value of full lymphadenectomy in this setting. Although lymphadenectomy offers critical information on lymphatic spread and prognosis, most patients will not derive oncologic benefit from this procedure as the majority of patients do not have lymph node involvement. SLN mapping offers prognostic information while simultaneously avoiding the morbidity associated with an extensive and often unnecessary lymphadenectomy. A key factor in the decision making when planning for EC surgery is the histologic subtype. Since the risk of lymphatic spread is less than 5% in low-grade EC, these patients might not benefit from lymph node assessment. Nonetheless, in high-grade EC, the risk for lymph node metastases is much higher (20-30%); therefore, it is crucial to determine the spread of disease both for determining prognosis and for tailoring the appropriate adjuvant treatment. Studies on the accuracy of SLN mapping in high-grade EC have shown a detection rate of over 90%. The available evidence supports adopting the SLN approach as an accurate method for surgical staging. However, there is a paucity of prospective data on the long-term oncologic outcome for patients undergoing SLN mapping in high-grade EC, and more trials are warranted to answer this question.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Perspective on Mass Wasting in Contrasting Planetary Environments: Cases of the Moon and Ceres
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass wasting, as one of the most significant geomorphological processes, contributes immensely to planetary landscape evolution. The frequency and diversity of mass wasting features on any planetary body also put engineering constraints on its robotic exploration. Mass wasting on other Solar System bodies shares similar, although not identical, morphological characteristics with its terrestrial counterpart, indicating a possible common nature for their formation. Thus, planetary bodies with contrasting environmental conditions might help reveal the effects of the atmosphere, subsurface fluids, mass accumulation/precipitation, and seismicity on mass wasting, and vice versa. Their relative positions within our Solar System and the environmental and geophysical conditions on the Moon and the dwarf planet Ceres are not only extremely different from Earth's but from each other too. Their smaller sizes coupled with the availability of global-scale remote sensing datasets make them ideal candidates to understand mass wasting processes in widely contrasting planetary environments. Through this concept article, we highlight several recent advances in and prospects of using remote sensing datasets to reveal unprecedented details on lunar and Cerean mass wasting processes. We start with briefly discussing several recent studies on mass wasting using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) data for the Moon and Dawn spacecraft data for Ceres. We further identify the prospects of available remote sensing data in advancing our understanding of mass wasting processes under reduced gravity and in a scant (or absent) atmosphere, and we conclude the article by suggesting future research directions.

TI  - Effects of Surface Wave Breaking Caused by Internal Solitary Waves in SAR Altimeter: Sentinel-3 Copernicus Products and Advanced New Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We address surface wave breaking caused by oceanic Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) and how ISWs are manifested in the SAR altimeter onboard Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites by means of their effects in Significant Wave Height (SWH). Two different regions of the ocean are selected, namely the tropical Atlantic Ocean off the Amazon shelf and the Banda Sea in the Indian Ocean, where there are scenes of Sentinel-3 OLCI acquired simultaneously with an along-track SAR mode altimeter, which include signatures of large amplitude ISWs. New data of unfocused SAR (UF-SAR 20 Hz) and fully focused SAR (FF-SAR 160 Hz) modes are analyzed, which are retracked in full range and over a reduced range of bins (truncation carried out dynamically ten gates away from the estimated epoch position). At first order, in scales of 1-3 km, a strong decrease in the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) over the rough part of the ISWs is observed followed by a small increase in the smooth part relative to the unperturbed ocean background. A second order ISW signature, in scales of 20 km, is noted: the SWH is attenuated after the passage of an ISW, considering length scales of about 10 km before and after the ISW crest. The SWH signatures are unique in showing that the surface wave energy does not return to its unperturbed level after the passage of an ISW, admittedly because intense meter-scale wave breaking results in surface wave energy dissipation. Furthermore, Sentinel-2 MSI images are analyzed and provide insights into this same phenomenon: white-capping resulting in a radiance increase at all (visible) wavelengths. Modulation of breaking waves owing to ISWs is demonstrated by estimates of the fraction of breaking waves in the presence of internal waves.

TI  - Understanding Haze: Modeling Size-Resolved Mineral Aerosol from Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral dust aerosols are composed of a complex mixture of silicates, carbonates, oxides, and sulfates. The minerals' chemical composition and size distribution are vital parameters to evaluate dust environmental impacts. However, the quantification of minerals remains a challenge due to the sparse in situ measurements of dust samples. Here we derive the size-resolved mineralogical composition of airborne dust aerosols from MODIS (Terra and Aqua) satellite-acquired optical measurements and compare it with chemically analyzed elemental (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg) concentrations of aerosols for PM2.5 and PM10 from Chonburi, Chiang Rai, and Bangkok in Thailand, and from Singapore. MODIS-derived mineral retrievals exhibited high correlations with elemental concentrations with R-2 >= 0.84 for PM2.5 and >= 0.96 for PM10. High mineral dust activity was detected in the vicinity of biomass-burning areas with gypsum and calcite exhibiting tracer characteristics of combustion. The spatiotemporal pattern of the MODIS-derived minerals matched with Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-derived dust, sulfates, and carbonaceous aerosols, indicating the model's consistency. Variation in aerosol loading by +/- 90% led to deviation in the mineral concentration by <10%. An uncertainty of 6.4% between AERONET-measured and MODIS-derived AOD corresponds to a < +/- 2% uncertainty in MODIS-derived mineral concentration, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

TI  - Mapping Ecological Focus Areas within the EU CAP Controls Framework by Copernicus Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Greening is a Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidy that ensures that all EU farmers receiving income support produce climate and environmental benefits as part of their farming activities. To receive greening support, it is mandatory for the farmer to carry out three agricultural practices that are considered environmentally and climate friendly: (a) crop diversification; (b) maintenance of permanent meadows and pastures; and (c) presence of an Ecological Focus Area (EFA). Contributions are delivered and monitored by paying agencies (PP) that ordinarily perform administrative checks and spot checks. The latter are provided through photo-interpretation of high-resolution satellite or aerial images and, in specific cases, through local ground checks (GC) as well. In this work, stimulated by the Piemonte Regional Agency for Payments in Agriculture (ARPEA), a prototype service to support PPs' controls within the greening CAP framework was proposed with special concern for EFA detection. The proposed approach is expected to represent a valid alternative or supporting tool for GC. It relies on the analysis of NDVI time series derived from Copernicus Sentinel-2 data. The study was conducted in the provinces of Turin, Asti and Vercelli within the Piedmont Region (NW Italy), and over 12,500 EFA fields were assessed. Since the recent National Report No. 5465 stipulates that mowing and any other soil management operation is prohibited on set-aside land designated as an EFA during the reference period (RP) between 1st March and 30th June, a time series (TS) of NDVI in the same period was generated. Once averaged at plot level, NDVI trends were modelled by a first-order polynomial, and the correspondent statistics (namely, R-2, MAE and maximum residual) was computed. These were assumed to play the role of discriminants in EFA detection based on a thresholding approach (Otsu's method), calibrated with reference to the training dataset. The threshold satisfaction was therefore tested, and, depending on the number of satisfied thresholds out of the possible three, EFA and non-EFA plots were detected with a different degree of reliability. The correspondent EFA map was generated for the area of interest and validated according to GCs as provided by the ARPEA. The results showed an overall accuracy of 84%, indicating that the approach is promising. The authors retain that this procedure represents a valid alternative (or integrating) tool for ground controls by PPs.

TI  - Dataset of five years of <i>in situ</i> and satellite derived chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations and its spatiotemporal variability in the Rotorua Te Arawa Lakes, New Zealand
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Horizontal patchiness of water quality attributes in lakes substantially influences the ability to accurately determine an average condition of a lake from traditional in situ sampling. Monitoring programmes for lake water quality often rely on water samples from one or few locations but the assumption of representativeness is seldomly tested. Satellite observations can support environmental monitoring by detecting horizontal variability of water quality attributes over entire lakes. This article is a co-submission with Lehmann et al. (2021), who present a method to create a regional calibration of a satellite chlorophyll a algorithm and a spatial analysis of an image time series to detect recurring patchiness. Our method was developed on 13 lakes in the central North Island of New Zealand and this publication makes available the data used in our analysis and the spatial fields of results. These data are immediately valuable for practitioners operating within the region of interest providing a five year archive of synoptic water quality data and spatial fields to help optimize in situ monitoring effort s. In addition, there is value to the wider scientific community as the study lakes are a useful 'natural lab' for the development of aquatic remote sensing methods due to the range of trophic conditions and water colour in a single satellite image scene. Together with decades of in situ water quality records, our data is therefore useful for the development and validation of widely applicable methods of water quality retrieval from satellite data.

TI  - Mapping grassland mowing events across Germany based on combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit knowledge on grassland extent and management is critical to understand and monitor the impact of grassland use intensity on ecosystem services and biodiversity. While regional studies allow detailed insights into land use and ecosystem service interactions, information on a national scale can aid biodiversity assessments. However, for most European countries this information is not yet widely available. We used an analysis-ready-data cube that contains dense time series of co-registered Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, covering the extent of Germany. We propose an algorithm that detects mowing events in the time series based on residuals from an assumed undisturbed phenology, as an indicator of grassland use intensity. A self-adaptive ruleset enabled to account for regional variations in land surface phenology and non-stationary time series on a pixelbasis. We mapped mowing events for the years from 2017 to 2020 for permanent grassland areas in Germany. The results were validated on a pixel level in four of the main natural regions in Germany based on reported mowing events for a total of 92 (2018) and 78 (2019) grassland parcels. Results for 2020 were evaluated with combined time series of Landsat, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope data. The mean absolute percentage error between detected and reported mowing events was on average 40% (2018), 36% (2019) and 35% (2020). Mowing events were on average detected 11 days (2018), 7 days (2019) and 6 days (2020) after the reported mowing. Performance measures varied between the different regions of Germany, and lower accuracies were found in areas that are revisited less frequently by Sentinel-2. Thus, we assessed the influence of data availability and found that the detection of mowing events was less influenced by data availability when at least 16 cloud-free observations were available in the grassland season. Still, the distribution of available observations throughout the season appeared to be critical. On a national scale our results revealed overall higher shares of less intensively mown grasslands and smaller shares of highly intensively managed grasslands. Hotspots of the latter were identified in the alpine foreland in Southern Germany as well as in the lowlands in the Northwest of Germany. While these patterns were stable throughout the years, the results revealed a tendency to lower management intensity in the extremely dry year 2018. Our results emphasize the ability of the approach to map the intensity of grassland management throughout large areas despite variations in data availability and environmental conditions.

TI  - Albedo-Induced Global Warming Impact at Multiple Temporal Scales within an Upper Midwest USA Watershed
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is a significant regulator of climate. Changes in land use worldwide have greatly reshaped landscapes in the recent decades. Deforestation, agricultural development, and urban expansion alter land surface albedo, each with unique influences on shortwave radiative forcing and global warming impact (GWI). Here, we characterize the changes in landscape albedo-induced GWI (GWI(Delta alpha)) at multiple temporal scales, with a special focus on the seasonal and monthly GWI(Delta alpha) over a 19-year period for different land cover types in five ecoregions within a watershed in the upper Midwest USA. The results show that land cover changes from the original forest exhibited a net cooling effect, with contributions of annual GWI(Delta alpha) varying by cover type and ecoregion. Seasonal and monthly variations of the GWI(Delta alpha) showed unique trends over the 19-year period and contributed differently to the total GWI(Delta alpha). Cropland contributed most to cooling the local climate, with seasonal and monthly offsets of 18% and 83%, respectively, of the annual greenhouse gas emissions of maize fields in the same area. Urban areas exhibited both cooling and warming effects. Cropland and urban areas showed significantly different seasonal GWI(Delta alpha) at some ecoregions. The landscape composition of the five ecoregions could cause different net landscape GWI(Delta alpha).

TI  - Predicting Snowmelt Runoff at the Source of the Mountainous Euphrates River Basin in Turkey for Water Supply and Flood Control Issues Using HEC-HMS Modeling
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the runoff from snowpack accumulated in mountainous basins during the melting periods is very important in terms of assessing issues such as water supply and flood control. In this study, the Hydrological Engineering Center-Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS) was used to simulate snowmelt runoff in the Kirkgoze-cipak Basin that has a complex topography where altitude differences range from 1823 m to 3140 m above the sea level. The Kirkgoze-cipak Basin, located in eastern Turkey, is a basin where snowfall is highly effective during the cold season. There are three automatic meteorology and snow observation stations and three stream gauge stations in the basin, which are operated especially for the calibration and validation of hydrological parameters at different altitudes and exposures. In this study, the parameters affecting snow accumulation-melting and runoff were investigated using the simulations on an hourly basis carried out over a three-year period for temporal and spatial distribution at the basin scale. Different from previous studies focusing on the rate of snowmelt, the temperature index method, which is calculated with physically-based parameters (R-2 = 0.77~0.99), was integrated into the runoff simulations (R-2 = 0.84) in the basin. The snowmelt-dominated basin is considered to be the source of the headwaters of the Euphrates River.

TI  - Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among primary healthcare patients in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area: the SeroCAP sentinel network protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies are currently being recommended and implemented in many countries. Forming part of the COVID-19 monitoring and evaluation plan of the Catalan Government Health Department, our network aims to initiate a primary healthcare sentinel monitoring system as a surrogate of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. Methods and analysis The seroCAP is a serial cross-sectional study, which will be performed in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area to estimate antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. From February 2021 to March 2022, the detection of serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein will be performed on a monthly basis in blood samples collected for diverse clinical purposes in three reference hospitals from the three Barcelona healthcare areas (BCN areas). The samples (n=2588/month) will be from patients attended by 30 primary healthcare teams at 30 basic healthcare areas (BHA). A lab software algorithm will systematically select the samples by age and sex. Seroprevalence will be estimated and monitored by age, sex, BCN area and BHA. Descriptive and cluster analysis of the characteristics and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be performed. Sociodemographic, socioeconomic and morbidity-associated factors will be determined using logistic regression. We will explore the association between seroprevalence, SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and the implemented measures using interrupted time series analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the University Institute Foundation for Primary Health Care Research Jordi Gol i Gurina ethics committee. An informed consent is not required regarding the approval of the secondary use of biological samples within the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic. A report will be generated quarterly. The final analysis, conclusions and recommendations will be shared with the stakeholders and communicated to the general public. Manuscripts resulting from the network will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

TI  - Surface Water Change Detection via Water Indices and Predictive Modeling Using Remote Sensing Imagery: A Case Study of Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake, Romania
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body feature extraction using a remote sensing technique represents an important tool in the investigation of water resources and hydrological drought assessment. Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake, a component of the Danube Delta Natural Reserve, is located on the Romanian Black Sea littoral. On account of an event in summer 2020, when the lake surface water decreased significantly, this study aims to identify the variation of the Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake surface water over a long-term period in correlation with human intervention and climate change. To this end, it provides an analysis in the period 1965-2021 via hydrological drought indices and data mining classification. The latter approach is based on several water indices derived from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and MODIS full-time series datasets: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Weighted Normalized Difference Water Index (WNDWI), and Water Ratio Index (WRI). The experimental results indicate that the proposed classification methods can extract relevant features from waterbodies using remote sensing imagery with a high accuracy. Moreover, the study shows a similarity in the evolution of surface water cover identified with the data mining classification and the drought periods detected in the flow data series for the Nuntasi and Sacele Rivers that supply the Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake. Overall, the results of our investigation show that human intervention and hydrological drought had an extensive impact on the long-term changes in surface water of the Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake.

We investigated multisensor machine learning (ML) models to estimate desert grassland habitat suitability for a critically endangered species, the mask bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridgewayi). Contemporary habitat conditions are marked by a history of intensive livestock grazing, periodic drought, and changes in arid land hydrology. Historical land use and vegetation changes were accompanied by altered disturbance regimes that once supported recurrent fire important to maintaining grassland composition and structure. Habitat assessment plots were combined with multidate and multispectral Worldview-3 (WV3) satellite imagery and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) metrics to model habitat suitability on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (BANWR). We used regression and structural equation models (SEM) to assess fire history, climate, and site biophysical effects on habitat suitability from 239 vegetation plots stratified by topography and fire frequency. We found that combined WV3/LiDAR models improved suitability predictions and consistency over WV3-only models comparing the root mean squared and mean absolute error from training data. Hyperparameter tuning for ML habitat models further improved performance. Gradient boosted regression trees and WV3/LiDAR habitat suitability models showed superior performance and correspondence to independent field validation data (F = 92.7, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.57). Comparisons between predicted habitat suitability and fire history variables from 84 management units showed a significant negative relationship with increased fire frequency (F = 27.6, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.41) and positive relationship with time since last burn (F = 41.3, p <= 0.001, R-2 = 0.34). SEMs established that masked bobwhite habitat occurrence was strongly associated with site biophysical conditions that supported greater woody plant cover important for nesting, thermal, and predator protection. Our results suggest that desert grasslands associated with low primary productivity may require recovery periods in excess of 20 years to develop a desired mix of herbaceous and woody plant cover for masked bobwhite, when >= 2 fires have occurred over the last 30 years. Multiple sensor types provided a unique set of variables describing horizontal and vertical habitat structure and composition, essential to understanding fire effects on masked bobwhite habitat suitability. Combined information from active and passive remote sensing systems can likely enhance mapping and monitoring applications necessary for assessing recovery needs for numerous other wildlife species with diverse habitat requirements.

TI  - A Dual Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Crop Classification Using Time-Series Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely mapping of crop types and having reliable information about the cultivation pattern/area play a key role in various applications, including food security and sustainable agriculture management. Remote sensing (RS) has extensively been employed for crop type classification. However, accurate mapping of crop types and extents is still a challenge, especially using traditional machine learning methods. Therefore, in this study, a novel framework based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a dual attention module (DAM) and using Sentinel-2 time-series datasets was proposed to classify crops. A new DAM was implemented to extract informative deep features by taking advantage of both spectral and spatial characteristics of Sentinel-2 datasets. The spectral and spatial attention modules (AMs) were respectively applied to investigate the behavior of crops during the growing season and their neighborhood properties (e.g., textural characteristics and spatial relation to surrounding crops). The proposed network contained two streams: (1) convolution blocks for deep feature extraction and (2) several DAMs, which were employed after each convolution block. The first stream included three multi-scale residual convolution blocks, where the spectral attention blocks were mainly applied to extract deep spectral features. The second stream was built using four multi-scale convolution blocks with a spatial AM. In this study, over 200,000 samples from six different crop types (i.e., alfalfa, broad bean, wheat, barley, canola, and garden) and three non-crop classes (i.e., built-up, barren, and water) were collected to train and validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved high overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 98.54% and 0.981, respectively. It also outperformed other state-of-the-art classification methods, including RF, XGBOOST, R-CNN, 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN, and CBAM, indicating its high potential to discriminate different crop types.

TI  - Analysis of Air Pollution Data in India between 2015 and 2019
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - India suffers from among the worst air pollution in the world. In response, a large government effort to increase air quality monitoring is underway. We present the first comprehensive analysis of government air quality observations from 2015-2019 for PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO(2 )and O-3 from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (CAAQM) network and the manual National Air Quality Monitoring Program (NAMP), as well as PM2.5 from the US Air-Now network. We address inconsistencies and data gaps in datasets using a rigorous procedure to ensure data representativeness. We find particulate pollution dominates the pollution mix across India with virtually all sites in northern India (divided at 23.5 degrees N) exceeding the annual average PM10 and PM2.5 residential national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) by 150% and 100% respectively, and in southern India exceeding the PM10 standard by 50% and the PM2.5 standard by 40%. Annual average SO2, NO2 and MDA8 O-3 generally meet the residential NAAQS across India. Northern India has (similar to 10%-130%) higher concentrations of all pollutants than southern India, with only SO2 having similar concentrations. Although inter-annual variability exists, we found no significant trend of these pollutants over the five-year period. In the five cities with Air-Now PM2.5 measurements - Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai, there is reasonable agreement with CPCB data. The PM2.5 CPCB CAAQM data compares well with satellite derived annual surface PM2.5 concentrations (Hammer et al., 2020), with the exception of the western desert region prior to 2018 when surface measurements exceeded satellite retrievals. Our reanalyzed dataset is useful for evaluation of Indian air quality from satellite data, atmospheric models, and low-cost sensors. Our dataset also provides a baseline to evaluate the future success of National Clean Air Programme as well as aids in assessment of existing and future air pollution mitigation policies.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Given its high root regeneration ability and adaptation capacity, Spartina alterniflora would predominate the resource competition with other plant species. As an invasive alien species, it has caused serious damages to the coastal ecosystem of China. We explored the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the growth and expansion of mangroves around the coastal zones around Guangxi Shankou Mangrove National Nature Reserve (GSMNNR). The area of S. alterniflora and mangroves in the GSMNNR was analyzed based on a sequence of Landsat satellite multispectral images collected during 1995 to 2019. The results showed that S. alterniflora predominated in the competition with mangroves without human intervention. The area of S. alterniflora decreased under the conditions of cutting, rooting and other management measures, while the average annual growth rate of mangrove area correspondingly increased. It indicated that the invasion of S. alterniflora would inhibit the growth and expansion of mangroves. The S. alterniflora management measures, such as mowing and rooting, could weaken the negative impacts of S. alterniflora on mangroves. Mangroves could thus be effectively protected. This study could provide quantitative scientific data for S. alterniflora management and the protection of the mangrove ecosystem in the GSMNNR, and thus be a valuable reference to the prevention on a larger scale of S. alterniflora and the formulation of further protective measures for mangroves.

TI  - Effects of Mulching on Maize Yield and Evapotranspiration in the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic film mulching is an effective way to manage agricultural fields in water shortage areas. Through increasing the soil surface temperature at the early stage of crop growth and reducing the soil evaporation during the whole growth period, plastic film mulching can realize the effect of water saving and yield increase. This study examined the effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield and evapotranspiration (ET) in the Heihe River basin in Northwest China. By using remote sensing data, the gridding G-AquaCrop model was built to simulate the maize yield and ET in the basin under conditions of film mulching and no-film mulching. Through an analysis of changes in maize yield and ET before and after film mulching, suitable areas for film mulching in the whole basin were identified. Through comparative analysis, it was found that after plastic film mulching, maize yield in 12-41% of the Heihe River basin increased to a certain extent, reaching 8%. Furthermore, film mulching decreased ET by 5-30% in 34-41% of areas planted with maize. Based on these results, suggestions were made on suitable areas for expansion of maize cultivation to balance the benefits of water saving and production increase with environmental pollution. Furthermore, the way of assessing the suitable mulching area is obtained by examining the meteorological condition directly. The results of this study are of great significance for rational allocation of agricultural production resources and efficient utilization of agricultural water resources.

TI  - Improving the Inversion Accuracy of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly by Combining GNSS and LSTM Algorithm and Its Application in Mainland China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Densely distributed Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations can invert the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) with high precision. However, the uneven distribution of GNSS stations greatly limits the application of TWSA inversion. The purpose of this study was to compensate for the spatial coverage of GNSS stations by simulating the vertical deformation in unobserved grids. First, a new deep learning weight loading inversion model (DWLIM) was constructed by combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm, inverse distance weight, and the crustal load model. DWLIM is beneficial for improving the inversion accuracy of TWSA based on the GNSS vertical displacement. Second, the DWLIM-based and traditional GNSS-derived TWSA methods were utilized to derive TWSA over mainland China. Furthermore, the TWSA results were compared with the TWSA solutions of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model. The results indicate that the maximum Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient, and root mean square error (RMSE) equal 0.81, 0.61, and 2.18 cm, respectively. The accuracy of DWLIM was higher than that of the traditional GNSS inversion method according to PCC, NSE, and RMSE, which were increased by 67.11, 128.15, and 22.75%. The inversion strategy of DWLIM can effectively improve the accuracy of TWSA inversion in regions with unevenly distributed GNSS stations. Third, this study investigated the variation characteristics of TWSA based on DWLIM in 10 river basins over mainland China. The analysis shows that the TWSA amplitudes of Songhua and Liaohe River basins are significantly higher than those of the other basins. Moreover, TWSA sequences in each river basin contain annual seasonal signals, and the wave peaks of TWSA estimates emerge between June and July. Overall, DWLIM provides a useful measure to derive TWSA in regions where GNSS stations are uneven or sparse.

TI  - Assessing Land Cover and Ecological Quality Changes in the Forest-Steppe Ecotone of the Greater Khingan Mountains, Northeast China, from Landsat and MODIS Observations from 2000 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover changes are the main factors driving the evolution of regional ecological quality. These changes must be considered in the strategic formulation of regional or national ecological policies. The forest-steppe ecotone in the Greater Khingan Mountains is an important ecological barrier in northern China. To measure the effect of ecological protection in recent years, Landsat images, object-oriented image segmentation, and convolutional neural networks were used to create land cover datasets of the forest-steppe ecotone. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) and the dimidiate pixel model were used to derive net primary productivity (NPP) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) to assess the ecological quality of this area. The results showed that only grassland and urban land increased, whereas saline-alkali land and desert areas initially increased and then decreased from 2010 to 2018, indicating that the desertification process was substantially curbed. Total NPP increased by 26.3% (2000-2010) and 10.8% (2010-2018). However, NPP decreased slightly in the center of the study area. FVC first decreased and then increased, and the increased areas were concentrated in the forest-steppe ecotone, saline-alkali land, and desert zone in Xin Barag Left Banner. These observations indicate that the ecological quality has gradually improved due to the strict protection of forest and grassland resources and the suppression of desertification. Our results provide potential insights for land use planning and the development of environmental protection measures in the forest-steppe ecotone.

TI  - Tracking of Land Reclamation Activities Using Landsat Observations-An Example in Shanghai and Hangzhou Bay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, reclamation-changing ocean areas into inland land cover type for human usage-is one of the major methods for expanding land area around the world to alleviate the problem of land shortage. Thus, reclamation activities play an important role in land area extension. In recent years, reclamation projects have been active in eastern China. However, research on how to determine the initiation of reclamation activity remains very limited. Thus, a method of tracking reclamation activities was proposed in this study to analyze the coastline change due to human activities in Shanghai Lingang New City and Hangzhou Bay area. First, the reclamation area was extracted and separated into sea filling and sea enclosing. Next, the "SEDIMENT" signal track method and the "Eight-Neighborhood" morphological method were used to track dissimilar reclamation types. The historical reclamation activities (including start time and end time) over the recent 30 years were also tracked and obtained. Experimental results indicated that the time tracker accuracy of reclamation activity can reach 83.8%. Thus, this study can provide a reference for tracking coastline change.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Convolutional Neural Networks and Conventional Machine Learning Models for Lithological Mapping Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithological mapping is a critical aspect of geological mapping that can be useful in studying the mineralization potential of a region and has implications for mineral prospectivity mapping. This is a challenging task if performed manually, particularly in highly remote areas that require a large number of participants and resources. The combination of machine learning (ML) methods and remote sensing data can provide a quick, low-cost, and accurate approach for mapping lithological units. This study used deep learning via convolutional neural networks and conventional ML methods involving support vector machines and multilayer perceptron to map lithological units of a mineral-rich area in the southeast of Iran. Moreover, we used and compared the efficiency of three different types of multispectral remote-sensing data, including Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI), advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER), and Sentinel-2. The results show that CNNs and conventional ML methods effectively use the respective remote-sensing data in generating an accurate lithological map of the study area. However, the combination of CNNs and ASTER data provides the best performance and the highest accuracy and adaptability with field observations and laboratory analysis results so that almost all the test data are predicted correctly. The framework proposed in this study can be helpful for exploration geologists to create accurate lithological maps in other regions by using various remote-sensing data at a low cost.

TI  - Features of the conceptual structure of Osip Mandelstam's poetic texts in poems of different years
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The topicality of the research is determined by the lack of knowledge about Mandelstam's poetic worldview in the dynamic of his writing. The analysis of the author's conceptual structure of poetic texts allows us to expand understanding of the poet's sphere of concepts and means of its verbalization in his early and late lyrics, and provides a possibility to identify features of its realization in poems of different years. Mandelstam's poetic texts included in the collection Stone (1913) and lyrics written in the period from 1930 to 1937 (138 works) are the material of the research. The key concepts are life, death, St. Petersburg, the way and music, which are ideologically significant in the author's works and display the author's individual features. The research is carried out taking into account the typology of conceptual structures developed in the communicative stylistics of the text. The results of the analysis show that Mandelstam's conceptual structure of texts transforms in terms of the number of key concepts actualized within a single text (in the early works one-term conceptual structures dominate; in the late works two- and three-term ones). The content of the concepts also changes. This shows, for example, in the features of the music concept: in Mandelstam's early lyrics music is interpreted as life, while the late ones express the idea that the existence of any sound can lead to death. The nature of relations between key concepts within a single poetic text changes: in contrast to early lyrics, late works are characterized by bright and repeatedly updated relations of contrast between the key concepts. This feature can be explained by a change in the literary direction in which the author was working (the transition from symbolism to Acmeism), a change of emotional tonality of the texts, their semantic and ideological content. The transformation also involves such a feature of the conceptual structure as the presence or absence of direct nominations of concepts in the lexical structure of poetic texts: in the author's early lyrics the analyzed concepts are actualized clearly, and in the late ones indirectly. Thus, conceptual structures of explicit type are represented widely in the early works and of implicit type in the late works. In my opinion, the changes in Mandelstam's poetic worldview and in the conceptual structure of his poems were influenced by such extralinguistic factors as peculiarities of the poet's biography, the change of his literary method, the influence of the political and social situation in the country. The research proves the evolution of the conceptual structure of Mandelstam's poetic texts and determines its evolutional features, distinctive for his lyrics of different years. The results of the research are interesting for cognitive linguistics and communicative stylistics of the text, and can be used in university and school classes on stylistics and philological analysis of the text.

TI  - Effective method for filling gaps in time series of environmental remote sensing data: An example on evapotranspiration and land surface temperature images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenomena such as cloudiness, atmospheric aerosol or sensor failure cause missing data (gaps) in remote sensing images and damage spatial and temporal continuity. Dealing with this deficiency is of importance for continuous spatio-temporal modeling and environmental studies. Simplicity, efficiency and accuracy are dominant factors in practicality of gap filling algorithms especially in dealing with large gaps and long time series. In this study, an effective and efficient spatio-temporal gap filling algorithm is proposed, implemented and tested. The method was applied to MODIS 8-day Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET) datasets with a 1 km spatial resolution. To assess the performance of the proposed methods, artificial gaps were introduced and filled. Then estimated and real values were compared. The results showed that our method can predict the missing values very accurately (based on RMSE) even in gaps with heterogeneous surface for both variables. Our proposed method has no limitation on the shape and size of the gaps. The proposed algorithm is flexible regarding parameterization. It can handle large volumes of datasets due to its parallelizable structure. More importantly, the method run-time is extremely low even in large gaps.

TI  - Removing Diurnal Signals and Longer Term Trends From Electron Flux and ULF Correlations: A Comparison of Spectral Subtraction, Simple Differencing, and ARIMAX Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simultaneously cycling space weather parameters may show high correlations even if there is no immediate relationship between them. We successfully remove diurnal cycles using spectral subtraction, and remove both diurnal and longer cycles (e.g., the 27 days solar cycle) with a difference transformation. Other methods of diurnal cycle removal (daily averaging, moving averages [MAs], and simpler spectral subtraction using regression) are less successful at removing cycles. We apply spectral subtraction (a finite impulse response equiripple bandstop filter) to hourly electron flux (Los Alamos National Laboratory satellite data) and a ground-based ULF index to remove a 24 hr noise signal. This results in smoother time series appropriate for short-term (approximately < 1 week) correlation and observational studies. However, spectral subtraction may not remove longer cycles such as the 27 days and 11 yr solar cycles. A differencing transformation (y(t) - y(t-24)) removes not only the 24 hr noise signal but also the 27 days solar cycle, autocorrelation, and longer trends. This results in a low correlation between electron flux and the ULF index over long periods of time (maximum of 0.1). Correlations of electron flux and the ULF index with solar wind velocity (differenced at y(t) - y(t-1)) are also lower than previously reported (<= 0.1). An autoregressive, MA transfer function model (ARIMAX) shows that there are significant cumulative effects of solar wind velocity on ULF activity over long periods, but correlations of velocity and ULF waves with flux are only seen over shorter time spans of more homogeneous geomagnetic activity levels.

TI  - Genesis of a Severe Dust Storm Over the Indian Subcontinent: Dynamics and Impacts
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The genesis, dynamics, and impacts of a severe dust storm over the central Himalaya during June 13-17, 2018 have been investigated using in situ measurements, satellite data, and model reanalysis. A low-pressure system over northern India and prevalence of strong winds (similar to 20 ms(-1)) triggered the dust storm leading to poor visibility conditions and five-fold enhancement in the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the central Himalaya. Enhancements in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) were observed to be stronger over the Himalayan foothills site (Lumbini) than that over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) site-Gandhi College. The sharp reductions in Angstrom exponent (alpha) from about 1.2 to 0.3 indicated the dominance of coarse-mode aerosols during the dust episode. Model results show an enhancement in the dust from 1.5 to 2.5 Tg (similar to 70%) over the northern Indian subcontinent, with about half of the contribution from the regional source (Thar Desert). Interestingly, dust storm also had significant impacts on turbulent kinetic energy (2.9-9.6 m(2) s(-2)), vertical momentum flux (0.9-3.3 Nm(-2)), and sensible heat flux (34.8 to -33.9 Wm(-2)), suggesting turbulent mixing of aerosols and cooling near the surface over the Himalayas. Our study highlights that the large-scale dust storms exposed to additional dust and pollution from regional sources can profoundly impact the air quality, heat fluxes, and radiative balance over the northern Indian subcontinent. The study would also help in evaluating the results of climate models and to assess the impacts of dust on the hydrological processes and melting Himalayan glaciers.

TI  - Investigations on mode-division multiplexed free-space optical transmission for inter-satellite communication link
T2  - WIRELESS NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inter-satellite data transmission links are very crucial for providing global inter-connectivity. We report designing and investigations on high date rate inter-satellite communication based on free-space optical (FSO) transmission system employing mode-division multiplexing (MDM) technique, which enhances the spectral-effectiveness and net data rate of the communication link. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed inter-satellite FSO transmission system has been compared for polarization-shift keyed, differential phase-shift keyed, and alternate mark inverted signals at different rates of data transmission. Favorable transmission of 2-distinct 40 Gbps data signals along 35,000 km distance with reliable BER is reported to realize an 80 Gbps-35000 km inter-satellite FSO communication. Furthermore, the proposed inter-satellite FSO system is investigated for increasing receiver pointing error losses and 80 Gbps-15000 km transmission up to 2.7 mu rad error angle is reported.

TI  - Time Series of Quad-Pol C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar for the Forecasting of Crop Biophysical Variables of Barley Fields Using Statistical Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to both fit and predict crop biophysical variables with a SAR image series by performing a factorial experiment and estimating time series models using a combination of forecasts. Two plots of barley grown under rainfed conditions in Spain were monitored during the growing cycle of 2015 (February to June). The dataset included nine field estimations of agronomic parameters, 20 RADARSAT-2 images, and daily weather records. Ten polarimetric observables were retrieved and integrated to derive the six agronomic and monitoring variables, including the height, biomass, fraction of vegetation cover, leaf area index, water content, and soil moisture. The statistical methods applied, namely double smoothing, ARIMAX, and robust regression, allowed the adjustment and modelling of these field variables. The model equations showed a positive contribution of meteorological variables and a strong temporal component in the crop's development, as occurs in natural conditions. After combining different models, the results showed the best efficiency in terms of forecasting and the influence of several weather variables. The existence of a cointegration relationship between the data series of the same crop in different fields allows for adjusting and predicting the results in other fields with similar crops without re-modelling.

TI  - Tracking crop phenology in a highly dynamic landscape with knowledge-based Landsat-MODIS data fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation image data are regularly used to capture surface conditions over large areas, but there is a trade-off between high (or low) spatial and low (or high) temporal resolution. The Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) overcomes this trade-off by fusing high spatial and temporal resolution multisource image data. However, ESTARFM requires additional modifications in order to provide reliable estimates of surface conditions showing large spectral differences in highly dynamic and fragmented agricultural systems. We modified ESTARFM by taking a knowledge-based approach to track maize and rice phenology in a highly dynamic and fragmented agricultural landscape in Ethiopia in 2019. The two major improvements included: (i) Selection of Landsat-MODIS imageries based on crop sowing and harvesting information and (ii) generation and use of a land cover map to select similar pixels. We assessed model performance with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from independent Landsat image data and in-situ leaf area index (LAI) data. The improved ESTARFM workflow resulted in reliable Landsat-MODIS prediction (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.07) compared to the standard ESTARFM workflow (R-2 = 0.54 RMSE = 0.01) during the rapid growth stage. Our modifications outperformed the standard implementation of ESTARFM according to LAI magnitude (R-2 = 0.73-0.84 versus R-2 = 0.58-0.64) and phenological timing (RMSE = 8 days verses RMSE = 12 days). Our modified application of ESTARFM serves as a basis for monitoring crop growth and development in highly dynamic and fragmented agricultural systems.

TI  - A Machine Learning Framework for the Classification of Natura 2000 Habitat Types at Large Spatial Scales Using MODIS Surface Reflectance Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic climate and land use change is causing rapid shifts in the distribution and composition of habitats with profound impacts on ecosystem biodiversity. The sustainable management of ecosystems requires monitoring programmes capable of detecting shifts in habitat distribution and composition at large spatial scales. Remote sensing observations facilitate such efforts as they enable cost-efficient modelling approaches that utilize publicly available datasets and can assess the status of habitats over extended periods of time. In this study, we introduce a modelling framework for habitat monitoring in Germany using readily available MODIS surface reflectance data. We developed supervised classification models that allocate (semi-)natural areas to one of 18 classes based on their similarity to Natura 2000 habitat types. Three machine learning classifiers, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and C5.0, and an ensemble approach were employed to predict habitat type using spectral signatures from MODIS in the visible-to-near-infrared and short-wave infrared. The models were trained on homogenous Special Areas of Conservation that are predominantly covered by a single habitat type with reference data from 2013, 2014, and 2016 and tested against ground truth data from 2010 and 2019 for independent model validation. Individually, the SVM and RF methods achieved better overall classification accuracies (SVM: 0.72-0.93%, RF: 0.72-0.94%) than the C5.0 algorithm (0.66-0.93%), while the ensemble classifier developed from the individual models gave the best performance with overall accuracies of 94.23% for 2010 and 80.34% for 2019 and also allowed a robust detection of non-classifiable pixels. We detected strong variability in the cover of individual habitat types, which were reduced when aggregated based on their similarity. Our methodology is capable to provide quantitative information on the spatial distribution of habitats, differentiate between disturbance events and gradual shifts in ecosystem composition, and could successfully allocate natural areas to Natura 2000 habitat types.

TI  - The Enclosed Intestinal Microbiome: Semiochemical Signals from the Precambrian and Their Disruption by Heavy Metal Pollution
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is increasingly likely that many non-communicable diseases of humans and associated animals are due to the degradation of their intestinal microbiomes, a situation often referred to as dysbiosis. An analysis of the resultant diseases offers an opportunity to probe the function of these microbial partners of multicellular animals. In our view, it now seems likely that vertebrate animals and their microbiomes have coevolved throughout the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition and beyond, operating by semiochemical messaging between the multicellular host and its microbial community guest. A consideration of the overall role of the mutualistic intestinal microbiome as an enclosed bioreactor throws up a variety of challenging concepts. In particular: the significance of the microbiome with respect to the immune system suggests that microeukaryotes could act as microbial sentinel cells; the ubiquity of bacteriophage viruses implies the rapid turnover of microbial composition by a viral-shunt mechanism; and high microbial diversity is needed to ensure that horizontal gene transfer allows valuable genetic functions to be expressed. We have previously postulated that microbes of sufficient diversity must be transferred from mother to infant by seemingly accidental contamination during the process of natural birth. We termed this maternal microbial inheritance and suggested that it operates alongside parental genetic inheritance to modify gene expression. In this way, the adjustment of the neonate immune system by the microbiome may represent one of the ways in which the genome of a vertebrate animal interacts with its microbial environment. The absence of such critical functions in the neonate may help to explain the observation of persistent immune-system problems in affected adults. Equally, granted that the survival of the guest microbiome depends on the viability of its host, one function of microbiome-generated semiochemicals could be to facilitate the movement of food through the digestive tract, effectively partitioning nutrition between host and guest. In the event of famine, downregulation of microbial growth and therefore of semiochemical production would allow all available food to be consumed by the host. Although it is often thought that non-communicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, are caused by consumption of food containing insufficient dietary fibre, our hypothesis suggests that poor-quality food is not the prime cause but that the tendency for disease follows the degradation of the intestinal microbiome, when fat build-up occurs because the relevant semiochemicals can no longer be produced. It is the purpose of this paper to highlight the possibility that the origins of the microbiome lie in the Precambrian and that the disconnection of body and microbiome gives rise to non-communicable disease through the loss of semiochemical signalling. We further surmise that this disconnect has been largely brought about by heavy metal poisoning, potentially illuminating a facet of the exposome, the sum total of environmental insults that influence the expression of the genetic inheritance of an animal.

TI  - Spectral-Based Monitoring of Climate Effects on the Inter-Annual Variability of Different Plant Functional Types in Mediterranean Cork Oak Woodlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remotely sensed data to estimate the biophysical properties of vegetation in woodlands is a challenging task due to their heterogeneous nature. The objective of this study was to assess the biophysical parameters of different vegetation types (cork oak trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation) in cork oak woodland through the analysis of temporal trends in spectral vegetation indices (VIs). A seven-year database (from 2011 until 2017) of in situ observations collected with a field spectroradiometer with a monthly basis was used and four VIs were derived, considered as proxies for several biophysical properties of vegetation such as biomass (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI); chlorophyll content (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index-MTCI), tissue water content (Normalized Difference Water Index-NDWI) and the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio (Photochemical Reflectance Index-PRI). During the analyzed period, some key meteorological data (precipitation, temperature, relative air humidity and global radiation) were collected for the study site, aggregated at three different time-lags (short period (30 d), medium period (90 d) and hydrological period (HIDR)), and their relationship with VIs was analyzed. The results showed different trends for each vegetation index and vegetation type. In NDVI and NDWI, herbaceous vegetation showed a highly marked seasonal trend, whereas for MTCI, it was the cork oak and Cistus salvifolius, and for PRI, it was Ulex airensis that showed the marked seasonal trend. Shrubs have large differences depending on the species: the shallow-rooted Cistus salvifolius showed a higher seasonal variability than the deep-rooted Ulex airensis. Our results revealed the importance of temperature and precipitation as the main climatic variables influencing VI variability in the four studied vegetation types. This study sets up the relationships between climate and vegetation indices for each vegetation type. Spectral vegetation indices are useful tools for assessing the impact of climate on vegetation, because using these makes it easier to monitor the amount of "greenness", biomass and water stress of vegetation than assessing the photosynthetic efficiency. Proximal remote sensing measurements are fundamental for the correct use of remote sensing in monitoring complex agroforest ecosystems, largely used to inform policies to improve resilience to drought, particularly in the Mediterranean region.

TI  - Forest Disturbance Detection with Seasonal and Trend Model Components and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances reduce the extent of natural habitats, biodiversity, and carbon sequestered in forests. With the implementation of the international framework Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), it is important to improve the accuracy in the estimation of the extent of forest disturbances. Time series analyses, such as Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST), have been frequently used to map tropical forest disturbances with promising results. Previous studies suggest that in addition to magnitude of change, disturbance accuracy could be enhanced by using other components of BFAST that describe additional aspects of the model, such as its goodness-of-fit, NDVI seasonal variation, temporal trend, historical length of observations and data quality, as well as by using separate thresholds for distinct forest types. The objective of this study is to determine if the BFAST algorithm can benefit from using these model components in a supervised scheme to improve the accuracy to detect forest disturbance. A random forests and support vector machines algorithms were trained and verified using 238 points in three different datasets: all-forest, tropical dry forest, and temperate forest. The results show that the highest accuracy was achieved by the support vector machines algorithm using the all-forest dataset. Although the increase in accuracy of the latter model vs. a magnitude threshold model is small, i.e., 0.14% for sample-based accuracy and 0.71% for area-weighted accuracy, the standard error of the estimated total disturbed forest area was 4352.59 ha smaller, while the annual disturbance rate was also smaller by 1262.2 ha year(-1). The implemented approach can be useful to obtain more precise estimates in forest disturbance, as well as its associated carbon emissions.

TI  - Influences of wind direction on the cooling effects of mountain vegetation in urban area
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountain or hill with lots of natural vegetation in a city has obvious cooling effects, so it can play a significant role in the regulation of urban microclimate and mitigation of urban heat island (UHI). In this paper, the influences of wind direction on the cooling effects of the Zijin Mountain in Nanjing were evaluated. Firstly, the land surface temperature (LST) was obtained based on 15 Landsat-8 images from 2013 to 2020, and the wind directions in 4 h before the satellite crossing time were calculated. Then, two remote sensing images with opposite wind directions were compared and analyzed to explore the influences of wind direction on the cooling effects of the Zijin Mountain. The results showed that both the cooling buffer zone method and the cooling area method proposed in this paper had proved that the wind direction had great influences on the cooling effects of the mountain vegetation in urban area. In addition, it was also found that the larger the wind speed differences of group images, the greater the influences of the wind direction on the cooling effects. This study will be helpful and meaningful for urban microclimate analyses and urban planning research.

TI  - Global quasi-daily fractional vegetation cover estimated from the DSCOVR EPIC directional hotspot dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) represents the planar fraction of the land-surface covered by green foliage, and its dynamics are important for an enhanced understanding of ecosystems especially how they respond to climate change. The lack of global near-real-time satellite-based products restricts the application of FVC in ecosystem modeling, climate change, and vegetation phenology studies. Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft provides daily spectral reflectance of the entire sunlit Earth in the near Hotspot directions. Hotspot observations (i.e., observation in Hotspot direction which has the peak backscattering reflected radiation) with only sunlit vegetation and sunlit soil components are more suitable for FVC estimation with a two-endmember mixture model as such observations exclude contributions from shaded vegetation and soil components. In this study, an algorithm for retrieving quasi-daily FVC from EPIC based on two-endmember mixture and gap fraction models is developed. Analyses of its performance predict that the average Root-Mean-Square Deviations (RMSDs) of retrievals in FVC units is below 0.050 when compared with reference values. The RMSD is 0.043 when compared to field-based Landsat reference FVC, which confirms lower retrieval uncertainty than FVC retrieved from Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite products such as MODIS, VIIRS, and GEOV2 with RMSDs 0.049- 0.087. The comparison analyses suggest a good consistency between EPIC FVC and FVC products from LEO and geostationary (GEO) satellites sensor, SEVIRI, with RMSD values less than 0.129. EPIC allows for quasi-daily FVC estimation across the global terrestrial surface at 10 km resolution, which is an important development for numerous biophysical applications.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Differences and Driving Factors of Evapotranspiration from Terrestrial Ecosystems of the Qinghai Province in the Past 20 Years
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - As the "Asian Water Tower", understanding the hydrological cycles in Qinghai Province and its interior is critical to the security of terrestrial ecosystems. Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)16 evapotranspiration (ET) remote sensing data, we used least squares regression, correlation analysis, and t-test to determine the temporal and spatial changes and trends of ET in Qinghai Province and its five ecological functional regions, located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Plateau) Western China from 2000 to 2020. In addition, we discussed the main factors affecting the changes of ET in different regions of Qinghai Province over the first two decades of the 21st century along spatial as well as altitudinal gradients. The results showed that: (1) the average annual ET in Qinghai Province was 496.56 mm/a, the highest ET value appeared in the southeast of the study area (684.08 mm/a), and the lowest ET value appeared in the Qaidam region in the northwest (110.49 mm/a); (2) the annual ET showed an increasing trend with a rate of 3.71 mm/a (p < 0.01), the place where ET decreased most was in the Three-River Source region (-8-0 mm/a) in the southwest of the study area, and the ET increased the most in the Hehuang region in the east of the study area (9-34 mm/a); (3) temperature (T) was the dominant ET change factor in Qinghai Province, accounting for about 65.27% of the region, followed by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation (P) for 62.52% and 55.41%, respectively; and (4) ET increased significantly by 2.84 mm/100 m with increasing altitude. The dominant factors changed from P to NDVI and T as the altitude increased. The research is of practical value for gaining insight into the regional water cycle process on the Plateau under climate change.

TI  - Large Soil Carbon Storage in Terrestrial Ecosystems of Canada
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems of Canada store a large amount of organic carbon (C) in soils, peats and plant materials, yet little is known about the C stock size and distributions, both spatially and in various C pools. As temperature rises, C is becoming available for disturbance, decomposition and eventual release into the atmosphere, which makes the quantification of C stocks in terrestrial ecosystems of Canada of high interest for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation efforts. We used a large number of field measurements, multisource satellite, climate and topographic data and a machine learning algorithm to produce the first wall-to-wall estimates of C stocks and uncertainties in plants and soils of Canada at 250 m spatial resolution. Our findings show that above and belowground live biomass and detritus store a total of 21.1 Pg of carbon (Pg C). Whereas the Canadian soils store 306 (+/- 147, 90% confidence interval) Pg organic C in the top 1 m, 98 Pg C of which are stored in peatlands, confirming that the soil organic C dominates terrestrial carbon stocks in Canada. We also find previously under-reported large soil organic C stocks in forested peatlands on the boreal shields of Canada. Given that Canada is warming twice the global average rate and Canadian soils store approximately 20.4% of world soil C stocks in top 1 m, initiatives to understand their vulnerabilities to climate change and disturbance are indispensable not only for Canada but also for the global C cycle.

TI  - The Spectral Mixture Residual: A Source of Low-Variance Information to Enhance the Explainability and Accuracy of Surface Biology and Geology Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectrally mixed pixels are the rule, not the exception, in decameter terrestrial imaging. By definition, the reflectance spectrum of a mixed pixel is a function of more than one generative process. Physically based surface biology and geology retrievals must therefore isolate the component of interest from a myriad of unrelated processes, each occurring with unknown presence and abundance across the hundreds of square meters sampled by each pixel. Foliar traits, for example, must be isolated from canopy structure and substrate composition. In many cases, these unrelated processes can dominate overall variance of spatially integrated reflectance. We propose a new approach to isolate low-variance spectral signatures in mixed pixels. The aggregate effects of (high-variance) spatial mixing processes within each pixel are modeled by treating the observed reflectance as a linear mixture of a small set of generic endmember spectra. Spatial mixing effects are removed by computing the (low-variance) difference between the modeled and observed spectra, named the Mixture Residual (MR). The MR, a residual reflectance spectrum that is presumed to carry the subtler and variable signals of interest, is then leveraged as a source of signal. We illustrate the approach using three independent collections of reflectance spectra: synthetic composites computed from field measurements, NEON AOP airborne image compilations, and DESIS satellite data. The MR is found to discriminate between land cover versus plant trait signals, and to accentuate subtle absorption features. Mean band-to-band correlations within the visible, NIR, and SWIR wavebands decrease from 0.97, 0.94, and 0.97 to 0.95, 0.04, and 0.31 (respectively). The number of dimensions required to explain 99% of image variance increases from 4 to 13. We focus on vegetation as an illustrative example, but note that the concept can be extended to other classes of spectra and used as an input to other algorithms.

TI  - Arteriovenous malformations in the optic apparatus: systematic literature review and report of four cases
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - OBJECTIVE Rare arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the optic apparatus account for < 1% of all AVMs. The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature for cases of optic apparatus AVMs and present 4 cases from their institution. The literature is summarized to describe preoperative characteristics, surgical technique, and treatment outcomes for these lesions. METHODS A comprehensive search of the English-language literature was performed in accordance with established Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify all published cases of AVM in the optic apparatus in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. The authors also searched their prospective institutional database of vascular malformations for such cases. Data regarding the clinical and radiological presentation, visual acuity, visual fields, extent of resection, and postoperative outcomes were gathered. RESULTS Nine patients in the literature and 4 patients in the authors' single-surgeon series who fit the inclusion criteria were identified. The median age at presentation was 29 years (range 8-39 years). Among these patients, 11 presented with visual disturbance, 9 with headache, and 1 with multiple prior subarachnoid hemorrhages; the AVM in 1 case was found incidentally. Four patients described prior symptoms of headache or visual disturbance consistent with sentinel events. Visual acuity was decreased from baseline in 10 patients, and 11 patients had visual field defects on formal visual field testing. The most common visual field defect was temporal hemianopia, found in one or both eyes in 7 patients. The optic chiasm was affected in 10 patients, the hypothalamus in 2 patients, the optic nerve (unilaterally) in 8 patients, and the optic tract in 2 patients. Six patients underwent gross-total resection; 6 patients underwent subtotal resection; and 1 patient underwent craniotomy, but no resection was attempted. Postoperatively, 9 of the patients had improved visual function, 1 had no change, and 3 had worse visual acuity. Eight patients demonstrated improved visual fields, 1 had no change, and 4 had narrowed fields. CONCLUSIONS AVMs of the optic apparatus are rare lesions. Although they reside in a highly eloquent region, surgical outcomes are generally good; the majority of patients will see improvement in their visual function postoperatively. Microsurgical technique is critical to the successful removal of these lesions, and preservation of function sometimes requires subtotal resection of the lesion.

TI  - Evaluating the Use of Lidar to Discern Snag Characteristics Important for Wildlife
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Standing dead trees (known as snags) are historically difficult to map and model using airborne laser scanning (ALS), or lidar. Specific snag characteristics are important for wildlife; for instance, a larger snag with a broken top can serve as a nesting platform for raptors. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether characteristics such as top intactness could be inferred from discrete-return ALS data. We collected structural information for 198 snags in closed-canopy conifer forest plots in Idaho. We selected 13 lidar metrics within 5 m diameter point clouds to serve as predictor variables in random forest (RF) models to classify snags into four groups by size (small (<40 cm diameter) or large (>= 40 cm diameter)) and intactness (intact or broken top) across multiple iterations. We conducted these models first with all snags combined, and then ran the same models with only small or large snags. Overall accuracies were highest in RF models with large snags only (77%), but kappa statistics for all models were low (0.29-0.49). ALS data alone were not sufficient to identify top intactness for large snags; future studies combining ALS data with other remotely sensed data to improve classification of snag characteristics important for wildlife is encouraged.

TI  - Ocean color algorithms to estimate the concentration of particulate organic carbon in surface waters of the global ocean in support of a long-term data record from multiple satellite missions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the surface ocean plays a key role in marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems, its assessment from satellite observations of the global ocean is of significant interest. To achieve a global multi-decadal data record of POC by merging observations from multiple satellite ocean color missions, we formulated a new suite of empirical POC algorithms for several satellite sensors. For the algorithm development we assembled a field dataset of concurrent POC and remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), measurements collected in all major ocean basins encompassing tropical, subtropical, and temperate latitudes as well as the northern and southern polar latitudes. This dataset is characterized by a globally-representative probability distribution of POC with a broad range of values between about 10 and 1000 mg m(-3). This development dataset was created with the use of additional inclusion and exclusion criteria based on well-assured and documented consistency of measurement protocols as well as specific bio-optical and particle characteristics of seawater which are consistent with vast areas of open-ocean pelagic environments.To formulate the algorithms the development dataset was subject to parametric regression analysis. Overall we evaluated over seventy formulas for estimating POC from R-rs(lambda) using seven distinctly different algorithmic categories, each with a fundamentally different definition of independent variable involving R-rs(lambda). Through the goodness-of-fit analysis, we selected the best candidate POC algorithms, referred to as the hybrid algorithms, which are tuned specifically for the spectral bands of SeaWiFS, MODIS, VIIRS, MERIS, and OLCI satellite sensors. These hybrid algorithms consist of two components, the MBR (Maximum Band Ratio)-OC4 cubic polynomial function and BRDI (Band Ratio Difference Index) quintic polynomial function. The MBR-OC4 uses four spectral bands and the BRDI three spectral bands from the blue-green spectral region. The MBR-OC4 algorithm is used for POC > 25 mg m(-3) and the BRDI for POC < 15 mg m(-3). In the transition region the weighting approach is applied to POC derived from the two algorithmic formulas. While the main role of the BRDI is to improve POC estimates in ultraoligotrophic waters where POC is very low, the MBR-OC4 provides improvements, compared with the predecessor algorithms, over a broader range of POC but especially for relatively high POC values. A preliminary analysis of field-satellite matchup datasets based on SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua observations shows improved performance of hybrid algorithms compared with current standard algorithms for both SeaWiFS and MODIS. In addition, a reasonable consistency is demonstrated between POC derived from hybrid algorithms applied to example satellite observations with SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS-SNPP. The suite of newly developed algorithms provides the potential next generation version of global algorithms that better represents the spatial and temporal variability within a broader range of POC than the predecessor global algorithms, while also offering a capability to generate a long-term sensor-to-sensor consistent data record of POC that begins with the launch of SeaWiFS mission in 1997.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Several Typical Landsat 8 OLI Cloud Detection Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is a high-resolution satellite sensor that is carried on the next-generation Landsat which was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 2013. Compared to the previous land observation satellites in this series, Landsat 8 OLI has been further optimized in regard to its band setting and data acquisition frequency. The application scope of the data and the ability of information extraction have been further expanded and enhanced. However, the existence of clouds reduces the efficiency and the quality of satellite data. Therefore, in order to identify cloud pixels with a high level of accuracy and efficiency, a variety of cloud detection methods have been developed for Landsat 8 OLI sensors. Distinct treatment methods have been adopted for identifying different surface backgrounds and various types of cloud characteristics in order to improve the accuracy of cloud detection. The present study compares and analyzes the detection results from five typical cloud detection algorithms for different cloud types over different ground types. In addition, it discusses the various cloud detection algorithms used for different types of adaptive backgrounds and clouds in order to shed light upon the comprehensive application of different methods. Subsequently, these findings may provide a reference for the development of an algorithm with a higher precision of cloud detection.

TI  - The Extraction of Near-Shore Bathymetry using Sentinel-2A Satellite Imagery: Algorithms and Their Modifications
T2  - TEM JOURNAL-TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION MANAGEMENT INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) is one of the solution technologies for medium-scale bathymetry mapping in large areas. Various basic algorithms for bathymetry extraction with SDB have been developed. However, they require study and modification for different satellite imageries and different regional characteristics. In this study, the researchers explore three basic SDB algorithms which are often used, namely the Lyzenga algorithm, the Stumpf algorithm, and the Van Hengel & Spitzer (VHS) algorithm. These three algorithms are modified using the multilinear regression method with the 'average if' function to find out the in-situ depth using Sentinel-2A satellite imagery. These three algorithms can estimate the depth of shallow water bathymetry effectively up to a depth of 20 m. The accuracy test on the extraction results of the modification of the three basic algorithms proves to be able to increase the accuracy of the SDB depth estimation in the depth range of 0 - 20 m to an accuracy of 1.888 m for the Lyzenga algorithm, 2.093 m for the Stumpf algorithm, and 2.868 m for the VHS algorithm.

TI  - Effectiveness of Semi-Supervised Learning and Multi-Source Data in Detailed Urban Landuse Mapping with a Few Labeled Samples
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed urban landuse information plays a fundamental role in smart city management. A sufficient sample size has been identified as a very crucial pre-request in machine learning algorithms for urban landuse classification. However, it is often difficult to recognize and label landuse categories from remote sensing images alone. Alternatively, field investigation is time-consuming with a high demand in human resources and monetary cost. Therefore, previous studies on urban landuse classification have often relied on a small size of labeled samples with very uneven spatial distribution. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of a semi-supervised classification framework with multi-source data for detailed urban landuse classification with a few labeled samples. A disagreement-based semi-supervised learning approach, the Co-Forest, was employed and compared with traditional supervised methods (e.g., random forest and XGBoost). Multi-source geospatial data were utilized including optical and nighttime light remote sensing and geospatial big data, which present the physical and socio-economic features of landuse categories. Taking urban landuse classification in Shenzhen City as a case, results show that the classification accuracy of the semi-supervised method are generally on par with that of traditional supervised methods, and less labeled samples are needed to achieve a comparable result under different training set ratios. Given a small sample size, the accuracy tends to be stable with training samples no less than 5% in total. Our results also indicate that the classification accuracy by using multi-source data is significantly higher than that with any single data source being applied. Among these data, map POI and high-resolution optical remote sensing data make larger contributions on the classification, followed by mobile data and nighttime light remote sensing data.

TI  - Hepatic Fatty Acid Profiles Associated with Exposure to Emerging and Legacy Halogenated Contaminants in Two Harbor Seal Populations across the North Atlantic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fatty acids (FAs) have been extensively used as indicators of foraging ecology in marine mammals, yet their association with exposure to contaminants has rarely been investigated. The present study provided the first characterization of the relationship between hepatic FA profiles and exposure to a suite of contaminants in a sentinel species-the harbor seal (Plioca vitulina)-from the Gulf of Maine and the south coast of Sweden. FA profiles differed in the two seal populations, and the levels of legacy and alternative brominated flame retardants and polylialo-genated carbazoles were significantly elevated in Maine seals. Correlations between individual FAs and multiple flame retardants (FRs) and poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were found in seals from both populations. Moreover, several FR and PFAS chemicals were significantly associated with the estimated desaturating enzyme activity inferred from the FA profiles. The ratios of poly to monounsaturated FAs (Sigma PUFAs/Sigma MUFAs) and those of unsaturated to saturated FAs (Sigma UFAs/Sigma SFAs) were significantly associated with HBBZ, PFHxS, or BDE 47 in seals from Maine and Sweden, whereas Sigma n - 6/Sigma n - 3 PUFAs was significantly associated with BDE 154 and 36-CCZ in Swedish and Maine seals, respectively. Our results suggest the lipid metabolism-disrupting potential of these contaminants in marine mammals and warrant continuous biomonitoring and risk assessment, considering the critical role of PUFAs in vital biological processes.

TI  - Global and Regional Variations and Main Drivers of Aerosol Loadings over Land during 1980-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol particles originated from anthropogenic emissions, volcanic eruptions, biomass burning, and fossil combustion emissions, and their radiative effect is one of the most uncertain factors in climate change. Meanwhile, aerosol particles in fine particle size could also cause irreversible effects on the human respiratory system. This study attempted to analyse the spatial and temporal variations of global aerosol optical depth (AOD, 550 nm) during 1980-2018 using MERRA-2 aerosol reanalysis products and to investigate the effects of natural/anthropogenic emissions of different types of aerosols on AOD values. The results show that the global annual mean AOD values kept high levels with significant fluctuations during 1980-1995 and showed a consistent decreasing and less volatile trend after 1995. Spatially, the AOD values are relatively higher in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in North Africa (0.329), Northern India (0.235), and Eastern China (0.347), because of the intensive natural/anthropogenic aerosol emissions there. The sulphate-based aerosols emitted by biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions are the main types of aerosols worldwide, especially in densely populated and industrialized regions such as East Asia and Europe. Dust aerosols are also the main aerosol type in desert areas. For example, the AOD and AODP values for the Sahara Desert are 0.3178 and 75.32%, respectively. Both black carbon aerosols (BC) and organic carbon aerosols (OC) are primary or secondary from carbon emissions of fossil fuels, biomass burning, and open burning. Thus, the regions with high BC and OC aerosol loadings are mainly located in densely populated or vegetated areas such as East Asia, South Asia, and Central Africa. Sea salt aerosols are mainly found in coastline areas along the warm current pathway. This study could help relevant researchers in the fields of atmospheric science, environmental protection, air pollution, and ecological environment to understand the global spatial-temporal variations and main driving factors of aerosol loadings.

TI  - The Influence of Underlying Land Cover on the Accuracy of MODIS C6.1 Aerosol Products-A Case Study over the Yangtze River Delta Region of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the significant spatial variation of the performance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals, validation is very important for applications of MODIS AOD products at regional scales. This study presents a comparative analysis of Collection 6.1 MODIS AOD retrievals and ground measurements from five local sites and one Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, which significantly complements the previous validation that utilized limited AERONET measurements. Generally, MODIS AOD retrievals showed a reasonable agreement with collocated ground measurements (R-2 > 0.7), with 66% of Dark Target (DT) 10 km retrievals, 56% of Deep Blue (DB) 10 km retrievals, and 69% of DT 3 km retrievals falling within the expected error (EE = +/-(0.05 + 0.2 x AOD)). Nevertheless, it was found that the DT AOD retrievals tended to be overestimated over urbanized and lakeside sites, while the DB AOD retrievals tended to be underestimated over all ground sites except for lakeside sites. Such patterns appeared to be linked with the systematic biases of the single-scattering albedo estimation in the AOD retrieval algorithms. Another significant finding of this study is that the uncertainties of the MODIS AOD retrievals were highly correlated with the land cover proportions of urbanized features and water (LCP_UW) in the surrounding region, especially for the DT products. An empirical correction method based on these correlations could substantially reduce the uncertainties of DT AOD products over high LCP_UW areas. The results not only highlight the significant impacts of both urban and water areas on the MODIS AOD retrieval algorithms but also create new possibilities to correct such impacts once the universal correlations between LCP_UW and the uncertainty measures are established.

TI  - Deep learning prediction of axillary lymph node status using ultrasound images
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the ability of our convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict axillary lymph node metastasis using primary breast cancer ultrasound (US) images.Methods: In this IRB-approved study, 338 US images (two orthogonal images) from 169 patients from 1/2014-12/2016 were used. Suspicious lymph nodes were seen on US and patients subsequently underwent core biopsy. 64 patients had metastatic lymph nodes. A custom CNN was utilized on 248 US images from 124 patients in the training dataset and tested on 90 US images from 45 patients. The CNN was implemented entirely of 3 x 3 convolutional kernels and linear layers. The 9 convolutional kernels consisted of 6 residual layers, totaling 12 convolutional layers. Feature maps were down-sampled using strided convolutions. Dropout with a 0.5 keep probability and L2 normalization was utilized. Training was implemented by using the Adam optimizer and a final SoftMax score threshold of 0.5 from the average of raw logits from each pixel was used for two class classification (metastasis or not).Results: Our CNN achieved an AUC of 0.72 (SD +/- 0.08) in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis from US images in the testing dataset. The model had an accuracy of 72.6% (SD +/- 8.4) with a sensitivity and specificity of 65.5% (SD +/- 28.6) and 78.9% (SD +/- 15.1) respectively. Our algorithm is available to be shared for research use. (https://github.com/stmutasa/ MetUS).Conclusion: It's feasible to predict axillary lymph node metastasis from US images using a deep learning technique. This can potentially aid nodal staging in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Large-scale building height retrieval from single SAR imagery based on bounding box regression networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building height retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is of great importance for urban appli-cations, yet highly challenging due to the complexity of SAR data. This paper addresses the issue of building height retrieval in large-scale urban areas from a single TerraSAR-X spotlight or stripmap image. Based on the radar viewing geometry, we propose that this problem be formulated as a bounding box regression problem and therefore allows for integrating height data from multiple data sources in generating ground truth on a larger scale. We introduce building footprints from geographic information system (GIS) data as complementary in-formation and propose a bounding box regression network that exploits the location relationship between a building's footprint and its bounding box, enabling fast computation. The method is validated on four urban data sets using TerraSAR-X images in both high-resolution spotlight and stripmap modes. Experimental results show that the proposed network can reduce the computation cost significantly while keeping the height accuracy of individual buildings compared to a Faster R-CNN based method. Moreover, we investigate the impact of inac-curate GIS data on our proposed network, and this study shows that the bounding box regression network is robust against positioning errors in GIS data. The proposed method has great potential to be applied to regional or even global scales. Our code will be made publicly available at github.com/ya0-sun/bbox-SAR-building.

TI  - Farmland parcel-based crop classification in cloudy/rainy mountains using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 based deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal remote sensing data, especially those for key phenological periods, play an important role in crop classification. However, cloudy/rainy climate conditions can easily lead to a lack of valid optical data, leading to crop classification difficulties. A general solution is taking advantage of all-weather synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. In practice, SAR and optical datasets are often applied in the agricultural field by the method of image fusion, but it is difficult to apply when the number of optical images is too small. To solve this problem, this research proposes a data-transfer and feature-optimize-based method, which deploy an RNN-based encoding-decoding network to add additional data to the 'optical' temporal features at the farmland parcel scale and improve the utilization of optical fragments. On the basis of this method, we mitigate inconsistencies in spatial scale among different datasets and optimize the time-series parameters without expert knowledge in the crop classification procedure. The experimental results illustrate the crop classification accuracy of this method, which achieves a 4.1% improvement over the traditional approach and is especially effective for dryland crops (e.g. corn and rapeseed). Thus, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of the combined use of optical and SAR data for similar applications in cloudy/rainy mountainous areas.

TI  - Root Zone Soil Moisture Assessment at the Farm Scale Using Remote Sensing and Water Balance Models
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resource planning and management necessitates understanding soil moisture changes with depth in the root zone at the farm scale. For measuring soil moisture, remote sensing methods have been relatively successful. Soil moisture is estimated from image data, using in situ moisture and an empirical scattering model via regression fit analysis. However, in situ sensor data are prone to misinterpretations, requiring verification. Herein, we aimed at investigating the application of soil moisture from the water balance model towards verification of in situ soil moisture sensor data before in situ data was assessed for its relationship with remote sensing data. In situ soil moisture sensor data was obtained at 10 and 30 cm, and CROPWAT8.0 furnished root zone soil moisture data. The correlation between the in situ soil moisture at 10 and 30 cm was 0.78; the correlation between the soil moisture from CROPWAT8.0 and the in situ soil moisture were 0.64 and 0.62 at 10 and 30 cm, respectively. The R-2 between Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficients and in situ moisture were 0.74 and 0.68 at each depth, respectively. Therefore, the water balance model could verify sensor results before assessing in situ soil moisture data for relationship with remote sensing data.

TI  - RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF WORLD BOXING CHAMPIONS AS A FACTOR OF INFLUENCE ON UKRAINIAN SOCIETY IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The issue regarding the influence of mass media on the public consciousness is one of the priorities in the times of the digitalization of the information space. Great sports such as professional boxing are world-famous and have a wide resonance in the media. As a result, scientists are paying attention to the study of factors of influence that arise during the information coverage of sporting events. Religious beliefs are a conditional plane of differentiation of different worldview systems, but in the 21st century, they are harmoniously integrated into the colors of different cultures, nationalities, and states. Celebrities' religious beliefs can be influential factors that have certain results and consequences for society. This article considers the issue of social responsibility of world boxing champions for the public demonstration of their own religious beliefs as the example of the Ukrainian experience. The latter is relevant for the international community in the context of the rapid movement of Ukraine towards European integration and accession to NATO. The stated issues are considered in the example of media activity of Ukrainian world boxing champions, O. Usyk and V. Lomachenko. The problem is exacerbated against the background of the current Russian-Ukrainian hybrid war, where the plane of the religious worldview is actively used as a destructive factor of informational influence. In this context, this paper presents the data of the study of the coefficient of possibilities of informational influence of the Russian Federation on neighboring countries. The most resonant examples of media activity of Ukrainian world boxing champions on the topic of covering their own religious beliefs are demonstrated. Indicators of media potential of the influence of athletes' religious worldviews on society are analyzed.

TI  - Reducing unintended retained foreign objects in operating rooms: a proactive risk assessment framework to improve patient safety
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY AND RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - According to a study by Johns Hopkins, an average of 251,454 Americans die annually from medical errors. Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. after heart disease and cancer. Unintended retained foreign objects (URFOs) has been identified as the most common sentinel event by The Joint Commission. This paper proposes a proactive risk assessment framework to enhance patient safety in operating rooms by addressing the URFOs issue. This framework is developed by integrating the 10 traits of a positive safety culture, initially introduced by the nuclear industry and later adopted by other industries, with an accident investigation methodology called AcciMap, originally developed by Rasmussen.The AcciMap is a hierarchical framework consisting of several layers: government and regulatory bodies, company (hospital), (surgery division) management, (operating room) staff, and work. Thirty main categories of socio-technical contributing causes of URFOs were captured across the AcciMap layers. Organizational factors were identified as the root cause of questionable decisions made by staff and management. Financial and budget constraints, inadequate training infrastructure, absence of a risk management infrastructure, and leadership failure are the most influential organizational factors contributed to URFOs.Our mapping of the aforementioned positive safety culture traits on the AcciMap depicted that the four traits of Work Processes, Leadership Safety Values and Actions, Effective Communication, and Continuous Learning had the most influence on the URFOs issue. Associated recommendations to these findings are provided to contribute to reducing risks of URFOs instances.

TI  - Investigating groundwater recharge potential of Notwane catchment in Botswana using geophysical and geospatial tools
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: This study is conducted over the Notwane Catchment Area (NCA) in Southeastern Botswana using geospatial and geophysical tools. Study focus: Geospatial and geophysical tools, which provide spatial information for both the surface and subsurface have been widely used in groundwater exploration because of their capability in detecting physical properties that are related to groundwater phenomena. In this research, relevant remotely sensed data including aeromagnetic data and satellite images were used to identify potential groundwater recharge zones within the NCA as a contribution towards improved water resources management amid the changing climate. The multi-disciplinary approach used could offer a more reliable way to identify potential recharge zones, particularly in semi-arid hard rock terrains. New hydrological insights for the region: Assessment of groundwater recharge potential looking at remotely sensed data revealed that built-up areas expanded significantly between 2009 and 2019 with implications for run-off and flooding. Through aeromagnetic data interpretation of Euler deconvolution solutions and apparent susceptibility computations, weathered zones and geologic lineaments, mainly dykes and faults, indicating areas with increased secondary porosity were identified. Consequently, the groundwater recharge optimization model was used to determine areas with higher recharge potential which lie on the central part of the NCA, northeastern margin and the southernmost part bounded by topographical relief of hills with thick vegetation. These areas are characterized by approximately 200 m depth of weathering and predominantly east-west structural features.

TI  - Utility and Outcomes of Preoperative Screening Breast MRI for Planned Bilateral Prophylactic Mastectomy in High-Risk Patients
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND. There is a paucity of data and consensus guidelines on the utility of preoperative MRI for planned bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of breast MRI performed in high-risk patients for the indication of planned bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, with attention given to the diagnostic performance for breast cancer detection. A secondary aim was to assess the potential impact of breast MRI findings on the decision to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of prophylactic mastectomy.RESULTS. The final cohort included 53 patients (mean age, 45 years). Most (35/53; 66.0%) studies were baseline examinations. Of the 53 patients, 31 (58.5%) had negative MRI examinations and 22 (41.5%) had positive MRI examinations. MRI detected two malignancies (one invasive lobular carcinoma and one high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ), both of which were assessed as BI-RADS category 4. The patient with invasive lobular cancer underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of mastectomy, which showed metastasis. Breast MRI had sensitivity of 100.0% and specificity of 60.8% for overall breast cancer detection and sensitivity of 100.0% and specificity of 59.6% for invasive cancer detection.CONCLUSION. Preoperative MRI for planned bilateral prophylactic mastectomy detected all cancers, indicating a potential role for MRI in impacting surgical decision making.CLINICAL IMPACT. Given the high NPV for cancer, our results suggest that lymph node biopsy may be safely avoided in patients with a negative MRI examination. This is clinically relevant because sentinel nodes cannot be identified after mastectomy.

TI  - Detection of sinkhole activity in West-Central Florida using InSAR time series observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinkhole activity in Florida is a major hazard for people and property. Its increasing frequency is often related to an accelerated use of ground-water and land resources in the region. In this work, we use a combined approach of radar interferometry and spatial clustering analysis over three selected sites in West-Central Florida to identify localized deformation that may be caused by sinkhole activity. The region of West-Central Florida is a densely active sinkhole region, where sinkholes tend to be small and land cover is mixed resulting in variable interferometric coherence that complicates Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surveys. In this work, we present a combined methodology implementing InSAR and a Density-Based Spatial Clustering Analysis (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect unknown sinkhole activity and to alert to possible precursors of sinkhole collapse. The data used for the study consist of acquisitions from three TerraSAR-X frames covering time spans of similar to 1.7 and 2.5 years with spatial resolutions ranging from 25 cm up to 1 m. We applied the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) and confirmed the observed deformation signals by also processing the data using the SAR PROcessing tool (SARPROZ). Results show several areas of localized subsidence, from which the cluster with highest rates for each site was selected for detailed inspection. Locations of selected clusters were found in buildings with sizes ranging from 300 m(2) to nearly 2000 m(2), with subsidence trends ranging from -3 to -6 mm/yr. Results were compared with in-situ observations such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys, visual structural inspection and public county archive documents to help as ground truthing; subsiding locations were found to be related to sinkhole presence or development.

TI  - Siberian taiga and tundra fire regimes from 2001-2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Circum-boreal and -tundra systems are crucial carbon pools that are experiencing amplified warming and are at risk of increasing wildfire activity. Changes in wildfire activity have broad implications for vegetation dynamics, underlying permafrost soils, and ultimately, carbon cycling. However, understanding wildfire effects on biophysical processes across eastern Siberian taiga and tundra remains challenging because of the lack of an easily accessible annual fire perimeter database and underestimation of area burned by MODIS satellite imagery. To better understand wildfire dynamics over the last 20 years in this region, we mapped area burned, generated a fire perimeter database, and characterized fire regimes across eight ecozones spanning 7.8 million km(2) of eastern Siberian taiga and tundra from similar to 61-72.5 degrees N and 100 degrees E-176 degrees W using long-term satellite data from Landsat, processed via Google Earth Engine. We generated composite images for the annual growing season (May-September), which allowed mitigation of missing data from snow-cover, cloud-cover, and the Landsat 7 scan line error. We used annual composites to calculate the difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) for each year. The annual dNBR images were converted to binary burned or unburned imagery that was used to vectorize fire perimeters. We mapped 22 091 fires burning 152 million hectares (Mha) over 20 years. Although 2003 was the largest fire year on record, 2020 was an exceptional fire year for four of the northeastern ecozones resulting in substantial increases in fire activity above the Arctic Circle. Increases in fire extent, severity, and frequency with continued climate warming will impact vegetation and permafrost dynamics with increased likelihood of irreversible permafrost thaw that leads to increased carbon release and/or conversion of forest to shrublands.

TI  - On-Orbit Radiometric Performance of GF-7 Satellite Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China's first civilian, sub-meter, high-resolution stereo mapping satellite, GF-7, launched on 3 November 2019. Radiometric characterization of GF-7 multispectral imagery has been performed in this study. A relative radiometric accuracy evaluation of the GF-7 multispectral imagery was performed using several large uniform scenes, and the results showed that the accuracy is better than 2%. The absolute radiometric evaluation of the GF-7 satellite sensor was conducted at the Baotou and Dunhuang calibration sites, using the reflectance-based vicarious approach. The synchronous measurements of surface reflectance and atmospheric parameters were collected as the input for the radiative transfer model. The official radiometrically calibrated coefficient of the GF-7 multispectral imagery was evaluated with the predicted top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance from the radiative transfer model. The results indicated that the absolute radiometric accuracy of GF-7 multispectral imagery is better than 5%. In order to monitor the radiometric stability of the GF-7 satellite multispectral sensor, a relative and absolute radiometric accuracy assessment campaign should be performed several times a year.

TI  - Changes of Chinese Coastal Regions Induced by Land Reclamation as Revealed through TanDEM-X DEM and InSAR Analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese coastal topography has changed significantly over the last two decades due to human actions such as the development of extensive land reclamation projects. Newly-reclaimed lands typically have low elevations (<10 m) and often experience severe ground subsidence. These conditions, combined with the more frequent occurrence of extreme sea-level events amplified by global climate change, lead to an increased risk of flooding of coastal regions. This work focuses on twelve Chinese coastal areas that underwent significant changes from 2000 to 2015 in their environments, correlated to relevant land reclamation projects. First, the ground changes between 2000 and 2015 were roughly computed by comparing the TanDEM-X and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation models of the investigated areas. These results indicate that six of the analyzed coastal zones have reclaimed more than 200 km(2) of new lands from 2000 to 2015, with five of them in northern China. Second, we focused specifically on the city of Shanghai, and characterized the risk of flood in this area. To this purpose, two independent sets of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected at the X- and C-band through the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and the European Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S-1) sensors were exploited. We assumed that the still extreme seawater depth is chi-square distributed, and estimated the probability of waves overtopping the coast. We also evaluated the impact on the territory of potential extreme flood events by counting the number of very-coherent objects (at most anthropic, such as buildings and public infrastructures) that could be seriously affected by a flood. To forecast possible inundation patterns, we used the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model. Assuming that an extreme event destroyed a given sector of the coastline, we finally computed the extent of the flooded areas and quantified its impact in terms of coherent structures potentially damaged by the inundation. Experimental results showed that two coastline segments located in the southern districts of Shanghai, where the seawalls height is lower, had the highest probability of wave overtopping and the most significant density of coherent objects potentially subjected to severe flood impacts.

TI  - Effects of desertification and degradation on carbon sequestration of grassland ecosystem in Gannan
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - As the second largest carbon pool of the world, terrestrial ecosystems have always been a hot research field with respect to the responses of their carbon budget to climate change. Most studies mainly focus on the effects of temperature, humidity , and CO2 concentration on carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems , but the studies on the effects of desertification and degradation of grasslands on carbon sequestration processes of vegetation are relatively insufficient. In this study, we used remote sensing data with a spatial resolution of 30 mx30 m, to decipher grassland desertification and degradation data with a reference of the national standard GB/T 24255-2009. We simulated gross primary productivity ( GPP ) , net primary productivity ( NPP ) and net ecosystem productivity ( NEP) with a remote sensing model of light energy utilization. We analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation carbon sequestration and the role of grassland desertification and degradation in Gannan. The grassland mainly presented a state of no desertification or light desertification, and was accompanied by small dispersed areas of land degradation with varying degrees. Among them, grassland desertification and degradation were relatively serious in Maqu County. Grassland desertification and degradation areas accounted for 0.03% and 2.50% of the total study area, respectively. The GPP , NPP , and NEP of grassland in Gannan were characterized by monthly increasing in the first half of the year and decreasing in the second half of the year. The spatial pattern was characterized by the distribution of high in the east and low in the west, high in the north and low in the south. Maqu was the county with the largest annual carbon sequestration of grassland (691.28 t C . a(-1)). Among all the counties, only Zhouqu County was a carbon source, with a NEP of -88.64 t C . a(-1). GPP , NPP , and NEP showed a significant decreasing trend along with extremely severe, severe, moderate, light, and no desertification, while grassland degradation did not affect GPP , NPP , and NEP in Gannan. Our results provide basis for revealing the dynamic mechanism of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle and data support for the formulation of carbon emission reduction policies in Gannan.

TI  - Assessing Performances of Multivariate Data Assimilation Algorithms with SMOS, SMAP, and GRACE Observations for Improved Soil Moisture and Groundwater Analyses
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Multivariate data assimilation (DA) of satellite soil moisture (SM) and terrestrial water storage (TWS) observations has recently been used to improve SM and groundwater storage (GWS) simulations. Previous studies employed the ensemble Kalman approach in multivariate DA schemes, which assumes that model and observation errors have a Gaussian distribution. Despite the success of the Kalman approaches, SM and GWS estimates can be suboptimal when the Gaussian assumption is violated. Other DA approaches, such as particle smoother (PS), ensemble Gaussian particle smoother (EnGPS), and evolutionary smoother (EvS), do not rely on the Gaussian assumption and may be better suited to non-Gaussian error systems. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of these four DA approaches (EnKS, PS, EnGPS, and EvS) in multivariate DA systems by assimilating satellite data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions into the Community Atmosphere and Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model. The analyses are carried out in Australia's Goulburn River catchment, where in situ SM and groundwater data are available to comprehensively validate the DA performance. Results show that all four DA approaches have outstanding performances and improve correlation coefficients of SM and GWS estimates by similar to 20% and 100%, respectively. The EvS outperforms the others, but its benefit is relatively marginal compared to Gaussian approaches (e.g., EnKS). This is due to the fact that SM and TWS error distributions in this study are close to Gaussian: a suitable condition for, e.g., EnKS, EnGPS. The robust performance of EvS appears to be the optimal approach for jointly assimilating multi-source hydrological observations to improve regional hydrological analyses.

TI  - A Google Earth Engine Approach for Wildfire Susceptibility Prediction Fusion with Remote Sensing Data of Different Spatial Resolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of the spatial resolution of remote sensing (RS) data on wildfire susceptibility prediction are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluate the effects of coarse (Landsat 8 and SRTM) and medium (Sentinel-2 and ALOS) spatial resolution data on wildfire susceptibility prediction using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models. In addition, we investigate the fusion of the predictions from the different spatial resolutions using the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) and 14 wildfire conditioning factors. Seven factors are derived separately from the coarse and medium spatial resolution datasets for the whole forest area of the Guilan Province, Iran. All conditional factors are used to train and test the SVM and RF models in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) software environment, along with an inventory dataset from comprehensive global positioning system (GPS)-based field survey points of wildfire locations. These locations are evaluated and combined with coarse resolution satellite data, namely the thermal anomalies product of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period 2009 to 2019. We assess the performance of the models using four-fold cross-validation by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method. The area under the curve (AUC) achieved from the ROC curve yields 92.15% and 91.98% accuracy for the respective SVM and RF models for the coarse RS data. In comparison, the AUC for the medium RS data is 92.5% and 93.37%, respectively. Remarkably, the highest AUC value of 94.71% is achieved for the RF model where coarse and medium resolution datasets are combined through DST.

TI  - Suitable Habitat Dynamics of Wintering Geese in a Large Floodplain Wetland: Insights from Flood Duration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between hydrological variation and the habitat use of waterbirds in wetland complexes is a significant field of ecological research. Quantification of the relationships between wetland hydrological attributes and waterbirds distribution is critical for the success of waterbird conservation. In this study, flood duration (FD) derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was combined with geese GPS tracking data to quantify the optimal FD thresholds for identifying geese habitats. Based on the thresholds, we defined the suitable habitats of wintering geese and investigated the difference in the spatial distribution pattern of habitat from 2018 to 2020 in Poyang Lake, China. We also considered the role of sub-lakes in habitat protection. The results showed that the area of suitable habitats for wintering geese decreased in both dry and wet years, and the range of optimal FD threshold was wider in normal years than in both dry and wet years. The proportion of suitable habitats per unit area was greater in the sub-lakes than in the whole Poyang Lake. We concluded that FD indices extracted from SAR data are valuable for reflecting the influence of the pattern of hydrological variation on waterbird distribution and for the protection and rational use of wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Comparison of Three Water Indices for Tropical Aquaculture Ponds Extraction using Google Earth Engine
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the spatial distribution of aquaculture ponds, especially the inland brackish aquaculture, is crucial for effective and sustainable aquaculture management. Google Earth Engine (GEE) has been utilized to quickly map aquaculture ponds in different parts of the world, but the application is still limited in tropical regions. Selection of an optimal water index is essential to accurately map the aquaculture ponds from the Landsat 8 satellite images that are available in GEE. This study aims to evaluate the capability of three different water indices, namely Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), in mapping of the aquaculture ponds in Sungai Udang, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. The results show that MNDWI is the best index for aquaculture ponds extraction in Sungai Udang, with an accuracy of 81.87% and Kappa coefficient of 0.61. Meanwhile, the accuracy of NDWI and AWEI as compared to the digitized aquaculture ponds are 58.21 and 61.60%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.33 and 0.36, respectively. Then, MNDWI was applied to calculate the spatial changes of aquaculture ponds from 2014 to 2020. The result indicates that the area of aquaculture ponds has expanded by 26.16% since the past seven years.

TI  - A First Assessment of Canopy Cover Loss in Germany's Forests after the 2018-2020 Drought Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Europe was hit by several unusually strong periods of drought and heat between 2018 and 2020. These droughts affected forest ecosystems. Cascading effects with bark beetle infestations in spruce stands were fatal to vast forest areas in Germany. We present the first assessment of canopy cover loss in Germany for the period of January 2018-April 2021. Our approach makes use of dense Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 time-series data. We computed the disturbance index (DI) from the tasseled cap components brightness, greenness, and wetness. Using quantiles, we generated monthly DI composites and calculated anomalies in a reference period (2017). From the resulting map, we calculated the canopy cover loss statistics for administrative entities. Our results show a canopy cover loss of 501,000 ha for Germany, with large regional differences. The losses were largest in central Germany and reached up to two-thirds of coniferous forest loss in some districts. Our map has high spatial (10 m) and temporal (monthly) resolution and can be updated at any time.

TI  - Improving surface soil moisture retrievals through a novel assimilation algorithm to estimate both model and observation errors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture controls the land surface water and energy budget and plays a crucial role in land surface processes. Based on certain mathematical rules, data assimilation can merge satellite observations and land surface models, and produce spatiotemporally continuous profile soil moisture. The two mainstream assimilation algorithms (variational-based and sequential-based) both need model error and observation error estimates, which greatly impact the assimilation results. Moreover, the performance of land data assimilation relies heavily on the specification of model parameters. However, it is always challenging to specify these errors and model parameters. In this study, a dual-cycle assimilation algorithm was proposed for addressing the above issue. In the inner cycle, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is run with parameters of both model and observation operators and their errors, which are provided by the outer cycle. Both the analyzed state variable and the innovation are reserved at each analysis moment. In the outer cycle, the innovation time series kept by the inner cycle are fed into a likelihood function to adjust the values of parameters of both the model and observation operators and their errors through an optimization algorithm. A series of assimilation experiments were first performed based on the Lorenz-63 model. The results illustrate that the performance of the dual-cycle algorithm substantially surpasses those of both the classical parameter calibration and the standard EnKF. Subsequently, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer of earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures were assimilated into the simple biosphere model scheme version 2 (SiB2) with a radiative transfer model as the observation operator in two experimental areas, namely Naqu on the Tibetan Plateau and a Coordinate Enhanced Observing (CEOP) reference site in Mongolia. The results indicate that the dual-cycle assimilation algorithm can simultaneously estimate model parameters, observation operator parameters, model error, and observation error, thus improving surface soil moisture estimation in comparison with other assimilation algorithms. Since the dualcycle assimilation algorithm can estimate the observation errors, it provides the potential for assimilating multi-source remote sensing data to generate physically consistent land surface state and flux estimates.

TI  - Coseismic Slip Model of the 2021 Maduo Earthquake, China from Sentinel-1 InSAR Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2021 Maduo earthquake occurred in the interior of the Bayan Har block of the Tibetan Plateau. We used space-born radar interferometry to study the coseismic deformation of this earthquake. Sentinel-1 InSAR observations along ascending and descending orbits provide the coseismic deformation. Pixel offset tracking method is used to complement InSAR observations near the rupture zone. The surface trace of the ruptured fault can be clearly mapped by InSAR observations. We constructed a three-dimensional coseismic slip model constrained by interferograms and pixel offset tracking in the form of a geodetic inverse problem. The coseismic slip model demonstrates that: (1) the Maduo earthquake was a left-lateral strike-slip event with moment magnitude of 7.4; (2) the peak slip is approximately 8 m and is located at a depth of 4 km; (3) a 'shallow slip deficit' of the Maduo earthquake is observed; (4) the ruptured faults are found to be dipping northward with a high dipping angle (80 degrees). This study has important implications on earthquake hazard evaluation of the Bayan Har block.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Endometrial Cancer: Dual Injection, Dual Tracer-A Multidisciplinary Exhaustive Approach to Nodal Staging
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Since clinical guidelines accepted the utilization of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in apparent uterine-confined endometrial cancer (EC), many centers have already used it as a standard staging surgery. The most widely accepted tracer is ICG alone, but several studies comment on the importance of surgeon experience in order not to lose sensitivity in the first 30-40 cases. This is a prospective, observational single-center trial designed to improve SLN detection rate specially during learning curve. The application of dual tracer (indocyanine green (ICG) and Technetium99 (Tc99) injected separately) helps us to reach a very good overall and bilateral SLN pelvic detection rate in early-stage endometrial cancer patients. Dual injection (cervical and fundal) improves para-aortic SLN detection rate. Introduction: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) has recently been introduced as a standard staging technique in endometrial cancer (EC). There are some issues regarding team experience and para-aortic detection. Objective: to report the accuracy of SLN detection in EC with a dual tracer (ICG and Tc99) and dual injection site (cervix and fundus) during the learning curve. Methods: A prospective, observational single-center trial including 48 patients diagnosed with early-stage EC. Dual intracervical tracer (Tc99 and ICG) was injected at different times. High-risk patients had a second fundus injection with both tracers. Results: the detection rates were as follows: 100% (48/48) overall for SLNs; 98% (47/48) overall for pelvic SLNs; 89.5% (43/48) for bilateral SLNs; and 2% (1/48) for isolated para-aortic SLNs. In high-risk patients, the para-aortic overall DR was 66.7% (22/33); 60.7% (17/28) with ICG and 51.5% (17/33) with Tc99 (p = 0.048)). Overall rate of lymph node involvement was 14.6% (7/48). Macroscopic pelvic metastasis was found in four patients (8.3%) and microscopic in one case (2%). No metastasis was found in any para-aortic SLNs. Half of the patients with positive pelvic SLNs had positive para-aortic nodes. In high-risk patients, when para-aortic SLNs mapped failed, 36.4% (4/11) had positive nodes in para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of SLN pelvic detection was 100%. Conclusions: Multidisciplinary exhaustive approach gives a suitable accuracy of SLN during learning curve. Dual injection (cervical and fundal) with dual tracer (ICG and Tc99) offers good overall detection rates and increases para-aortic SLN detection.

TI  - An Object-Oriented Approach to the Classification of Roofing Materials Using Very High-Resolution Satellite Stereo-Pairs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of multispectral images, with both high spatial and spectral resolution, makes it possible to obtain valuable information about complex urban environment, reducing the need for more expensive surveying techniques. Here, a methodology is tested for the semiautomatic extraction of buildings and the mapping of the main roofing materials over a urban area of approximately 100 km(2), including the entire city of Bologna (Italy). The methodology follows an object-oriented approach and exploits a limited number of training samples. After a validation based on field inspections and close-range photos acquired by a drone, the final map achieved an overall accuracy of 94% (producer accuracy 79%) regarding the building extraction and of 91% for the classification of the roofing materials. The proposed approach proved to be flexible enough to catch the strong variability of the urban texture in different districts and can be easily reproducible in other contexts, as only satellite imagery is required for the mapping.

TI  - Flood Hazard and Risk Zonation in North Bihar Using Satellite-Derived Historical Flood Events and Socio-Economic Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - North Bihar is one of the most flood-affected regions of India. Frequent flooding caused significant loss of life and severe economic damages. In this study, hydroclimatic conditions and historical flood events during the period of 2001 to 2020 were coupled over different basins in North Bihar. The main objective of this study is to assess the severity of floods by estimating flood hazards, vulnerability and risk in North Bihar. The uniqueness of this study is to assess flood risk at the village level as no such study was performed earlier. Other thematic data, namely, land-use and drainage networks, were also utilised with flood maps to validate the severity of the event. MOD09A1 satellite data (during 2001-2020) derived indices were used to derive inundation extents and flood frequency. Socio-economic vulnerability (SEV) was derived based on seven census parameters (i.e., population density, house-hold density, literacy rate, agricultural labour, and cultivator, total male, and female) and coupled with flood hazard to derive flood risk over the study region. The study exhibited that a total ~34% of the geographical area of North Bihar was inundated in the last 20 years and the maximum flood extent was seen in 2020. Flood risk map exhibited that ~7%, ~8%, ~13%, ~4%, and ~2% of the geographical area was mapped under Very High, High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low categories, respectively. The 2770 and 3535 number of villages was categorized under Very High and High flood risk zone which are located in north-central and central-western regions. These findings can be applied to distinguish and classify areas of various risk zones to assist in flood mitigation and management activities.

TI  - Non-seasonal Landsat based bare area gain detection in Botswana during 2002 to 2020 Period using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC)
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper estimates bare area gain detected using cloud free Landsat 7 (ETM+) and Landsat 8 (OLI) in Botswana. From 2002 to 2020, agricultural fields shrunk by 76.4%, while built-up increased by 49.2%, and bare areas increased from 3.32% to 7.03% (or 111.7%). There is a significant seasonal change in bare area detected reaching maximum during the dry season when there is little or no ground cover. In this study, the seasonality of bare area gain was overcome by only considering a bare area pixel to contribute to bare area gain if it exists during both the winter and summer months. The probability of bare area detection was 75.0% and probability of false detection 13.3% respectively. The 13% false detection tended to be built-up areas which had similar spectral characteristics as bare areas since most built-up areas have no ground cover. The bare area gain is driven by the high population growth rate of 3.4%. From 2001 to 2017, the population of the study area has increased by 34% and now accounts for 47% of the population of Botswana.

TI  - Kinematics of Active Landslides in Achaia (Peloponnese, Greece) through InSAR Time Series Analysis and Relation to Rainfall Patterns
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the kinematic behaviour of active landslides at several localities in the area of Panachaikon Mountain, Achaia (Peloponnese, Greece) using Sentinel (C-band) InSAR time series analysis. We processed LiCSAR interferograms using the SBAS tool, and we obtained average displacement maps for the period 2016-2021. We found that the maximum displacement rate of each landslide is located at about the center of it. The average E-W velocity of the Krini landslide is similar to 3 cm/year (toward the east) and 0.6 cm/year downward. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the landslide (descending orbit) compares well to a co-located GNSS station within (+/-) 3 mm/yr. Our results also suggest a correlation between rainfall and landslide motion. For the Krini landslide, a cross-correlation analysis of our data suggests that the mean time lag was 13.5 days between the maximum seasonal rainfall and the change in the LOS displacement rate. We also found that the amount of total seasonal rainfall controls the increase in the displacement rate, as 40-550% changes in the displacement rate of the Krini landslide were detected, following to a seasonal maximum of rainfall values at the nearby meteorological station of Kato Vlassia. According to our results, it seems that large part of this mountainous region of Achaia suffers from slope instability that is manifested in various degrees of ground displacement greatly affecting its morphological features and inhabited areas.

TI  - Developing and Testing Remote-Sensing Indices to Represent within-Field Variation of Wheat Yields: Assessment of the Variation Explained by Simple Models
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - One important issue faced by wheat producers is temporal and spatial yield variation management at a within-field scale. Vegetation indices derived from remote-sensing platforms, such as Landsat, can provide vital information characterising this variability and allow crop yield indicators development to map productivity. However, the most appropriate vegetation index and crop growth stage for use in yield mapping is often unclear. This study considered vegetation indices and growth stages selection and built and tested models to predict within-field yield variation. We used 48 wheat yield monitor maps to build linear-mixed models for predicting yield that were tested using leave-one-field-out cross-validation. It was found that some of the simplest models were not improved upon (by more complex models) for the prediction of the spatial pattern of the high and low yielding areas (the within-field yield ranking). In addition, predictions of longer-term average yields were generally more accurate than predictions of yield for single years. Therefore, the predictions over multiple years are valuable for revealing consistent spatial patterns in yield. The results demonstrate the potential and limitations of tools based on remote-sensing data that might provide growers with better knowledge of within-field variation to make more informed management decisions.

TI  - Co-Registration Methods and Error Analysis for Four Decades (1979-2018) of Glacier Elevation Changes in the Southern Patagonian Icefield
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this paper is to compare two co-registration methods for geodetic mass balance (GMB) calculation in 28 glaciers making up the Upper Santa Cruz River basin, Southern Patagonian Icefield (SPI), from 1979 to 2018. For this purpose, geospatial data have been used as primary sources: Hexagon KH-9, ASTER, and LANDSAT optical images; SRTM digital radar elevation model; and ICESat elevation profiles. After the analyses, the two co-registration methods, namely M1, based on horizontal displacements and 3D shift vectors, and M2, based on three-dimensional transformations, turned out to be similar. The errors in the GMB were analyzed through a k index that considers, among other variables, the error in elevation change by testing four interpolation methods for filling gaps. We found that, in 63% of the cases, the relative error in elevation change contributes 90% or more to k index. The GMB throughout our study area reported that a loss value of -1.44 +/- 0.15 m w. e. a(-1) (-3.0 Gt a(-1)) and an ice thinning median of -1.38 +/- 0.11 m a(-1) occurred within the study period. The glaciers that showed the most negative GMB values were Upsala, with an annual elevation change median of -2.07 +/- 0.18 m w. e. a(-1), and Ameghino, with -2.31 +/- 0.22 m w. e. a(-1).

TI  - The Use of C-Band and X-Band SAR with Machine Learning for Detecting Small-Scale Mining
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Illicit small-scale mining occurs in many tropical regions and is both environmentally and socially hazardous. The aim of this study was to determine whether the classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery could detect and map small-scale mining in Ghana by analyzing multi-temporal filtering applied to three SAR datasets and testing five machine-learning classifiers. Using an object-based image analysis approach, we were successful in classifying water bodies associated with small-scale mining. The multi-temporally filtered Sentinel-1 dataset was the most reliable, with kappa coefficients at 0.65 and 0.82 for the multi-class classification scheme and binary-water classification scheme, respectively. The single-date Sentinel-1 dataset has the highest overall accuracy, at 90.93% for the binary water classification scheme. The KompSAT-5 dataset achieved the lowest accuracy at an overall accuracy of 80.61% and a kappa coefficient of 0.61 for a binary-water classification scheme. The experimental results demonstrated that it is possible to classify water as a proxy to identify illegal mining activities and that SAR is a potentially accurate and reliable solution for the detection of SSM in tropical regions such as Ghana. Therefore, using SAR can assist local governments in regulating small-scale mining activities by providing specific spatial information on the whereabouts of small-scale mining locations.

TI  - The Determination of the Snow Optical Grain Diameter and Snowmelt Area on the Greenland Ice Sheet Using Spaceborne Optical Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical diameter of the surface snow grains impacts the amount of energy absorbed by the surface and therefore the onset and magnitude of surface melt. Snow grains respond to surface heating through grain metamorphism and growth. During melt, liquid water between the grains markedly increases the optical grain size, as wet snow grain clusters are optically equivalent to large grains. We present daily surface snow grain optical diameters (d(opt)) retrieved from the Greenland ice sheet at 1 km resolution for 2017-2019 using observations from Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3A. The retrieved d(opt) are evaluated against 3 years of in situ measurements in Northeast Greenland. We show that higher d(opt) are indicative of surface melt as calculated from meteorological measurements at four PROMICE automatic weather stations. We deduce a threshold value of 0.64 mm in d(opt) allowing categorization of the days either as melting or nonmelting. We apply this simple melt detection technique in Northeast Greenland and compare the derived melting areas with the conventional passive microwave MEaSUREs melt flag for June 2019. The two flags show generally consistent evolution of the melt extent although we highlight areas where large grain diameters are strong indicators of melt but are missed by the MEaSUREs melt flag. While spatial resolution of the optical grain diameter-based melt flag is higher than passive microwave, it is hampered by clouds. Our retrieval remains suitable to study melt at a local to regional scales and could be in the future combined with passive microwave melt flags for increased coverage.

TI  - Space-Time Dynamics of Land Use in the Municipality of Goianesia Do Para, Brazil
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydroelectric energy generates more than 50% of all renewable electricity in the world. The Amazon is home to a large part of these ventures, promoted as a strategy of energy independence in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the countries of the region. However, these hydroelectric plants lead to changes in land cover, fragmentation, degradation, and loss of tropical forests. This article analyzes the spatial pattern of alterations in the land cover of the municipality of Goianesia do Para, one of the seven municipalities affected by the artificial lake of the Tucurui hydroelectric plant. This case study integrates remote sensing and landscape metrics to identify, quantify, and spatialize the loss of tropical forest within the municipality by using satellite images of the TM-Landsat 5, ETM+-Landsat 7 and OLI-Landsat 8 sensors. The results show that the average deforestation rates were high in the first two periods: 1984-1988 (23,101.2 ha per year) and 1988-1999 (13,428.6 ha per year). However, this rate drastically fell in the last period because, by 2010, more than 60% of the territory was already deforested, which shows the consolidation of the municipality's deforestation process.

TI  - Long-Term Series of Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration in Brazilian Semiarid Lakes from Modis Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - By monitoring the chlorophyll a concentration (chla), it is possible to keep track of the eutrophication status of a lake and to describe the temporal dynamics of the phytoplankton biomass. Such monitoring must be both extensive and intensive to account for the short- and long-term biomass variations. This may be achieved by the remote estimation of chla through an orbital sensor with high temporal resolution. In this study, we used MODIS imagery to produce 21-year time series of chla for three strategic lakes of the Brazilian semi-arid region: Eng. Armando Ribeiro Goncalves, Castanhao, and Oros. We used data collected in 13 lakes of the region to test new and published regression models for chla estimation. The selected model was validated and applied to daily MODIS images for the three largest lakes. The resulting chla time series revealed that the temporal dynamics of the phytoplankton biomass is associated with the hydraulic regime of the lakes, with chla plummeting upon intense water renewal and keeping high during persistent dry periods. The intense rainy season of 2004 reduced the phytoplankton biomass and its effects even extended to the subsequent years. Our results encourage the exploration of the MODIS archived imagery in limnological studies.

TI  - A Cloud-Based Mapping Approach Using Deep Learning and Very-High Spatial Resolution Earth Observation Data to Facilitate the SDG 11.7.1 Indicator Computation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As urbanized areas continue to expand rapidly across all continents, the United Nations adopted in 2015 the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, aimed at shaping a sustainable future for city dwellers. Earth Observation (EO) satellite data can provide at a fine scale, essential urban land use information for computing SDG 11 indicators in order to complement or even replace inaccurate or invalid existing spatial datasets. This study proposes an EO-based approach for extracting large scale information regarding urban open spaces (UOS) and land allocated to streets (LAS) at the city level, for calculating SDG indicator 11.7.1. The research workflow was developed over the Athens metropolitan area in Greece using deep learning classification models for processing PlanetScope and Sentinel-1 imagery, employing freely-available cloud environments offered by Google. The LAS model exhibited satisfactory results while the best experiment performance for mapping UOS, considering both PlanetScope and Sentinel-1 data, yielded high commission errors, however, the cross-validation analysis with the UOS area of OpenStreetMap exhibited a total overlap of 67.38%, suggesting that our workflow is suitable for creating a "potential" UOS layer. The methodology developed herein can serve as a roadmap for the calculation of indicator 11.7.1 through national statistical offices when spatial data are absent or unreliable.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a and Sea Surface Temperature Changes in Relation to Paralytic Shellfish Toxin Production off the East Coast of Tasmania, Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxic phytoplankton have been detrimental to the fishing and aquaculture industry on the east coast of Tasmania, causing millions of dollars in loss due to contaminated seafood. In 2012-2017, shellfish stocks were poisoned by Alexandrium catenella, a dinoflagellate species that produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PST). Remote sensing data may provide an environmental context for the drivers of PST events in Tasmania. We conducted spatial and temporal trend analyses of the Multi-Scale Ultra-High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (MUR SST) and Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative chlorophyll-a (OC-CCI chl-a) to determine if SST and chl-a correlated with the major toxin increases from 2012 to 2017. Along with the trends, we compare the remotely sensed oceanographic parameters of SST and chl-a to toxin events off the east coast of Tasmania to provide environmental context for the high-toxin period. Spatial and temporal changes for chl-a differ based on the north, central, and southeast coast of Tasmania. For sites in the north, chl-a was 5.3% higher from the pre-PST period relative to the PST period, 5.1% along the central part of the coast, and by 6.0% in the south based on deviations from the coastal study area time series. Overall, SST has slightly decreased from 2007 to 2020 (tau = -0.011, p = 0.827) and chl-a has significantly decreased for the east coast (tau = -0.164, p = 1.58 x 10(-3)). A negative relationship of SST and PST values occurred in the north (r = -0.530, p = 5.32 x 10(-5)) and central sites (r = -0.225, p = 0.157). The correlation between satellite chl-a (from OC-CCI, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Aqua) and in situ data is weak, which makes it difficult to assess relationships present between chl-a and toxin concentrations. Moving forward, the development of a regional chl-a algorithm and increased in situ chl-a collection and plankton sampling at a species level will help to improve chl-a measurements and toxic phytoplankton production monitoring around Tasmania.

TI  - Enhancing Spatial Resolution of SMAP Soil Moisture Products through Spatial Downscaling over a Large Watershed: A Case Study for the Susquehanna River Basin in the Northeastern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) with a high spatial resolution plays a paramount role in many local and regional hydrological and agricultural applications. The advent of L-band passive microwave satellites allowed for it to be possible to measure near-surface SM at a global scale compared to in situ measurements. However, their use is often limited because of their coarse spatial resolution. Aiming to address this limitation, random forest (RF) models are adopted to downscale the SMAP level-3 (L3SMP, 36 km) and SMAP enhanced (L3SMP_E, 9 km) SM to 1 km. A suite of predictors derived from the Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and MODIS is used in the downscaling process. The RF models are separately trained and verified at both spatial scales (i.e., 36 and 9 km) considering two experiments: (1) using predictors derived from the MODIS and Sentinel-1 along with other predictors such as elevation and brightness temperature and (2) using all predictors of the first experiment except for the Sentinel-1 predictors. Only dates when the Sentinel-1 images were available are considered for the comparison of the two experiments. The comparison of the results of the two experiments indicates that the removal of Sentinel-1 predictors from the second experiment only reduces the R value from 0.84 to 0.83 and from 0.91 to 0.86 for 36 and 9 km spatial scales, respectively. Among the predictors used in the downscaling, the brightness temperature in VV polarization is identified as the most important predictor, followed by NDVI, surface albedo and API. On the contrary, the Sentinel-1 predictors play a less important role with no marked contribution in enhancing the predictive accuracy of RF models. In general, the two experiments have limitation, such as a small sample size for the training of the RF model because of the scarcity of Sentinel-1 images (i.e., revisit time of 12 days). Therefore, based on this limitation, a third experiment is proposed, in which the Sentinel-1 predictors are not considered at all in the training of the RF models. The results of the third experiment show a good agreement between the downscaled L3SMP and L3SMP_E SM, and in situ SM measurements at both spatial scales. In addition, the temporal availability of the downscaled SM increased. Moreover, the downscaled SM from both SMAP products presented greater spatial detail while preserving the spatial patterns found in their original products. The use of the two SMAP SM products as background fields for the downscaling process does not show marked differences. Overall, this study demonstrates encouraging results in the downscaling of SMAP SM products over humid climate with warm summers dominated by vegetation.

TI  - Assessment of Ocean Swell Height Observations from Sentinel-1A/B Wave Mode against Buoy In Situ and Modeling Hindcasts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in wave mode is a powerful tool for monitoring sea states in terms of long-period ocean swells of a specific wave directional partition. Since 2016, SARs aboard Sentinel-1A/B operating in wave mode have provided ocean swell spectra dataset as Level-2 Ocean products on a continuous and global basis over open oceans. Furthermore, Level-3 swell products are processed by Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Services (CMEMS) taking the benefit of the unique "fireworks" analysis. In this paper, swell wave heights from Sentinel-1A/B wave mode during the period from June 2016 to June 2020 are evaluated. The reference data include the collocated in situ measurements from directional wave buoys and WaveWatch III (WW3) hindcasts. Assessment results show systematic overestimation of approximately 0.2 m in terms of the partitioned swell heights for Sentinel-1A/B Level-2 products compared to the directional buoy observations in eastern Pacific and the western Atlantic. Based on the reliable SAR-WW3 collocations after quality-controls, empirical corrections have been proposed for Sentinel-1 Level-2 swell heights. Independent comparisons against WW3 hindcasts and buoy observations demonstrate the validity of our postprocessing correction for both Level-2 and Level-3 swell heights by eliminating the biases and reducing the root mean square errors. The consistency between CMEMS Level-3 swells and buoy in situ is also examined and discussed by case studies.

TI  - Studies on the Equatorial Spot of G-type Contact Binary UV Lyn
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - New CCD photometric observations of G-type contact binary UV Lyn were obtained in 2006 and 2020, when the light curves (LCs) showed positive O'Connell effect and negative O'Connell effect, respectively. From the previous studies, the LCs by other ground-based telescope are variable from 1973 to 2020, particularly the magnitude difference between the two maxima. These phenomena indicate that the component has been active in the past 47 yr. In addition, during monitoring by the space telescope Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) from January to March 2020, we fortunately found continuous variations from the O'Connell effect in every cycle for the first time. The analysis also shows that in a short time, the positive O'Connell effect has been transformed into the negative one, which demonstrates that there are stronger magnetic activities on the surface of the component. By using the Wilson-Devinney code with a spot model, these photometric solutions confirm UV Lyn is a shallow W-subtype contact binary with a cool equatorial spot on the less massive component. The successive variability of the O'Connell effect possibly results from one equatorial cool spot shifting gradually along with time. We also investigated its O - C curve from these continuous LCs, and there is no apparent variation in such a short time. However, regarding the O'Connell effect as the indicator of magnetic activity indicates the system is possibly undergoing a periodic trend with a period of nearly 38 days. Comparing with the trend of the O - C curve, we could not find any relation between the period variation and magnetic activity.

TI  - Remote Sensing Analysis of Erosion in Arctic Coastal Areas of Alaska and Eastern Siberia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, remote sensing analysis of coastal erosion is conducted for three typical regions of Alaska and Eastern Siberia based on remote sensing data collected between 1974 and 2017. The comparative studies were made on the difference in coastal erosion at different latitudes and the difference and influencing factors in coastal erosion at similar latitudes. The coastline retreatment is used to indicate coastal erosion. It is found that the most extensive erosion occurred along Alaska's coast, followed by that of the Eastern Siberian coasts. Based on the analysis of the historical time series of snow and ice as well as climate data, it is found that at similar latitudes, the erosion of the Arctic coasts is closely related to the trend and fluctuations of the sea surface temperature (SST). Specifically, it is found that in Alaska, coastal erosion is closely related to the fluctuation of the SST, while in Eastern Siberia, it is related to the increasing or decreasing trend of the SST. A decreasing trend is associated with low coastal erosion, whereas an increasing trend is associated with accelerated coastal erosion. In the Arctic, the strong fluctuations of the SST, the continuous decline of the sea ice cover, and the consequent increase of the significant wave height are the critical factors that cause changes in coastal permafrost and coastal erosion.

TI  - Permafrost Ground Ice Melting and Deformation Time Series Revealed by Sentinel-1 InSAR in the Tanggula Mountain Region on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we applied small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) to monitor the ground surface deformation from 2017 to 2020 in the permafrost region within an ~400 km x 230 km area covering the northern and southern slopes of Mt. Geladandong, Tanggula Mountains on the Tibetan Plateau. During SBAS-InSAR processing, we inverted the network of interferograms into a deformation time series using a weighted least square estimator without a preset deformation model. The deformation curves of various permafrost states in the Tanggula Mountain region were revealed in detail for the first time. The study region undergoes significant subsidence. Over the subsiding terrain, the average subsidence rate was 9.1 mm/a; 68.1% of its area had a subsidence rate between 5 and 20 mm/a, while just 0.7% of its area had a subsidence rate larger than 30 mm/a. The average peak-to-peak seasonal deformation was 19.7 mm. There is a weak positive relationship (~0.3) between seasonal amplitude (water storage in the active layer) and long-term deformation velocity (ground ice melting). By examining the deformation time series of subsiding terrain with different subsidence levels, we also found that thaw subsidence was not restricted to the summer and autumn thawing times but could last until the following winter, and in this circumstance, the winter uplift was greatly weakened. Two import indices for indicating permafrost deformation properties, i.e., long-term deformation trend and seasonal deformation magnitude, were extracted by direct calculation and model approximations of deformation time series and compared with each other. The comparisons showed that the long-term velocity by different calculations was highly consistent, but the intra-annual deformation magnitudes by the model approximations were larger than those of the intra-annual highest-lowest elevation difference. The findings improve the understanding of deformation properties in the degrading permafrost environment.

TI  - Exploring the Spatiotemporal Coverage of Terrestrial Snow Mass Using a Suite of Satellite Constellation Configurations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial snow is a vital freshwater resource for more than 1 billion people. Remotely-sensed snow observations can be used to retrieve snow mass or integrated into a snow model estimate; however, optimally leveraging remote sensing observations of snow is challenging. One reason is that no single sensor can accurately measure all types of snow because each type of sensor has its own unique limitations. Another reason is that remote sensing data is inherently discontinuous across time and space, and that the revisit cycle of remote sensing observations may not meet the requirements of a given snow applications. In order to quantify the feasible availability of remotely-sensed observations across space and time, this study simulates the sensor coverage for a suite of hypothetical snow sensors as a function of different orbital configurations and sensor properties. The information gleaned from this analysis coupled with a dynamic snow binary map is used to evaluate the efficiency of a single sensor (or constellation) to observe terrestrial snow on a global scale. The results show the efficacy achievable by different sensors over different snow types. The combination of different orbital and sensor configurations is explored to requirements of remote sensing missions that have 1-day, 3-day, or 30-day repeat intervals. The simulation results suggest that 1100 km, 550 km, and 200 km are the minimum required swath width for a polar-orbiting sensor to meet snow-related applications demanding a 1-day, 3-day, and 30-day repeat cycles, respectively. The results of this paper provide valuable input for the planning of a future global snow mission.

TI  - Three Mw ≥ 4.7 Earthquakes Within the Changning (China) Shale Gas Field Ruptured Shallow Faults Intersecting With Hydraulic Fracturing Wells
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - From 2017 to 2019, three destructive earthquakes (27 January 2017 Mw 4.7, 16 December 2018 Mw 5.2, and 3 January 2019 Mw 4.8) occurred in the Changning shale gas field in the southwest Sichuan Basin, China. Previous seismological studies attributed these events to hydraulic fracturing (HF), but were unable to identify the causative seismogenic faults and their slip behaviors. Here, we use Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data to measure surface deformation triggered by the three events and conduct geodetic inversions to characterize their rupture models. The resulting coseismic interferograms show prominent surface deformation with the maximum line-of-sight displacements of up to 4 cm. The inversion results show that all three earthquakes mainly ruptured sedimentary formations above the shale gas bed, in the upper 3 km of the crust, with slip magnitudes ranging from 8.5 to 15 cm, and stress drops ranging from similar to 1.8 to similar to 3.3 MPa. Their source faults intersect with horizontal HF wells, but do not root in the crystalline basement. Combined with the reported difficulty of increasing HF operation pressures prior to the three events, we argue that they were most likely induced by direct injection of pressurized fluids into the fault zones. Crustal deformation patterns inferred from regional topography and GPS velocities highlight that the Changning field is located within a triple junction region near the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau with large deformation gradients; such conditions are not only favorable to the development of critically stressed faults, but also facilitate the occurrence of at least moderate magnitude earthquakes.

TI  - Retrieval of Significant Wave Height Under Typhoon Conditions from Gaofen-3 SAR Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to propose an empirical method to inverse significant wave height (SWH) under typhoon conditions from collected dual-polarization Gaofen (GF)-3 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The typhoon scenes were captured from narrow scan (NSC) and wide scan (WSC) images, and collocated with European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis data of (ECMWF). To improve the quality of GF-3 SAR images, the recalibration over rainforest and de-scalloping were carried out. To establish the empirical relationship between SAR-derived parameters and collocated SWH, the sensitivity analysis of typical parameters about the normalized radar cross section (Nrcs) and imagery variance (Cvar) were performed to both VV and VH polarized images. Four scenes from GF-3 SAR imagery under typhoon conditions were used for training the model by the multivariate least square regression, and one scene was used for preliminary validation. It was found that the joint retrieval model based on VV and VH polarized SAR imagery performed better than any single polarized model. These results, verified by using ECMWF data, revealed the soundness of this approach, with a correlation of 0.95, bias of 0 m, RMSE of 0.44 and SI of 0.01 when VV polarization and VH polarization data were both used.

TI  - Integrating Multi-Source Remote Sensing to Assess Forest Aboveground Biomass in the Khingan Mountains of North-Eastern China Using Machine-Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is of great significance since it represents large carbon storage and may reduce global climate change. However, there are still considerable uncertainties in forest AGB estimates, especially in rugged regions, due to the lack of effective algorithms to remove the effects of topography and the lack of comprehensive comparisons of methods used for estimation. Here, we systematically compare the performance of three sources of remote sensing data used in forest AGB estimation, along with three machine-learning algorithms using extensive field measurements (N = 1058) made in the Khingan Mountains of north-eastern China in 2008. The datasets used were obtained from the LiDAR-based Geoscience Laser Altimeter System onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation satellite (ICESat/GLAS), the optical-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the SAR-based Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). We show that terrain correction is effective for this mountainous study region and that the combination of terrain-corrected GLAS and PALSAR features with Random Forest regression produces the best results at the plot scale. Including further MODIS-based features added little power for prediction. Based upon the parsimonious data source combination, we created a map of AGB circa 2008 and its uncertainty, which yields a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.82 and a root mean squared error of 16.84 Mg ha(-1) when validated with field data. Forest AGB values in our study area were within the range 79.81 +/- 16.00 Mg ha(-1), ~25% larger than a previous, SAR-based, analysis. Our result provides a historic benchmark for regional carbon budget estimation.

TI  - Fine-Scale Improved Carbon Bookkeeping Model Using Landsat Time Series for Subtropical Forest, Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subtropical forests easily suffer anthropogenic disturbance, including deforestation and reforestation management, which both highly affect the carbon pools. This study proposes spatial-temporal tracking of the carbon density dynamics to improve bookkeeping in the carbon model and applied to subtropical forest activities in Guangzhou, southern China, during the period of 1995 to 2014. Based on the overall accuracy of 87.5% +/- 1.7% for forest change products using Landsat time series (LTS), we found that this is a typical period of deforestation conversion to reforestation activity accompanied with urbanization. Additionally, linear regression, random forest regression and allometric growth fitting were proposed by using forest field plots to obtain reliable per-pixel carbon density estimations. The cross-validation (CV) of random forest with LTS-derived parameters reached the highest accuracy of R-2 and RMSE of 0.763 and 7.499 Mg ha(-1). The RMES of the density estimation ranged between 78 and 84% of the mean observed biomass in the study area, which outperformed previous studies. Over the 20-year period, the study results showed that the explicit carbon emissions were (6.82 +/- 0.26) x 10(4) Mg C yr(-1) from deforestation; emissions increased to (1.02 +/- 0.04) x 10(5) Mg C yr(-1) given the implicit carbon not yet released to the atmosphere in the form of decomposing slash and wood products. In addition, a carbon uptake of about 1.91 +/- 0.73 x 10(5) Mg C yr(-1), presented as the net carbon pool. Based on the continuous detection capability, biennial reforestation activity has increased carbon density by a growth rate of 1.55 Mg ha(-1), and the emission factors can be identified with LTS-derived parameters. In general, the study realizes the spatiotemporal improvement of carbon density and flux dynamics tracking, including the abrupt and graduate change based on fine-scale forest activity. It can provide more comprehensive and detailed feedback on the carbon source and sink change process of forest activities and disturbances.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Temperature Fusion Based on a Deep Convolutional Network
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatiotemporal-resolution land surface temperature (LST) images are essential in various fields of study. However; due to technical constraints, sensing systems have difficulty in providing LSTs with both high spatial and high temporal resolution. In this study, we propose a multi-scale spatiotemporal temperature-image fusion network (MSTTIFN) to generate high-spatial-resolution LST products. The MSTTIFN builds nonlinear mappings between the input Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (moms) LSTs and the output Landsat LSTs at the target date with two pairs of references and therefore enhances the resolution of time-series LSTs. We conduct experiments on the actual Landsat and MODIS data in two study areas (Beijing and Shandong) and compare our proposed MSTTIFN with four competing methods: the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Model, a two-stream convolutional neural network (StfNet), and a deep learning-based spatiotemporal temperature-fusion network. Results reveal that the MSTTIFN achieves the best and most stable performance.

TI  - Intra-Annual Variability of Evapotranspiration in Response to Climate and Vegetation Change across the Poyang Lake Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving understanding of changes in intra-annual variability (IAV) of evapotranspiration (ET) and the underlying drivers is an essential step for modeling hydrological processes in response to global change. Previous studies paid special attention to climatic regulations of IAV of ET. However, ignoring the role of landscape characteristics (e.g., vegetation coverage) can introduce great uncertainty in the explanation of ET variance. In this work, the Poyang Lake Basin, which is a typical humid basin in China, was taken as the study area. It has experienced an obvious climate change and revegetation since the 1980s. Here, trends of IAV of ET and their responses to four climatic variables (i.e., air temperature, precipitation, downward shortwave radiation and wind speed) and vegetation coverage were explored from 1983 to 2014. The results show that IAV of ET exhibited contrary trends during the past decades. It significantly (p < 0.05) declined with a significant linear slope of -0.52 mm/year before 2000, and then slightly increased (slope = 0.06 mm/year, p > 0.05) over the basin, which was generally consistent with the IAV of temperature and radiation. The proposed variables could well capture the change in IAV of ET, while their dominators were different during the two contrasting phases mentioned above. The IAV of radiation and temperature dominated the change of the IAV of ET over 77.82% and 35.14% of the basin, respectively, before and after the turning point. Meanwhile, the rapid increase in vegetation coverage, which was associated with afforestation, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced IAV of ET over about 35% of the study area. The achievements of this study should be beneficial for a sophisticated awareness of responses of intra-annual variability of ET to climate and land cover changes at the basin scale.

TI  - Snow Coverage Mapping by Learning from Sentinel-2 Satellite Multispectral Images via Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow coverage mapping plays a vital role not only in studying hydrology and climatology, but also in investigating crop disease overwintering for smart agriculture management. This work investigates snow coverage mapping by learning from Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral images via machine-learning methods. To this end, the largest dataset for snow coverage mapping (to our best knowledge) with three typical classes (snow, cloud and background) is first collected and labeled via the semi-automatic classification plugin in QGIS. Then, both random forest-based conventional machine learning and U-Net-based deep learning are applied to the semantic segmentation challenge in this work. The effects of various input band combinations are also investigated so that the most suitable one can be identified. Experimental results show that (1) both conventional machine-learning and advanced deep-learning methods significantly outperform the existing rule-based Sen2Cor product for snow mapping; (2) U-Net generally outperforms the random forest since both spectral and spatial information is incorporated in U-Net via convolution operations; (3) the best spectral band combination for U-Net is B2, B11, B4 and B9. It is concluded that a U-Net-based deep-learning classifier with four informative spectral bands is suitable for snow coverage mapping.

TI  - Effects of Environmental Factors on the Changes in MODIS NPP along DEM in Global Terrestrial Ecosystems over the Last Two Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has exerted widespread impacts on the terrestrial ecosystem in the past three decades. Vegetation is an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem, and its net primary productivity (NPP) is an important variable in the exchange of materials and energy in the terrestrial ecosystem. However, the effect of climate variation on the spatial pattern of zonal distribution of NPP has remained unclear over the past two decades. Therefore, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of MODIS NPP and environmental factors (temperature, radiation, and soil moisture) derived from three sets of reanalysis data. The moving window method and digital elevation model (DEM) were used to explore their changes along elevation gradients. Finally, we explored the effect of environmental factors on the changes in NPP and its elevation distribution patterns. Results showed that nearly 60% of the global area exhibited an increase in NPP with increasing elevation. Soil moisture has the largest uncertainty either in the spatial pattern or inter-annual variation, while temperature has the smallest uncertainty among the three environmental factors. The uncertainty of environmental factors is also reflected in its impact on the elevation distribution of NPP, and temperature is still the main dominating environmental factor. Our research results imply that the carbon sequestration capability of vegetation is becoming increasingly prominent in high-elevation regions. However, the quantitative evaluation of its carbon sink (source) functions needs further research under global warming.

TI  - Can a Hierarchical Classification of Sentinel-2 Data Improve Land Cover Mapping?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of land cover plays an important role in effective environmental management, assessment of natural resources, environmental protection, urban planning and sustainable development. Increasing demand for accurate and repeatable information on land cover and land cover changes causes rapid development of the advanced, machine learning algorithms dedicated to land cover mapping using satellite images. Free and open access to Sentinel-2 data, characterized with high spatial and temporal resolution, increased the potential to map and to monitor land surface with high accuracy and frequency. Despite a considerable number of approaches towards land cover classification based on satellite data, there is still a challenge to clearly separate complex land cover classes, for example grasslands, arable land and wetlands. The aim of this study is to examine, whether a hierarchal classification of Sentinel-2 data can improve the accuracy of land cover mapping and delineation of complex land cover classes. The study is conducted in the Lodz Province, in central Poland. The pixel-based land cover classification is carried out using the machine learning Random Forest (RF) algorithm, based on a time series of Sentinel-2 imagery acquired in 2020. The following nine land cover classes are mapped: sealed surfaces, woodland broadleaved, woodland coniferous, shrubs, permanent herbaceous (grassy cover), periodically herbaceous (i.e., arable land), mosses, non-vegetated (bare soil) and water bodies. The land cover classification is conducted following two approaches: (1) flat, where all land cover classes are classified together, and (2) hierarchical, where the stratification is applied to first separate the most stable land cover classes and then classifying the most problematic once. The national databases served as the source of the reference sampling plots for the classification process. The process of selection and verification of the reference sampling plots is performed automatically. To assess the stability of the classification models the classification processes are performed iteratively. The results of this study confirmed that the hierarchical approach gave more accurate results compared to the commonly used flat approach. The median of the overall accuracy (OA) of the hierarchical classification was higher by 3-9 percentage points compared to the flat one. Of interest, the OA of the hierarchical classification reached 0.93-0.99, whereas the flat approach reached 0.90. Individual classes are also better classified in the hierarchical approach.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Quality Indicators for Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an invaluable technique in the detection and monitoring of changes on the surface of the earth. Its high spatial coverage, weather friendly and remote nature are among the advantages of the tool. The multi-temporal differential InSAR (DInSAR) methods in particular estimate the spatio-temporal evolution of deformation by incorporating information from multiple SAR images. Moreover, opportunities from the DInSAR techniques are accompanied by challenges that affect the final outputs. Resolving the inherent ambiguities of interferometric phases, especially in areas with a high spatio-temporal deformation gradient, represents the main challenge. This brings the necessity of quality indices as important DInSAR data processing tools in achieving ultimate processing outcomes. Often such indices are not provided with the deformation products. In this work, we propose four scores associated with (i) measurement points, (ii) dates of time series, (iii) interferograms and (iv) images involved in the processing. These scores are derived from a redundant set of interferograms and are calculated based on the consistency of the unwrapped interferometric phases in the frame of a least-squares adjustment. The scores reflect the occurrence of phase unwrapping errors and represent valuable input for the analysis and exploitation of the DInSAR results. The proposed tools were tested on 432,311 points, 1795 interferograms and 263 Sentinel-1 single look complex images by employing the small baseline technique in the PSI processing chain, PSIG of the geomatics division of the Centre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC). The results illustrate the importance of the scores-mainly in the interpretation of the DInSAR outputs.

TI  - Interseismic Strain Accumulation Across the Main Recent Fault, SW Iran, From Sentinel-1 InSAR Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Main Recent Fault is a major right-lateral strike-slip fault in the western Zagros mountains of Iran. Recent geodetic and geological studies estimate a low slip rate of 1-6 mm/yr at an unknown depth which, when combined with a non-ideal fault geometry, makes the Main Recent Fault a difficult but interesting target for InSAR analysis. This analysis would further cement the estimated slip rate and provide an opportunity of estimate the depth to the base of the locked seismogenic zone, both important constraints on the seismic hazard posed by the fault, as well as for understanding how oblique convergence is accommodated and partitioned across the Zagros. We use 200 Sentinel-1 SAR images from the past 5 years, spanning two ascending and two descending tracks, to estimate the first InSAR-derived slip rate and locking depth for a 300 km long section of the fault. We utilize two established processing systems, LiCSAR and LiCSBAS, to produce interferograms and perform time series analysis, respectively. We constrain north-south motion using GNSS observations, decompose our InSAR line-of-sight velocities into fault-parallel and vertical motion, and fit 1-D screw dislocation models to three fault-perpendicular profiles of fault-parallel velocity, following a Bayesian approach to estimate the posterior probability distribution on the fault parameters. We estimate an interseismic slip velocity of 2.4 +/- 1.2 mm/yr below a loosely constrained 14 km locking depth, the first such estimate for the fault, and discuss the challenges in constraining the locking depth for low magnitude interseismic signals.

TI  - Unsupervised Optical Classification of the Seabed Color in Shallow Oligotrophic Waters from Sentinel-2 Images: A Case Study in the Voh-Kone-Pouembout Lagoon (New Caledonia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring chlorophyll-a concentration or turbidity is crucial for understanding and managing oligo- to mesotrophic coastal waters quality. However, mapping bio-optical components from space in such shallow settings remains challenging because of the strong interference of the complex bathymetry and various seabed colors. Correcting the total satellite reflectance signal from the seabed reflectance in ocean color with high resolution sensors is promising. This article shows how unsupervised clustering approaches can be applied to Sentinel-2 images to classify seabed colors in shallow waters of a tropical oligotrophic lagoon in New Caledonia. Data processing included Lyzenga correction for estimating the water column reflectance, optical spectra standardization for attenuating water absorption effects and clustering using the unsupervised k-means method. This methodological approach was applied on the 497, 560, 664 and 704 nm optical bands of the selected Sentinel-2 image. When applied on non-standardized data, our unsupervised classification retrieved three seafloor clusters, whereas five seafloor clusters could be retrieved using standardized data. For each of these two trials, the computed membership values explained more than 75% of the inertia in each Sentinel-2 wavelength band used for the clustering. However, the accuracy of the method was slightly improved when applied on standardized data. Confusion index mapping of the unsupervised clustering retrieved from these data emphasized the relevance and robustness of our methodological approach. Such an approach for seabed colors classification in optically complex shallow settings will be particularly helpful to improve remote sensing of biogeochemical indicators such as chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity in fragile coastal environments.

TI  - Maximizing Multi-Decadal Water Surface Elevation Estimates With Landsat Imagery and Elevation/Bathymetry Datasets
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying patterns and trends in long-term lake dynamics is essential to establish effective water management procedures and boost our understanding of inland water's role in the global water cycle. This research leverages Google Earth Engine to estimate multi-decadal water surface elevations for 52 lakes and reservoirs with varying physical properties. Water surface elevation was estimated using the entire Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 Landsat Top-of-Atmosphere Tier-1 Collection-1 archive from August 1982 through December 2017 via shoreline boundary statistics extracted from the National Elevation Dataset merged with lake bathymetry. Image contamination was identified and removed to provide elevation estimates for images with varying levels of image contamination. To improve accuracy, data filtering techniques were identified which retained over 70% of images with detectable water boundaries producing 26 lakes with sub-meter root-mean-square-error accuracy and 40 lakes with sub-meter mean-absolute-error-accuracy using a general overall parameter model. Additionally, lake-specific locally optimized models were also determined with 45 of the 52 lakes producing sub-meter root-mean-square-error accuracies and 49 with sub-meter mean-absolute-errors with individual lake accuracy as low as 0.191 m RMSE CI95%[0.129, 0.243]. In general, individual lake accuracy is highly correlated with the mean slope of the surrounding terrain with low-slope shorelines having greater accuracy than high-slope shorelines. Seasonal patterns in estimate accuracy were also identified. This research extends our ability to track lake dynamics over long time periods to lakes lacking traditional in-situ monitoring, enables rapid assessment of lake dynamics across large areas, and balances a need for both high-accuracy measurements and maximum temporal resolution.

TI  - Quantification of Foraging Areas for the Northern Bald Ibis (<i>Geronticus eremita</i>) in the Northern Alpine Foothills: A Random Forest Model Fitted with Optical and Actively Sensed Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita, NBI) is an endangered migratory species, which went extinct in Europe in the 17th century. Currently, a translocation project in the frame of the European LIFE program is carried out, to reintroduce a migratory population with breeding colonies in the northern and southern Alpine foothills and a common wintering area in southern Tuscany. The population meanwhile consists of about 200 individuals, with about 90% of them carrying a GPS device on their back. We used biologging data from 2021 to model the habitat suitability for the species in the northern Alpine foothills. To set up a species distribution model, indices describing environmental conditions were calculated from satellite images of Landsat-8, and in addition to the well-proven use of optical remote sensing data, we also included Sentinel-1 actively sensed observation data, as well as climate and urbanization data. A random forest model was fitted on NBI GPS positions, which we used to identify regions with high predicted foraging suitability within the northern Alpine foothills. The model resulted in 84.5% overall accuracy. Elevation and slope had the highest predictive power, followed by grass cover and VV intensity of Sentinel-1 radar data. The map resulting from the model predicts the highest foraging suitability for valley floors, especially of Inn, Rhine, and Salzach-Valley as well as flatlands, like the Swiss Plateau and the agricultural areas surrounding Lake Constance. Areas with a high suitability index largely overlap with known historic breeding sites. This is particularly noteworthy because the model only refers to foraging habitats without considering the availability of suitable breeding cliffs. Detailed analyses identify the transition zone from extensive grassland management to intensive arable farming as the northern range limit. The modeling outcome allows for defining suitable areas for further translocation and management measures in the frame of the European NBI reintroduction program. Although required in the international IUCN translocation guidelines, the use of models in the context of translocation projects is still not common and in the case of the Northern Bald Ibis not considered in the present Single Species Action Plan of the African-Eurasian Migratory Water bird Agreement. Our species distribution model represents a contemporary snapshot, but sustainability is essential for conservation planning, especially in times of climate change. In this regard, a further model could be optimized by investigating sustainable land use, temporal dynamics, and climate change scenarios.

M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice cropping systems play a vital role in food security, water use, gas emission estimates, and grain yield prediction. Due to alterations in the labor structure and the high cost of paddy rice planting, the paddy rice cropping systems (single or double paddy rice) have drastically changed in China in recent years; many double-cropping paddy rice fields have been converted to single-cropping paddy rice or other crops, especially in southern China. Few maps detect single and double paddy rice and cropping intensity for paddy rice (CIPR) in China with a 30 m resolution. The Landsat-based and effective flooding signal-based phenology (EFSP) method, which distinguishes CIPR with the frequency of the effective flooding signal (EFe), was proposed and tested in China. The cloud/ice/shadow was excluded by bit arithmetic, generating a good observation map, and several non-paddy rice masks were established to improve the classification accuracy. Threshold values for single and double paddy rice were calculated through the mapped data and agricultural census data. Image processing (more than 684,000 scenes) and algorithm implementation were accomplished by a cloud computing approach with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The resultant maps of paddy rice from 2014 to 2019 were evaluated with data from statistical yearbooks and high-resolution images, with producer (user) accuracy and kappa coefficients ranging from 0.92 to 0.96 (0.76-0.87) and 0.67-0.80, respectively. Additionally, the determination coefficients for mapped and statistical data were higher than 0.88 from 2014 to 2019. Maps derived from EFSP illustrate that the single and double paddy rice systems are mainly concentrated in the Cfa (warm, fully humid, and hot summer, 49% vs. 56%) climate zone in China and show a slightly decreasing trend. The trend of double paddy rice is more pronounced than that of single paddy rice due to the high cost and shortages of rural household labor. However, single paddy rice fields expanded in Dwa (cold, dry winter, and hot summer, 11%) and Dwb (cold, dry winter, and warm summer, 9%) climate zones. The regional cropping intensity for paddy rice coincides with the paddy rice planting area but shows a significant decrease in south China, especially in Hunan Province, from 2014 to 2019. The results demonstrate that EFSP can effectively support the mapping of single and double paddy rice fields and CIPR in China, and the combinations of Landsat 7 and 8 provide enough good observations for EFSP to monitor paddy rice agriculture.

TI  - Inversion of Soil Salinity Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data and Particle Swarm Machine Learning Models in Keriya Oasis, Northwestern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a global problem that damages soil ecology and affects agricultural development. Timely management and monitoring of soil salinity are essential to achieve the most sustainable development goals in arid and semi-arid regions. It has been demonstrated that Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data have a high sensitivity to the soil dielectric constant and soil surface roughness, thus having great potential for the detection of soil salinity. However, studies combining PALSAR-2 data and Landsat 8 data to invert soil salinity information are less common. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is characterized by simple operation, fast computation, and good adaptability, but there are relatively few studies applying it to soil salinity as well. This paper takes the Keriya Oasis as an example, proposing the PSO-SVR and PSO-BPNN models by combining PSO with support vector machine regression (SVR) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models. Then, PALSAR-2 data, Landsat 8 data, evapotranspiration data, groundwater burial depth data, and DEM data were combined to conduct the inversion study of soil salinity in the study area. The results showed that the introduction of PSO generated a satisfactory estimating performance. The SVR model accuracy (R-2) improved by 0.07 (PALSAR-2 data), 0.20 (Landsat 8 data), and 0.19 (PALSAR + Landsat data); the BP model accuracy (R-2) improved by 0.03 (PALSAR-2 data), 0.24 (Landsat 8 data), and 0.12 (PALSAR + Landsat data), and then combined with the model inversion plots, we found that PALSAR + Landsat data combined with the PSO-SVR model could achieve better inversion results. The fine texture information of PALSAR-2 data can be used to better invert the soil salinity in the study area by combining it with the rich spectral information of Landsat 8 data. This study complements the research ideas and methods for soil salinization using multi-source remote sensing data to provide scientific support for salinity monitoring in the study area.

TI  - Research on Comfort Evaluation Model of Urban Residents' Public Space Lighting Integrating Public Perception and Nighttime Light Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of a sustainable lifestyle, people are paying more and more attention to the comfort of their own living environment, including public space lighting, which is immediately accessible to residents. The demand on its quality and comfort has thus gained attention recently. However, there is still a lack of related research on public space lighting comfort evaluation models that combine nighttime light remote sensing data and field measurement data, and link lighting attributes with the comfort of residents. This research uses nighttime light remote sensing data to select typical test areas, measures the lighting data of the survey points on the spot, develops an intelligent WeChat applet that collects public perception data, analyzes different lighting parameters, and builds a public space lighting comfort model based on the structural equation model analysis method. The results show that the factor that the areas with high light intensity are more comfortable than the areas with low light intensity. In areas with high light intensity, people pay more attention to the uniformity, security and comfort of the light, while in areas with low light intensity or high blue light, people's perception of glare will be more obvious. This research can provide a basis for the intelligent optimization of public space lighting from the perspective of public preference.

TI  - As the Deep River Rises <i>Rethinking Halakhah in the Anthropocene</i>
T2  - WORLDVIEWS-GLOBAL RELIGIONS CULTURE AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present essay seeks to offer a conceptual framework for grappling with climate change from within the sources of Jewish law (halakhah), a discourse rooted in the Hebrew Bible but developed in the rabbinic literature of Late Antiquity and then in medieval and modern codes and commentaries. Halakhah reflects deeply-held intellectual, theological, ontological, and sociological values. As a modus vivendi, rabbinic law-variously interpreted by Jews of different stripes-remains a vital force that shapes the life of contemporary practitioners. We are interested in how a variety of contemporary scholars, theologians, and activists might use the full range of rabbinic legal sources-and their philosophical, jurisprudential, and moral values-to construct an alternative environmental ethic founded in a worldview rooted in obligation and a matrix of kinship relationships. Our essay is thus an exercise in decolonizing knowledge by moving beyond the search for environmental keywords or ready analogies to contemporary western discourse. We join the voices of recent scholars who have sought to revise regnant assumptions about how religious traditions should be read and interpreted with an eye to formulating constructive ethics.

TI  - Impact of Volcanic Sulfur Emissions on the Pine Forest of La Palma, Spain
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In autumn 2021, the largest volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma in historic records took place. The Canary Islands are of volcanic origin and eruptions have always constituted part of their natural disturbance regime. Until recently, their impacts could not be directly observed and studied. Influence of the emission of phytotoxic gases on biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics was hitherto unknown. The recent eruption is still being intensely monitored. We used Sentinel-2 remote sensing data to analyze the spatial extent and intensity of the impact related to sulfuric emissions, aiming to understand the damage patterns in Canary pine forest. The emissions damaged 10% of that forest and affected 5.3% of the Natura 2000 protected areas. We concluded that this is largely due to the toxic effects of the enormous emissions of SO2. We found a clear correlation between the change in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and distance from the eruption. This pattern was weakly anisotropic, with stronger damage in southern directions. Counteracting effects, such as ash deposition, were largely excluded by combining NDVI change detection with tree cover density. We expect that vegetation damage will be transient. P. canariensis can resprout after forest fires, where most leaves are lost. Consequently, our assessment can serve as a reference for future ecosystem regeneration.

TI  - Influence of inundation frequency change on enhanced vegetation index of wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake, China
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Inundation frequency (IF) is an important influencing factor on dynamics of wetland vegetation. This study analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of IF and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of wetland vegetation and their correlation in Poyang Lake, so as to maintain the stability of wetland ecosystem.Methods In view of the significant seasonal changes of Poyang Lake, its impact on wetland vegetation needs to be analyzed with a high temporal resolution method. Based on MODIS image data from 2000-03-01 to 2020-02-29, this study mapped the annual water inundation frequency of Poyang Lake, analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of EVI under different flooding conditions, and explored the response of EVI of wetland vegetation to changes in flooding conditions.Important findings The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The hydrological rhythm of Poyang Lake has changed significantly in the past 20 years. The water area with high inundation frequency (IF > 75%) decreased from 1 435.3 km(2) in 2000 to 510.25 km(2) in 2019, with a decrement of 64.45%. (2) The regional average EVI showed a significant upward trend. Vegetation expansion was mainly concentrated in the middle region of Poyang Lake which was also the main region of IF declining. (3) By analyzing the changes of average EVI value under different total IF regions, it was found that the variation trend of IF was similar to that of EVI. After 2009, the shrinking trend of the Poyang Lake water area was alleviated, and the growth rate of EVI decreased. (4) In the past 20 years, the changing trend of IF and EVI in Poyang Lake was highly consistent in spatial distribution. Wetland vegetation was mainly expanded along the decreasing direction of water area. This spatial heterogeneity further confirms that hydrological variation plays a role in regulating vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Detection of Multidecadal Changes in Vegetation Dynamics and Association with Intra-Annual Climate Variability in the Columbia River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a useful metric for assessing changes in vegetation cover and greeness over time and space. Satellite-derived LAI measurements can be used to assess these intra- and inter-annual vegetation dynamics and how they correlate with changing regional and local climate conditions. The detection of such changes at local and regional levels is challenged by the underlying continuity and extensive missing values of high-resolution spatio-temporal vegetation data. Here, the feasibility of functional data analysis methods was evaluated to improve the exploration of such data. In this paper, an investigation of multidecadal variation in LAI is conducted in the Columbia River Watershed, as detected by NOAA Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imaging. The inter- and intra-annual correlation of LAI with temperature and precipitation were then investigated using data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global atmospheric re-analysis (ERA-Interim) in the period 1996-2017. A functional cluster analysis model was implemented to identify regions in the Columbia River Watershed that exhibit similar long-term greening trends. Across this region, a multidecadal trend toward earlier and higher annual LAI peaks was detected, and strong correlations were found between earlier and higher LAI peaks and warmer temperatures in late winter and early spring. Although strongly correlated to LAI, maximum temperature and precipitation do not demonstrate a similar strong multidecadal trend over the studied time period. The modeling approach is proficient for analyzing tens or hundreds of thousands of sampled sites without parallel processing or high-performance computing (HPC).

TI  - Melanoma sentinel lymph node biopsy and completion lymph node dissection: A regional hospital experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Summary Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) following positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for cutaneous melanoma is a topic of controversy. The second Multicenter Selec-tive Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-II) suggested no survival benefit with CLND over observation amongst patients with a positive SLNB. The findings of the MSLT-II may have limited applicabil-ity to our high-risk population where nodal ultrasound and non-surgical melanoma treatment is rationed. In this regional, retrospective study, we reviewed primary melanoma, SLNB and CLND histopathological reports in the Bay of Plenty District Health Board (BOPDHB) across a 10-year period. The primary outcomes measured were size of sentinel lymph node metastases and non-sentinel node (NSN) positivity on CLND for patients with a positive SLNB. In the 157 SLNB identified, the mean sentinel lymph node metastatic deposit size was larger in BOPDHB compared with MSLT-II (3.53 vs 1.07/1.11mm). A greater proportion of BOPDHB patients (54.8%) had metastatic deposits larger than 1mm compared with MSLT-II (33.2/34.5%) and the rate of NSN involvement on CLND was also higher (23.8% vs 11.5%). These findings indicate that the BOPDHB is a high-risk population for nodal melanoma metastases. Forgoing CLND in the con -text of a positive SLNB may place these patients at risk.

T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to compare the demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, medical evaluation, and injuries identified in a cohort of children with and without subconjunctival hemorrhage who were evaluated by a child abuse specialist. Methods This was a case-control study that used data from the ExSTRA (Examining Siblings to Recognize Abuse) research network. Subjects with a subconjunctival hemorrhage(s) were designated as cases. Four controls matched for age and participating center were included for each case. Descriptive statistics were used to compare cases and controls. Results Fifty of the 2890 subjects in the parent study had a subconjunctival hemorrhage(s) and were designated as cases. The cases had a median (interquartile range) age of 5.0 months (2.0-23.6 months). Two hundred controls were matched to the cases. There was no difference in the demographics, clinical characteristics, medical evaluation, or rate of occult injuries identified in cases and controls. Almost one-quarter of children with subconjunctival hemorrhages had no other external sign of trauma but had the same rate of occult injuries as children with bruises. Conclusions These data suggest that subconjunctival hemorrhages are relatively rare among children undergoing evaluation by a child abuse specialist, but that they are often an indicator of occult injury. Even in the absence of other external signs of trauma, the presence of subconjunctival hemorrhages should prompt an age-appropriate evaluation for physical abuse.

TI  - Validation of significant wave height from Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A/B and relation to tidal currents in coastal regions of the Korean Peninsula
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As climate change and oceanic warming have an increasing impact on coastal waves, accurate observation of satellite significant wave height (SWH) in coastal regions is becoming more important. In addition to the validation of satellite SWHs in the global ocean, the SWHs should also be validated in coastal regions for their diverse applications. In this study, the accuracy and error characteristics of altimeter SWH data, Jason-3 Geophysical Data Records Version D and Sentinel-3A/B Level-2 marine scientific products, were investigated using SWH measurements from 18 buoy stations in the coastal region of the Korean Peninsula from 2017 to 2019. Results showed that the Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A/B SWHs exhibited root mean square errors (RMSE) and bias errors of 0.59-1.60 m and 0.03-0.42 m, respectively. Cross-validation between Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A/B exhibited a consistency comparable to that of the global ocean. The spatial distribution of comparison between altimeter SWH and wave model data was similar to that obtained using altimeter SWH and in situ measurements. Validation of altimeter SWH from the buoy stations yielded the highest error in the southwestern coastal region of the Korean Peninsula, with high tidal currents in the Yellow Sea. The stronger the tidal current speed, the more amplified the satellite SWH errors. The SWH differences exhibited a high dependence on the tidal index, including the elements of tidal current speed, water depth, and tide height. A relationship was found between the tidal index and the altimeter SWH differences from the in situ measurements. Based on this relation, formulas were proposed to reduce satellite SWH errors due to tidal currents in the coastal regions of the Korean Peninsula. For the matchups with tidal index less than 2, RMSE and bias errors of each satellite sensor were improved by up to 14.25% (0.28 m) and 94.40% (0.84 m), respectively.

TI  - Modelling Impacts of Environmental Water on Vegetation of a Semi-Arid Floodplain-Lakes System Using 30-Year Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River floodplains are among the most dynamic and diverse ecosystems on the planet. They are at risk of degradation due to river regulation and climate change. Environmental water has been delivered to floodplains to maintain environmental health by mimicking natural floods. It is important to understand the long-term effects of environmental water to floodplain vegetation to support its management. This study used Normalized Differences Vegetation index (NDVI) from the 30-year Landsat datasets of the Hattah Lakes floodplain in Australia to investigate the drivers of vegetation dynamics. We developed generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) to model responses of vegetation to environmental water, natural floods, precipitation, temperature, and distance to water across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We found the effect of environmental water on floodplain vegetation to be quite different from that of natural floods in both space and time. Vegetation in most areas of Hattah Lakes will respond to natural floods within one month of flooding, while positive responses to environmental water occur 1 to 3 months after inundation and are more restricted spatially. For environmental water planning, managers need to be aware of these differences. The implementation of new infrastructure to transport or retain environmental water on floodplains needs to be planned carefully, with continuous monitoring of rainfall and natural floods. Whilst environmental floods do not mimic the effect of natural floods, they do provide some positive benefits that can partially offset effects of reduced natural floods.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization exacerbates the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, which significantly affects people's daily life and socioeconomic activities. In this study, using Landsat long-time series satellite images, we attempted to examine the dynamics of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in Hangzhou from 2000 to 2020. Directional analysis, correlation analysis, and stepwise regression analysis were employed to detect the relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and landscape patterns. The results show that the changes of SUHI were mainly due to the urban expansion in suburban areas, and the intensity of SUHI in the urban center kept stable. The correlation between LST and forest was stronger over time with an increased proportion level. There was no correlation between LST and forest when the forest density was less than 20 ha/km(2). However, when the forest density reached 80 ha/km(2), the R-2 of their correlation was 0.2921. The landscape configuration also affected the LST, and agglomerated water and forests showed a more substantial cooling effect. Compared with dense buildings, scattered buildings showed a weaker warming effect. These findings would be helpful for the current landscape configuration adjustment and future urban planning, with the promotion of sustainable development in Hangzhou.

TI  - Local Enhancement of Marine Gravity Field over the Spratly Islands by Combining Satellite SAR Altimeter-Derived Gravity Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The marine gravity field recovery close to land/island is challenging owing to the scarcity of measured gravimetric observations and sorely contaminated satellite radar altimeter-derived data. The satellite missions that carried the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeters supplied data with improved quality compared to that retrieved from the conventional radar altimeters. In this study, we combine the satellite altimeter-derived gravity data for marine gravity field augmentation over island areas; in particular, the feasibility for regional augmentation by incorporating the SAR altimeter-derived gravity data is investigated. The gravity field modeling results over the Spratly Islands demonstrate that the marine gravity field is augmented by the incorporation of newly published satellite altimeter-derived gravity data. By merging the gravity models computed with the Sentinel-3A/B SAR altimetry data, the quasi-geoid and mean dynamic topography are dramatically improved, by a magnitude larger than 4 cm around areas close to islands, in comparison with the results directly derived from a combined global geopotential model alone. Further comparison of regional solutions computed from heterogeneous gravity models shows that the ones modeled from the SAR-based gravity models have better performances, the errors of which are reduced by a magnitude of 2~4 cm over the regions close to islands, in comparison with the solutions modeled with the gravity models developed without SAR altimetry data. These results highlight the superiority of using the SAR-based gravity data in marine gravity field recovery, especially over the regions close to land/island.

TI  - Climatological Characteristics and Aerosol Loading Trends from 2001 to 2020 Based on MODIS MAIAC Data for Tianjin, North China Plain
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) in East Asia has a severe air pollution problem. In this study, the long-term spatial distribution and interannual trends of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were investigated using the MODIS MAIAC (multiangle implementation of the atmospheric correction) dataset from 2001 to 2020 for Tianjin, a city on the NCP. The annual AOD in Tianjin was 0.59 from 2001 to 2020. The average AOD of Tianjin was the highest in summer (0.96), followed by spring (0.58) and autumn (0.51). The annual AOD in Tianjin increased significantly in 2008 (approximately 0.77), and the minimum annual AOD was observed in 2020 (0.41). In summer, AOD in the 11 districts of Tianjin significantly increased from 2001 to 2010 and gradually decreased from 2011 to 2020. The occurrence frequency of AOD in the range of 0.2-0.5 was high in Tianjin accounting for almost 40% of the total proportion. In Tianjin, AOD exhibited a positive trend from 2001 to 2008 and an obvious negative growth trend from 2009 to 2020 due to anthropogenic emission. The findings are valuable for analyzing the climatological characteristics of aerosol loading and their optical properties at the district level of cities on the NCP.

TI  - Monitoring and characterizing multi-decadal variations of urban thermal condition using time-series thermal remote sensing and dynamic land cover data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development and associated land cover and land use change alter the thermal, hydrological, and physical properties of the land surface. Assessments of surface urban heat island (UHI) usually focused on using remote sensing and land cover data to quantify UHI intensity and spatial distribution within a certain period. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in landscape dynamics and land surface thermal features are still being assessed. In this study, we developed and implemented a novel approach to characterize landscape thermal conditions by focusing on UHI intensity and its spatiotemporal variation using the recently available time series of Landsat land surface temperature and land cover change products. We analyzed land surface temperature changes in urban and surrounding non-urban lands to quantify the UHI intensity and landscape thermal conditions in the Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas of the United States. Our results revealed that UHI intensities had averages of 3.4 degrees C and 3.3 degrees C in the Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas, respectively. The dominant land cover type in rural areas and urban imperviousness cover determines the UHI intensity. Increasing trends of 0.04 degrees C/year and 0.01 degrees C/year in UHI intensity between 1985 and 2018 were found in Atlanta and Minneapolis, respectively. The UHI intensity variations in 1985 and 2018 suggest that the magnitudes and temporal variations of UHI intensity averaged from all urban land cover classes are close to the UHI intensity estimated from the low intensity urban area only while the UHI intensities are more than 2 degrees C larger in medium to high and high intensity urban areas. The UHI intensities estimated from the maximum temperature that have statistically significant increasing trends suggest that the maximum temperature is a good element for measuring UHI effect. Urban land cover dynamics play an important role in controlling temporal variation of UHI and the UHI hotspots. Our findings support the scientific value of implementing the prototype approach as an objective framework to quantify and monitor UHI intensity at a large geographic extent.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Differentiation of Cultivated Land and Its Response to Climatic Factors in Complex Geomorphic Areas-A Case Study of Sichuan Province of China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the distribution characteristics and influencing factors of cultivated land in complex geomorphic areas is significant in evaluating the agricultural farming environment and formulating cultivated land protection measures. This study extracted cultivated land information based on multi-source remote sensing data, and analyzed the geomorphic differentiation of cultivated land distribution and climate response from 2000 to 2020 using the Gini coefficient, spatial autocorrelation analysis and geographic detector. The results show that cultivated land is mainly distributed in low-altitude hills and low-altitude small undulating mountains, and secondarily in low-altitude alluvial and proluvial plains and platforms. Moreover, from 2000 to 2020, the cultivated land in the high-altitude and high-altitude undulating mountains and medium and high-altitude undulating mountains in the Northwest Plateau of Sichuan showed an upward trend, while the cultivated land in the Sichuan Basin mainly increased from the north and south to the middle of the basin. In addition, the highest temperature has the strongest ability to explain the spatial heterogeneity of cultivated land. From the calculation results of the influence coefficient of a single climatic factor and the combined effect of multiple climatic factors, the main factors that affect the distribution of cultivated land are different in different geomorphological regions. Finally, it is proposed to formulate a long-term strategy for agricultural production to adapt to climate change in complex geomorphic areas in order to reduce the negative impact of environmental change on agricultural production.

TI  - Urban Tree Extraction Method Based on LiDAR Data and Orthophoto
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction method of urban trees based on multisource remote sensing data is of great significance for urban resource investigation, health status evaluation, and scientific management. To further improve the accuracy of tree extraction, this paper combined the advantages of LiDAR and orthophoto data and proposed a tree extraction algorithm based on automatic feature segmentation. This algorithm is used to identify and extract the shadowed regions; the correlation between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and digital surface models (DSM) local entropy features is used to reduce the background extraction threshold by combining with histogram subtraction. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, which has been verified using the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, has a high precision of tree extraction on multiple datasets and is robust to a certain degree, thus being suitable to be used in complex environments.

TI  - Effects of Climate Change and Human Activities on Aeolian Desertification Reversal in Mu Us Sandy Land, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aeolian desertification in Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) in northern China have been paid much attention, but the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to desertification dynamics are still not clear. Based on the Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ and OLI images in 1975, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015, we developed a database of aeolian desertification land distribution, discussed the spatial and temporal variation of aeolian desertification, and discovered the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to desertification reversal, using the trends of the potential net primary productivity (NPP) and the human-influenced NPP with meteorological data and MODIS NPP products. The results indicated that aeolian desertification developed firstly from 1975 to 2000, with serious and severe aeolian desertification land continually increasing, and then changed into a reversal state from 2000 to 2015, as the serious aeolian desertification land decreased, although the severe, moderate and light aeolian desertification land lightly increased. Human activities were the dominant factor in desertification dynamics in MUSL and had different contributions to aeolian desertification reversal in different periods. This study will improve our understanding of the processes of aeolian desertification.

TI  - A Novel Workflow for Seasonal Wetland Identification Using Bi-Weekly Multiple Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate wetland mapping is essential for their protection and management; however, it is difficult to accurately identify seasonal wetlands because of irregular rainfall and the potential lack of water inundation. In this study, we propose a novel method to generate reliable seasonal wetland maps with a spatial resolution of 20 m using a seasonal-rule-based method in the Zhalong and Momoge National Nature Reserves. This study used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, along with a bi-weekly composition method to generate a 15-day image time series. The random forest algorithm was used to classify the images into vegetation, waterbodies, bare land, and wet bare land during each time period. Several rules were incorporated based on the intra-annual changes in the seasonal wetlands and annual wetland maps of the study regions were generated. Validation processes showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were above 89.8% and 0.87, respectively. The seasonal-rule-based method was able to identify seasonal marshes, flooded wetlands, and artificial wetlands (e.g., paddy fields). Zonal analysis indicated that seasonal wetland types, including flooded wetlands and seasonal marshes, accounted for over 50% of the total wetland area in both Zhalong and Momoge National Nature Reserves; and permanent wetlands, including permanent water and permanent marsh, only accounted for 11% and 12% in the two reserves, respectively. This study proposes a new method to generate reliable annual wetland maps that include seasonal wetlands, providing an accurate dataset for interannual change analyses and wetland protection decision-making.

TI  - Lite-YOLOv5: A Lightweight Deep Learning Detector for On-Board Ship Detection in Large-Scene Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites can provide microwave remote sensing images without weather and light constraints, so they are widely applied in the maritime monitoring field. Current SAR ship detection methods based on deep learning (DL) are difficult to deploy on satellites, because these methods usually have complex models and huge calculations. To solve this problem, based on the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) algorithm, we propose a lightweight on-board SAR ship detector called Lite-YOLOv5, which (1) reduces the model volume; (2) decreases the floating-point operations (FLOPs); and (3) realizes the on-board ship detection without sacrificing accuracy. First, in order to obtain a lightweight network, we design a lightweight cross stage partial (L-CSP) module to reduce the amount of calculation and we apply network pruning for a more compact detector. Then, in order to ensure the excellent detection performance, we integrate a histogram-based pure backgrounds classification (HPBC) module, a shape distance clustering (SDC) module, a channel and spatial attention (CSA) module, and a hybrid spatial pyramid pooling (H-SPP) module to improve detection performance. To evaluate the on-board SAR ship detection ability of Lite-YOLOv5, we also transplant it to the embedded platform NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Experimental results on the Large-Scale SAR Ship Detection Dataset-v1.0 (LS-SSDD-v1.0) show that Lite-YOLOv5 can realize lightweight architecture with a 2.38 M model volume (14.18% of model size of YOLOv5), on-board ship detection with a low computation cost (26.59% of FLOPs of YOLOv5), and superior detection accuracy (1.51% F1 improvement compared with YOLOv5).

TI  - Preoperative localization of sentinel lymph nodes using percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in patients with breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of preoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for patients with breast cancer. Methods: The patients with T1-T2N0M0 breast cancer who were scheduled for primary surgical treatment were recruited. All the patients had received a periareolar intradermal injection of an ultrasonic contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco, Milan, Italy) followed by an ultrasound to identify contrast-enhanced SLNs. A guidewire was deployed to localize the SLN. Methylene blue stain was used to help trace SLNs during the operation. The identification rate and accuracy rate were recorded. The number of SLNs labeled by two methods was counted and compared using Wilcoxon testing. Results: A total of 366 SLNs were detected in 72 patients by methylene blue intraoperatively, with a median of 5 lymph nodes [interquartile range (IQR), 4-6] per patient. A total of 95 SLNs were detected in 63 patients (87.5%) by CEUS, with a median of 1 lymph node (IQR, 1-2) per patient. The number of SLNs detected by CEUS was significantly less than that labeled by the methylene blue staining method (Z=-7.362, P=0000). Pathology confirmed 12 single metastases in all the lymph nodes examined, 10 of which were the only lymph node identified by CEUS. Conclusions: Periareolar intradermal injection of an ultrasonic contrast agent was an effective and convenient supplementary to localize SLNs. The technique was expected to improve the accuracy of axillary staging with minor surgical trauma and postoperative complications.

TI  - Kinematics of Irrigation-Induced Landslides in a Washington Desert: Impacts of Basal Geometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are often considered to be a natural hazard that frequently occurs in mountainous, precipitation-abundant regions worldwide; however, they can also occur in dry climates resulting from anthropogenic infuences, such as irrigation farming. Generally less affected by precipitation, landslides in arid regions are ideal for examining impacts of non-precipitation controls on landslide motion, such as basal geometry. Here, we focused on 25 large, irrigation-triggered, slow-moving and catastrophic landslides that occurred in a desert valley near Hanford, Washington along the Columbia River. Optical images in submeter resolution from 1996 to 2020 and Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation measurements from 2016 to 2020 were utilized to map 12 catastrophic landslides and obtain time-series deformation of 13 actively slow-moving landslide complexes. Our results show that the catastrophic landslides usually completed their life cycle from initiation to final deposition within minutes to days, whereas the slow-moving ones have lasted approximately 40 years, exhibiting rapid acceleration and a subsequent deceleration period that is almost 12 times longer. Though varying in rates, both types of landslides facilitate sediment transport into the Columbia River, which is of concern for aquatic habitats. Motion dynamics of the four riverside, slow-moving landslides were strongly modulated by the Columbia River height subject to seasonal dam water release, whereas the eight river-distant landslides primarily respond to the infiltrated irrigation water from the farmlands. We observed an apparent "early deceleration" phenomenon for the riverside Locke landslide, where the landslide starts to decelerate despite the threshold groundwater conditions being exceeded. We interpret that the early decelerations result from the forced water circulation near the basal-surface asperities, because river bathymetry data suggest that basal surfaces of the Locke landslide (originally the Columbia River bed) are highly irregular. This interpretation was also supported by numerical simulations, which show that incorporating the forced water circulation may help accurately predict the InSAR-observed maximum velocity and the timing of deceleration. Additionally, our analyses of basal profiles of 10 slow-moving and catastrophic landslides in the study region reveal that basal geometry could impart a bifurcation between slow and catastrophic landslide movements. Gentle basal surfaces are more likely associated with large, slow-moving landslides, whereas steep ones are often involved with relatively small, catastrophic landslides due to rapid kinetic energy gains while moving downslope. In general, the examined impacts of basal geometry in this study are widely applicable to natural landslides worldwide for their kinematics characterization and forecasting.

TI  - What Drove Regional Changes in the Number and Surface Area of Lakes Across the Yangtze River Basin During 2000-2019: Human or Climatic Factors?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distribution of lakes in the Yangtze River basin (YRB) has changed tremendously; however, research on how and why lakes changed across this basin is limited. In this study, based on Google Earth Engine, Landsat images were used to track lakes (>1 km(2)) across the YRB from 2000 to 2019. Then, the anthropogenic and climatic impacts on the evolution of lakes were fully discussed. Results showed that the distribution of lakes across the YRB was extremely uneven. From 2000 to 2019, the total number and the area (referring to the surface area) of lakes increased by 30 and declined by 885 km(2), respectively, but the trends of them were unobvious. In contrast, these changes and related causes exhibited high spatial heterogeneity. Lakes in the upper reaches significantly increased (P < 0.01). The expanded and new lakes were mainly distributed in the headwater catchment of the Yangtze River, which was closely related to increased precipitation. The number of lakes in the middle reaches decreased significantly (P < 0.05), which was primarily affected by intense human activities, such as land reclamation and agricultural irrigation. Precipitation played a dominant role in the fluctuation of the lake area here. In the lower reaches, the number of lakes increased (P < 0.01) as a result of the policy of "returning farmland to lakes," while the expansion of area (P < 0.05) was closely related to the precipitation and runoff. These findings have important policy implications for the conservation of lake resources.

TI  - The Wave Climate of the Sea of Azov
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the results of the retrospective numerical simulation of wind waves in the Sea of Azov using the SWAN spectral wave model and the ERA-Interim global reanalysis for 1979-2019. A digital model of the sea-floor relief of the Sea of Azov was used for the calculations. This model was built using a bathymetric map of the Sea of Azov, as well as nautical charts and remote sensing data. Verification of the model for the conditions that characterize the Sea of Azov was conducted using data from ship observations of wind waves. The features of the mean long-term wind wave patterns, as well as the seasonal, interannual, and interdecadal dynamics were presented. The main focus was on the following parameters: significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction. A description of storm conditions and a comparison with surge phenomena and ice conditions was also completed. The results indicated that, in contrast to Taganrog Bay, the wave patterns were heavily influenced according to the time of year (i.e., the seasons). The maximum wave heights were typical for the cold season of the year but not for the ice-free period. The interannual dynamics of wind waves were characterized by the alternation of three five-year periods of strengthening and weakening of wind waves. After 2002, the wave height increased in the summer and autumn seasons and slightly decreased in winter and spring. A shift of the storm season to a warmer period was also detected.

TI  - Vegetation Dynamics Due to Urbanization in the Coastal Cities along the Maritime Silk Road
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial research indicates the effects of urbanization on vegetation cover; however, a view of this scenario from a regional scale is absent. Nowadays, coastal cities have become the new engine for the development of countries in coastal areas. To capture the effects of rapid urbanization on vegetation dynamics, 35 coastal cities along the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) were selected to study the related research using quantitative tools. We calculated spatiotemporal trends of vegetation dynamics along an urban development intensity (UDI) gradient using the MODIS-enhanced vegetation index (EVI) during the period of 2000-2015. We found a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in the EVI in the core area against that in the rural area (Delta EVI) of 14 cities and an insignificant change in vegetation in the peri-urban areas or urban outskirts. EVI decreased significantly along the UDI gradients in 12 coastal cities with a linear pattern and in seven coastal cities with a concave pattern; only Bangkok exhibited a convex pattern. The nonlinear pattern between the EVI and UDI reflected the fact that vegetation dynamics were affected by complicated factors, including climate change and human interventions, over a long period of time. In conclusion, our work provided a scientific reference for the sustainable development of coastal cities along the MSR; further work is necessary to explore the mechanic details of the positive and negative influences of urban factors and related policies on vegetation conditions.

TI  - The Forest Change Footprint of the Upper Indus Valley, from 1990 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Indus Valley is the most important and vulnerable water tower in the South Asian subcontinent, which provides a vital water supply for 230 million people in the basin. Forests play an important role in water conservation in this region, and the security of upstream forests forms the foundation downstream water and food security. However, a big challenge is to effectively monitor the dynamics of the forest in this region. Thus, we used the LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation algorithm combined with 8203 scenes of multi-source remote sensing data to study the forest change footprint in the upper Indus Valley. The overall accuracy of LandTrendr extraction for forest disturbance and recovery was 86.01%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.73. The results showed the following: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of forest recovery was 1.01% more than that of disturbance, 70% of disturbance occurred between 1990 and 2001, and 60% of recovery occurred between 1999 and 2012. (2) Although the overall trend of forest disturbance and recovery was balanced, there were significant differences in forest management status among the different regions. Nepal has the highest forest stability, India has the largest area of forest disturbance, and Pakistan and China have the largest areas of forest recovery. (3) India's Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir are the two provinces with the largest disturbed areas, primarily due to grazing, fires, and commercial tree planting. Pakistan's North-West Frontier, Azad Kashmir, and China's Tibet Ali region were major contributors to the recovery, which was driven by afforestation policies in both countries. This study provides an important data base and monitoring method for planning land and forest use in Indus Valley countries, protecting fragile environments, and promoting policies for the Sustainable Development Goals.

T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 63-year-old woman with pathological anatomic/prognostic stage IA ER+/PR+/HER2- multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features of the left breast underwent lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. During evaluation of the CT simulation for adjuvant radiation (RT) treatment planning, a liver lesion and splenomegaly were noted. A subsequent MRI abdomen revealed a large, indeterminate splenic lesion with a wide differential and a benign liver cyst. The patient ultimately underwent splenectomy, with pathology consistent with littoral cell angioma, a rare entity associated with several malignancies. At last follow-up, 7 months after completion of RT, she remained cancer free while on anastrazole and was doing well clinically.

TI  - Urban vertical profiles of three most urbanized Chinese cities and the spatial coupling with horizontal urban expansion
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth has entered the century of city. Horizontal urban expansion has long been studied and is relatively well understood, but the knowledge of the vertical profiles of built structures remains limited. Here we propose a spatially explicit ensemble model and map the wall-to-wall building height of the three most urbanized Chinese cities in 2017 based on open-access Sentinel-1 SAR data, biophysical indices derived from Sentinel-2 multi spectral imageries, and nighttime light (NTL) intensity. We further conduct a chronosequence analysis of the building height for these cities along with their horizontal urban expansion between 1985 and 2017. We show that our proposed method performs well in generating 1 km x 1 km building height maps in Beijing (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 3.53 m), Shanghai (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 4.21 m), and Shenzhen (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 6.92 m). Shenzhen has the tallest (mean building height (MBH) = 37.63 m) and most diverse (coefficient of variation (CV) = 63.84%) vertical landscapes, followed by Shanghai (MBH = 29.86 m, CV= 51.14%). And the vertical profile is the lowest (MBH = 19.21 m) and relatively homogeneous (CV = 44.93%) in Beijing. We also find that vertical urban profiles are coupled with horizontal urban expansion, evidenced by an increase in building height along with the decreasing proximity to urban centers and the increasing urbanization intensity, and a clear imprint of urbanization age in all three cities. The specific characteristics vary among cities due primarily to local urbanization strategies. The knowledge of the vertical profiles of the three most urbanized Chinese cities complements the horizontal insights into urbanization and can assist sustainable land use and urban planning.

TI  - FY3E GNOS II GNSS Reflectometry: Mission Review and First Results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - FengYun-3E (FY3E), launched on 5 July 2021, is one of China's polar-orbiting meteorological satellite series. The GNOS II onboard FY3E is an operational GNSS remote sensor that for the first time combines GNSS radio occultation (GNSS RO) and GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R). It has eight reflection channels that can track eight specular points at the same time, receiving reflected signals from multiple GNSS systems, including GPS, BeiDou and Galileo. The basic GNSS-R output generated by GNOS II is a 122 x 20 non-uniform delay-Doppler map whose high resolution portion captures more information near the specular point. This paper introduces the GNSS-R aspect of the FengYun-3E GNOS II, including the instrument, power calibration and wind speed retrieval algorithm. Preliminary validation results for its first four months of data are also presented. After preliminary quality control, the overall wind speed error is less than 2 m/s at wind speeds below 20 m/s for data from both GPS satellites and BeiDou satellites when compared to the ECMWF reanalysis winds.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Estimation of Rice Height Using Time Series Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice height, as the fundamental biophysical attribute, is a controlling factor in crop phenology estimation and yield estimation. The aim of this study was to use time series Sentinel-1A images to estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of rice height. In this study, a particle filter (PF) was applied for the real-time estimation of rice height compared with a simplified water cloud model (SWCM) on the basis of rice mapping and transplanting date. It was found that the VH backscatter (sigma(vh)o) can potentially be applied to accurately estimate rice height compared with VV backscatter (sigma(o)(vv)), the sigma(vh)o/sigma(0)(vv) ratio, and the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI, 4* sigma(o)(vh)/(sigma(o)(vh)+sigma(o)(vv))). The results show that the rice height estimation by PF generated a better result with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) equal to 7.36 cm and a determination factor (R-2) of 0.95 compared with SWCM (RMSE = 12.59 cm and R-2 = 0.86). Moreover, rice height in the south and east of the study area was higher than in the north and west. The reason for this is that the south and east are near to the South China Sea, and there are higher temperatures and earlier transplanting. Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential of PF and sigma(o)(vh) to study the spatio-temporal distribution of crop height estimation. As a result, the PF method can contribute greatly to improvements in crop monitoring.

TI  - Geographical and temporal encoding for improving the estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in China using end-to-end gradient boosting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 ism (PM2.5) profoundly affects environmental systems and human health. To dynamically monitor fine particulate matter over large geographic areas, some machine learning methods have been utilized to estimate its concentration using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD). To improve the estimation of PM2.5 concentration across large areas, a geospatial-temporal joint code is proposed in this paper to characterize the influence of spatial-temporal information hidden in satellitebased aerosol products. This encoding method can reveal the relationship between the PM2.5 concentration and its geospatial location and observation time. Instead of aggregating observation data over neighbors, the method directly encodes the spatial-temporal information as features of the end-to-end gradient boosting model for the estimation of PM2.5. Experimental results of PM2.5 concentration in 2019 across China show that the state-of-theart method is outperformed by the proposed method by a large margin, with R-2 from 0.89 to 0.92, RMSE from 10.35 to 7.89 mu g/m(3), and MAE from 6.71 to 5.17 mu g/m(3). In addition, overall partial dependence plots (PDPs) are used for the first time to visualize the complicated relationship between satellite-based aerosol products and PM2.5 concentrations.

TI  - Mapping Plant Diversity Based on Combined SENTINEL-1/2 Data-Opportunities for Subtropical Mountainous Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant diversity is an important parameter in maintaining forest ecosystem services, functions and stability. Timely and accurate monitoring and evaluation of large-area wall-to-wall maps on plant diversity and its spatial heterogeneity are crucial for the conservation and management of forest resources. However, traditional botanical field surveys designed to estimate plant diversity are usually limited in their spatiotemporal resolutions. Using Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data at high spatiotemporal scales, combined with and referenced to botanical field surveys, may be the best choice to provide accurate plant diversity distribution information over a large area. In this paper, we predicted and mapped plant diversity in a subtropical forest using 24 months of freely and openly available S-1 and S-2 images (10 m x 10 m) data over a large study area (15,290 km(2)). A total of 448 quadrats (10 m x 10 m) of forestry field surveys were captured in a subtropical evergreen-deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest to validate a machine learning algorithm. The objective was to link the fine Sentinel spectral and radar data to several ground-truthing plant diversity indices in the forests. The results showed that: (1) The Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were the best predicted indices using random forest regression, with (r) over cap (2) of around 0.65; (2) The use of S-1 radar data can enhance the accuracy of the predicted heterogeneity indices in the forests by approximately 0.2; (3) As for the mapping of Simpson and Shannon-Wiener, the overall accuracy was 67.4% and 64.2% respectively, while the texture diversity's overall accuracy was merely 56.8%; (4) From the evaluation and prediction map information, the Simpson, Shannon-Wiener and texture diversity values (and its confidence interval values) indicate spatial heterogeneity in pixel level. The large-area forest plant diversity indices maps add spatially explicit information to the ground-truthing data. Based on the results, we conclude that using the time-series of S-1 and S-2 radar and spectral characteristics, when coupled with limited ground-truthing data, can provide reasonable assessments of plant spatial heterogeneity and diversity across wide areas. It could also help promote forest ecosystem and resource conservation activities in the forestry sector.

TI  - Identifying Urban Wetlands through Remote Sensing Scene Classification Using Deep Learning: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban wetlands provide cities with unique and valuable ecosystem services but are under great degradation pressure. Correctly identifying urban wetlands from remote sensing images is fundamental for developing appropriate management and protection plans. To overcome the semantic limitations of traditional pixel-level urban wetland classification techniques, we proposed an urban wetland identification framework based on an advanced scene-level classification scheme. First, the Sentinel-2 high-resolution multispectral image of Shenzhen was segmented into 320 m x 320 m square patches to generate sample datasets for classification. Next, twelve typical convolutional neural network (CNN) models were transformed for the comparison experiments. Finally, the model with the best performance was used to classify the wetland scenes in Shenzhen, and pattern and composition analyses were also implemented in the classification results. We found that the DenseNet121 model performed best in classifying urban wetland scenes, with overall accuracy (OA) and kappa values reaching 0.89 and 0.86, respectively. The analysis results revealed that the wetland scene in Shenzhen is generally balanced in the east-west direction. Among the wetland scenes, coastal open waters accounted for a relatively high proportion and showed an obvious southward pattern. The remaining swamp, marsh, tidal flat, and pond areas were scattered, accounting for only 4.64% of the total area of Shenzhen. For scattered and dynamic urban wetlands, we are the first to achieve scene-level classification with satisfactory results, thus providing a clearer and easier-to-understand reference for management and protection, which is of great significance for promoting harmony between humanity and ecosystems in cities.

TI  - Spectral Index for Mapping Topsoil Organic Matter Content Based on ZY1-02D Satellite Hyperspectral Data in Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of soil organic matter content (SOMC) is essential for soil quality evaluation. Compared with traditional multispectral remote sensing for SOMC mapping, the distribution of SOMC in a certain area can be obtained quickly by using hyperspectral remote sensing data. The Advanced Hyper-Spectral Imager (AHSI) onboard the ZY1-02D satellite can simultaneously obtain spectral information in 166 bands from visible (400 nm) to shortwave infrared (2500 nm), providing an important data source for SOMC mapping. In this study, SOMC-related spectral indices (SIs) suitable for this satellite were analyzed and evaluated in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province. A series of SIs were constructed for the bare soil and vegetation-covered (mainly rice crops and tree seedlings) areas by combining spectral transformations (such as reciprocal and square root) and dual-band index formulas (such as ratio and difference), respectively. The optimal SIs were determined based on Pearson's correlation coefficient (rho) and satellite data quality, and applied to SOMC level mapping and estimation. The results show that: (1) The SI with the highest rho in the bare soil area is the ratio index of original reflectance at 654 and 679 nm (OR-RI(654,679)), whereas the SI in the vegetation area is the square root of the difference between the reciprocal reflectance at 551 and 1998 nm (V-RR-DSI(551,1998)); (2) the spatial distribution trend of regional SOMC results obtained by linear regression models of OR-RI(654,679) and V-RR-DSI(551,1998) is consistent with the samples; (3) based on the optimal SIs, support vector machine and tree ensembles were used to predict the SOMC of bare soil and vegetation-covered areas of Shuyang County, respectively. The determination coefficient of the soil-vegetation combined prediction results is 0.775, the root mean square error is 3.72 g/kg, and the residual prediction deviation is 2.12. The results show that the proposed SIs for ZY1-02D satellite hyperspectral data are of great potential for SOMC mapping.

TI  - A Scale-Separating Framework for Fusing Satellite Land Surface Temperature Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite imagery is a long-standing problem in satellite remote sensing applications. The lack of daily land surface temperature (LST) data with fine spatial resolution has hampered the understanding of surface climatic phenomena, such as the urban heat island (UHI). Here, we developed a fusion framework, characterized by a scale-separating process, to generate LST data with high spatiotemporal resolution. The scale-separating framework breaks the fusion task into three steps to address errors at multiple spatial scales, with a specific focus on intra-scene variations of LST. The framework was experimented with MODIS and Landsat LST data. It first removed inter-sensor biases, which depend on season and on land use type (urban versus rural), and then produced a Landsat-like sharpened LST map for days when MOIDS observations are available. The sharpened images achieved a high accuracy, with a RMSE of 0.91 K for a challenging heterogeneous landscape (urban area). A comparison between the sharpened LST and the air temperature measured with bicycle-mounted mobile sensors revealed the roles of impervious surface fraction and wind speed in controlling the surface-to-air temperature gradient in an urban landscape.

TI  - Reforestation improves vegetation coverage and biomass, but not spatial structure, on semi-arid mine dumps
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern mine rehabilitation aims at thorough restoration of an ecosystem with emphasis on not only land area covered by vegetation but also the structure and function of that vegetation. However, assessment of current restoration success reveals a lack of attention to the spatial structure and its relationships with vegetation coverage and biomass. A forest's spatial structure is an important attribute of structural diversity. Complex spatial structures mean diverse species composition and spatial dissimilarity, which can provide a base for selfsustaining and regeneration. This study uses WorldView-2 images and field data to train the mind evolutionary algorithm-back propagation neural network (MEA-BP) model for the purpose of mapping three parameters (coverage, biomass, and spatial structure) across mine dumps. The results show that the spectral and textural features could effectively assess the coverage, biomass, and spatial structure, with an R-2 of 0.91, 0.86, and 0.62, respectively. The coverage is positively correlated with biomass, while the spatial structure is negatively correlated with coverage and biomass. Pure Hippophae rhamnoides L. had high coverage but very low spatial structure, while the mixed community dominated by Populus L. and Pinus tabulaeformis Carr had high coverage, high biomass, and medium structure at around 10 years. The results suggested that the artificial reforestation improves vegetation coverage and biomass but did not synchronously increase spatial structure. The initially planted species composition, substrates, and succession process have a significant influence on the forest parameter relationships. The future reforestation and optimization of community assemblages should take the relationships and their influence factors and effects on ecosystem services into account. The remote sensing based data and model has potential and advantages in dynamically guiding the rehabilitation and monitoring of the restored ecosystem.

TI  - A New Adaptive Remote Sensing Extraction Algorithm for Complex Muddy Coast Waterline
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline is an important geographical element of the boundary between ocean and land. Due to the impact of the ocean-land interactions at multiple temporal-spatial scales and the intensified human activities, the waterline of muddy coast is undergoing long-term and continuous dynamic changes. Using traditional remote sensing-based waterline extraction methods, it is difficult to achieve ideal results for muddy coast waterlines, which are faced with problems such as limited algorithm stability, weak algorithm migration, and discontinuous coastlines extraction results. In response to the above challenges, three different types of muddy coasts, Yancheng, Jiuduansha and Xiangshan were selected as the study areas. Based on the Sentinel-2 MSI images, we proposed an adaptive remote sensing extraction algorithm framework for the complex muddy coast waterline, named AEMCW (Adaptive Extraction for Muddy Coast Waterline), including main procedures of high-pass filtering, histogram statistics and adaptive threshold determination, which has the capability to obtain continuous and high-precision muddy coastal waterline. NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index), MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) and ED (Edge Detection) methods were selected to compare the extraction effect of AEMCW method. The length and spatial accuracy of these four methods were evaluated with the same criteria. The accuracy evaluation presented that the length errors of ED method in all three study areas were minimum, but the waterline results were offset more to the land side, due to spectral similarity, turbid water and tidal flats having similar values of NDWI and MNDWI. Therefore, the length and spatial accuracies of NDWI and MNDWI methods were lower than AEMCW method. The length errors of the AEMCW algorithm in Yancheng, Jiuduansha, and Xiangshan were 14.4%, 18.0%, and 7.7%, respectively. The producer accuracies were 94.3%, 109.6%, and 94.2%, respectively. The user accuracies were 82.4%, 92.9%, and 87.5%, respectively. These results indicated that the proposed AEMCW algorithm can effectively restrain the influence of spectral noise from various land cover types and ensure the continuity of waterline extraction results. The adaptive threshold determination equation reduced the influence of human factors on threshold selection. The further application on ZY-1 02D hyperspectral images in the Yancheng area verified the proposed algorithm is transferable and has good stability.

TI  - Evaluation of the Emissions State of a Satellite Laser Altimeter Based on Laser Footprint Imaging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-7(GF-7) satellite is equipped with China's first laser altimeter for Earth observation; it has the capability of full waveform recording, which can obtain global high-precision three-dimensional coordinates over a wide range. The laser is inevitably affected by platform tremors, random errors in the laser pointing angle, laser state, and other factors, which further affect the measurement accuracy of the laser footprint. Therefore, evaluation of the satellite laser launch state is an important process. This study contributes to laser emission state evaluations based on the laser footprint image in terms of two main two aspects: (1) Monitoring changes in the laser pointing angle-laser pointing is closely related to positioning accuracy, which mainly results from monitoring the change in the laser spot centroid. We propose a threshold constraint algorithm that extracts the centroid of an ellipse-fitting spot. (2) Analysis of the energy distribution state-directly obtaining the parameters used in the traditional evaluation method is a challenge for the satellite. Therefore, an index suitable for evaluating the laser emissions state of the GF-7 satellite was constructed according to the data characteristics. Based on these methods, long time-series data were evaluated and analyzed. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the emissions state of the laser altimeter, during which the laser pointing angle changes monthly by 0.434 ''. During each continuous operation of the laser, the energy state decreased gradually, with a small variation range; however, both were generally in a stable state.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations of Aerosols in China during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread nature of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is gradually changing people's lives and impacting economic development worldwide. Owing to the curtailment of daily activities during the lockdown period, anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants have greatly reduced, and this influence is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Spatiotemporal variations in aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be used to analyze this influence. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed AOD and NO2 data obtained from satellite remote sensing data inversion. First, data were corrected using Eidetic three-dimensional-long short-term memory to eliminate errors related to sensors and algorithms. Second, taking Hubei Province in China as the experimental area, spatiotemporal variations in AOD and NO2 concentration during the pandemic were analyzed. Finally, based on the results obtained, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on human life has been summarized. This work will be of great significance to the formulation of regional epidemic prevention and control policies and the analysis of spatiotemporal changes in aerosols.

TI  - A Coupled BRDF CO<sub>2</sub> Retrieval Method for the GF-5 GMI and Improvements in the Correction of Atmospheric Scattering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenhouse Gases Monitoring Instrument (GMI), on board the Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite, provides rich observation data for the global remote sensing of atmospheric CO2. To meet the high-precision satellite retrieval needs of atmospheric CO2, this paper designs a coupled bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) CO2 retrieval (CBCR) method, which describes the surface reflectance characteristics by the BRDF, corrects for atmospheric scattering based on full physics retrieval theory, and ensures the stable retrieval of multiple parameters and atmospheric CO2 by enriching prior constraints. Theoretical analysis shows that the influence of atmospheric scattering induced by the surface bidirectional reflectance characteristics is significantly related to the aerosol optical depth (AOD), solar zenith angle (SZA), and viewing zenith angle (VZA). The validation of GMI CO2 retrievals shows that the CBCR method significantly reduced the influence of the surface bidirectional reflectance characteristics under high AOD and high SZA conditions, decreased the atmospheric CO2 retrieval error from 0.58 +/- 5.64 ppm to -1.33 +/- 3.13 ppm, and increased the correlation with the temporal variation of actual atmospheric CO2 from 34.7 to 76.8%. Our CBCR method can correct the influence of atmospheric scattering induced by the surface bidirectional reflectance characteristics on atmospheric CO2 retrieval, and this work demonstrates that describing the surface reflectance characteristics by using BRDF is a promising idea in the field of satellite CO2 retrievals.

TI  - Investigation of the consistency of Swarm data and CHAOS-6 towards crustal magnetic field studies in China
T2  - APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We investigate using satellite geomagnetic data and their derived field models to study the crustal field. We focus on China to understand whether field models completely explain the crustal field of the regional extent and whether a high-quality satellite contains additional information, particularly on small scales, enhancing crustal field studies and improving model resolution. We use Swarm satellite data and the CHAOS-6 model and examine along-track one-degree differences in latitude bin averages of satellite data to seek additional small-scale structures. The results show that the CHAOS-6 model does a very good job of explaining the data. The mean square deviation is similar to 3 nT. Moreover, the model broadly explains secular variation with certain misfits but not consistent between tracks. We report an anomalous unmodeled feature in the data. However, as this is located close to the magnetic equator, this may be attributed to an external field source. We conclude that crustal field studies should primarily focus on models and not data.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution, Prediction and Optimization of LUCC Based on CA-Markov and InVEST Models: A Case Study of Mentougou District, Beijing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid advancement of urbanization and industrialization, the contradiction between the social economy and resources and the environment has become increasingly prominent. On the basis of limited land resources, the way to promote multi-objective comprehensive development such as economic, social development and ecological and environmental protection through structure and layout regulation, so as to maximize regional comprehensive benefits, is an important task of current land spatial planning. Our aim is to obtain land-use-change data in the study area using remote-sensing data inversion and multiple-model simulation. Based on land suitability evaluation, we predict and optimize the land use structure of the study area in 2030 and evaluate and compare ecosystem services. Based on remote-sensing images and eco-environmental data from 1985 to 2014 in the study area, land use/land cover change (LUCC) and future simulation data were obtained by using supervised classification, landscape metrics and the CA-Markov model. The ecosystem services were evaluated by the InVEST model. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to evaluate the land suitability for LUCC. Finally, the LUCC in 2030 under two different scenarios, Scenario_1 (prediction) and Scenario_2 (optimization), were evaluated, and the ecosystem service functions were compared. In the last 30 years, the landscape in the study area has gradually fragmented, and the built-up land has expanded rapidly, increased by one-third, mainly at the cost of cropland, orchards and wasteland. According to the suitability evaluation, giving priority to the land use types with higher environmental requirements will ensure the study area has a higher ecosystem service value. The rapid development of urbanization has a far-reaching impact on regional LUCC. Intensive land resources need reasonable and scientific land use planning, and land use planning should be based on the suitability evaluation of land resources, which can improve the regional ecosystem service function.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations in Fish Assemblage in Feitsui Reservoir, in Northern Taiwan, from 2006-2020
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs are artificial ecosystems that modify the hydrological and environmental components nearby. The long-term monitoring of fish assemblages in reservoirs may provide key information to understand how these artificial ecosystems allow fish population fluctuations and identify proper conservation strategies. A sentinel-site approach method assessed changes in fish assemblages in the Feitsui Reservoir (1024 ha) over 14 years, including the periods 2006-2008, 2010-2011, 2016, 2018, and 2020. Fish assemblages, sampled using gill nets, were composed of 38 species (12 families and 8 orders) with Cyprinidae as the dominant family; the fish fauna were dominated by species of the family Cyprinidae (71%) and Cichlidae (20.3%). Principal component analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling categorized the assemblages into two groups (cold and warm seasons), and we identified three parameters that were significantly correlated with the season (p < 0.05): SD (R = -0.04), Chl-a (R = 0.01), and algal count (R = 0.19); the algal count was higher in the warm season than in the cold season. The fish assemblage in the cold and warm seasons contained no exclusive taxa, contributing to the dissimilarity between the groups. The fish assemblage for the years before and after 2010 indicated partial overlap between the two groups; S. macrops contributed greatly to the separation of the two periods (>10% each; SIMPER) and O. mossambicus was dominant in assemblage structures after 2010. Our findings show the importance of long-term fish monitoring for the investigation of the effects of nonnative fish species on native fish species composition.

TI  - Analysis of Spatial Heterogeneity and Influencing Factors of Ecological Environment Quality in China's North-South Transitional Zone
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological environment is important for the natural disaster prevention of human society. The monitoring of ecological environment quality has far-reaching practical significance for the functional construction of ecosystem services and policy coordination. Based on Landsat 8 operational land image (OLI)/thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) remote sensing image data, this study selected the normalized vegetation (NDVI), tasseled cap transformation humidity (WI), bare soil (SI), construction index (NDSI), and land surface temperature (LST) indexes from the aspects of greenness, humidity, dryness, and heat. Using spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) and the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) analyzed the spatial differentiation characteristics and influencing factors of the original remote sensing ecological index (RSEI0). The results showed that: (1) the overall RSEI average value of the Qinling-Daba Mountains in 2017 was 0.61, and the ecological environment quality was at a "Good" level. Greenness contributed the most to the comprehensive index of the area, and vegetation distribution had a significant impact on the ecological environment quality of the study area. Heat is a secondary impact, and it has an inhibitory effect on habitat quality; (2) the overall distribution of regional ecological environment quality was quite different, with the ecological environment quality level showing a decreasing trend from low to high altitude; RSEI0 spatial heterogeneity at the optimal scale of 2 km was the largest, and the nugget effect was 88% which indicated a high degree of spatial variability, mainly affected by structural factors; (3) Slope, relief amplitude, elevation, the proportion of high-vegetation area, proportion of construction land area, and average population density significantly impact the spatial differentiation of RSEI0. The explanatory powers of slope and relief amplitude were 56.1% and 65.3%, respectively, which were the main factors affecting the spatial differentiation of the ecological environment quality in high undulation. The results can provide important scientific support for ecological environment construction and ecological restoration in the study area.

TI  - Evaluation of Empirical Atmospheric Models Using Swarm-C Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Swarm-C satellite, a new instrument for atmospheric study, has been the focus of many studies to evaluate its usage and accuracy. This paper takes the Swarm-C satellite as a research object to verify the Swarm-C accelerometer's inversion results. This paper uses the two-row orbital elements density inversion to verify the atmospheric density accuracy results of the Swarm-C satellite accelerometer. After the accuracy of the satellite data is verified, this paper conducts comparative verification and empirical atmospheric model evaluation experiments based on the Swarm-C accelerometer's inversion results. After comparing with the inversion results of the Swarm-C semi-major axis attenuation method, it is found that the atmospheric density obtained by inversion using the Swarm-C accelerometer is more dynamic and real-time. It shows that with more available data, the Swarm-C satellite could be a new high-quality instrument for related studies along with the well-established satellites. After evaluating the performance of the JB2008 and NRLMSISE-00 empirical atmospheric models using the Swarm-C accelerometer inversion results, it is found that the accuracy and real-time performance of the JB2008 model at the altitude where the Swarm-C satellite is located are better than the NRLMSISE-00 model.

TI  - Estimating the Horizontal and Vertical Distributions of Pigments in Canopies of Ginkgo Plantation Based on UAV-Borne LiDAR, Hyperspectral Data by Coupling PROSAIL Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pigments are the biochemical material basis for energy and material exchange between vegetation and the external environment, therefore quantitative determination of pigment content is crucial. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-borne remote sensing data coupled with radiative transfer models (RTM) provide marked strengths for three-dimensional (3D) visualization, as well as accurate determination of the distributions of pigment content in forest canopies. In this study, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral images acquired by a multi-rotor UAV were assessed with the PROSAIL model (i.e., PROSPECT model coupled with 4SAIL model) and were synthetically implemented to estimate the horizontal and vertical distribution of pigments in canopies of Ginkgo plantations in a study site within coastal southeast China. Firstly, the fusion of LiDAR point cloud and hyperspectral images was carried out in the frame of voxels to obtain fused hyperspectral point clouds. Secondly, the PROSAIL model was calibrated using specific model parameters of Ginkgo trees and the corresponding look-up tables (LUTs) of leaf pigment content were constructed and optimally selected. Finally, based on the optimal LUTs and combined with the hyperspectral point clouds, the horizontal and vertical distributions of pigments in different ages of ginkgo trees were mapped to explore their distribution characteristics. The results showed that 22-year-old ginkgo trees had higher biochemical pigment content (increase 3.37-55.67%) than 13-year-old ginkgo trees. Pigment content decreased with the increase of height, whereas pigment content from the outer part of tree canopies showed a rising tendency as compared to the inner part of canopies. Compared with the traditional vegetation index models (R-2 = 0.25-0.46, rRMSE = 16.25-19.37%), the new approach developed in this study exhibited significant higher accuracies (R-2 = 0.36-0.60, rRMSE = 13.53-16.86%). The results of this study confirmed the effectiveness of coupling the UAV-borne LiDAR and hyperspectral image with the PROSAIL model for accurately assessing pigment content in ginkgo canopies, and the developed estimation methods can also be adopted to other regions under different conditions, providing technical support for sustainable forest management and precision silvicuture for plantations.

TI  - Compassion and Self-Concern in Halakhic Environmental Decision-Making
T2  - WORLDVIEWS-GLOBAL RELIGIONS CULTURE AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevailing stance in Jewish orthodoxy is that environmental issues are extra-legal and not under the purview of halakhah (Jewish law). While considered important, environmental protection falls only under "midat hahasidut" (extraordinary piety). This ultimately translates into environmental protection being treated as nonobligatory and only under the purview of righteous behavior rather than obligation. This has created a significant barrier to halakhically driven environmental decision-making. I argue that this worldview emerges from the process of conceptualizing the prohibition of bat tashhit-"waste not," the prohibition against wastefulness originating in Deuteronomy tong. This verse gave rise to two worldviews: one which was prioritized of not destroying the environment out of compassion for the non-human world, and another marginalized worldview that emphasized a self-concerned environmentalism which equates harm to the environment as self-harm. Privileging this latter worldview creates a pathway to advance Jewish legal discourse and align it with mainstream environmentalism.

TI  - The River-Sea Interaction off the Amazon Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon River has the highest discharge in the world. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of the research on the interaction between river-diluted water and the ocean. This study used the remote sensing data (2008-2017) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite, and data of the currents, wind fields, sea surface temperature, and water depth. The river-sea interaction off the Amazon estuary was studied by analyzing the diffusion of river-diluted water and the distribution of surface suspended particulate matter (SPM). The results revealed that the Amazon estuary has a "filter effect," whereby the distribution of the surface SPM exhibited significant spatial characteristics of being high in the nearshore area and low in the offshore area. Most of the SPM accumulated within the estuary in a fan shape, although some was distributed in the shallow water region of the continental shelf along the coasts on both sides of the estuary. The currents were found to limit the diffusion range of SPM. The flow direction and velocity of the North Brazil Current and the North Equatorial Countercurrent, which are largely driven by the magnitude of the trade wind stress, are the main forces controlling the long-distance diffusion of diluted water, thus forming unique river-sea interaction patterns in the Amazon estuary. This research provides a supplement and reference for the study of the diffusion process of SPM and river-diluted water, and on the estuarine river-sea interactions of other large rivers worldwide.

TI  - Slip model of the 2021 <i>M</i><sub>s</sub>7. 4 Madoi earthquake constrained by GNSS and InSAR coseismic deformation
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - On May 22, 2021, an M(s)7. 4 earthquake occurred in Madoi county, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province of China. The epicenter was located in the Bayan Har block in the middle of the Tibetan Plateau. It was another strong earthquake occurred in the Bayan Har block after eight M >= 7 earthquakes occurred around the boundaries of the block in recent 20 years. It is also the largest earthquake in China since the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Therefore, the cause of the earthquake and the regional seismic risk deserve special attention. The near-field campaign GNSS observations, combined with continuous GNSS observations, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2 InSAR observations were used to obtain the fine coseismic deformation field of the Madoi earthquake. The horizontal deformation field derived from GNSS was remarkable. The maximum horizontal displacements of GNSS stations located on both sides of the fault are 0.7 m and -1.2 m, respectively. The deformation was remains 1 cm even at a large distance of 200 km from the epicenter. The InSAR coseismic deformation field of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 shows that the earthquake caused a surface rupture of about 160 km long, with the maximum line-of-sight (LOS) deformation of 0.9 m and 1.2 m respectively. Based on the coseismic deformation field derived from GNSS and InSAR interferograms, we inverted for the slip distribution. The result showed that the seismogenic fault consists of a main segment and a secondary segment with the length of 170 km and 20 km, respectively. The main segment dips to the north, and its dip angle is 85 degrees. The average rake angle was 4.36, indicating that the Madoi earthquake was dominated by a left-lateral strike-slip. The dip direction of the secondary segment is opposite to that of the main, with a dip angle of 68, and the average rake angle was -11.84 degrees. The coseismic slip is concentrated at a depth of 0 similar to 15 km. The maximum slip was 4.4 m, at a depth of 6.97 km. The estimated total seismic moment is 1.61 X 10(20) N . m, corresponding to a magnitude of M-w 7. 4. There are 4 asperities ruptured by the earthquake on the main segment, and the Madoi earthquake is an asymmetrically bilateral rupture event. Combined with results from the aftershock relocation, field investigation and tectonic background, we believe that the seismogenic fault is the pre-existing Kunlunshankou-Jiangcuo fault and the rupture mechanism of the secondary fracture in the east is different from the main rupture mechanism. The coseismic Coulomb stress changes shows that the stress on the Maqen segment of the East Kunlun fault was enhanced, implying that there is the possibility of strong earthquakes in this region in the future.

TI  - Vaccine for yourself, your community, or your country? Examining audiences' response to distance framing of COVID-19 vaccine messages
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study explored the effects of COVID-19 vaccine promotion messages highlighting the benefit at individual, community, and country levels. Based on the cultural theory of risks, we investigated how individuals' valuation of individualism vs. communitarianism and hierarchical vs. egalitarian social structure affect their responses to vaccine messages. Methods: An online experiment (N = 702) with four video message conditions (individual-centered, community-centered, country-centered, and no message) was conducted. Participants were asked about their cultural cognition worldview, then were randomly assigned to view one message. Participants also reported their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccines and support for vaccine mandate. Results: Respondents were more likely to get vaccinated and support vaccine mandates after viewing an individual-centered message, less with a community-centered message. Individuals who value individualism were more likely to respond positively to individual-centered messages, but those who believe more in communitarianism value were less likely. Conclusion: Results showed that individuals are motivated selectively to respond to certain claims that cohere with their worldview and therefore respond differently to vaccine benefit frames. Practice Implications: The results point to the importance of understanding audiences' worldviews. By identifying this process through hierarchical and individualistic values, properly designed health promotion messages can maximize the desired outcomes. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of land cover and phenology changes on the gross primary productivity in an <i>Artemisia ordosica</i> shrubland
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims We aimed to examine how changes in vegetation cover and phenology affect the trend of gross primary productivity (GPP) in an Artemisia ordosica shrubland in the Mau Us Desert during the first two decades of the 21th century.Methods We used the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) in combination with remote sensing data (MODIS) to simulate GPP dynamics during 2005-2018. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of GPP (GPP(Flux)) were used to parameterize and validate the VPM model. The "derivation and threshold" approach was used to determine the start (SOS) and the end of the growing season (EOS), as well as the length of the growing season (LOS) for each year. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to examine the variations in temperature, normalized differences vegetation index (NDVI), and GPP over time. OLS, multiple, and partial correlation analyses were used to test the relationships among temperature, NDVI, phenology, and GPP.Important findings (1) Modeled GPP well captured the dynamics of GPP(Flux), whereas the MODIS product (MODI7A2H) significantly underestimated GPP (Flux). (2) NDVI, annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax), and annual GPP all showed an increasing trend during 2005-2018, indicating the role of vegetation recovery in promoting GPP. (3) SOS showed an advancing trend (2.1 d.a(-1)) and EOS showed a delaying trend (1.5 d.a(-1)), and therefore both SOS and EOS contributed to the increasing trend of LOS (3.6 d.a(-1)). (4) Annual GPP was higher with greater LOS (6.44 g C.m(-2).a(-1) for 1 day increase in LOS). (5) Increases in vegetation cover and growing season length explained 79% and 57% of the variations in GPP, respectively. (6) Increases in vegetation cover played a more important role than growing season extension in promoting GPP.

TI  - SITS-Former: A pre-trained spatio-spectral-temporal representation model for Sentinel-2 time series classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 images provide a rich source of information for a variety of land cover, vegetation, and environmental monitoring applications due to their high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. Recently, deep learning-based classification of Sentinel-2 time series becomes a popular solution to vegetation classification and land cover mapping, but it often demands a large number of manually annotated labels. Improving classification performance with limited labeled data is still a challenge in many real-world remote sensing applications. To address label scarcity, we present SITS-Former (SITS stands for Satellite Image Time Series and Former stands for Transformer), a pre-trained representation model for Sentinel-2 time series classification. SITS-Former adopts a Transformer encoder as the backbone and takes time series of image patches as input to learn spatio-spectral-temporal features. According to the principles of self-supervised learning, we pre-train SITS-Former on massive unlabeled Sentinel-2 time series via a missing-data imputation proxy task. Given an incomplete time series with some patches being masked randomly, the network is asked to regress the central pixels of these masked patches based on the residual ones. By doing so, the network can capture high-level spatial and temporal dependencies from the data to learn discriminative features. After pre-training, the network can adapt the learned features to a target classification task through fine-tuning. As far as we know, this is the first study that exploits self-supervised learning for patch-based representation learning and classification of SITS. We quantitatively evaluate the quality of the learned features by transferring them on two crop classification tasks, showing that SITS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and yields a significant improvement (2.64%similar to 3.30% in overall accuracy) over the purely supervised model. The proposed model provides an effective tool for SITS-related applications as it greatly reduces the burden of manual labeling. The source code will be released at htt ps://github.com/linlei1214/SITS-Former upon publication.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Variations in Surface Albedo on Urumqi Glacier No.1 in Tien Shan, under Arid and Semi-Arid Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo exerts substantial control over the energy available for glacier melting. For Urumqi Glacier No.1 in the Tien Shan Mountains, China, represented as a "summer accumulation" glacier, the variations in albedo driven by surface processes are complex and still poorly understood. In this study, we examined the interannual trends in ablation-period albedo from 2000 to 2021 using MOD10A1 products, evaluated the variation in bare-ice albedo retrieved from 13 end-of-summer Landsat images obtained between 2002 and 2019, and investigated the seasonal variation and diurnal cycle of surface albedo collected near the equilibrium line of the glacier by an AWS from September 2018 to August 2021. During the period of 2000-2021, the average ablation-period albedo presented a slight but not statistically significant downward trend, with a total decrease of 1.87%. Specifically, the decrease in glacier albedo was quicker in July than that in August, and there was a slight increase in May and June. The blackening phenomenon was shown on the east branch glacier, but not on the west branch glacier. For seasonal variability, a bimodal pattern was demonstrated, different from the unimodal seasonal variation in other midlatitude glaciers. The albedo peaks occurred in December and April or May. Under clear sky conditions, the diurnal cycle presented three patterns: a symmetric pattern, an asymmetric pattern, and a progressive decreasing pattern. Air temperature and solid precipitation are the main drivers of variations in glacier albedo, but in different periods of the ablation season, two climate variables affect albedo to varying degrees. The effect of surface albedo reduction enhanced glacier melting by about 20% over the past 20 years. The short-term increase in albedo caused by summer snowfall can considerably reduce glacier melting by as much as 80% in June.

TI  - Satellite-Based Methodology for Purposes of Rescue Archaeology of Cultural Heritage Threatened by Dam Construction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The destruction of cultural heritage caused by dams represents a major issue especially in an age of climate change and narrowly focused development policies. To counteract this phenomenon, archaeologists and cultural heritage experts have relied upon rescue archaeology practices generally limited to fieldwork methodologies, while remote sensing of satellite imagery remains under-considered. To bridge this gap, we build on a multidisciplinary collaboration exploring the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and open access multispectral satellite imagery, for quantifying the archaeological evidence located within a prospective reservoir area before dam construction. Based on previous research by Marchetti (2020) claiming the necessity for ad hoc protocols to document and monitor the impact of dams on cultural heritage, we selected two complementary situations: the planned dam of Halabiyeh in Syria and the under construction Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. These case studies were analyzed with state-of-the-art methodologies to develop a feasible workflow that may contribute to fostering the use of satellite imagery in operational contexts such as those represented by these particular cases, and be replicated by archaeologists in other areas. The workflow is designed to be integrated to ground-truthing methodologies into two dedicated protocols named Pre-Construction Archaeological Risk Assessment (PCARA) and Pre-Flooding Rescue Archaeological Program (PFRAP) which could eventually become a standard procedure for rescue archaeology in dams areas.

TI  - Improved Performance of Geospatial Model to Access the Tidal Flood Impact on Land Use by Evaluating Sea Level Rise and Land Subsidence Parameters
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 20st century, climate change caused an increase in temperature that accelerated the rate of sea level. Sea level rise and land subsidence threaten densely populated coastal areas as well as lowlands because they cause tidal flooding. Tidal floods occur every year due to an increase in sea level rise and land subsidence. The lack of information on this phenomenon causes delays in disaster mitigation, leading to serious problems. This study was conducted to predict the area of tidal flood inundation on land use in 2020 to 2035. This research was performed in Pekalongan Regency, as one of the areas experiencing large land subsidence and sea level rise. The research data to be used were tides and the value of soil subsidence. as well as sea level rise. Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was obtained through a topographic survey. Modeling was used for DTM reconstruction based on land subsidence and sea level rise every year. The sea level rise value uses the satellite altimetry data from 1993-2018. A field survey was conducted to validate the inundation model that has been created. Land subsidence was processed using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image data with Single Band Algorithm (SBA) differential interferoineuy. This study proved that tidal flooding has increased every year where in 2020 it was 783.99 hectares, but with the embankment there was a reduction in inundation area of 1.68 hectares. The predicted area of tidal flood inundation in 2025, 2030 and 2035 without the embankment is 3388.98 hectares, 6523.19 hectares, 7578.94 hectares, while with the embankment in 2035 is 1686.62 hectares. The research results showed that the use of embankments is a solution for coastal mitigation as well as regional planning.

TI  - The Trajectories, Trends, and Opportunities for Assessing Urban Ecosystem Services: A Systematic Review of Geospatial Methods
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Urban ecosystem services (UES) are indispensable for life. Stakeholders are improvising strategies for a more sustainable provisioning of UES. For this purpose and for identifying orientations towards geospatial data in UES studies, the "bibliometric analysis" technique was deployed. The inclinations facilitate assessments pertaining to spatio-temporal oscillations in the supply-demand equilibrium. The propensities are gaining recognition due to time and cost effectiveness. Besides this, Remote Sensing (RS) in conjunction with Geographic Information System (GIS), enables the conduct of synoptic and robust periodic evaluations. The study analyzes inclinations towards RS in contemporary research (2010-2020) focusing, particularly, on urban ecosystem services. It specifically focuses on methodological frameworks and major sources of remotely sensed data. Therefore, a total of 261 records of research articles were identified and retrieved. Subsequently, 79 articles were selected for further processing and content analysis. It transpired that approximately 30% of the selected publications deployed remotely sensed data for assessment purposes. The majority (96%) of such studies were conducted in economically developed and industrialized countries. However, the researchers from both developed and developing countries prefer open software and free data sources. Besides this, they prefer satellite-based optical sensors over image sensors such as TIR, SAR, or light sensors for acquiring data. The findings formulate that Land Use Land Cover (LULC)-based methodologies and inclinations for assessing regulating services are more frequently pursued. The findings revealed that enhanced research collaborations, access to data, and assessment gadgets are obligatory for capacity building in developing regions. Knowledge sharing and cost-effective access to RS and GIS based platforms are incumbent for ensuring urban environmental sustainability in developing economies.

TI  - Evolving Religion-Science Perspectives of the Bhaktivedanta Institute and ISKCON
T2  - NOVA RELIGIO-JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND EMERGENT RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bhaktivedanta Institute was established in 1976 as a research branch of ISKCON, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, popularly known as the Hare Krishnas. This article examines the history and ongoing activities of this institute as it has shaped ISKCON's official religion-science discourses. Early Bhaktivedanta Institute documents are compared with data gathered from a 2019 Bhaktivedanta Institute for Higher Studies workshop. While the Bhaktivedanta Institute's media initially described science and scientists as malign forces, the 2019 workshop disclosed more complex stances towards biological evolution and scientific researchers. Consequently, this article illustrates the ways in which a contemporary branch of the Bhaktivedanta Institute has attempted to reconcile ISKCON's worldview with modern science, while also distancing itself from the movement's previous science-religion conflict narratives.

TI  - Estimating the Near-Ground PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration over China Based on the CapsNet Model during 2018-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) threatens human health and the natural environment. Estimating the near-ground PM2.5 concentrations accurately is of great significance in air quality research. Statistical and deep-learning models are widely used for estimating PM2.5 concentration based on remotely sensed aerosol optical depth (AOD) products. Deep-learning models can effectively express the nonlinear relationship between AOD, parameters, and PM2.5. This study proposed a capsule network model (CapsNet) to address the spatial differences in PM2.5 concentration distribution by introducing a capsule structure and dynamic routing algorithm for the first time, which integrates AOD, surface PM2.5 measurements, and auxiliary variables (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and meteorological parameters). Moreover, we examined the longitude and latitude of pixels as input parameters to reflect spatial location information, and the results showed that the introduction of longitude (LON) and latitude (LAT) parameters improved the model fitting accuracy. The coefficient of determination (R-2) increased by 0.05 +/- 0.01, and the root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE), and mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by 3.30 +/- 1.0 mu g/m(3), 8 +/- 3%, and 1.40 +/- 0.2 mu g/m(3), respectively. To verify the accuracy of our proposed CapsNet, the deep neural network (DNN) model was executed. The results indicated that the R-2 values of the validation dataset using CapsNet improved by 4 +/- 2%, and RMSE, MRE, and MAE decreased by 1.50 +/- 0.4 mu g/m(3), 5%, and 0.60 +/- 0.2 mu g/m(3), respectively. Finally, the effects of seasons and spatial region on the fitting accuracy were examined separately from 2018 to 2020. With respect to seasons, the model performed more robustly in the cold season. In terms of spatial region, the R-2 values exceeded 0.9 in the central-eastern region, while the accuracy was lower in the western and coastal regions. This study proposed the CapsNet model to estimate PM2.5 concentrations for the first time and achieved good accuracy, which could be used for the estimation of other air contaminants.

TI  - Resolving phase unwrapping in interferometric synthetic aperture radar using deep recurrent residual U-Net
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase unwrapping (PhU) is a primary task in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) with the ability to resolve the ambiguity of modulo 2p and obtain the absolute change of phase. This paper addresses the PhU problem by introducing a novel network configuration inspired by recurrent residual U-Net. There current residual convolutional blocks improve feature representation, while the U-Net shape architecture maintains the fusion of a low level with high spatial features. This architecture fused the advantage of the of residual learning, recurrent and U-Net connection. The residual connection boosts the flow of information, recalibrate the data and the efficiency of the parameter. Finally, ample experiments were conducted on Synthetic dataset, which contains of simulated InSAR images with 2000 image pairs (256 x 256). To further assess the proposed network using the Sentinel-1A dataset for the Sukari gold mine in Egypt. Experiments on simulated and real Sentinel-1A datasets proved that the proposed network outperforms traditional SNAPHU and other deep learning-based approaches on the basis of qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and that the proposed network architecture outperforms traditional SNAPHU and other deep learning-based approaches (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - The seasonal cycle and break-up of landfast sea ice along the northwest coast of Kotelny Island, East Siberian Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic landfast sea ice (LFSI) represents an important quasi-stationary coastal zone. Its evolution is determined by the regional climate and bathymetry. This study investigated the seasonal cycle and interannual variations of LFSI along the northwest coast of Kotelny Island. Initial freezing, rapid ice formation, stable and decay stages were identified in the seasonal cycle based on application of the visual inspection approach (VIA) to MODIS/Envisat imagery and results from a thermodynamic snow/ice model. The modeled annual maximum ice thickness in 1995-2014 was 2.02 +/- 0.12 m showing a trend of -0.13 m decade(-1). Shortened ice season length (-22 d decade(-1)) from model results associated with substantial spring (2.3 degrees C decade(-1)) and fall (1.9 degrees C decade(-1)) warming. LFSI break-up resulted from combined fracturing and melting, and the local spatiotemporal patterns of break-up were associated with the irregular bathymetry. Melting dominated the LFSI break-up in the nearshore sheltered area, and the ice thickness decreased to an average of 0.50 m before the LFSI disappeared. For the LFSI adjacent to drift ice, fracturing was the dominant process and the average ice thickness was 1.56 m at the occurrence of the fracturing. The LFSI stages detected by VIA were supported by the model results.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo, a key component of the earth's energy balance, can be monitored regularly by satellite observations. Compared to the previous study Song et al. (2018), this paper estimates TOA albedo by directly linking Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) narrowband reflectance with TOA broadband albedo determined by NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instead of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The TOA albedo product developed in this study has an increased spatial resolution, from 1 degrees to 0.05 degrees, and its starting year has been extended from 2000 to 1981, compared to the CERES TOA albedo product. Models of lands and oceans are established separately under different atmospheric and surface conditions using gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) method instead of the linear regression models in the previous study. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the cloudy-sky, clear sky and snow-cover models over land are 11.2%, 9.2% and 2.3%, respectively; over oceans they are 14.6%, 10.6% and 5.6%, respectively. Compared to Song et al. (2018), the improvements of the three models over land are 28.8%, 29.2% and 68.6%, respectively. Compared to the CERES product, the new product is much more accurate than that from our previous study. The global monthly mean differences of the TOA albedo obtained with the GBRT product and CERES from 2001 to 2014 are mostly less than 5%.

TI  - Multi-Species Individual Tree Segmentation and Identification Based on Improved Mask R-CNN and UAV Imagery in Mixed Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution UAV imagery paired with a convolutional neural network approach offers significant advantages in accurately measuring forestry ecosystems. Despite numerous studies existing for individual tree crown delineation, species classification, and quantity detection, the comprehensive situation in performing the above tasks simultaneously has rarely been explored, especially in mixed forests. In this study, we propose a new method for individual tree segmentation and identification based on the improved Mask R-CNN. For the optimized network, the fusion type in the feature pyramid network is modified from down-top to top-down to shorten the feature acquisition path among the different levels. Meanwhile, a boundary-weighted loss module is introduced to the cross-entropy loss function L-mask to refine the target loss. All geometric parameters (contour, the center of gravity and area) associated with canopies ultimately are extracted from the mask by a boundary segmentation algorithm. The results showed that F1-score and mAP for coniferous species were higher than 90%, and that of broadleaf species were located between 75-85.44%. The producer's accuracy of coniferous forests was distributed between 0.8-0.95 and that of broadleaf ranged in 0.87-0.93; user's accuracy of coniferous was distributed between 0.81-0.84 and that of broadleaf ranged in 0.71-0.76. The total number of trees predicted was 50,041 for the entire study area, with an overall error of 5.11%. The method under study is compared with other networks including U-net and YOLOv3. Results in this study show that the improved Mask R-CNN has more advantages in broadleaf canopy segmentation and number detection.

TI  - Can GPM IMERG Capture Extreme Precipitation in North China Plain?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme precipitation events (EPE) often cause catastrophic floods accompanied by serious economic losses and casualties. The latest version (V06) of the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM IMERG) provides global satellite precipitation data from 2000 at a higher spatiotemporal resolution with improved quality. It is scientifically and practically important to assess the accuracy of the IMERG V06 in capturing extreme precipitation. This study evaluates the two widely used products of IMERG during 2000-2018, i.e., IMERG late run (IMERG-L) and IMERG final run (IMERG-F), in the densely populated and flood-prone North China Plain. The accuracy of the IMERG V06 is evaluated with ground measurements from rain gauge stations at multiple scales (hourly, daily, and seasonally). A novel target tracking method is introduced to extract three-dimensional (3D) extreme precipitation events, and the near-real-time uncalibrated PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System) and GSMAP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) satellite data are added to further evaluate IMERG's performance during extreme precipitation. Finally, for flash flood events induced by extreme rainfall in the Hebei Province from 15 to 23 July 2016, the accuracy of capturing the event with IMERG-F and IMERG-L was verified. Results reveal that IMERG-F is better than IMERG-L at all investigated scales (hourly, daily, and seasonally), but the difference between the two products is less at higher time resolutions. Both products manifest decreased performance when capturing 3D extreme precipitation events, and comparatively, IMERG-F performs better than IMERG-L. IMERG-F exhibits a distinct discontinuity in extreme precipitation thresholds between land and ocean, which is a limitation of IMERG-F not documented in previous studies. Moreover, IMERG-L and IMERG-F are comparable at an hourly scale for some metrics, which is beyond the expectation that IMERG-F is notably better than IMERG-L. This study provides a scientific basis for the performance of satellite precipitation products and contributes to guiding users when applying global precipitation products.

TI  - Seamless and automated rapeseed mapping for large cloudy regions using time-series optical satellite imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate field-level mapping of rapeseed spatial distributions using remote sensing technology supports agricultural planning, food and edible oil security, and ecological system management. The phenological and spectral methods for rapeseed mapping mainly rely on optical images collected during the flowering period. However, these images are often occluded by clouds. Moreover, the scarcity of well-represented training samples with various phenology patterns constrains large-scale supervised classification and extraction of rapeseed. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Seamless and Automated Rapeseed Mapping (SARM) method using time-series optical satellite imagery for large cloudy regions to generate seamless rapeseed maps at field scale without any manually collected samples. First, a Winter Rapeseed Index (WRI) was designed to automatically extract rapeseed in cloud-free areas by enhancing the phenological separability of rapeseed. Second, a multiple random forest-based fusion mapping framework was developed using WRI-based training samples, and was applied for the cloudy regions to map rapeseed seamlessly across the whole study area. The proposed SARM method was validated under different years, sensors, and cropping patterns at four study sites both in China and the USA. Extensive experimental results and analysis suggest that the SARM method outperforms other traditional methods on all four study sites with an average overall accuracy varying from 88.58% to 98.78%. These results also reveal that our proposed approach is capable of expanding the time windows for rapeseed mapping from the significant flowering period to the insignificant flowering period. More importantly, the spatial incompleteness of rapeseed maps caused by cloud contamination was mitigated to some degree. The SARM method robustly delivers seamless and automated rapeseed mapping by using time-series optical satellite imagery, thus offering new insights for crop investigation, especially in large cloudy regions.

TI  - An Improved Sea Ice Classification Algorithm with Gaofen-3 Dual-Polarization SAR Data Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of sea ice is one of the major safety hazards for sea navigation. As human activities in polar regions become more frequent, monitoring and forecasting of sea ice are of great significance. In this paper, we use SAR data from the C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Gaofen-3 satellite in the dual-polarization (VV, VH) fine strip II (FSII) mode of operation to study the Arctic sea ice classification in winter. SAR data we use were taken in the western Arctic Ocean from January to February 2020. We classify the sea ice into four categories, namely new ice (NI), thin first-year ice (tI), thick first-year ice (TI), and old ice (OI), by referring to the ice maps provided by the Canadian Ice Service (CIS). Then, we use the deep learning model MobileNetV3 as the backbone network, input samples of different sizes, and combine the backbone network with multiscale feature fusion methods to build a deep learning model called Multiscale MobileNet (MSMN). Dual-polarization SAR data are used to synthesize pseudocolor images and produce samples of sizes 16 x 16 x 3, 32 x 32 x 3, and 64 x 64 x 3 as input. Ultimately, MSMN can reach over 95% classification accuracy on testing SAR sea ice images. The classification results using only VV polarization or VH polarization data are tested, and it is found that using dual-polarization data could improve the classification accuracy by 10.05% and 9.35%, respectively. When other classification models are trained using the training data from this paper for comparison, the accuracy of MSMN is 4.86% and 1.84% higher on average than that of the model built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and ResNet18 model, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring Spatio-Temporal Dynamics in the Eastern Plain Lakes of China Using Long-Term MODIS UNWI Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) is vital to the local environment and economy. However, due to the limitations and efficiency of traditional image formats in storing and processing large amounts of images and optimal threshold adjustments are often necessary for water/non-water separation based on traditional multi-band/spectral water indexes over large areas and in the long-term, previous studies have either been on a short period or mainly focused on water inundation dynamics of several lakes. To address these issues, a multi-dimensional dataset (MDD) storage format was used to efficiently organize more than ~7000 time series composite MODIS images. Furthermore, a universal normalized water index (UNWI) was developed based on full-spectrum information to simplify optimal threshold adjustments. Consequently, the present study analyzed the patterns of spatio-temporal water dynamic patterns and potential driving factors of inundation changes at large lakes (>5 km(2)) in the EPL during 2000-2020 through MDD and UNWI. In terms of annual inundation patterns, the numbers of lakes that experienced significant (p < 0.05) decreases (17 lakes) and increases (43 lakes) were highest for Class IV lakes among six geographical classes. Variation in intra-annual inundation in Classes I and II is correlated with consumption of chemical fertilizers (CCF), while precipitation accounted for the most change in lake area in Class III. This spatio-temporal analysis of lakes provides a necessary foundation for the sustainable development and continuous investigations of the EPL.

TI  - Research on the Temporal and Spatial Distributions of Standing Wood Carbon Storage Based on Remote Sensing Images and Local Models
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: It is important to understand the temporal and spatial distributions of standing wood carbon storage in forests to maintain ecological balance and forest dynamics. Such information can provide technical and data support for promoting ecological construction, formulating different afforestation policies, and implementing forest management strategies. Long-term series of Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper, TM) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager, OLI) remote sensing images and digital elevation models (DEM), as well as multiphase survey data, provide new opportunities for research on the temporal and spatial distributions of standing wood carbon storage in forests. Methods: The extracted remote sensing factors, terrain factors, and forest stand factors were analyzed with stepwise regression in relation to standing wood carbon storage to identify significant influential factors, build a global ordinary least squares (OLS) model and a linear mixed model (LMM), and construct a local geographically weighted regression (GWR), multiscale geographically weighted regression model (MGWR), temporally weighted regression (TWR), and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). Model evaluation indicators were used to calculate residual Moran's I values, and the optimal model was selected to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of standing wood carbon storage in the Liangshui Nature Reserve. Results: Remote sensing factors, topographic factors (Slope), and stand factors (Age and DBH) were significantly correlated with standing wood carbon storage, and the constructed global models exhibited fitting effects inferior to those of the established local models. LMM is also used as a global model to add random effects on the basis of OLS, and R-2 is increased to 0.52 compared with OLS. The local models based on geographically weighted regression, namely, GWR, MGWR, TWR, and GTWR, all have good performance. Compared with OLS, the R-2 is increased to 0.572, 0.589, 0.643, and 0.734, and the fitting effect of GTWR is the best. GTWR can overcome spatial autocorrelation and temporal autocorrelation problems, with a higher R-2 (0.734) and a more ideal model residual than other models. This study develops a model for carbon storage (CS) considering various influential factors in the Liangshui area and provides a possible solution for the estimation of long-term carbon storage distribution.

TI  - Inversion of Groundwater Storage Variations Considering Lag Effect in Beijing Plain, from RadarSat-2 with SBAS-InSAR Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term over-exploitation of groundwater has not only caused the compaction of aquifer thickness and surface deformation but has also further aggravated the loss of groundwater storage (GWS) in Beijing plain. The South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) furnishes a new source of water for Beijing. By reviewing related studies, it was found that there are few studies on the realization of GWS estimation based on InSAR technology considering the lag effect. Therefore, in this study, firstly, the long-time series deformation characteristics of Beijing plain were obtained from 46 RadarSat-2 images using small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology. Secondly, the seasonal components of surface deformation and hydraulic head change were extracted by means of multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA), verifying the separation accuracy by means of Monto Carlo-SSA (MC-SSA). Finally, for the hydrodynamic delay (aquifer water supply/drainage) of the complex aquifer system, we introduced the time lag cross-correlation (TLCC) approach to correct the hysteresis response of seasonal deformation relative to the variation of the aquifer system head, so as to realize the estimation of aquifer storage properties and GWS loss, even unrecoverable GWS (UGWS). The results showed that the average annual variation of total GWS (TGWS) in Beijing plain was -6.702 x 10(7) m(3), of which the depletion volume of UGWS was -6.168 x 10(7) m(3), accounting for 92.03% of the TGWS. On a temporal scale, the depletion of UGWS lagged behind the total head change, with about one year of lag time. On a spatial scale, in contrast to the north of Beijing plain, the depletion of UGWS in the south only recovered briefly after 2015 and then continued to decline. This further indicated that the process of the decline of middle-deep confined head and long-term GWS loss caused by over-exploitation of groundwater was irreversible. These findings are of great significance to optimize the allocation of groundwater resources, reduce the harm of land subsidence and protect groundwater resources.

TI  - FENGYUN-4A Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager Layered Precipitable Water Vapor Products' Comprehensive Evaluation Based on Quality Control System
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A physical retrieval algorithm has been developed for deriving the layered precipitable water vapor (LPWs) product from infrared radiances of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard FengYun-4A (FY-4A), the first of the new generation of Chinese geostationary weather satellites (FengYun-4, or FY-4 Series). The FY-4A AGRI LPWs are evaluated with different types of reference datasets based on Quality Control System (QCS), including those from Himawari-8 AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), Radiosonde, ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5), NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis and CMA (China Meteorological Administration) forecast product from global medium range numerical weather prediction (NWP) system. QCS is one of the important components of FY-4A ground segment, which mainly focuses on the satellite products' evaluation and validation. It is found that the AGRI LPW product has a good agreement with different evaluating sources and the quality is favorable and stable. With the capability of frequent (5-min interval) observations over the East Asia and Western Pacific regions, the AGRI LPW products can be used to investigate the atmospheric temporal and spatial variations in the pre-landfall environment for typhoons. The QCS is a useful tool to monitor, evaluate, and validate the AGRI LPW products.

TI  - Glacier changes in the Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve of China during 2000-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciers in the Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve of China (SNRC) are a significant water resource for the Yangtze, Yellow, and Mekong rivers. Based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images acquired in 2000, 2010, and 2018, the outlines of glaciers in the SNRC were obtained by combining band ratio method with manual interpretation. There were 1714 glaciers in the SNRC in 2018, with an area of 2331.15 +/- 54.84 km(2), an ice volume of 188.90 +/- 6.41 km(3), and an average length of 1475.4 +/- 15 m. During 2000-2018, the corresponding values of glaciers decreased by 69, 271.95 +/- 132.06 km(2), 18.59 +/- 8.83 km(3), and 84.75 +/- 34 m, respectively. Glaciers in the Yangtze River source area witnessed the largest area loss (-154.45 km(2)), whereas glaciers in the Mekong River source area experienced the fastest area loss (-2.02%center dot a(-1)) and the maximum reduction of the average length (-125.82 m). Overall, the retreat of glaciers in the SNRC exhibited an accelerating trend. Especially, the loss rate of glacier area in the Yellow River source area in 2010-2018 was more than twice that in 2000-2010. The glacier change is primarily attributed to the significant rise in temperature during the ablation period. Some other factors including the size, orientation and terminus elevation of glaciers also contributed to the heterogeneity of glacier change.

TI  - Evolutionary Toxicology : New Perspective of Ecotoxicology
T2  - Asian Journal of Ecotoxicology
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental pollution has become one of the significant driving factors behind the evolution of diverse organisms. With the advance in molecular biology and the theory of evolutionary biology, a new interdiscipline called evolutionary toxicology is growing. Based on the theory of evolutionary biology and conservation genetics, evolutionary toxicology aims to investigate how the polluted environment affects organisms and how the organisms adapt to the polluted environment. Research in evolutionary toxicology uses experimental design familiar to the ecotoxicologist with matched reference and contaminated sites and selection of sentinel species. Here, we reviewed the theorical development of evolutionary toxicology and summarized the scope and field of evolutionary toxicology research. Additionally, the prospects of evolutionary toxicology are presented, which include the application of evolutionary toxicology in ecological risk assessment, the research of evolutionary toxicology under the omics era, and evo-evolutionary dynamics in toxicology. It is anticipated that the review and introduction of this emerging interdisciplinary subject could provide theoretical support and insights into the study of ecotoxicology and management of serious environmental problems.

TI  - Long-Term Changes and Factors That Influence Changes in Thermal Discharge from Nuclear Power Plants in Daya Bay, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal discharge (i.e., warm water) from nuclear power plants (NPPs) in Daya Bay, China, was analyzed in this study. To determine temporal and spatial patterns as well as factors affecting thermal discharge, data were acquired by the Landsat series of remote-sensing satellites for the period 1993-2020. First, sea surface temperature (SST) data for waters off NPPs were retrieved from Landsat imagery using a radiative transfer equation in conjunction with a split-window algorithm. Then, retrieved SST data were used to analyze seasonal and interannual changes in areas affected by NPP thermal discharge, as well as the effects of NPP installed capacity, tides, and wind field on the diffusion of thermal discharge. Analysis of interannual changes revealed an increase in SST with an increase in NPP installed capacity, with the area affected by increased drainage outlet temperature increasing to different degrees. Sea surface temperature and NPP installed capacity were significantly linearly related. Both flood tides (peak spring and neap) and ebb tides (peak spring and neap) affected areas of warming zones, with ebb tides having greater effects. The total area of all warming zones in summer was approximately twice that in spring, regardless of whether winds were favorable (i.e., westerly) or adverse (i.e., easterly). The effects of tides on areas of warming zones exceeded those of winds.

TI  - Range resolution and sampling frequency trade-off for GPS passive radar
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a global positioning system (GPS) passive radar, a high resolution requires a high sampling frequency, which increases the computational load. Balancing the computational load and the range resolution is challenging. This paper presents a method to trade off the range resolution and the computational load by experimentally determining the optimal sampling frequency through an analysis of multiple sets of GPS satellite data at different sampling frequencies. The test data are used to construct a range resolution-sampling frequency trade-off model using least-squares estimation. The theoretical analysis shows that the experimental data are the best fit using smoothing and nth-order derivative splines. Using field GPS C/A code signal-based GPS radar, the trade-off between the optimal sampling frequency is determined to be in the 20 461.25 -24 553.5 kHz range, which supports a resolution of 43-48 m. Compared with the conventional method, the CPU time is reduced by approximately 50%.

TI  - Mapping global flying aircraft activities using Landsat 8 and cloud computing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing might provide a potential way for monitoring the global flight activities and their environment impacts, while the remote sensing community pays less attention on it. In this study, we presented a flying aircraft detection algorithm which effectively handles the noise on Landsat 8 OLI cirrus band caused by energetic particles in the South Atlantic Anomaly region, and a new framework based on cloud infrastructure was proposed to map global flying aircraft activities from 2013 to 2020 using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. Validation was performed for 254 scenes recorded for various cloudy and surface conditions and vapor contents. The overall percentages of false alarms and omissions for these validation images were 5.37% and 7.80%, respectively. Limited to the resolution of Landsat data, cloud, the size and flight altitude of the aircraft, 42.99% flying aircraft were undetected compared with the FlightRadar24. Instead of using the Google Earth Engine, we employed more flexible cloud computing techniques, Google Cloud Storage and Google Calculation Engine, to construct our framework for the larger volume data. A total of 1.94 million Landsat images were analyzed to obtain the activities maps, and the results showed that globally flying aircraft increased by 25.85% from 2014 to 2019 (the year 2013 was excluded for the low coverage of Landsat scenes), with an annual rate of 4.31%. In 2020, flying aircraft were reduced by 40% compared with 2019 due to the influence of COVID-19 and traveling restrictions, and Europe was the most severely affected by COVID-19, with an 84.59% decline of flying aircraft in April 2020. This study provides a unique long-term supplement to monitor aviation activities and their climate impact.

TI  - Monthly mapping of forest harvesting using dense time series Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with disturbance maps produced at annual or multi-year time steps, monthly mapping of forest harvesting can provide more temporal details needed for studying the socio-economic drivers (e.g., differentiating salvage logging and slash-and-burn from other timber harvesting) of harvesting and characterizing the associated intra-annual carbon and hydrological dynamics. Frequent cloud cover limits the application of optical remote sensing in timely mapping of forest changes. The freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve more frequent mapping of forest harvesting than ever before (i.e., at monthly interval). The unique landscape pattern of forest harvesting from Sentienl-1 data (i. e., how a harvested patch contrasts to surrounding intact forests) holds critical information for harvesting mapping but have not been fully explored. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based (i.e., U-Net) approach using the landscape pattern from Sentinel-1 data to produce monthly maps of forest harvesting in two deforestation hotspots -California, USA and Rondo<SIC>nia, Brazil - for as long as three years. Our results show that (1) our proposed approach is reliable (mean F1 scores (the geometric mean of user's and producer's accuracies) 0.74-0.78; mean IoU (the area of intersection over union between the prediction part and target part) 0.59-0.65) for monthly forest harvesting mapping with Sentinel-1 data, outperforming the traditional object-based approach (0.38-0.43 in IoU). The varying harvesting pattern from Sentinel-1 data can be recognized by the U-Net bottleneck block as whole entities, which is the key advantage of our proposed approach; (2) multi-temporal SAR filtering is helpful for improving the accuracies of our proposed approach (increased F1 and IoU for 0.04 and 0.06, respectively); (3) our proposed model can be trained using samples collected during a particular time period over one location and be fine-tuned using sparse local samples from a new area to achieve optimal performance, and hence can greatly reduce training data collection effort when applied to new study sites; (4) forest harvesting maps produced using our approach revealed substantial variations in monthly harvesting activities: in Rondo<SIC>nia, most of the forest harvest occurred in July/August (the dry season) and about 14% of the dry season harvesting were followed by fires (i.e., slash-and-burn); in California, the rates of forest harvesting were relatively stable, but abnormally high values could occur due to salvage logging after big fires. Our novel approach for mapping forest harvesting at monthly interval represents an important step towards timely monitoring of forest harvesting and assisting stakeholders in developing sustainable strategy of forest management, especially for regions with frequent cloud cover.

TI  - Detection of Surface Crevasses over Antarctic Ice Shelves Using SAR Imagery and Deep Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crevasses are formed by glacier movement and the stresses within glacier ice. Knowledge of the crevasses' distribution is critical for understanding the glacier and ice shelf stability. In this study, we propose an automated crevasse extraction framework based on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and an improved U-Net network. The spatial distribution of crevasses on Antarctic ice shelves in 2020 was mapped with a spatial resolution of ~40 m, and the characteristics of crevasses on the Nickerson Ice Shelf, Jelbart Ice Shelf, Amery Ice Shelf, Thwaites Glacier, and Shackleton Ice Shelf were analyzed. The results indicated the extraction accuracy of our method was 84.2% and the F1 score was 72.5%. Compared with previous published studies, the identification of the crevasse areas had good visual consistency. However, in some scenes, the recall rate was relatively lower due to the quality of the SAR image, terrain surrounding the crevasses, and observation geometry. The crevasses on different ice shelves had different characteristics in terms of length, density, type, and spatial pattern, implying the different stress structures of ice shelves. The Thwaites Glacier and the Nickerson Ice Shelf in the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) had shorter ice crevasses, whereas the lengths of ice crevasses on the Jelbart Ice Shelf and the Amery Ice Shelf in the East Antarctica Ice Sheet (EAIS) were relatively long. Nevertheless, there are more closely spaced crevasses on the ice shelf in WAIS compared to that in the EAIS. For the distribution of crevasse types, the Nickerson Ice Shelf and the Shackleton Ice Shelf had various forms of crevasses. There were mainly transverse crevasses developed on the Jelbart Ice Shelf and the Amery Ice Shelf. This study provides a helpful reference and guidance for automated crevasse extraction. The method proposed by this study manifests great application potential and the efficacy of producing a time-series crevasse data set with higher spatial resolution and larger coverage. In the future, more Sentinel-1 SAR imagery will be applied and the effect of temporal and spatial variations in crevasses on the stability of ice shelves will be investigated, which will contribute to project the ice shelf stability and explore the sea level rise implications of recent and future cryosphere changes.

TI  - An Improved Generalized Hierarchical Estimation Framework with Geostatistics for Mapping Forest Parameters and Its Uncertainty: A Case Study of Forest Canopy Height
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height is an essential parameter in estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB), growing stock volume (GSV), and carbon storage, and it can provide necessary information in forest management activities. Light direction and ranging (LiDAR) is widely used for estimating canopy height. Considering the high cost of acquiring LiDAR data over large areas, we took a two-stage up-scaling approach in estimating forest canopy height and aimed to develop a method for quantifying the uncertainty of the estimation result. Based on the generalized hierarchical model-based (GHMB) estimation framework, a new estimation framework named RK-GHMB that makes use of a geostatistical method (regression kriging, RK) was developed. In this framework, the wall-to-wall forest canopy height and corresponding uncertainty in map unit scale are generated. This study was carried out by integrating plot data, sampled airborne LiDAR data, and wall-to-wall Ziyuan-3 satellite (ZY3) stereo images. The result shows that RK-GHMB can obtain a similar estimation accuracy (r = 0.92, MAE = 1.50 m) to GHMB (r = 0.92, MAE = 1.52 m) with plot-based reference data. For LiDAR-based reference data, the accuracy of RK-GHMB (r = 0.78, MAE = 1.75 m) is higher than that of GHMB (r = 0.75, MAE = 1.85 m). The uncertainties for all map units range from 1.54 to 3.60 m for the RK-GHMB results. The values change between 1.84 and 3.60 m for GHMB. This study demonstrates that this two-stage up-scaling approach can be used to monitor forest canopy height. The proposed RK-GHMB approach considers the spatial autocorrelation of neighboring data in the second modeling stage and can achieve a higher accuracy.

TI  - The Improved Three-Step Semi-Empirical Radiometric Terrain Correction Approach for Supervised Classification of PolSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiometric terrain correction (RTC) is an essential processing step for supervised classification applications of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) over mountainous areas. However, the current angular variation effect (AVE) correction methods of three-step RTC processing are difficult to apply to PolSAR supervised classification because of the problem of interdependence between AVE correction and classification. To address this issue, based on the three-step semi-empirical RTC approach, we propose an improved AVE correction method suitable for the supervised classification of PolSAR. We make full use of the prior knowledge required for supervised classification and RTC processing, that is, samples and elevation data, to calculate the parameters of AVE correction by constructing a weight coefficient matrix. GaoFen-3 QPSI (C-band, quad-polarization) data were used to verify the proposed method. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is available and effective for PolSAR supervised classification. The new method can effectively remove the AVE effect in the PolSAR image, and the overall accuracy of PolSAR supervised classification can be improved about 9% compared to that without AVE correction. For the fine classification of forest types, the AVE correction can improve the classification accuracy by about 20%.

TI  - Spectral-Spatial Residual Network for Fusing Hyperspectral and Panchromatic Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusing hyperspectral and panchromatic remote sensing images can obtain the images with high resolution in both spectral and spatial domains. In addition, it can complement the deficiency of high-resolution hyperspectral and panchromatic remote sensing images. In this paper, a spectral-spatial residual network (SSRN) model is established for the intelligent fusion of hyperspectral and panchromatic remote sensing images. Firstly, the spectral-spatial deep feature branches are built to extract the representative spectral and spatial deep features, respectively. Secondly, an enhanced multi-scale residual network is established for the spatial deep feature branch. In addition, an enhanced residual network is established for the spectral deep feature branch This operation is adopted to enhance the spectral and spatial deep features. Finally, this method establishes the spectral-spatial deep feature simultaneity to circumvent the independence of spectral and spatial deep features. The proposed model was evaluated on three groups of real-world hyperspectral and panchromatic image datasets which are collected with a ZY-1E sensor and are located at Baiyangdian, Chaohu and Dianchi, respectively. The experimental results and quality evaluation values, including RMSE, SAM, SCC, spectral curve comparison, PSNR, SSIM ERGAS and Q metric, confirm the superior performance of the proposed model compared with the state-of-the-art methods, including AWLP, CNMF, GIHS, MTF_GLP, HPF and SFIM methods.

TI  - ASI: An artificial surface Index for Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensing the spatial extent of artificial surfaces is essential for understanding human footprints and evaluating anthropogenic impacts on the global environment and climate. However, since the spectral signatures of artificial surfaces are similar to other bright natural surfaces, it is still a difficult task to separate artificial surfaces from other natural surfaces. Therefore, this study proposed a new Artificial Surface Index (ASI) to extract artificial surfaces based on the multispectral Landsat 8 imagery. We examined the performance of ASI in eight study areas with a variety of landscapes, including desert, coastal, inland urban and rural areas dominated by different climates and land cover categories. We also compared ASI with seven state-of-the-art built-up area or impervious surface indices that are developed for similar purposes. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that ASI has advantages in suppressing non-artificial surfaces with similar spectral signatures to artificial surfaces, such as deserts, bare soil, and harvested croplands. Furthermore, ASI improves the separability between artificial and non-artificial surfaces by 2% to 75% (measured by Jeffries-Matusita Distance), 13% to 164% (measured by Transformed Divergence), and 3% to 131% (measured by Spectral Discrimination Index) compared to the other seven indices across the eight study areas. The newly proposed ASI index has the potential to support a variety of human-activity-related studies, such as change detection of artificial surfaces, urban planning, land resource management at local, continental, and even global scales.

TI  - Mapping <i>Phragmites australis</i> Aboveground Biomass in the Momoge Wetland Ramsar Site Based on Sentinel-1/2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phragmites australis (P. australis) is one of the most important plant species found in wetland ecosystems, and its aboveground biomass (AGB) is a key indicator for assessing the quality or health of a wetland site. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1/2 images and field observation data collected in 2020, to delineate the distribution of P. australis in the Momoge Ramsar Wetland site by using a random forest method, and further, to estimate AGB by comparing multiple linear regression models. The results showed that the overall classification accuracy of P. australis using the random forest method was 89.13% and the P. australis area in the site was 135.74 km(2) in 2020. Among various remote sensing variables, the largest correlation coefficient was observed between dry weight of AGB of P. australis and Sentinel-2 red edge B-7, and between fresh weight of P. australis AGB and red edge B-5. The optimal models for estimating dry and fresh weight of P. australis AGB were multiple linear regression models, with an accuracy of 75.4% and 69.2%, respectively. In 2020, it was estimated that the total fresh weight of P. australis AGB in this Ramsar site was 21.2 x 10(7) kg and the total dry weight was 7.2 x 10(7) kg. The larger weight of P. australis AGB was identified mainly at central and western sites. The application of Sentinel-2 red-edge band for AGB estimation can significantly improve the model estimation accuracy. The findings of this study will provide a scientific basis for the management and protection of wetland ecosystems and sustainable utilization of P. australis resources.

TI  - Tourists' Spatial-Temporal Behavior Patterns Analysis Based on Multi-Source Data for Smart Scenic Spots: Case Study of Zhongshan Botanical Garden, China
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The data based on location/activity sensing technology is exploding and integrating multi-source data provides us with a new perspective to observe tourist behavior. On the one hand, tourist preferences can be extracted from the attractions generated by clustering. On the other hand, potentially extracted tourist information can provide decision-making support for tourism management departments in tourism planning and resource development. Therefore, developing smart tourism services for tourists and promoting the realization of "smart scenic spots." A field survey was conducted in Zhongshan Botanical Garden, China, from 3 February to 3 April 2019. This empirical study combines a handheld GPS tracking device and questionnaire survey using SEE to optimize k-means clustering algorithm and explores the spatial-temporal behavior patterns of tourists. The results showed that tourists in the botanical garden could be divided into three behavioral patterns. They are recreation and leisure, birdwatching and photography, and learning and education. The spatial-temporal behavior patterns of different tourists have obvious differences, which provides a basis for the planning and management of smart scenic spots.

TI  - Analysis of Temporal and Spatial Evolution Characteristics of Land Subsidence in Western Songnen Plain Using Multisource Remote Sensing
T2  - LITHOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of underground fluid is an important factor leading to land subsidence. The effects of mining depth, frequency, and mode on land subsidence are also different. The objective of this study was to develop a multisource method-including optical remote sensing interpretation, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to reveal the long-term temporal and spatial evolution law of subsidence characteristics driven by groundwater and oil extraction, as well as to reveal the formation mechanism and seasonal response law of land subsidence under the action of different driving factors. In this paper, we select the western region of Jilin Province located in Songnen Plain as the study area. The subsidence funnels in the study area are distributed in a porphyritic manner, and the distribution of the subsidence funnels has a certain correlation with the distribution of the pumping wells. In farmland areas, the subsidence is mainly caused by pumping groundwater. The annual land subsidence rate in the study area is -3.14 mm/a, and the maximum deformation rate in the study area is -22.05 mm/a. The subsidence is affected by the season, shown by the fact that it rises in the dry season and decreases in the rainy season. The subsidence in the west of Songnen Plain is caused by oil pumping and groundwater pumping, and groundwater pumping is dominant. The exploitation of underground fluid transfers the pressure borne by water or oil to the soil skeleton so as to increase and consolidate the effective stress of the soil layer and lead to land subsidence. The continuous observation of the surface in the western area of Songnen Plain is helpful to guide the safe production of agriculture and industry and ensure the smooth development of local industry and agriculture.

TI  - Pinpointing Early Signs of Impending Slope Failures From Space
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A promised potential of spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radars (InSAR) is a capability for regularly monitoring ground deformation with millimeter accuracy, for timely forecasting of impending natural hazards such as landslides. The main limitation in InSAR being actually capable of unleashing this potential for hazard prediction is that key precursory ground displacements are, in the majority of cases, a very small subset of the entire big data set provided by the method over large regions. Consequently, pinpointing a single impending failure may become very difficult or impossible. We develop a data-driven framework that can handle such imbalanced spatiotemporal data based on the concept of outlying aspects mining, to find a subset of features out of a collection of potential features, which best distinguishes the landslide source area from the others. We show that the identified feature subspace can be used to find anomalous areas across multiple spatial scales, such that Sentinel-1 satellite monitoring points which persistently lie in these areas can accurately detect the location of the Xinmo landslide (China) almost 1 year in advance-without false alarms. In a second case study, we identify the area affected by rockfalls on Stromboli volcano, a task that is generally infeasible with traditional methods applied to InSAR data. With continuing improvements in the spatial and temporal resolution from the new generation of satellites, such as Sentinel-1, this approach opens the door to reliable and early prediction of failure over a broad range of slope instabilities.

TI  - Evaluation of Multi-Source High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Fusion in Aquaculture Areas
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion of satellite sensors can generate a high-resolution multi-spectral image from inputs of a high spatial resolution panchromatic image and a low spatial resolution multi-spectral image for feature extraction and target recognition, such as enclosure seines and floating rafts. However, there is currently no clear and definite method of image fusion for different aquaculture areas distribution extraction from high-resolution satellite images. This study uses three types of high-resolution remote sensing images, GF-1 (Gaofen-1), GF-2 (Gaofen-2), and WV-2 (WorldView-2), covering the raft and enclosure seines aquacultures in the Xiangshan Bay, China, to evaluate panchromatic and multispectral image fusion techniques to determine which is the best. This study applied PCA (principal component analysis), GS (Gram-Schmidt), and NNDiffuse (nearest neighbor diffusion) algorithms to panchromatic and multispectral images fusion of GF-1, GF-2, and WV-2. Two quantitative methods are used to evaluate the fusion effect. The first used seven statistical parameters, including gray mean value, standard deviation, information entropy, average gradient, correlation coefficient, deviation index, and spectral distortion. The second is the CQ(max) index. Comparing the evaluation results by these seven common statistical indicators with the results of the image fusion evaluation by index CQ(max), the results prove that the CQ(max) index can be applied to the evaluation of image fusion effects in different aquaculture areas. For the floating raft cultured area, the conclusion is consentaneous; NNDiffuse was also optimal for GF-1 and GF-2 data, and PCA was optimal for WV-2 data. For the enclosure seines culture area, the conclusion of quantitative evaluations is not consistent and it shows that there is no definite good method that can be applied to all areas; therefore, careful evaluation and selection of the best applicable image fusion method are required according to the study area and sensor images.

TI  - Decadal Changes in Glacier Area, Surface Elevation and Mass Balance for 2000-2020 in the Eastern Tanggula Mountains Using Optical Images and TanDEM-X Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of lake-terminating glaciers to climate change is complex, and their rapid changes are often closely linked to glacial-lake outburst floods. However, the eastern Tanggula Mountains, which are the only area where lake-terminating glaciers are found within the Tibetan Plateau, have received little attention to date. In this study, to address this gap, we generated updated glacier boundaries and estimated the interdecadal area changes for 2000-2020 based on the interpretation of Landsat-5/8 and Sentinel-2 images. In addition, based on the method of digital elevation model (DEM) differencing, we quantified the changes in glacier thickness and mass balance using TanDEM-X radar data and SRTM DEM over almost the same periods. The final results show that the glaciers in the eastern Tanggula Mountains, as a whole, have experienced accelerated area shrinkage (with a rate of area loss increasing from -0.34 +/- 0.83 km(2) a(-1) to -0.93 +/- 0.81 km(2) a(-1) for 2000-2013 and 2013-2020, respectively) and accelerated ice thinning (changing from -0.19 +/- 0.05 m a(-1) and -0.53 +/- 0.08 m a(-1) for 2000-2012 and 2012-2020, respectively). Furthermore, the region-wide glacier mass balance was -0.16 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1) and -0.45 +/- 0.07 m w.e. a(-1) for these two sub-periods, corresponding to a 1.8 times acceleration of mass loss rate. The average mass balance during 2000-2020 was -0.23 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1), which is equivalent to a rate of mass loss of -0.04 Gt a(-1). More specifically, within the region, the lake-terminating glaciers have exhibited more significant acceleration of area loss and mass loss, compared to the land-terminating glaciers. However, interestingly, the average thinning rate of the lake-terminating glaciers is always lower than that of the land-terminating glaciers over all study periods, which is in contrast with previous findings in other high mountain areas (e.g., the Himalaya Mountains). Field study and proglacial lakes monitoring suggest that the local topography plays a vital role in the evolution of the glacial lakes in this region, which further affects the glacier changes. Furthermore, the present status of the glacier changes in this region can be attributed to the long-term increase in air temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of glacier changes across the eastern Tanggula Mountains and will help to improve the understanding of the heterogeneous response of glaciers to climate change.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing of Water Quality Variation in a Semi-Enclosed Bay (Yueqing Bay) under Strong Anthropogenic Impact
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The semi-enclosed bays impacted by heavy anthropogenic activities have weak water exchange and purification capacities. Most of the sea bays have suffered severe eutrophication, water quality deterioration, ecosystem degradation and other problems. Although many countries and local governments have carried out corresponding environmental protection actions, the evaluation of their effectiveness still requires monitoring technology and data support for long-term water environment change. In this study, we take Yueqing Bay, the fourth largest bay in China, as a case to study the satellite-based water quality monitoring and variation analysis. We established a nutrient retrieval model for Yueqing Bay to produce a long-term series of nutrient concentration products in Yueqing Bay from 2013 to 2020, based on Landsat remote sensing images and long-term observation data, combined with support vector machine learning and water temperature and satellite spectra as input parameters, and then we analyzed its spatiotemporal variations and driving factors. In general, nutrient concentrations in the western part of the bay were higher than those in the eastern part. Levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were lower in summer than in spring and winter, and reactive phosphate (PO4-P) levels were lower in summer and higher in autumn. In terms of natural factors, physical effects (e.g., seasonal variations in flow field) and biological effects (e.g., seasonal differences in the intensity of plankton photosynthesis) were the main causes of seasonal differences in nutrient concentration in Yueqing Bay. Nutrient concentration generally increased from 2013 to 2015 but decreased slightly after 2015. Over the past decade, the economy and industry of Yueqing Bay basin have developed rapidly. Wastewater resulting from anthropogenic production and consumption was transported via streams into Yueqing Bay, leading to the continuous increase in nutrient concentrations (the variation rates: a(DIN)> 0, a(PO4-P)> 0), which directly or indirectly caused high nutrient concentrations in some areas of the bay (e.g., Southwest Shoal at the mouth of Yueqing Bay). After 2015, the various ecological remediation policies adopted by cities around Yueqing Bay have mitigated, to some extent, the increasing nutrient concentration trends (the variation rates: a(DIN)< 0, a(PO4-P)< 0), but not significantly (P > 0.1). The environmental restoration of Yueqing Bay also requires continuous and long-term ecological protection and restoration work to be effective. This research can provide a reference for ecological environment monitoring and remote sensing data application for similar semi-enclosed bays, and support the sustainable development of the bay.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations and Influent Factors of Tropospheric Ozone Concentration over China Based on OMI Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal distribution of atmospheric pollutants has been a hot topic in the field of environmental science in recent years. Rapid economic development, urbanization, and industrialization have resulted in a significant increase in ozone emissions, and China is facing the issue of air pollution with high ozone concentrations in the ambient air. The Aura ozone monitoring instrument (OMI), can provide long-term and large-scale dynamic monitoring of tropospheric column ozone (TCO). The TCO concentrations over China were extracted and analyzed from 2005 to 2019. The results showed that the spatiotemporal distribution of ozone concentration decreased from northeast to southeast in China. The seasonal variations of ozone concentration were spring's concentration is greater than winter's concentration, winter's concentration is greater than summer's concentration, summer's concentration is greater than autumn's concentration. The monthly variation showed a cyclical trend, with low values observed from June to November and high values from December to May. In addition, the spatiotemporal distribution of ozone concentration was affected by natural factors and anthropogenic factors. Regarding natural factors, TCO concentration was positively correlated with temperature, wind field, and vegetation coverage, but negatively with precipitation in southwest China. Regarding anthropogenic factors, TCO concentration showed a significant positive correlation with regional GDP, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in most areas of China. Clustering of backward air trajectories revealed that northwest and southeast airflows led to a higher TCO concentration in northeast China. These further indicate that the variation of TCO concentration was affected by many factors, but temperature, wind field, and the emissions of NOx and VOCs were the key factors.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Winter Habitat Indices Improve the Explanation of Broad-Scale Patterns of Mammal and Bird Species Richness in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is transforming winter environmental conditions rapidly. Shifts in snow regimes and freeze/thaw cycles that are unique to the harsh winter season can strongly influence ecological processes and biodiversity patterns of mammals and birds. However, the role of the winter environment in structuring a species richness pattern is generally downplayed, especially in temperate regions. Here we developed a suite of winter habitat indices at 500 m spatial resolution by fusing MODIS snow products and NASA MEaSUREs daily freeze/thaw records from passive microwave sensors and tested how these indices could improve the explanation of species richness patterns across China. We found that the winter habitat indices provided unique and mutually complementary environmental information compared to the commonly used Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs). Winter habitat indices significantly increased the explanatory power for species richness of all mammal and bird groups. Particularly, winter habitat indices contributed more to the explanation of bird species than mammals. Regarding the independent contribution, winter season length made the largest contributions to the explained variance of winter birds (30%), resident birds (27%), and mammals (18%), while the frequency of snow-free frozen ground contributed the most to the explanation of species richness for summer birds (23%). Our research provides new insights into the interpretation of broad-scale species diversity, which has great implications for biodiversity assessment and conservation.

TI  - The urban morphology on our planet-Global perspectives from space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is the second largest mega-trend right after climate change. Accurate measurements of urban morphological and demographic figures are at the core of many international endeavors to address issues of urbanization, such as the United Nations' call for "Sustainable Cities and Communities". In many countries - particularly developing countries -, however, this database does not yet exist. Here, we demonstrate a novel deep learning and big data analytics approach to fuse freely available global radar and multi-spectral satellite data, acquired by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Via this approach, we created the first-ever global and quality controlled urban local climate zones classification covering all cities across the globe with a population greater than 300,000 and made it available to the community (https://doi.org/10.14459/2021mp1633461). Statistical analysis of the data quantifies a global inequality problem: approximately 40% of the area defined as compact or light/large low-rise accommodates about 60% of the total population, whereas approximately 30% of the area defined as sparsely built accommodates only about 10% of the total population. Beyond, patterns of urban morphology were discovered from the global classification map, confirming a morphologic relationship to the geographical region and related cultural heritage. We expect the open access of our dataset to encourage research on the global change process of urbanization, as a multidisciplinary crowd of researchers will use this baseline for spatial perspective in their work. In addition, it can serve as a unique dataset for stakeholders such as the United Nations to improve their spatial assessments of urbanization.

TI  - Crop yield prediction using MODIS LAI, TIGGE weather forecasts and WOFOST model: A case study for winter wheat in Hebei, China during 2009-2013
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable in-season forecasting of crop yield is crucial for regional and national agricultural management. To improve the winter wheat yield prediction accuracy at the regional scale, we developed a data assimilation scheme that assimilated the MODIS leaf area index (LAI) into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model. The meteorological data of the WOFOST model include current weather data, 15-day THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) forecast dataset and weather forecast data generated by TIGGE forecast and historical meteorological data (1979-2008) using the vectorial angle method. The WOFOST model was calibrated within 10 subregions of Hebei province based on field measured winter wheat growth data from each corresponding agrometeorological station to account for the spatial variability of crop and soil parameters to some extent, and the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtered MODIS LAI was then assimilated into the WOFOST model for regional winter wheat yield forecasting. We constructed a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) cost function to account for the observations and model errors from Feb. 10th to Apr. 30th, and the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm was used to minimize the cost function by reinitializing three WOFOST parameters. The winter wheat yield forecasting date was started from Apr. 30th, and the results showed that assimilating MODIS LAI into the WOFOST model substantially improved the accuracy of regional wheat yield predictions (R = 0.60, CCC = 0.53, RMSE = 619.73 kg/ha) compared with the unassimilated results (R = 0.35, CCC = 0.24, RMSE = 857.32 kg/ha), and the relative error (RE) between the averaged predicted yield and official statistics for most cities decreased after data assimilation. This demonstrated that assimilating MODIS LAI can optimize the simulation of LAI in the WOFOST model, thereby further reduce the uncertainty of yield forecasting. These promising results highlighted the potential of integrating remotely sensed data, crop model and weather forecasts for in-season prediction of crop yield at the regional scale.

TI  - Modeling Secchi Disk Depth Over the North Arabian Gulf Waters Using MODIS and MERIS Images
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency measured using Secchi disk is an important water quality indicator influenced by various biotic and abiotic processes in coastal and marine ecosystems. Understanding the role of this important indicator over large coastal environments requires synoptic measurements through ocean color satellites, such as Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). In this study, we evaluated the performance of different atmospheric correction algorithms and the suitability of different pixel extraction methods in modeling Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) over the North Arabian Gulf (NAG) waters using MODIS and MERIS imagery. Evaluating the performance of different atmospheric correction algorithms and the suitability of pixel extraction methods yielded various Z(SD) models with different accuracy. The most accurate MODIS and MERIS Z(SD) models had R-2 of 0.75 (RMSE = 80 cm) and 0.78 (RMSE = 74 cm), respectively. These models can be used to accurately map Z(SD) of NAG waters that would provide a better understanding of NAG water quality dynamics. Although these models were designed for NAG waters, they can be applied for the entire Arabian Gulf waters and probably other similar waters with the availability of training data. The key factor that limits the efficiency of these models and other previous models is the success of atmospheric correction algorithms in retrieving reliable remote sensing reflectance over different water bodies.

TI  - Threatened Andean bears are negatively affected by human disturbance and free-ranging cattle in a protected area in northwest Peru
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas are vital for wildlife conservation, yet many activities that are detrimental for biodiversity are conducted within their limits. We used camera traps and remotely sensed data to assess the spatial and temporal relationships between cattle and Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in the Laquipampa Wildlife Refuge, a protected area in northwest Peru where cattle grazing is widespread. Between August 2015 and March 2016, we deployed 122 camera traps at 61 stations to measure the effect of cattle on the distribution and activity of Andean bears during the dry and humid seasons. We used generalized linear models to test the effects of cattle, other anthropogenic disturbances, and natural habitat variation on bear occurrence. We also estimated the degree of overlap between daily activity patterns of bears and cattle. We found a negative association between bears and cattle, and between bears and humans and dogs, and found that bears were less likely to use portions of the park closer to towns and farms. Bear responses to human disturbances were stronger than to habitat variation, and their spatial avoidance of cattle was stronger during the dry season. There was high overlap in daily activity patterns between bears and cattle, and bears and humans and dogs, suggesting the potential for interactions where they co-occur. Given the threatened status of Andean bears, and the role of protected areas in their conservation, we highlight the need for effective management of cattle and associated disturbances to protect this ecologically and culturally important carnivore.

TI  - An inter-comparison of different PSO-optimized artificial intelligence algorithms for thermal-based soil moisture retrieval
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the most important variables which affects different aspects of human life such as agriculture, flood, landslide, water resources, etc. There are different methods for modeling soil moisture such as conceptual, empirical and physically based models. Conceptual and physically based models are robust but they need several different data and information. However data driven models can be run using limited number of data. In this study, four data driven models i.e. MLP, ANFIS, SVR and GMDH were used to model soil moisture. Particle Swarm Optimization technique was used to optimize the structure of the four aforementioned models. Several different remote sensing-based indices were calculated using Landsat Imagery e.g. NDVI, TVDI, VTCI and TVX. An extensive field survey was conducted to collect soil moisture data in the region. A 70/30 ration was used to separate train and test data. 30 additional samples were used for a final validation of produced maps. Results showed a relatively poor performance of PSO-MLP model. The performance of PSO-ANFIS and PSO-SVR was moderate with R-2 of 0.74 and 0.84 and RMSE of 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively. PSO-GMDH had a superior performance with R-2 of 0.91 and RMSE of 2.4%. Therefore, PSO-GMDH can be suggested as a powerful modeling approach to produce soil moisture maps.

TI  - Framing Evaluation in Reality: An Introduction to Ontologically Integrative Evaluation
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EVALUATION
M3  - Article
AB  - For over 30 years, calls have been issued for the western evaluation field to address implicit bias in its theory and practice. Although many in the field encourage evaluators to be culturally competent, ontological competence remains unaddressed. Grounded in an institutionalized distrust of non-western perspectives of reality and knowledge frameworks, this neglect threatens the validity, reliability, and usefulness of western designed evaluations conducted in non-western settings. To address this, I introduce Ontologically Integrative Evaluation (OIE), a new framework built upon ontological competence and six foundational ontological concepts: ontological fluidity, authenticity, validity, synthesis, justice, and vocation. Grounding evaluation in three ontological considerations-what there is, what is real, and what is fundamental-OIE systematically guides evaluators through a deep exploration of their own and others' ontological assumptions. By demonstrating the futility of evaluations grounded in a limited ontological worldview, OIE bridges the current divide between western and non-western evaluative thinking.

TI  - Snow cover variability and trend over the Hindu Kush Himalayan region using MODIS and SRTM data
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover changes have a direct bearing on the regional and global energy and water cycles and the change in the Earth's climate conditions. We studied the relatively long-term (2000-2017) altitudinal spatiotemporal changes in the coverage of snow and glaciers in one of the world's largest mountainous regions, the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, including Tibet, using remote sensing data (5 km grid resolution) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite. This dataset provided a unique opportunity to study zonal and hypsographic changes in the intra-annual (accumulating season and melting season) and interannual variations in snow and glacial cover over the HKH region. The zonal and altitudinal (hypsographic) analyses were carried out for the melting season and accumulating season. The altitudewise linear trend analysis (Pearson's) of snow cover, shown as a hypsographic curve, clearly indicates a major decline in snow cover (average of 5 % or more at 100 m interval aggregates) between 4000-4500 and 5500-6000 m altitudes, which is consistent with the median trend (Theil-Sen - TS) and the monotonic trend (Mann-Kendall - MK; statistics) analysis. This analysis also revealed the regions and altitudes where major and statistically significant increases (10 % to 30 %) or decreases (-10 % to -30 %) in snow cover are identified. The extrapolation of the altitude-wise linear trend shows that it may take between similar to 74 and 7900 years, for 3001-6000 and 6000-7000 m altitude zones respectively, for mean snow cover to decline approximately 25 % in the HKH. More detailed analysis based on longer observational records and model simulations is warranted to better understand the underlying factors, processes, and feedbacks that affect the dynamic of snow cover in HKH. These preliminary results suggest a need for continued monitoring of this highly sensitive region to climate variability and change that depends on snow as a major source of freshwater for all human activities.

TI  - Optimizing the Peritumoral Region Size in Radiomics Analysis for Sentinel Lymph Node Status Prediction in Breast Cancer
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Peritumoral features have been suggested to be useful in improving the prediction performance of radiomic models. The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the prediction performance improvement for sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in breast cancer from peritumoral features in radiomic analysis by exploring the effect of peritumoral region sizes.Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was performed using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans of 162 breast cancer patients. The effect of peritumoral features was evaluated in a radiomics pipeline for predicting SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Peritumoral regions were generated by dilating the tumor regions-of-interest (ROls) manually annotated by two expert radiologists, with thicknesses of 2 mm, 4 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm. The prediction models were established in the training set (similar to 67% of cases) using the radiomics pipeline with and without peritumoral features derived from different peritumoral thicknesses. The prediction performance was tested in an independent validation set (the remaining similar to 33%).Results: For this specific application, the accuracy in the validation set when using the two radiologists' ROIs could be both improved from 0.704 to 0.796 by incorporating peritumoral features. The choice of the peritumoral size could affect the level of improvement.Conclusion: This study systematically investigates the effect of peritumoral region sizes in radiomic analysis for prediction performance improvement. The choice of the peritumoral size is dependent on the ROI drawing and would affect the final prediction performance of radiomic models, suggesting that peritumoral features should be optimized in future radiomics studies.

TI  - Uterine serous carcinoma: role of surgery, risk factors and oncologic outcomes. Experience of a tertiary center
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate factors impacting survival outcomes in patients with uterine serous carcinoma (USC).Methods: Data of consecutive patients diagnosed with USC undergoing surgery between 2000 and 2020 at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan (Italy) were reviewed. Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models.Results: Records of 147 consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Stage distribution was: 67 (45.6%) patients with early-stage with uterine confined disease and 80 (54.4%) with advanced stages disease. Minimally invasive surgery was performed in 43 patients (29.5%). The median follow-up period was 78.6 months (IQ range = 35.7-117.3 months). The overall recurrence rate was 41% (60 patients): 19/67 patients (28.4%) with early-stage disease and 41/80 patients (51.3%) with advanced stage. The 5-year PFS rate was 35.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.5-44.7%). In multivariate analysis, age, BMI, depth of myometrial invasion, cytology, and optimal cytoreduction with postoperative residual tumor absent significantly impacted on PFS. The 5-year OS rates were 46.5% (95% CI: 38.1-56.8). The result of multivariate analysis showed that there was significant difference in OS based only on optimal cytoreduction and accuracy of retroperitoneal surgery.Conclusions: In apparent early-stage USC, peritoneal and retroperitoneal staging allows to identify patients with disease harboring outside the uterus. Optimal cytoreduction is the most significant prognostic factor. Further collaborative studies are warranted in order to improve outcomes of USC patients.

TI  - Satellite-derived bathymetry using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A images: assessment of atmospheric correction algorithms and depth derivation models in shallow waters
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) has an extensive prospect in nearshore bathymetry for its high efficiency and low costs. Atmospheric correction and bathymetric modeling are critical processes in SDB, and examining the performance of related algorithms and models will contribute to the formulation of reliable bathymetry strategies. This study explored the effectiveness of three general atmospheric correction algorithms, namely Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S), Atmospheric correction for OLI 'lite' (ACOLITE), and QUick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), in depth retrieval from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A images using different SDB models over Ganquan Island and Oahu Island. The bathymetric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data was used for SDB model training and accuracy verification. The results indicated that the three atmospheric correction algorithms could provide effective corrections for SDB. For the SDB models except log-transformed band ratio model (LBR) and support vector machine (SVM), the impact of different atmospheric corrections on bathymetry was basically the same. Furthermore, we assessed the performance of six different SDB models: Lyzenga's model (LM), generalized additive model (GAM), LBR, SVM, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF). The bathymetric accuracy, consistency of bathymetric maps and generalization ability were considered for the assessment. Given sufficient training data, the accuracy of the machine learning models (SVM, MLP, RF) was generally superior to that of the empirical inversion models (LM, GAM, LBR), with the root mean square error (RMSE) varied between 0.735 m to 1.177 m. MLP achieved the best accuracy and consistency. When the depth was deeper than 15 m, the bathymetry error of all the SDB models increased sharply, and LM, LBR and SVM reached the upper limit of depth retrieval capability at 20-25 m. In addition, LM and LBR were demonstrated to have better adaptability in heterogeneous environment without training data.

TI  - Climate-driven variations in suspended particulate matter dominate water clarity in shallow lakes
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi disk depth (SDD) has long been considered as a reliable proxy for lake clarity, and an important indicator of the aquatic ecosystems. Meteorological and anthropogenic factors can affect SDD, but the mechanism of these effects and the potential control of climate change are poorly understood. Preliminary research at Lake Khanka (international shallow lake on the China-Russia border) had led to the hypothesis that climatic factors, through their impact on suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration, are key drivers of SDD variability. To verify the hypothesis, Landsat and MODIS images were used to examine temporal trend in these parameters. For that analysis, the novel SPM index (SPMI) was developed, through incorporation of SPM concentration effect on spectral radiance, and was satisfactorily applied to both Landsat (R-2 = 0.70, p < 0.001) and MODIS (R-2 =0.78, p < 0.001) images to obtain remote estimates of SPM concentration. Further, the SPMI algorithm was successfully applied to the shallow lakes Hulun, Chao and Hongze, demonstrating its portability. Through analysis of the temporal trend (1984-2019) in SDD and SPM, this study demonstrated that variation in SPM concentration was the dominant driver (explaining 63% of the variation as opposed to 2% due to solar radiation) of SDD in Lake Khanka, thus supporting the study hypothesis. Furthermore, we speculated that variation in wind speed, probably impacted by difference in temperature between lake surface and surrounding landscapes (greater difference between 1984-2009 than after 2010), may have caused varying degree of sediment resuspension, ultimately controlling SPM and SDD variation in Lake Khanka.

TI  - Diagnostic and prognostic classification of atypical spitzoid tumours based on histology and genomic aberrations: A prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Histological classification of atypical spitzoid tumours (ASTs) is un-reliable, and categorisation of these lesions into benign and malignant is poorly reproducible. Here, we classified ASTs based on histology and chromosomal aberrations and explored the prognostic significance of genomic aberrations in a prospective cohort with a long-term follow-up.Patients and methods: Histologically equivocal ASTs from 76 patients were analysed by array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH). Tumours were histologically assessed by a panel of dermatopathologist before and after aCGH and classified as benign, ambiguous or malig-nant. Chromosomal aberrations were correlated with an outcome. Results: Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 45 (59%) of 76 ASTs (median age: 16 years, range: 0-74; median follow-up: 90 months, range: 13-153). The initial histological diagnosis was changed upon presentation of aCGH results in 36 of 76 cases (47%). The final diagnostic interpretation classified 61% of the lesions as benign, 18% as ambiguous and 21% as malignant. Positive sentinel lymph node biopsies (6 thorn /29) occurred at similar rates in all diag-nostic groups (P Z 0.83) and were not associated with an unfavourable outcome. Two pa-tients had local recurrences, but none of the patients developed metastasis beyond the sentinel lymph node.Conclusions: All ASTs had an excellent prognosis, even in cases with worrisome morphology and chromosomal aberrations. With no distant metastasis or death in long-term follow-up of 76 patients, no correlation between chromosomal aberrations and prognosis was possible. However, it seems likely that in larger cohorts, metastases would arise in cases with complex aberrations and these patients should undergo clinical follow-up.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Using the Merlin assay for reducing sentinel lymph node biopsy complications in melanoma: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The assessment of the sentinel lymph node is a cornerstone of melanoma staging. However, similar to 80% of sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) are negative and nontherapeutic, and patients are unnecessarily exposed to surgery-related complications. Here, we gauged the potential of the Merlin assay to reduce SLNB-associated complications. The Merlin assay uses clinicopathologic variables and tumor gene expression profiling to identify low-risk patients who may forgo SLNB.Methods We utilized the Merlin test development cohort to determine SLNB complication rates for procedures performed between 2004 and 2018 at Mayo Clinic. Complications evaluated were lymphedema, seroma, infection/cellulitis, hematoma, and wound dehiscence. Patients who underwent a completion lymph node dissection were excluded.Results A total of 558 patients were included. The overall 90-day complication rate specific to SLNB (1 year for lymphedema) was 17.4%. The most common complications were seroma (9.3%), infection/cellulitis (4.8%), and lymphedema (4.3%). All three were more common in patients with a lower extremity primary tumor location versus other locations. With Merlin test results applied, SLNB-related complications would have decreased by 59%.Conclusion SLNB is a safe procedure but carries a significant complication rate. Merlin testing might reduce the need for SLNB and its associated complications.

TI  - Longwave radiative effect of the cloud-aerosol transition zone based on CERES observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an approach for the quantification of cloud-aerosol transition-zone broadband longwave radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) during daytime over the ocean, based on satellite observations and radiative transfer simulation. Specifically, we used several products from MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) sensors for the identification and selection of CERES footprints with a horizontally homogeneous transition-zone and clear-sky conditions. For the selected transition-zone footprints, radiative effect was calculated as the difference between the instantaneous CERES TOA upwelling broadband longwave radiance observations and corresponding clear-sky radiance simulations. The clear-sky radiances were simulated using the Santa Barbara DISORT (DIScrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer program for a multi-Layered plane-parallel medium) Atmospheric Radiative Transfer model fed by the hourly ERAS reanalysis (fifth generation ECMWF ReAnalysis) atmospheric and surface data. The CERES radiance observations corresponding to the clear-sky footprints detected were also used for validating the simulated clear-sky radiances. We tested this approach using the radiative measurements made by the MODIS and CERES instruments on board the Aqua platform over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean during August 2010. For the studied period and domain, transition-zone radiative effect (given in flux units) is on average equal to 8.0 +/- 3.7 W m(-2) (heating effect; median: 5.4 W m(-2)), although cases with radiative effects as large as 50 W m(-2) were found.

TI  - Affective Orientation and School Persistence Among African American Youth: Implications for Afrocentric Youth Research and Practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Completion of high school is a critical juncture predicting future success among adolescents. However, Black youth are often subjected to structural and micro-manifestations of structural barriers in schools, hindering their success. Moreover, research on resiliency factors associated with the academic success of Black adolescents facing structural barriers is woefully underdeveloped. In response, this study tested the associations between a resiliency factor (proposed by the Nguzo Saba and African-centered theory) and three predictors of school success (i.e., engagement, initiative-taking, and diligence). The study sample was derived from the Templeton Flourishing Children Project Pilot Study, which measured variables that contribute to "flourishing" and are important for improving youth outcomes. The sample of Black youth was evenly representative of both Black boys and girls. The results suggest that dimensions of school success can be bolstered by increased relational and personal concern among Black youth for their fellow peers, which supports that an Afrocentric worldview may be a relevant developmental asset for positive outcomes in Black adolescents. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed, including opportunities and strategies for school behavioral health workers to assist Black youth who may be at risk for school failure.

TI  - How we treat HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present goal of therapy for early hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human EGF receptor 2-negative (HER2-) BC is to optimize disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the currently available therapies while avoiding any relevant long-term sequalae. Local therapies have evolved toward less aggressive techniques (i.e. breast-preserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy and intraoperative radiotherapy), which significantly reduce the long-term sequalae observed with more radical treatments. Endocrine therapy (ET) is still the cornerstone of adjuvant treatment because it significantly reduces BC relapse and mortality. Adjuvant chemotherapy is today recommended only for a particular subset of patients with a high risk of recurrence with ET alone, identified through genomic assays, age and/or disease stage. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastasis and produce a slight although statistically significant improvement in survival in postmenopausal women. The CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib has been recently approved by the US FDA for patients at high risk of relapse.Plain language summary The goal of therapy for patients diagnosed with early hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human EGF receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BC) is to maximize survival rates while maintaining the quality of life and avoiding long-term sequalae. Local therapies have evolved toward less aggressive techniques, which significantly reduce the long-term sequalae observed with more radical approaches. Endocrine therapy (ET) remains as the cornerstone of adjuvant treatment because it significantly reduces BC relapse and mortality. Adjuvant chemotherapy is, however, recommended only for a particular subset of patients with a high-risk of recurrence with ET alone, identified through genomic assays together with clinical variables such as age and/or axillary involvement. Additionally, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastasis with a slight improvement in survival in postmenopausal women. The CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib has been recently approved by the US FDA for patients at high risk of relapse.

TI  - Impact of multiple lymphatic basin drainage in truncal melanoma patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In many patients with cutaneous melanoma that affects the trunk area, there is lymphatic drainage to multiple basins (MLBD). This study aimed to examine whether MLBD is associated with disease outcomes.Methods: Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were performed in 161 patients with truncal melanoma. The number and location of draining nodal basins were established during the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy using technetium-99 m rhenium sulphide nanocolloid.Results: MLBD was present in 59 (37%) patients, and single lymphatic basin drainage (SLBD) in 102 (63%) patients. Patients with MLBD showed no increased risk for SLN metastasis compared to patients with SLBD (27% versus 29%, respectively). There was no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between patients with MLBD and those with SLBD. Five-year DFS was 64% for patients with MLBD and SLBD. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of ulceration (p = 0.01) was an independent predictor of SLN metastasis, while melanoma thickness (p = 0.01) and SLN metastasis (p = 0.01) were independent predictors of DFS. In patients with a negative SLN, five-year DFS was 74% for patients with MLBD and 73% for those with SLBD. Multivariate analysis showed that melanoma thickness (p = 0.00) was an independent predictor of DFS.Conclusion: MLBD does not negatively impact the disease outcome in patients with truncal melanoma.

TI  - Watershed zonation through hillslope clustering for tractably quantifying above- and below-ground watershed heterogeneity and functions
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we develop a watershed zonation approach for characterizing watershed organization and functions in a tractable manner by integrating multiple spatial data layers. We hypothesize that (1) a hillslope is an appropriate unit for capturing the watershed-scale heterogeneity of key bedrock-through-canopy properties and for quantifying the co-variability of these properties representing coupled ecohydrological and biogeochemical interactions, (2) remote sensing data layers and clustering methods can be used to identify watershed hillslope zones having the unique distributions of these properties relative to neighboring parcels, and (3) property suites associated with the identified zones can be used to understand zone-based functions, such as response to early snowmelt or drought and solute exports to the river. We demonstrate this concept using unsupervised clustering methods that synthesize airborne remote sensing data (lidar, hyperspectral, and electromagnetic surveys) along with satellite and streamflow data collected in the East River Watershed, Crested Butte, Colorado, USA. Results show that (1) we can define the scale of hillslopes at which the hillslope-averaged metrics can capture the majority of the overall variability in key properties (such as elevation, net potential annual radiation, and peak snow-water equivalent - SWE), (2) elevation and aspect are independent controls on plant and snow signatures, (3) near-surface bedrock electrical resistivity (top 20 m) and geological structures are significantly correlated with surface topography and plan species distribution, and (4) K-means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture clustering methods generate similar zonation patterns across the watershed. Using independently collected data, we show that the identified zones provide information about zone-based watershed functions, including foresummer drought sensitivity and river nitrogen exports. The approach is expected to be applicable to other sites and generally useful for guiding the selection of hillslope-experiment locations and informing model parameterization.

TI  - HBeAg Is Indispensable for Inducing Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cell Activation by Hepatitis B Virus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and AimsLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) serve as sentinel cells to detect microbial infection and actively contribute to regulating immune responses for surveillance against intrahepatic pathogens. We recently reported that hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) stimulation could induce LSEC maturation and abrogate LSEC-mediated T cell suppression in a TNF-alpha and IL27 dependent manner. However, it remains unclear how HBeAg deficiency during HBV infection influences LSEC immunoregulation function and intrahepatic HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses. MethodsThe function of LSECs in regulating effector T cell response, intrahepatic HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses and HBV viremia were characterized in both HBeAg-deficient and -competent HBV hydrodynamic injection (HDI) mouse models. ResultsLSECs isolated from HBeAg-deficient HBV HDI mice showed a reduced capacity to promote T cell immunity in vitro compared with those isolated from wild-type HBV HDI mice. HBeAg expression replenishment in HBeAg-deficient HBV HDI mice restored the HBV-induced LSEC maturation, and resulted in potent intrahepatic anti-HBV CD8 T cell responses and efficient control of HBV replication. Moreover, in vivo TNF-alpha, but not IL27 blockade in HBV HDI mice impaired HBV-specific CD8 T cell immunity and delayed HBV clearance. ConclusionOur study underlines that HBeAg is indispensable for HBV-induced LSEC maturation to trigger intrahepatic HBV-specific T cell activation, and provides a new mechanism to elucidate the intrahepatic immune microenvironment regulation upon HBV exposure.

TI  - Spatial Mapping of the Flood-Affected Regions of Northern Kerala: A Case Study of 2018 Kerala Floods
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood mapping studies gained popularity in recent years with the availability of high-resolution SAR imagery. Satellite images in the visible spectrum cannot be used for disaster management applications due to inherent cloud cover during adverse weather conditions. The cloud penetrating capabilities and all-weather operation make radar images more suitable for flood mapping applications than optical images. The Kerala floods of 2018 were the worst disaster the state experienced in a century after the 1924 floods. It has resulted in widespread destruction and damages all around the state. Even though few flood inundation studies are based on the Kerala floods, they all concentrate on Central Kerala. Previous studies have not investigated detailed flood mapping of Northern Kerala using remote sensing techniques. This research paper explores the extent of flooding in Kozhikode, Malappuram and Wayanad districts of Northern Kerala by applying the thresholding method on radar images. The inundation extent of August 2018 is compared with the water-covered area of 2017 August to determine the extent of flooding. The current research also analyses the level of flood influence at the village level by using a spatial approach. The study reveals that the low-lying regions of the Malappuram district are the worse affected in the study area, with a few villages being severely flooded, with more than 10% of the geographical area inundated during the peak time. The flood inundation maps can be used to study the causative factors by applying modeling approaches.

TI  - Empirically validated drought vulnerability mapping in the mixed conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe droughts are predicted to become more frequent in the future, and the consequences of such droughts on forests can be dramatic, resulting in massive tree mortality, rapid change in forest structure and composition, and substantially increased risk of catastrophic fire. Forest managers have tools at their disposal to try to mitigate these effects but are often faced with limited resources, forcing them to make choices about which parts of the landscape to target for treatment. Such planning can greatly benefit from landscape vulnerability assessments, but many existing vulnerability analyses are unvalidated and not grounded in robust empirical datasets. We combined robust sets of ground-based plot and remote sensing data, collected during the 2012-2016 California drought, to develop rigorously validated tools for assessing forest vulnerability to drought-related canopy tree mortality for the mixed conifer forests of the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks and potentially for mixed conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada as a whole. Validation was carried out using a large external dataset. The best models included normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, and species identity. Models indicated that tree survival probability decreased with greenness (as measured by NDVI) and elevation, particularly if trees were growing slowly. Overall, models showed good calibration and validation, especially for Abies concolor, which comprise a large majority of the trees in many mixed conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada. Our models tended to overestimate mortality risk for Calocedrus decurrens and underestimate risk for pine species, in the latter case probably due to pine bark beetle outbreak dynamics. Validation results indicated dangers of overfitting, as well as showing that the inclusion of trees already under attack by bark beetles at the time of sampling can give false confidence in model strength, while also biasing predictions. These vulnerability tools should be useful to forest managers trying to assess which parts of their landscape were vulnerable during the 2012-2016 drought, and, with additional validation, may prove useful for ongoing assessments and predictions of future forest vulnerability.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Port Said Governorate is one of the distinguished Egyptian coastal areas in regard to location, activities and resources. Present study aims to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in Land Use/Cover (LULC), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Shoreline as a result of natural and anthropogenic factors using geospatial techniques. To achieve this aim, four calibrated multi-temporal Landsat images dated 1998, 2008, 2018 and 2021 integrated with field surveys were processed. Nine main LULC classes were mapped; urban, fish farms, vegetation, aquatic plants, main roads, bare land, water, canals/drains and salty areas. Developmental projects, particularly reclamation and urbanization, accelerated the increase in urban and agricultural lands during the whole period of study. Maximum rate of urban expansion was reported during the last period (2018-2021) and for agricultural lands during 2008-2018. The south eastern parts showed a continuous annual increase in the fish farms from 2.04 to 6.54 to 65.16 km(2) at 1998, 2008, 2018 and 2021, respectively. Further, the last periods showed an increase in the main roads due to the construction of "30 June Road ". A small variation is observed in mean LST recording 34.2, 33.7 and 34.3, 34.2 degrees C at 1998, 2008, 2018 and 2021, respectively. LULC can be ordered from lowest to highest LST as following; water (27.1 degrees C ), aquatic plants (28.1 degrees C), fish farms (30.6 degrees C), vegetation (31.9 degrees C), canals and drains (33.8 degrees C), urban (36.45 degrees C), salty areas (36.6 degrees C), main roads (37.20 degrees C) and bare land (39.40 degrees C). The total eroded area along Port Said shoreline (5 km(2)) exceeds the total accreted areas (2.8 km(2)). Maximum erosion and accretion were observed at the eastern sector recording 2.61 and 1.29 km(2), respectively. Fortunately, no intensive urban and agricultural areas are located in this sector which minimizes the probable adverse impact.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Impact of Post-Mastectomy Radiation Therapy for Sentinel Lymph Node Micrometastases in Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The association of radiotherapy with breast cancer survival in patients who underwent a mastectomy and had micrometastases in the sentinel lymph node is unclear.Material/Methods: The survival benefit of radiotherapy was examined in patients with T0/1-T2N1mi breast cancer undergoing mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Kaplan-Meier curves were employed for survival analysis and competing risk analysis, and a propensity score matching (PSM) cohort was enrolled to investigate whether such patients benefit from radiotherapy.Results: We identified 2864 patients in the SEER database from 2004 to 2015. All eligible patients were divided into the radiotherapy and the no-radiotherapy cohorts. With the median follow-up of 53 months, 5-year breast cancerspecific survival (BCSS) was 94.4% vs 95.2% (P=0.135), and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 91.2% vs 90.1% (P=0.466) in the radiotherapy cohorts and no-radiotherapy cohorts, respectively. The results of the competing risk analysis showed a comparable 5-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer-specific death (BCSD) in the radiotherapy and no-radiotherapy groups (5.5% vs 4.7%, P=0.107) but a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of other causes of death (OCD) in the no-radiotherapy cohort (3.3% vs 5.3%, P=0.011). No significant difference was observed for BCSS or OS in the PSM cohort.Conclusions: Radiotherapy has no benefit for patients with T0/1-T2 breast cancer undergoing mastectomy with N1mi disease on SLNB. This analysis provides evidence that radiotherapy may safely be omitted in this group of patients.

T2  - FISHERIES SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we developed an individual-based model for age-0 Pacific saury Cololabis saira focusing on the winter-spawned cohort to advance our understanding of the dynamic link between transport/migration and growth during the first year after hatching. The model individuals (superindividuals) were initially located in the spawning ground, and growth and transport/migration were calculated through bioenergetics and movement submodels using sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a, and velocity derived from satellite data. Comparative experiments for several migration algorithms and cues showed that the extended kinesis algorithm stimulated with growth rate condition yielded the most plausible results. Without considering mortality, the summer distribution predicted by the model was substantially different from observations. When distribution-based mortality was used, the model growth histories became qualitatively consistent with the otolith-derived growth histories. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of the second peak in daily growth rates occurring from spring to summer of age-0 fish were investigated by selecting superindividuals with a growth history well-fitted to that derived from otoliths. For these superindividuals, the growth rate increased in accordance with the successful northward migration from spring to early summer, and decreased as they fell behind the rapid northward shift of the high productivity zone in mid-summer.

AB  - The global process of transition from industrial to information society, as well as socio-economic changes taking place in Ukraine, require significant changes in many areas of state activity. It is especially connected with the reforms in the sphere of education. Today, national programs provide for the development of education on the basis of new progressive concepts, the introduction of the educational process of new pedagogical technologies and scientific achievements, the creation of a new system of information education, entrance of Ukaine into the transcontinental computer information system. Information technologies are qualitatively changing the key resources of development: this is no longer a space with fixed production, but primarily mobile finance and intelligence. They have a direct impact on the formation of personal growth, professional content and self-organization, emotional and psychological maturity and consciousness, and so on.One of the main factors in ensuring the stability and social education of the country's citizens is the culture of security, the formation and development of which is an urgent problem today. Comprehensive and systematic development of security culture will significantly increase the readiness of the population, the level of environmental, labor and patriotic education, reduce human losses, material damage from emergencies.Ecological education can be carried out more successfully only gradually and in accordance with the socio-psychological periods of one's development: kindergarten - school - college - university. The creation of such a system of environmental education should be enshrined as the basis of state environmental policy as a constitutional norm with the usage of information technology. Graduates of universities, who are the future of our country, after mastering the skills of basic environmental education must have a high level of environmental culture, which is, in turn, part of general human culture, and investigate environmental issues from the standpoint of their profession. It is known that with the help of environmental education the collective intelligence of society is formed, which can predict human activities and processes occurring in nature, and in some way to help with the elimination of crises. It is through environmental education that another system of human values is being formed, which places great emphasis on intangible wealth and solidarity, and great responsibility of humanity for the ecological state of the native country; provides a higher standard of living as a result of sustainable development, through the introduction of information technology in this system. To improve the quality of life, we need better knowledge, which must be implemented through information technology at the international level.

TI  - Analyzing the triggering factors of glacial lake outburst floods with SAR and optical images: a case study in Jinweng Co, Tibet, China
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - On June 25, 2020, Jinweng Co in Yiga, Tibet, experienced an outburst flood that resulted in catastrophic damage to farmland and roads. The complex causal factors for glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF) are not fully understood. This paper provides a systematic analysis of the contributing factors leading to the GLOF disaster in terms of meteorological triggering, glacial activity, lake expansion, landslide, and glacial collapse. The analysis is based on multi-source remote sensing approaches. Pixel offset tracking of Sentinel-1 images shows changes in the glacier flow velocity from 2017 to 2020. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images and inventory data have revealed the expansion of the lake since 1998. The satellite precipitation measurements revealed that the highest daily rainfall in recent years occurred approximately 4 days before the GLOF. Time series synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering images and interferograms suggest that a landslide had occurred from the western lateral moraine into the lake. Additionally, SAR images suggest possible ice collapse from the glacier tongue into the lake. The causal mechanism for the June 2020 GLOF event was likely the dam failure triggered by heavy rainfall and combined with landslides and ice collapses. Our research can provide a reference to identify and mitigate glacial lake outburst disasters in mountainous regions based on satellite optical and radar images.

TI  - Wetland classification using parcel-level ensemble algorithm based on Gaofen-6 multispectral imagery and Sentinel-1 dataset
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems have experienced dramatic challenges in the past few decades due to global climate change and human activities. Wetland maps are essential tools for conservation and management of terrestrial ecosystems. The objective of this study was to obtain an accurate wetland map using a parcel-level ensemble method based on Sentinel-1 SAR time series and segmentations generated from GF-6 MPS images. The Dongting Lake wetlands in China, which has a heterogeneous landscape, was deliberately chosen as a challenging case study. First, both VV and VH polarization backscatters (00 VV, 00 VH) were generated from time series Sentinel-1 SAR. Speckle noise inherent in SAR data can affect the performance on image segmentation by resulting in over segmentation or under-segmentation, and that will degrade the accuracies of wetland classification. Subsequently, optical data (Gaofen-6), which is effectively capable of delineating meaningful parcels, were applied to get the segmentations in this study. Finally, the ensemble method was utilized to extract the wetland information at parcel-level. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the object-based ensemble method are 90.58% and 0.88, which are 4.25% and 0.04 higher than that of the pixel-based method, respectively. Moreover, the object based ensemble method for classification in high heterogeneity areas is superior and can greatly improve the performance compared with single classifiers.

TI  - Application of a Large-Scale Terrain-Analysis-Based Flood Mapping System to Hurricane Harvey
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood modeling provides inundation estimates and improves disaster preparedness and response. Recent development in hydrologic modeling and inundation mapping enables the creation of such estimates in near real time. To quantify their performance, these estimates need to be compared to measurements collected during historical events. We present an application of a flood mapping system based on the National Water Model and the Height Above Nearest Drainage method to Hurricane Harvey. The outputs are validated with high-water marks collected to record the highest water levels during the flood. We use these points to compute elevation-related variables and flood extents and measure the quality of the estimates. To improve the performance of the method, we calibrate the roughness coefficient based on stream order. We also use lidar data with a workflow named GeoFlood and we compare the modeled inundation to that recorded by the high-water marks and to the maximum inundation extent provided by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory based on remotely sensed data from multiple sources. The results show that our mapping system estimates local water depth with a mean error of about 0.5 m and that the inundation extent covers over 90% of that derived from high-water marks. Using a calibrated roughness coefficient and lidar data reduces the mean error in flood depth but does not affect as much the inundation extent estimation.

TI  - Detecting landslide-dammed lakes on Sentinel-2 imagery and monitoring their spatio-temporal evolution following the Kaikoura earthquake in New Zealand
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide-dammed lakes pose a risk for upriver and downriver communities and infrastructure. The 2016 Kaikoura earthquake affected the northeastern region of the South Island in New Zealand, triggering numerous landslides that dammed river courses leading to the formation of hundreds of dammed lakes. Detecting and monitoring landslide-dammed lakes is important for disaster management. Satellite remote sensing imagery is often complementary to field acquisitions to obtain an overview of large and remote areas and thus can be exploited to monitor landslide-dammed lakes. Yet, the strengths and limitations of freely available multi-temporal satellite imagery for landslide-dammed lake assessment remain largely unexplored. This study aimed at automatically mapping landslide-dammed lakes caused by the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake and monitoring their evolution using time series of Sentinel-2 imagery and the computing capabilities of the Google Earth Engine. Our approach combined dynamic thresholding, change detection, and connected component analysis. Landslide-dammed lakes larger than 300 m(2) and located on relatively flat terrain were detected with reasonable accuracy, while lakes located in steeply incised valleys were detected less frequently. Despite the challenging topographical and environmental characteristics of the study area, we were able to detect landslide-dammed lake candidates at a regional scale. Temporal monitoring of the evolution of the landslide-dammed lake area revealed four distinct patterns: 1) constant, 2) increasing, 3) decreasing, and 4) variable. Our approach contributes to the understanding of the utility and limitations of temporal and spatial monitoring of landslide-dammed lakes, their potential cascading hazards and their interactions.

TI  - Marine aquaculture in the pacific coast of Costa Rica: Identifying the optimum areas for a sustainable development
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable marine aquaculture requires the definition of adequate areas for its development, where the productive activity has a lower impact on the environment and avoid conflicts with other coastal activities. The aim of this research is to identify the potential areas for marine aquaculture operations in the central and northern Pacific coast of Costa Rica, considering five fish species of commercial interest and three operation scale scenarios (large, medium and small scale). The mapping procedure considers the biological suitability for the species to have an optimum development, the structural suitability for the fish cages to endure the environmental conditions (mainly waves and currents), and the operational suitability for operation and maintenance activities associated to the fish production (e.g. feeding, harvesting, maintenance). Sea surface temperature, salinity, water clarity, wind speed and currents in open coasts regions were obtained from global models and satellite data. Currents and wave data in the Gulf of Nicoya, one of the main estuaries of the country, were modeled numerically. Available docking sites, marine protected areas and tourism sites were used and obtained from the corresponding national official entities. Results show a high potential for marine aquaculture projects, specifically for large and medium scale operations. Three out of five study species present high suitability in most of the study site, and the other two species present promising results in the Gulf of Nicoya. Small scale operations have several areas with high suitability for marine aquaculture projects, with extensions ranging from 101 km(2) to 2 118 km(2) depending on the species. At a regional scale, the Pacific coast of Costa Rica presents high potential for fish aquaculture, being a promising development medium for coastal communities as long as it is environmentally sustainable and compatible with other coastal activities such as tourism.

TI  - TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument observations of total column water vapour: Algorithm and validation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present the total column water vapour (TCWV) retrieval for the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations in the visible blue spectral band. The TROPOMI TCWV algorithm is being optimized and validated in the framework of the Sentinel 5 Precursor Product Algorithm Laboratory (S5P-PAL) project from the European Space Agency (ESA). The retrieval was first developed to retrieve TCWV from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2). We have optimized the settings of the retrieval to adapt it for TROPOMI observations. The TROPOMI TCWV algorithm follows the typical two step approach, using spectral fit retrieval of slant columns, and conversion of the slant columns to vertical columns using air mass factors (AMFs). An iterative optimization algorithm is developed to dynamically find the optimal a priori water vapour profile for the AMF calculation. Further optimizations on the spectral retrieval, air mass factor calculations as well as a new surface albedo retrieval approach are implemented.The TCWV retrieval algorithm is applied to TROPOMI observations from May 2018 to May 2021. The results are validated by comparing them to ERA5 reanalysis data, GOME-2, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) satellite observations. TCWV derived from TROPOMI observations agree well with the other data sets with Pearson correlation coefficient (R) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99. The mean bias between TROPOMI and ERA5 data is -1.24 kg m(-2) for measurements over land and 0.73 kg m(-2) for measurements over water. The comparison to MODIS observations show similar results with small dry bias of 1.51,kg m(-2) for measurements over land and a small wet bias of 1.25 kg m(-2) for measurements over water. Slightly larger dry bias of 1.98 kg m(-2) for measurements over land and 1.74 kg m(-2) for measurements over water are found when compared to GOME-2 obserations. Compared to SSMIS data over water, TROPOMI observations are bias low by 3.25 kg m(-2). The small discrepancies found between TROPOMI and reference data sets are related to the differences in measurement technique, measurement time, surface albedo issue, as well as cloud and aerosol contamination. This study demonstrates that the algorithm can provide stable and consistent results on a global scale and can be applied to generate operational TCWV products from TROPOMI and the forthcoming Copernicus missions Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5. We have also demonstrated the capability of retrieving fine scale water vapour structures in a case study over the Amazon. This indicates that the TROPOMI data set is also useful for local and regional climate studies.

TI  - Characteristics of built-up land change in resource-based cities and their impact on land surface temperature-Taking Wu'an as an example
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of built-up land on land surface temperature (LST) and its spatial patterns remain poorly understood over resource-based cities. Using Landsat-5,8 satellite imagery of Wu'an, a resource-based city in China, from 2001, 2007, and 2015, this paper classified the land use types and calculated the percentage of built-up land (PLAND). Changes in built-up land and their effects on the distribution of LST were analyzed through statistics and regression analysis. Statistical results showed that the amount of built-up land in 2007 and 2015 increased significantly compared with 2001. The same PLAND level increased LST more in 2007 and 2015. Furthermore, PLAND = 35% split the heating effects of PLAND on LST. The LST in areas with high PLAND (PLAND > 35%) was mainly impacted by the local built-up land. However, the LST in the areas with low PLAND (PLAND < 35%) was mainly correlated with the built-up land of areas with high PLAND. The results of regression analysis showed that the k value (slope of the correlation analysis) in 2007 and 2015 was larger than that in 2001, indicating the local heating effects of built-up land on LST. The spatial regression analysis results revealed that there was a closer spatial correlation between PLAND and LST in 2015, and built-up land with high PLAND (PLAND > 35%) would increase the LST of surrounding built-up land with low PLAND (PLAND < 35%). These research results could provide more references for urban expansion in urban design and planning.

TI  - Deep-water oil-spill monitoring and recurrence analysis in the Brazilian territory using Sentinel-1 time series and deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills are a worldwide concern since they cause environmental problems and financial losses. Automatic detection plays a crucial role in rapid decision-making to reduce damage. In this context, deep learning and remote sensing are powerful tools with successful applications in many regions. However, there are still no studies on deep-water zones and in the Brazilian territory. The present research has three contributions: (1) create an oil spill dataset on the Brazilian region, (2) compare state-of-the-art deep learning models for this task, and (3) propose a novel application on the Campos Basin (Brazil's largest producer) using Sentinel-1 time series to identify more susceptible regions, encompassing 138 images from 2016 to 2021. The experts manually labeled the dataset with confirmation from the oil company and federal inspection, resulting in 800 images with 512 x 512 spatial dimensions and their respective annotations (600 for training, 125 for validation, and 75 for testing). The study compared three semantic segmentation architectures (U-net, DeepLabv3+, and LinkNet) with four backbones (ResNet-101, ResNet-50, Efficient-net-B0, and Efficient-net-B3) resulting in 12 models. The U-net with the Efficient-net-B3 backbone presented slightly better results (98% accuracy, 75% precision, 78% recall, 76% F score, and 62% IoU). The time-series analysis considered images with 8,192 x 11,264 spatial dimensions. The entire image classification used a sliding window approach with a 128-pixel stride (averaging the overlapping pixels). Moreover, recurrence analysis detected the more susceptible areas and eliminated the look-alike. False positive features have a high spatial presence, but with low recurrence (rarely reaching 3 events), which facilitates their elimination using a threshold recurrence. This novel analysis for oil spills is suitable for understanding the patterns along the time and providing regions for the authorities in real-time.

TI  - Flood monitoring by integration of Remote Sensing technique and Multi-Criteria Decision Making method
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methodologies of flood monitoring are generally time-consuming and demanding tasks. In most cases, there is no possibility of flood monitoring in large areas. Due to the major drawbacks of conventional methods in flood detection of large districts, Remote Sensing (RS) has been efficiently employed as the best solution owing to its being synoptic view and cost-effective methodologies. One of the most challenging issues in RS technologies is choosing the optimal spectral bands to detect changes in the natural environment. In this research, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), as one of the most widely used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, was applied to select the optimal bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images for detection of flood-affected areas. For this purpose, the decision-making method was implemented during ten options and six criteria. The properties of the Sentinel-2 satellite images consisted of ten bands (with 10 and 20m spatial resolutions) and the criteria are the signal to noise ratio (SNR) related to sensor, standard deviation, variance, the SNR related to the bands, spatial resolution, and wavelength. Afterward, the ELECTRE technique was used to select six optimal bands among ten bands. The ELECTRE algorithm was programmed in MATLAB programming language that could make decisions with multiple options and multiple criteria. Furthermore, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, as one of the most powerful Machine Learning (ML) models, has been applied to classify the water bodies related to before and after the flood. According to the results of optimal bands classification, Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) for the pre-flood classification were 93.65 percent and 0.923, respectively, and for the post-flood classification, the OA and KC values were 94.52 percent and 0.935 respectively. In the case of before and after flooding, the results of classification model for optimal bands had more accuracy levels in comparison with those obtained by original bands. Generally, it was found that the ELECTRE technique for selecting the best bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images and detection of flood-affected areas, in a short period of time with high accuracy, offers remarkable and consistent results.

TI  - Morphometric characterization and erosion assessment of gullies in the lateritic badlands of Eastern India using ALOS AW3D30 DEM and topographic indices
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present geomorphic study analyzes the morphometric anomalies of the lateritic badlands (West Bengal, India) to understand the erosion intensity, triggering factors and landscape evolution using the ALOS AW3D30 DEM and quantitative techniques of various hydro-geomorphic processes (viz., basin morphometry, rainfall-runoff simulation, geomorphic threshold, erosion indices, sediment yield, SPI, and STI etc.). The GIS-based analysis reflects that there is the requitement of minimum drainage area (i.e. 55.71-349.01 m(2)) to maintain one metre of gully channel in the basins which have the network density of 2.86-13.76 km km(-2). The critical slope (i.e. geomorphic threshold) of badland terrain varies from 0.0222 to 0.0407 metre metre(-1), having dominance of overland flow erosion to initiate gully heads. The basin-wise SCS-CN and USLE coupling estimates that within the daily rainfall range of 11.41-66.41 mm day(-1), the potential sediment yield of gully basins varies from 2.15 to 9.10 t ha(-1). The S-L index (i.e. 0.81-47.32 m) diagram reflects the beats of gully energy profile due to stream erosion enhancement, slope steepness, resistance of underlying lithologies and active tectonics. Hypsometric integral values of the gully basins, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6, emphasize a low entropy-based fluvial system and development of mature-youthful landform stage. The evolutionary stages of badlands are explained here by the connectivity model and hillslope - gully - river coupling system, showing a quasi-equilibrium to complex stage of landscape development at present.

TI  - <SUP> 10</SUP>Be chronology of deglaciation and ice-dammed lake regression in the vicinity of the Mylodon Cave (Cerro Benitez, Patagonia, Chile)
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Located 51.5 degrees S in the vicinity of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, Cerro Benitez and the glacial valley of Lago Sofia host several caves and rock shelters that were occupied by megafauna and humans during the Late Pleistocene, including the Mylodon Cave and two of the oldest archaeological sites in Patagonia. During the last glaciation, Cerro Benitez was alternately covered by the Patagonian Ice Sheet and surrounded by an ice-dammed lake which restricted the access to the caves and rock shelters located under its uppermost level, 155 m a.s.l. This study aims to provide a detailed chronology of the deglaciation and lake regression in Cerro Benitez. The glacial fluctuations and the variations of lake level were reconstructed from multi-scale, remote-sensing data and field geomorphological mapping. In addition, we calculated the surface exposure age of 11 erratic blocks located above and on the lacustrine erosional platform using terrestrial cosmogenic Be-10 in order to date ice downwasting and lake regression, respectively. Dates of ice downwasting and lake regression events were modelled from prior surface exposure ages using Bayesian statistics. The results suggest that the Patagonian Ice Sheet locally thinned by at least 300 m during MIS 3 in the aftermath of a major glacial advance. Following deglaciation, the ice-dammed lake experienced a slow local regression (ca. 2.5 mm. a(-1) until 16.9 ka B2k, interpreted as the result of lake basin tilting due to differential post-glacial isostatic rebound. This initial phase of lake regression was followed by a faster regression caused by the reversal of the lake drainage between 16.9 and 15.4 ka B2k. We assess the chronological model by comparison with uplift and lakeshore erosion rates from the literature and eventually discuss the implications for megafaunal colonisation of the area.

TI  - Improved forest dynamics leads to better hydrological predictions in watershed modeling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored how the characterization of forest processes in hydrologic models affects watershed hydrological responses. To that end, we applied the widely used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to two forested watersheds in the southeastern United States. Although forests can cover a large portion of watersheds, tree attributes such as leaf area index (LAI), biomass accumulation, and processes such as evapotranspiration (ET) are rarely calibrated in hydrological modeling studies. The advent of freely and readily available remote-sensing data, combined with field observations from forestry studies and published literature, allowed us to develop an improved forest parameterization for SWAT. We tested our proposed parameterization at the watershed scale in Florida and Georgia and compared simulated LAI, biomass, and ET with the default model settings. Our results showed major improvements in predicted monthly LAI and ET based on MODIS reference data (NSE > 0.6). Simulated forest biomass also showed better agreement with the USDA forest biomass gridded data. Through a series of modeling experiments, we isolated the benefits of LAI, biomass, and ET in predicting streamflow and baseflow at the watershed level. The combined benefits of improved LAI, biomass, and ET predictions yielded the most optimal model configuration where terrestrial and in-stream processes were simulated reasonably well. We performed automated model calibration using two calibration strategies. In the first calibration scheme (M0), SWAT was calibrated for daily streamflow without adjusting LAI, biomass, and ET. In the second calibration scheme (MLAI+BM+ET), previously calibrated parameters constraining LAI, biomass, and ET were incorporated into the model and daily streamflow was recalibrated. The MLAI+BM+ET model showed superior performance and reduced uncertainties in predicting daily streamflow, with NSE values ranging from 0.52 to 0.8. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately representing forest dynamics in hydrological models.

TI  - Improving the representation of forests in hydrological models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a critical role in the hydrologic cycle, impacting the surface and groundwater dynamics of watersheds through transpiration, interception, shading, and modification of the atmospheric boundary layer. It is therefore critical that forest dynamics are adequately represented in watershed models, such as the widely applied Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT's default parameterization generally produces unrealistic forest growth predictions, which we address here through an improved representation of forest dynamics using species-specific re-parameterizations. We applied this methodology to the two dominant pine species in the southeastern U.S., loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and slash pine (Pinus elliotti). Specifically, we replaced unrealistic parameter values related to tree growth with physically meaningful parameters derived from publicly available remote-sensing products, field measurements, published literature, and expert knowledge. Outputs of the default and re-parameterized models were compared at four pine plantation sites across a range of management, soil, and climate conditions. Results were validated against MODIS-derived leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET), as well as field observations of total biomass. The re-parameterized model outperformed the default model in simulating LAI, biomass accumulation, and ET at all sites. The two parametrizations also resulted in substantially different mean annual water budgets for all sites, with reductions in water yield ranging from 13 to 45% under the new parameterization, highlighting the importance of properly parameterizing forest dynamics in watershed models. Importantly, our re-parameterization methodology does not require alteration to the SWAT code, allowing it to be readily adapted and applied in ongoing and future watershed modeling studies.

TI  - Mechanisms associated with the rapid decline in sea ice cover around a stranded ship in the Lazarev Sea, Antarctica
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the satellite data era starting from 1979, the extent of Antarctic sea ice increased moderately for the first 37 years. However, the extent decreased to record low levels from 2016 to 2020, with the drop being greatest in the Weddell and Lazarev Seas of the Southern Ocean. An important question for the scientific fraternity and policymakers is to understand what ocean-atmospheric processes triggered such a rapid decline in sea ice. We employ in-situ, satellite, and atmospheric reanalysis data to examine the causative mechanism of anomalous sea ice variability in the Lazarev Sea at a time of ice growth in the annual cycle (March-April 2019), when a cargo ship was stuck in extensive ice cover and freed following the unusual decline in sea ice. High-resolution Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar captured a distinct view of the ship location and track within extensive ice cover of fast sea ice, dense pack ice, and icebergs in the Lazarev Sea on 27 March 2019. Subsequently, the sea ice cover declined and reached the fourth lowest extent in the entire satellite record during April 2019 which was 25.6% lower than the long-term mean value of 2.65 x 10(6) km(2). We show that the anomalous sea ice variability was due to the occurrence of eastward-moving polar cyclones, including a quasi stationary explosive development that impacted sea ice through extreme changes in ocean-atmospheric conditions. The cyclone-induced dynamic (poleward propagation of ocean waves and ice motion) and thermodynamic (heat and moisture plumes from midlatitudes, ocean mixed layer warming) processes coupled with high tides provided a conducive environment for an exceptional decline in sea ice over the region of ship movement.

TI  - Global validation of clear-sky models for retrieving land-surface downward longwave radiation from MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface longwave radiation (SLR) plays an important role in the energy budget of the Earth's climate system. Remote sensing provides various data sources to retrieve SLR on a large scale and with high spatial resolution (e. g., 1 km). Multiple retrieval methods of surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) based on satellite thermal infrared data produce different retrieval results for the same scenario. Therefore, validating these models is necessary to understand their characteristics and limitations. To this end, ground-based measurements were used to provide independent validation of six widely used SDLR models for clear sky conditions over 41 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations worldwide. The Wang2020 model had the best overall performance (bias of similar to 5.480 W/m(2), root-mean-square errors [RMSE] of 23.226 W/m(2), R-2 of 0.879), and Tang2008 model had similar retrieval capability. The errors of LST had limited influence on the retrieval accuracy of SDLR models. When using the near-surface air temperature, the retrieval accuracy of the Zhou2007 model was significantly improved with a range of similar to 9.5 W/m(2) for the RMSE. The uncertainty of TCWV had significant effect on all model performances, wherein the Zhou2007 model had stronger error resilience of TCWV. Moreover, MODIS TIR TCWV data provided better performance than NIR TCWV in most situations, and thereby are preferred to use in the SDLR retrieval. Surface altitude had a lesser impact on SDLR retrieval than terrain effects. All models overestimated SDLR for peak stations in mountainous areas, with biases reaching 56.614 W/m(2) and RMSE reaching 63.909 W/m(2). Land cover type also had a significant effect on retrieval accuracy; model performances were poorer in the desert and barren where atmospheric conditions are extremely dry and hot. Remote sensing SDLR data with high accuracy are needed for hydrological, agricultural, and climate change applications. The results of this study provide a reference for the SDLR retrieval accuracy based on clear-sky models.

TI  - Spatial resolution of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and greenness exposure misclassification in an urban cohort
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a measure of greenness widely used in environmental health research. High spatial resolution NDVI has become increasingly available; however, the implications of its use in exposure assessment are not well understood.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of NDVI spatial resolution on greenness exposure misclassification.METHODS: Greenness exposure was assessed for 31,328 children in the Greater Boston Area in 2016 using NDVI from MODIS (250 m(2)), Landsat 8 (30 m(2)), Sentinel-2 (10 m(2)), and the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP, 1 m(2)). We compared continuous and categorical greenness estimates for multiple buffer sizes under a reliability assessment framework. Exposure misclassification was evaluated using NAIP data as reference.RESULTS: Greenness estimates were greater for coarser resolution NDVI, but exposure distributions were similar. Continuous estimates showed poor agreement and high consistency, while agreement in categorical estimates ranged from poor to strong. Exposure misclassification was higher with greater differences in resolution, smaller buffers, and greater number of exposure quantiles. The proportion of participants changing greenness quantiles was higher for MODIS (11-60%), followed by Landsat 8 (6-44%), and Sentinel-2 (5-33%).SIGNIFICANCE: Greenness exposure assessment is sensitive to spatial resolution of NDVI, aggregation area, and number of exposure quantiles. Greenness exposure decisions should ponder relevant pathways for specific health outcomes and operational considerations.

TI  - Postoperative radiotherapy in stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) is currently recommended for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma. Nevertheless, deviations occur frequently due to the generally elderly and frail patient population. We aimed to evaluate the influence of PORT on survival in stage I-III MCC patients treated in the Netherlands.Methods: Patients were included retrospectively between 2013 and 2018. Fine-Gray method was used for cumulative incidence of recurrence and MCC-related death, cox regression was performed for overall mortality. Analyses were performed in patients with clinical (sentinel node biopsy [SN] not performed) stage I/II (c-I/II-MCC), pathologic (SN negative) stage I/II (p-I/II-MCC) and stage III MCC (III-MCC), separately. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to assess confounding by indication.Results: In total 182 patients were included, 35 had p-I/II-MCC, 69 had c-I/II-MCC and 78 had III-MCC. Median follow up time was 53.5 (IQR 33.4-67.4), 30.5 (13.0-43.6) and 29.3 (19.3-51.0) months, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed PORT to be associated with less recurrences and reduced overall mortality, but not with MCC-related mortality. In stage III-MCC, extracapsular extension (subdistribution hazard [SDH] 4.09, p = 0.012) and PORT (SDH 0.45, p = 0.044) were associated with recurrence, and >= 4 positive lymph nodes (SDH 3.24, p = 0.024) were associated with MCC-related mortality.Conclusions: PORT was associated with less recurrences and reduced overall mortality in patients with stage I-III MCC, but not with MCC-related mortality. Trends in overall survival benefit are likely to be caused by selection bias suggesting further refinement of criteria for PORT is warranted, for instance by taking life expectancy into account.

TI  - Advanced diagnostic imaging of sentinel lymph node in early stage breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ULTRASOUND
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been regarded as the standard procedure for early staging breast cancer. One of the key steps is to locate the sentinel lymph node (SLN). The recommended method is the joint use of blue dye and radioisotope. However, due to radionuclide radiation and high cost, it is urgent to develop more convenient and sensitive imaging methods to accurately locate SLN. This article discusses the advancement of accurately locating SLN by isotope tracer imaging, magnetic tracer method, computed tomographic lymphography, and trans-lymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound, as well as proposing new propose for clinical diagnosis.

TI  - Monitoring Land Subsidence in North-central Henan Plain using the SBAS-InSAR Method with Sentinel-1 Imagery Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As impacted by long-term underground resource exploitation and urban shallow space construction and expansion, land subsidence has turned out to be a major ground geological disaster in the central-northern Henan Plain. For the construction of the Central Plains urban agglomeration, it is required to efficiently and comprehensively grasp the information of land subsidence in the North-central Henan Plain, as well as effectively prevent and control the rapid development of subsidence. In the present study, the Land subsidence in North-central Henan Plain was initially monitored and analyzed by employing the SBAS-InSAR technology with 40 scenes of C-band Sentinel-1 data (March 2017-August 2018). As revealed from the results, the central-northern North Henan Plain consists of 6 main subsidence areas, exhibiting a maximum subsidence rate of -116 mm/a, as primarily located in the southwestern region of Baiquan Town, Hui County, Xinxiang City. To verify the results achieved by the InSAR monitoring, a GPS monitoring network and a leveling route were deployed in the study area to acquire the data of the InSAR monitoring time period. The InSAR monitoring data and GPS monitoring data were used to analyze the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed railway, the Anyang-Xinxiang line and the South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The project and the ground subsidence along the Wari Railway are analyzed through the single-point comparison with GPS and leveling data. As indicated by the results, the InSAR monitoring results are highly consistent with the GPS and leveling data in the subsidence trend, whereas some differences exist in the values. As revealed from the calculated results, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the InSAR monitoring results and the GPS monitoring results was +/- 10.96 mm/a, and the RMSE between the InSAR measurement result and the level measurement was +/- 11.23 mm/a. The research results can scientifically underpin interprovincial joint prevention and control of land subsidence in the northern Henan Plain, as well as basically support sustainable economic and social development.

TI  - Influences of landform and urban form factors on urban heat island: Comparative case study between Chengdu and Chongqing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the degraded urban thermal environment has been widely concerned, whether monocentric or polycentric urban development can alleviate urban heat island (UHI) is still debatable, particularly considering different types of cities in plain and mountainous settings. To fill the gap, this study chose the cases of Chengdu on alluvial flatlands and Chongqing on mountainous landforms in China for comparison. Adapting to natural landforms, Chengdu has a dominated monocentric urban form, whereas Chongqing has a naturally polycentric urban form. This study found that areas with high UHI intensity were located in the urban center and peripheral suburbs in Chengdu, while those were located in the peripheral industrial zones in Chongqing. The spatial error model and random forest regression results showed that natural elements such as vegetation and water had similar influences and contributions to UHI. However, distinct landforms and urban forms played critical roles in UHI differences among the two cities. Impervious surface and building density were the dominant variables to UHI of Chengdu, while sky view factor and industrial zones were the main contributors to UHI of Chongqing. The findings called for corresponding policy strategies to optimize urban form and improve the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Evaluation of trophic state for inland waters through combining Forel-Ule Index and inherent optical properties
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is a severe environmental pollution problem for inland waters and poses significant threats to the water safety. Monitoring trophic state of inland waters using optical remote sensing generally requires the inversion of water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll-a, secchi depth, etc. However, the accurate inversion of these individual indicators remains challenging, while the associated retrieval errors can propagate and degrade the evaluation of trophic state. Hence, we proposed a novel monitoring method by developing a Trophic State Index (TSI) based on optical remote-sensing parameters, i.e., Forel-Ule index (FUI) and non-water absorption coefficient at 674 nm (referred to as at-w(674)) retrieved from Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery. The estimated TSI showed favorable correspondence with observed water quality data, including coefficient of determination (r(2) = 0.91), root mean squared error (RMSE = 5.54), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 10.69%). Using the Sentinel-3 OLCI data, the proposed method also had very good performance in the field spectrum (MAPE = 5.25 %, RMSE = 3.36). The monthly trophic state evaluation also showed congruence (MAPE = 12.51 %, RMSE = 6.41) with surface water quality monthly report (SWQMR) from the Ministry of Environment and Ecology of the People's Republic of China. The monthly TSI showed favorable agreement for 23 ungauged lakes (RMSE = 7.26, MAPE = 12.78%), indicating potential utility for regional lake water quality monitoring. The proposed method was then applied to 47 other large (>50 km(2)) water bodies in the Middle-and-Lower watershed of Yangtze River and the Huaihe watershed to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of trophic state from 2016 to 2020. The TSI results revealed several lakes, such as Lake Honghu and Lake Luoma, with rapidly deteriorating water quality during the study period, while other lakes show relative improvement (e.g., Xiashan Reservoir), indicating unbalanced environmental pressure over the region. Overall, this study showed promising performance and potential for satellite-based monitoring of regional aquatic environments.

TI  - Spatial statistics techniques for SPEI and NDVI drought indices: a case study of Khuzestan Province
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a major water resources management issue in Iran. Khuzestan Province is in a drought state due to water shortage. Therefore, identifying areas at high risk of drought and when drought occurs is essential for drought management. For this purpose, this study used precipitation and temperature data of 12 selected stations and MODIS sensor images from the United States Geological Survey database in 2000-2017. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated using the Hargreaves-Samani method and ENVI software. Moreover, different spatial statistics techniques were used in the ArcGIS environment to analyze the results. Also, time series diagrams were drawn, and the trend was evaluated using the Mann-Kendall test. Finally, the distribution of NDVI values was investigated using EasyFit software, and the amount of drought damage was determined using NDVI. The investigation of the cluster maps of the Anselin Local Moran's Index along with hot and cold spots formed for both SPEI and NDVI showed that drought severity was higher at the southern stations than at the semi-northern and northwestern ones in the province. Moreover, the survey results using the EasyFit software showed that the southern stations, including the Ahvaz, Mahshahr, and Omidiyeh-Aghajari stations, were more at risk of drought than the other stations due to the drought threshold. Furthermore, the total damage caused by drought for the Ahvaz and Abadan stations showed a damage rate of 50%.

TI  - Medium-resolution multispectral satellite imagery in precision agriculture: mapping precision canola (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.) yield using Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery has been a key data source for precision agriculture. However, high-resolution and/or hyperspectral imagery have typically been favored for their greater information content. This study aims to demonstrate the capability of medium-resolution imagery in precision agriculture by developing an example of canola yield mapping using Sentinel-2 data in central Alberta. Two simple empirical models for mapping precision canola yield are tested: one using random forest regression and a second using functional linear regression. Both take as input freely-available Sentinel-2 time series images and use these to predict precision yield gathered by a yield monitor. The models were able to predict crop yield to within 12-16% accuracy of the reference yield. These results also demonstrate that a time series of medium-resolution multispectral imagery can capture small-scale variation in crop yields. The proposed methods can be applied to other areas or cropping systems to improve understanding of crop growth at both the field-level and regional-level.

TI  - A multi-sensor satellite imagery approach to monitor on-farm reservoirs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fresh water stored by on-farm reservoirs (OFRs) is an important component of surface hydrology and is critical for meeting global irrigation needs. Farmers use OFRs to store water during the wet season and for crop irrigation during the dry season, yet their seasonal and inter-annual variability and downstream impacts are not quantified. Therefore, OFRs' sub-weekly surface area changes are critical to understanding their dynamics and mitigating their downstream impacts. However, prior to the recent increase in satellite imagery availability and improvement in sensors' spatial resolution, monitoring the OFRs' sub-weekly surface area changes across space and time was challenging because OFRs occur in high numbers (i.e. hundreds) and are small water bodies (50 ha). We propose a novel multi-sensor approach to monitor OFRs surface areas, developed based on 736 OFRs in eastern Arkansas, USA, which leverages the use of PlanetScope (PS), RapidEye (RE), Sentinel 2 (S2), and Sentinel 1 (S1). First, we estimate the uncertainties in surface area for each sensor by comparing the surface area estimates to a validation dataset, and by comparing RE, S2 and S1 to PS-the sensor with the highest spatial resolution (i.e. 3.125 m). Second, we use the uncertainties of each sensor with a data assimilation algorithm based on the Kalman filter to obtain sub-weekly surface area time series for all OFRs. Our results show the lowest uncertainties for PS, followed by RE, S2 and S1. These uncertainties varied according to the OFRs' size and shape complexities. The surface area estimates derived from the Kalman filter including only the optical sensors resulted in high agreement (r(2) > 0.95) and small uncertainties (4-8%) when compared to the validation dataset. We found higher uncertainties (5-14%) when adding S1 to the Kalman filter-this is related to the higher uncertainties found for S1 (similar to 20%). The algorithm can assimilate optical and radar satellite data to increase the OFRs' surface area time series cadence allowing us to investigate sub-weekly surface area changes. The algorithm is not sensor-specific, and it accounts for the uncertainties in both the sensors observations and the resulting surface areas, which are key advantages when compared to other algorithms used to combine satellite data. By improving the surface area observations cadence and providing the surface area uncertainties, the approach presented in this study has the potential to enhance water conservation plans by allowing better assessment and management of the OFRs.

TI  - Quantifying vertical land motion at tide gauge sites using permanent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar and global navigation satellite system solutions
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the consequences of climate change is sea level rise (SLR). Near the coast SLR varies at different locations due to the contributions from regional/local climatic and non-climatic factors. Vertical land motion (VLM) can affect the accuracy of sea level observations from tide gauges (TG) that may exacerbate coastal area inundation/flooding. This study investigated the viability of Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) to quantify the rate of VLM at the TG sites. Measurements from TG co-located GNSS receivers provide the actual VLM rates and ground truth for PSInSAR-derived rates. Based on the results from the 9 study sites, almost all except one are subsiding. Both PSInSAR and GNSS solutions showed the same trend with rates that correlate at 0.89. Analysis from 20 Active GNSS stations showed 95% of the sites are undergoing land subsidence. This should be a cause of concern for communities near the coastal areas.

TI  - Performance assessment of a Persian Gulf wind and wave forecasting system
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from three satellites (JASON2, CRYOSAT, and SARAL/AltiKa) and two buoys were used to examine the performance of wind and wave forecasting models in the Persian Gulf. The quality of the satellite data was first examined by comparing them with buoy data. Wind speed data from all three satellites were found to be close to in situ measurements; for wave heights, SARAL/AltiKa data showed the best comparisons. Model forecasts and buoy data indicated correlation coefficients between 0.72 and 0.86 for wind speeds and 0.85-0.94 for wave heights. The forecast was more accurate at the open sea buoy than at the coastal buoy. Relative to SARAL/AltiKa data, which was preferred for assessing modelled wave heights, correlation coefficients were between 0.86 and 0.90. For modelled wind speeds, correlation coefficients with the consolidated satellite dataset were between 0.80 and 0.88. Some anomalous results were partly attributed to the exclusion of air-sea temperature differences. The likelihood of a given forecast representing a given sea state was estimated. Generally, for lead times up to 48 h, a user could have a 78-92% expectation that a SWH forecast > 1 m would lie within +/- 30% of a sea-state represented by the SARAL/AltiKa measurements.

TI  - Land-use change influence ecosystem services in an agricultural landscape in Central America
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems provide a variety of services that are important for human well-being. The estimation of different ecosystem services is necessary to support decision-making processes at different levels in the landscapes. The dynamics of land use, based on LANDSAT satellite images from the years 1978, 1986, 1998 and 2011 in La Via Lactea (Nicaragua), was analyzed to estimate its impact on four ecosystem services (habitat for species, carbon stock, greenhouse gas regulation and food production). The valuation of ecosystem services was carried out through a land-use change analysis, while the estimation of conservation value coefficients was estimated for the study area using information collected in the field. It was estimated that forest cover was reduced by 93% between 1978 and 2011, whereas pasture areas increased considerably (133,304 ha) in the same period. These changes have caused a reduction of forest cover for cattle production, resulting in a loss in the quality and provision of ecosystem services. The conversion of forests to pastures caused a reduction of ecosystem services such as habitat for species and carbon stock, while milk production and greenhouse gas emissions have increased, which is related to grassland management. Between 1978 and 2011, support and regulation services had decreased by $15.6 and $4.4 million USD, respectively, whereas provisioning services have increased by $14.9 million USD. Recovery of pastures through silvopastoral systems is an alternative that would improve the provision of ecosystem services and the promotion of sustainable livestock to improve landscape conservation.

TI  - 10 m crop type mapping using Sentinel-2 reflectance and 30 m cropland data layer product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The 30 m resolution U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop data layer (CDL) is a widely used crop type map for agricultural management and assessment, environmental impact assessment, and food security. A finer resolution crop type map can potentially reduce errors related to crop area estimation, field size characterization, and precision agriculture activities that requires crop growth information at scales finer than crop field. This study is to develop a method for crop type mapping using Sentinel-2 10 m bands (i.e., red, green, blue, and near infrared) and to examine the benefit of the derived 10 m crop type map. The crop type mapping was conducted for two study areas with significantly different field sizes and crop types in South Dakota and California, respectively. The Sentinel-2 10 m surface reflectance and the derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) acquired in the 2019 growing season were used to generate monthly median composites as classification input. The training and evaluation samples were derived from CDL by (i) finding good quality 30 m CDL pixels and (ii) identifying a single representative Sentinel-2 10 m pixel time series for each 30 m good quality CDL pixel. The random forest algorithm was trained using 80% of the samples and evaluated using the 20% remaining samples, and the results showed high overall accuracies of 94% and 83% for South Dakota and California study areas, respectively. The major crops in both study areas obtained high user's and producer's accuracies (> 87%). There is a good agreement between the class proportions in the 10 m crop type map and 30 m CDL for both study areas with R-2 >= 0.94 and root mean square error (RMSE) <= 3%. More importantly, compared to the 30 m CDL, the 10 m crop type map has much less salt-pepper and crop boundary-aliasing effects and defines better the small surface features (e.g., small fields, roads, and rivers). The potential of the method for large area 10 m crop type mapping is discussed.

TI  - Mapping forest types over large areas with Landsat imagery partially affected by clouds and SLC gaps
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem services that forests provide depend on tree species composition. Therefore, it is important to map not only forest extent and its dynamics, but also composition. Open access to Landsat has resulted in considerable improvements in remote sensing methods for mapping tree species, but most approaches fail to perform when there is a shortage of clear observations. Our main goal was to map forest composition with Landsat imagery in various data availability conditions, and to investigate how the missing data, either due to clouds or scan line problems affect classification accuracy. We tested a data driven approach that is based on multi-temporal analysis of the tree species' spectral characteristics making it applicable to regional-scale mapping even when the gap-free imagery is not available. Our study area consisted of one Landsat footprint (26/28) located in Northern Wisconsin, USA. We selected this area because of numerous tree species (23), heterogenic composition of forests where the majority of stands are mixed, and availability of high-quality reference data. We quantified how classification accuracy at the species level was affected by a) the amount of missing data due to cloud cover and Scanning Line Corrector (SLC) gaps, b) the number of acquisitions, and c) the seasonal availability of images. We applied a decision tree classifier, capable of handling missing data to both single-and a three-year Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 observations. We classified the dominant tree species in each pixel and grouped results to forest stands to match our reference data. Our results show four major findings. First, producer's and user's accuracies range from 46.2% to 96.2% and from 59.9% to 93.7%, respectively for the most abundant forest types in the study area (all types covering greater than 2% of the forest area). Second, all tree species were mapped with overall accuracy above 70% even in when we restricted our data set to images having gaps larger than 30% of the study area. Third, the classification accuracy improved with more acquisitions, especially when images were available for the fall, spring, and summer. Finally, producer's accuracies for pure-stands were higher than those for mixed stands by 10 to 30 percentage points. We conclude that inclusion of Landsat imagery with missing data allows to map forest types with accuracies that previously could be achieved only for those rare years for which several gap-free images were available. The approach presented here is directly applicable to Landsat-like ob-servations and derived products such as seasonal composites and temporal statistics that miss 30% or more of the data for any single date to develop forest composition maps that are important for both forest management and ecology.

TI  - A copula model integrating atmospheric moisture demand and supply for vegetation vulnerability mapping
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought caused by various meteorological factors negatively affects vegetation. Constructing a joint probability distribution between vegetation and drought information may be appropriate to understand the vulnerability of vegetation to drought. In this study, a copula-based trivariate joint probability model is proposed to investigate the effects of various aspects of meteorological drought on vegetation (vegetation drought). Because drought can be caused by insufficient precipitation or excessive evapotranspiration, the meteorological drought risk for vegetation was divided into two aspects (atmospheric moisture supply and moisture demand). The vulnerability of vegetation drought was mapped when two aspects of meteorological drought occurred separately or simultaneously at high spatial resolution using remote sensing data. The results revealed that the response of vegetation was significantly different depending on the climatic stressors. Although the sensitivity of vegetation to each drought condition varied from region to region, it was found that vegetation was more vulnerable to drought caused by atmospheric moisture demand in most regions of Far East Asia. It has also been shown that drought conditions, which overlapped with insufficient precipitation and excessive evapotranspiration, can drive vegetation to a far more lethal level. Meanwhile, through comparison with the existing VTCI, the proposed Normalized Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (nVTCI) was found to be able to more rationally monitor vegetation drought in the Far East Asian region.

TI  - Characteristics of subsurface chlorophyll maxima during the boreal summer in the South China Sea with respect to environmental properties
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a in the water column in each oceanic region is crucial for accurate assessment of depth-integrated phytoplankton biomass. In this study, the characteristics of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) in the South China Sea (SCS) during the boreal summer were investigated by using bio-optical and hydrological data collected during four cruises from 2008 to 2015. During the boreal summer, a well-developed SCM layer was found to be a prominent feature in the SCS, with the thickness, depth, and magnitude of the SCM exhibiting large spatial variability. The vertical position of the SCM varied between 11 and 99 m, with an average value of 53 m. Light attenuation played a fundamental role in determining the depth (Z(SCM)) and magnitude of the SCM (Chl(max)), as reflected by their relationships with the euphotic zone depth (Z(eu)). However, because significant positive correlations were found between Z(SCM) and the depth of potential density at 23 kg m(-3) (Z(sigma=23)), physical processes were inferred to be more important in modulating the fluctuation of Z(SCM), especially in open-ocean areas. Anticyclonic eddies, which act to deepen the nutricline by means of isopyncnal displacement, may play a role in aggravating nutrient limitation in the SCM layer, which leads to deepening of Z(SCM), weakening of Chl(max), and a fall in the total integrated chlorophyll a within the euphotic layer (Chl(intZeu)). Knowledge of ocean physical conditions and the variability of Z(SCM) should be taken into consideration to improve the accuracy of Chl(intZeu) estimates based on the surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl(surf)), especially when Chl(surf) is very low. Our assessment of SCM parameters provides the basis for a better understanding and quantification of their role in primary production estimation within the SCS.

TI  - Estimation of actual evapotranspiration and water stress in the Lijiang River Basin, China using a modified Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the simultaneous impacts of economic development and climate change, the Lijiang River Basin in China-the largest karst tourist attraction in the world-has experienced dramatic water shortages during the dry season. As actual evapotranspiration (ETa) plays a critical role in the water cycle, accurate estimation of ETa and water stress are important for sustainable water resources management. In this paper, we mapped the distribution of daily ETa using a modified Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model in combination with Landsat 8 images and assessed water stress using the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) during the dry season in the Lijiang River Basin. In general, the daily ETa simulated by the SSEBop model with aerodynamic resistance value of 110 s m(-1) was higher than that of satellite-based actual evapotranspiration products (i.e., MOD16A2 and Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML)_V2 actual evapotranspiration products in this study). Aerodynamic resistance plays a critical role in the estimation of energy fluxes in the SSEBop model and should be readjusted and calibrated with available datasets to improve the model's performance in estimating actual evapotranspiration for particular regions. Readjusted values between 20 and 35 s m(-1) of aerodynamic resistance produced reasonable agreement with satellite-based actual evapotranspiration products in the Lijiang River Basin. In addition, insufficient ground-level measurements of actual evapotranspiration might have increased the uncertainty of the SSEBop model's performance. The achievement of higher accuracy in the estimation of actual evapotranspiration and water availability will require establishing local flux towers, particularly in forested areas, to collect evapotranspiration, temperature and other in situ data. For different land-cover classes, forest areas exhibited the highest actual evapotranspiration, whereas farmland and built-up areas had the lowest actual evapotranspiration values compared to the other land-cover classes. All land-cover classes, especially farmland areas, experienced severe water stress. Inadequate precipitation as a result of climate change, combined with high actual evapotranspiration will result in less water being available for the Lijiang River Basin. Additional water is required to compensate for evapotranspiration and support plant growth in the Lijiang River Basin during the growing season.

TI  - A generative adversarial network with joint multistream architecture and spectral compensation for pansharpening
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and variational models for pansharpening have obtained a compelling performance gain over the state of the art. Inspired by these models, we propose MSCGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with joint multistream architecture and spectral compensation for pansharpening that uses a variational model to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and in particular, introduces a spectral compensation block. First, we extract the structural information of the panchromatic (PAN) image and input it into the generator together with the upsampled multispectral (MS) image. Then, we design a multistream pansharpening CNN architecture suite for domain-specific knowledge. Second, to boost the quality of the pansharpened images, we put the MS image in the generator and design a spectral compensation block. Then, we introduce the concept of the energy function of the variational model and add corresponding spectral constraints and spatial structure constraints to the objective function to achieve a compromise between spectral information fidelity and spatial information fidelity. Finally, the discriminator also introduces spatial structure information to help the generator generate the desired high-resolution multispectral image. Experiments on the images captured by the Quickbird and WorldView-2 satellites show that the our proposed MSCGAN can make use of PAN and LRMS images adequately to attain very encouraging results, obtaining large gains over the state of the art both visually and as measured by quality metrics.

TI  - Evaluation of the MODIS Collection 6.1 3 km aerosol optical depth product over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 3 km aerosol product was released to resolve fine aerosol features and provide regional high-resolution aerosol distributions required by the air quality community. It has been publicly available since the Collection 6 (C6) release. In the Collection 6.1 (C6.1) release, a new surface parameterization scheme has been introduced to improve the accuracy of retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) over urban surfaces, whereas few detailed evaluations have been conducted. In the present study, we comprehensively evaluated the MODIS C6.1 3 km (C6.1_3km) AOD product over China for the 2001-2017 period. The C6.1_3km product was validated against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data and compared with the C6 3 km (C6_3km) and C6.1 10 km (C6.1_10km) products. The spatial averaging technique was used to generate MODIS-AERONET collocations for C6_3km and C6.1_3km, whereas the single pixel collocation technique was used for comparing the C6.1_3km and C6.1_10km retrievals. Different collocation techniques were used because we found that the single pixel collocation technique was more suitable for evaluating aerosol products of different spatial resolutions over urban areas. Results indicated that the C6.1_3km product outperformed the C6_3km product over urban areas because of the new C6.1 surface parameterization scheme, while the upstream changes implemented in C6.1 have minor effects on the improvement. The C6.1_3km product showed a similar performance as compared to the C6.1_10km product, which indicated that the C6.1 surface scheme originally designed on a 10 km scale performed equally well at the 3 km spatial resolution. However, the evaluation statistics also indicated that an overestimation of AOD values over urban areas still existed in the C6.1_3km aerosol product. Therefore, refinement of the DT algorithm is required to further improve the C6.1_3km product for air quality studies over urban areas in China.

TI  - Cows as canaries: The effects of ambient air pollution exposure on milk production and somatic cell count in dairy cows
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to air pollution, including criteria pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3), has been associated with morbidity and mortality in mammals. As a genetically homogenous population that is closely monitored for health, dairy cattle present a unique opportunity to assess the association between changes in air pollution and mammalian health. Milk yield decreases in the summer if temperature and humidity, measured by the Temperature Humidity Index (THI). As O-3 levels increase with warmer temperatures, and summer PM2.5 may increase with wildfire smoke, dairy cows may serve as a useful sentinel species to evaluate subacute markers of inflammation and metabolic output and ambient pollution. Over two years, we assessed summertime O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations from local US EPA air quality monitors into an auto-regressive mixed model of the association between THI and daily milk production data and bulk tank somatic cell count (SCC). In unadjusted models, a 10 unit increase THI was associated with 28,700 cells/mL (95% CI: 17,700, 39,690) in-crease in SCC. After controlling for ambient air pollutants, THI was associated with a 14,500 SCC increase (95% CI: 3,400, 25,680), a 48% decrease in effect compared to the crude model. Further, in fully adjusted models, PM2.5 was associated with a 105,500 cells/mL (95% CI: 90,030, 121,050) increase in SCC. Similar results were found for milk production. Results were amplified when high PM2.5 days (95th percentile of observed values) associated with wildfire smoke were removed from the analyses. Our results support the hypothesis that PM2.5 confounds the relationships between THI and milk yield and somatic cell count. The results of this study can be used to inform strategies for intervention to mitigate these impacts at the dairy level and potentially contribute to a model where production animals can act as air quality sentinels.

TI  - Vegetation phenology in the Argentinean Wet Chaco: Assessing seasonality and precipitation dependence through NDVI MODIS time series (2000-2018)
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenology, that is, the timing of plant growth and development, is sensitive to climate and land-use changes. Despite its importance in the context of global change, little is known about the plant phenology of subtropical regions. In the Argentinean Wet Chaco region, which is currently under high pressure due to land-use intensification, the phenology patterns of its natural land covers are remarkably understudied. This important aspect of vegetation functioning can be effectively monitored through indices based on satellite imagery, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Thus, in this work, we used the NDVI from MODIS imagery to analyse plant phenology in the Argentinean Wet Chaco and discuss its implications in the current context of global change. NDVI time series were analysed for the period 2000-2018 for the following plant categories: riparian forest, forest islet, dense and open palm savanna and flooding grassland. Their seasonality and precipitation marginal response (PMR) were also assessed. The riparian forest presented the highest NDVI annual mean values and lowest PMR, followed by the forest islet. The flooding grassland presented the highest seasonality and palm savannas the highest precipitation dependence, with even higher PMR values in drier years. Climate change models predict an increase in precipitation in the region. If this occurs, palm savannas and flooding grasslands could present a more stable phenology. This would imply better conditions for cattle grazing and would, thus, reinforce the current land-use pressure. On the contrary, this increase in precipitation would not have an impact over the photosynthetic activity of both types of forest, since our results suggest that this parameter is not limited by rainfall. In the current context of climate change and land-use intensification, the results obtained provide key knowledge for a better use, management and conservation of the environments of the Argentinean Wet Chaco. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Observing the pre-convective environment and convection initiation with Doppler Lidar and cloud radar in the Al Hajar Mountains of the United Arab Emirates
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present multi-season measurements from a remote mountain peak observatory in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). During the campaign, Doppler lidar and cloud radar were employed using coordinated scan patterns, to study seedable convective clouds, and identify pre-convection initiation clear-air signatures. The instruments were employed for approximately two years in an extreme environment with a high vantage point for observing valley wind f ows and convective cells. The instruments were conf gured to run synchronized plan position indicator (PPI) scans at 0 degrees, 5 degrees, and 45 degrees elevation angles and vertical cross-section range height indicator (RHI) scans at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, and 150 degrees azimuth angles. Using this output imagery, along with local C-band radar and satellite data, we were able to identify and analyse several convective cases. To illustrate this synergy of measurements, we present two cases in unstable conditions - the 5 and 6 September 2018. In both cases, we observed areas of convergence/divergence to the south-west of the observatory, associated with wind f ow around a peak 2 km to the south-west. The extension of these deformations were visible in the atmosphere as high as 3 km above sea level. Subsequently, we observed convective cells developing in the same directions - apparently connected with these phenomena. The cloud radar Doppler images provided detailed observations of cloud hydrometeor dynamics. In both convective cases, pre-convective signatures were apparent before CI, in the form of convergence, wind shear structures, and updrafts. These results demonstrate the potential of these synergetic observations for understanding convection initiation processes and in the future, to provide cloud seeding guidance via early detection of CI events.

TI  - A deep learning method for cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms prediction in Taihu Lake, China
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial Harmful Algae Blooms (CyanoHABs) in the eutrophic lakes have become a global environmental and ecological problem. In this study, a CNN-LSTM integrated model for predicting the CyanoHABs area was proposed and applied to the prediction of the CyanoHABs area in Taihu Lake. Firstly, the time-series data of the CyanoHABs area in Taihu Lake for 20 years were accurately obtained using MODIS images from 2000 to 2019 based on the FAI method. Then, a principal component analysis was performed on the daily meteorological data for the month before the outbreak of CyanoHABs in Taihu Lake from 2000 to 2019 to determine the meteorological factors closely related to the outbreak of CyanoHABs. Finally, the features of CyanoHABs area and meteorological data were extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model and used as the input of Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). An integrated CNN-LSTM model approach was constructed for predicting the CyanoHABs area. The results show that high R-2 (0.91) and low mean relative error (17.42%) verified the validity of the FAI index to extract the CyanoHABs area in Taihu Lake; the meteorological factors closely related to the CyanoHABs outbreak in Taihu Lake are mainly temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation; the CNN-LSTM integrated model has better prediction effect for both training and test sets compared with the CNN and LSTM models. This study provides an effective method for predicting temporal changes in the CyanoHABs area and offers new ideas for scientific and effective regulation of inland water safety.

TI  - Double-scale analysis on the detectability of irrigation signals from remote sensing soil moisture over an area with complex topography in central Italy
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite a detailed knowledge of the spatial-temporal dynamics of irrigation being necessary to optimize the agricultural production without exacerbating the pressure exercised on the water resource, such information is still often lacking worldwide. In this study, a double-scale analysis on the detectability of the irrigation occurrence over an area in central Italy through remote sensing soil moisture is proposed; the period of interest is a 3-year time span from 2017 to 2019. The detectability of district- or sub-district-scale irrigation signals through remotely sensed soil moisture data is investigated at two different spatial resolutions: 1 km and plot scale. Three soil moisture products sampled at 1 km resolution are evaluated: a DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) downscaled version of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and two Sentinel-1-derived products, namely the 1 km version delivered by Copernicus and a plot-scale-born version developed by THEIA and aggregated at 1 km. The THEIA Sentinel-1 product aggregated at 100 m is used in the plot-scale analysis. Over the study area, the irrigation extent is determined by the fragmentation of the agricultural fields and the complex topography, making the adoption of plot-scale data necessary. Satisfactory results are obtained by comparing maps of irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution produced through the k-means clustering algorithm with ground-truth data, since the method fails only once out of seven in properly reproducing the irrigated or non-irrigated conditions occurred over four pilot agricultural fields.

TI  - Crop-type mapping and acreage estimation in smallholding plots using Sentinel-2 images and machine learning algorithms: Some comparisons
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop acreage analysis and yield estimation are of prime importance in field-level agricultural monitoring and management. This enables prudent decision making during any crop failure event and for ensuing crop insurance. The free availability of the high resolution Sentinel-2 satellite datasets has created new possibilities for mapping and monitoring agricultural lands in this regard. In the present study conducted on the Tamluk Subdivision of the Purba Medinipur District of West Bengal, the heterogeneous crop area was mapped according to the respective crop type, using Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images and two machine learning algorithms-K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). Plot-level field information was collected from different cropland types to frame the training and validation datasets (comprising 70% and 30% of the total dataset, respectively) for cropland classification and accuracy assessment. Through this, the major summer crop acreage was identified (Boro rice, vegetables and betel vine-the three main crops in the study area). The extracted maps had an overall accuracy of 97.16% and 97.22%, respectively, in the KNN and RF classifications, with respective Kappa index values of 95.99% and 96.08%, and the RF method proved to be more accurate. This study was particularly useful in mapping the betel leaf acreage herein since scant information exists for this crop and it is cultivated by many smallholder farmers in the region. The methods used in this paper can be readily applied elsewhere for accurately enumerating the respective crop acreages.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithm: A Case Study Along Karakoram Highway (KKH), Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-Pakistan Karakoram Highway links China to South Asia and the Middle East through Pakistan. Rockfall and debris flows are dangerous geological risks on the main route, and they often disrupt traffic and result in fatalities. As a result, the landslide susceptibility map (LSM) evolution along the highway could make it safer to drive. In this article, remote sensing data are combined with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to develop the LSM. Initially, 274 landslide locations we determined and mapped in ArcGIS software and randomly divided into a ratio of 8/2. Secondly, ten landslide susceptibility factors were developed using satellite imagery and different topographical and geological maps. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value, was used to estimate the model's effectiveness. Our consequences showed that, for three models, the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models, as well as slope, elevation, and distance from the river parameters, had the maximum influence upon landslide sensitivity. Accordingly, the prediction rates are 83.5%, 82.7%, and 80.7% for RF, XGBoost, and KNN. Furthermore, the RF method has better efficiency as compared to other models on the base of AUC. Our findings show that all three machine learning algorithms positively impact, and the results may assist the highway's safe operations.

AB  - Information on urban expansion is a significant input in forecasting upcoming land cover and land use changes in a city. This study combines Landsat 8, night-time lights, and population data to assess urban expansion in Kimberley, South Africa from 2013 to 2018. This study used a post-classification change detection approach to measure urban expansion. Urban and non-urban land use classes where the two classes mapped and evaluated for this analysis. Overall, urban expansion from 2013 to 2018 was 15% while the annual urban expansion rate experienced was 0.6%. Night-time lights, calculated from satellite imagery, are increasingly used by social scientists as a proxy for economic activity or economic development. During the period of 2013 to 2018, both the urban night-time lights and the urban population experienced high rates of growth. This study obtained a positive correlation for night-time light and population datasets of 0.51 for 2013 and 0.57 for 2018, to suggest a positive population and lighting increase in the study area. Municipal authorities and policymakers may use this knowledge as feedback during urban and environmental planning.

TI  - Mapping native and non-native vegetation in the Brazilian Cerrado using freely available satellite products
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Native vegetation across the Brazilian Cerrado is highly heterogeneous and biodiverse and provides important ecosystem services, including carbon and water balance regulation, however, land-use changes have been extensive. Conservation and restoration of native vegetation is essential and could be facilitated by detailed landcover maps. Here, across a large case study region in Goias State, Brazil (1.1 Mha), we produced physiognomy level maps of native vegetation (n = 8) and other landcover types (n = 5). Seven different classification schemes using different combinations of input satellite imagery were used, with a Random Forest classifier and 2-stage approach implemented within Google Earth Engine. Overall classification accuracies ranged from 88.6-92.6% for native and non-native vegetation at the formation level (stage-1), and 70.7-77.9% for native vegetation at the physiognomy level (stage-2), across the seven different classifications schemes. The differences in classification accuracy resulting from varying the input imagery combination and quality control procedures used were small. However, a combination of seasonal Sentinel-1 (C-band synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (surface reflectance) imagery resulted in the most accurate classification at a spatial resolution of 20 m. Classification accuracies when using Landsat-8 imagery were marginally lower, but still reasonable. Quality control procedures that account for vegetation burning when selecting vegetation reference data may also improve classification accuracy for some native vegetation types. Detailed landcover maps, produced using freely available satellite imagery and upscalable techniques, will be important tools for understanding vegetation functioning at the landscape scale and for implementing restoration projects.

TI  - Storm surge damage interpretation by satellite imagery: case review
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Review
AB  - Rapid response and restoration after storm surge events are critical for the resilient development of coastal areas. Remote sensing has become a practical tool for postdisaster impact assessment since the modern satellite era. This paper presents the methodology and case review of damage detection using high-resolution satellite imagery for vulnerable targets with limited accessibility on land or water during China's recent typhoon landfalls. Multiple sources of remotely sensed data are acquired and processed in a broad geographic scope. The study demonstrates how storm damage may be explicitly revealed by interpreting the texture difference or reflectance spectrum contrast for various target types, including flotation facilities, green vegetation, sandy coast and coastal protections. The damage state in the same area may show rapid variations in space due to local differences in the shielding effectiveness with respect to the storm track. The technical features, advantages, and drawbacks of remote sensing applications to marine disaster assessment are discussed from a future perspective. The study results provide a comprehensive reference to better integrate satellite observations into postdisaster surveys, vulnerability analyses, and risk predictions for coastal communities that will withstand future marine hazards.

TI  - Urban Heat Islands Significantly Reduced by COVID-19 Lockdown
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The significant reduction in human activities during COVID-19 lockdown is anticipated to substantially influence urban climates, especially urban heat islands (UHIs). However, the UHI variations during lockdown periods remain to be quantified. Based on the MODIS daily land surface temperature and the in-situ surface air temperature observations, we reveal a substantial decline in both surface and canopy UHIs over 300-plus megacities in China during lockdown periods compared with reference periods. The surface UHI intensity (UHII) is reduced by 0.25 (one S.D. = 0.22) K in the daytime and by 0.23 (0.20) K at night during lockdown periods. The reductions in canopy UHII reach 0.42 (one S.D. = 0.26) K in the daytime and 0.39 (0.29) K at night. These reductions are mainly due to the near-unprecedented drop in human activities induced by strict lockdown measures. Our results provide an improved understanding of the urban climate variations during the global pandemic.

T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Detection of Ionosphere Anomalies (DIA) software was developed and used for ionosphere research in the Institute of Space Technique and Technology of the National Center of Space Research and Technology (Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan). The software was designed for ionosphere anomalies detection, identification, and analysis from satellite spectral and wave data from scientific payloads installed on the DEME PLR (Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions) satellite. The main task of DIA software is to provide the researcher with a convenient package for detection and identification of the sources of electromagnetic radiation, variations of the ionic and electronic components of the ionosphere, and other ionosphere parameters from satellite data. Using this software, a complex research of the state of the medium-latitude ionosphere during a geomagnetic storm on 20 January 2010 was done. Electric and magnetic components of the field in ultralow frequency (ULF), extremely low frequency (ELF), and very low frequency (VLF) bands are processed and analyzed, as well as temperature, velocity, and density of ionic and electronic plasma components and fluxes of energetic electrons at satellite altitude during a storm.

TI  - MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification of mosquitoes collected in Vietnam
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a tool that has revolutionised clinical microbiology and has recently been described as an innovative and effective approach to arthropod identification.Methods: In this study, mosquitoes were captured in Vietnam using four different methods (human landing catch, CDC light traps, BG-Sentinel traps, animal-baited net traps). A total of 4215 mosquitoes were captured and morphologically identified as belonging to three genera: Aedes, Anopheles and Culex. We randomly selected 1253 mosquitoes, including 662 specimens of 14 Anopheles species, 200 specimens of two Aedes species and 391 morphologically unidentified Culex specimens, for molecular and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The DNA from 98 mosquitoes (69 Anopheles specimens, 23 Culex specimens and six Aedes sp. specimens) was subjected to molecular analysis, either to confirm our morphological identification or the MALDI-TOF MS results, as well as to identify the Culex species that were morphologically identified at the genus level and to resolve the discrepancies between the morphological identification and the MALDI-TOF MS identification.Results: High-quality MS spectra were obtained for 1058 of the 1253 specimens (84%), including 192/200 for Aedes, 589/662 for Anopheles and 277/391 for Culex. The blind test showed that 986/997 (99%) of the specimens were correctly identified by MALDI-TOF MS, with log score values ranging from 1.708 to 2.843. Eleven specimens of Culex could not be identified based on morphological features, MALDI-TOF MS or molecular analysis.Conclusions: This study enabled us to identify several species of mosquitoes from Vietnam using MALDI-TOF MS, and to enrich our database of MALDI-TOF MS reference spectra.

Existing methods for bathymetry mapping require intensive and costly field surveys or targeted aerial captures, neither of which are easily or affordably replicated for repeat mapping and change monitoring. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), however, offers the potential to map shallow water bodies repeatedly and efficiently with high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., daily-weekly at 5 m or better). One challenge to large-scale implementation of SDB lies in the automated derivation of inherent water column properties such that they may be accurately compensated for across a variety of depth and substrate conditions. Here we present an algorithm that leverages WorldView (Maxar/Digital Globe (TM)) satellite imagery to map the entire 3700 km(2) Florida Keys (USA) island chain at 2-meter resolution without the need for any in-situ data collections. Preprocessing included radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, automated deglinting, and automated detection of optically deep water, which was then used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration assuming that the study area is primarily comprised of Case-I water (i.e., those where the optical signal is dominated by water, Chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton, and properties that vary in proportion to Chlorophyll-a concentration). Estimating Chlorophyll-a concentration allowed us to calculate the appropriate tuning coefficients used in a spectral band ratio equation for estimating bathymetry. The entire process was fully automated from ingestion of Level-1B image to bathymetry raster output. Mapping the Florida Keys from Key Largo to Key West required 34 WorldView images and was completed in approximately 27 min for an average processing time of 47 s per image using a single GPU core (i.e., supercomputing resources were not needed). After combining the products (mosaicking) in ArcMap, the wall-to-wall bathymetry map was validated against a LiDAR-derived bathymetry model with over 600,000 points; results show an RMSE of 1.95 m over depths from 0 to 15 m.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) are a highly specialized wetland obligate bird. They are a species at risk in Canada and very little is known about their abundance in the wetlands of the western boreal forest. Emerging technologies have enabled us to effectively survey for Yellow Rail and other wetland birds in remote areas by using ground-based remote sensors (autonomous recording units; ARUs) to conduct passive acoustic monitoring. We analyzed bird data from the first four years (2013-2016) of an ongoing monitoring program led by the Bioacoustic Unit at the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute. We developed species abundance models using satellite data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 processed in Google Earth Engine. We identified covariates from both synthetic aperture radar and optical remote sensing that had strong predictive capacity for this wetland bird (AUC = 0.96). Approximately 1.5% of available wetland habitat in our northeast Alberta study area was predicted to be highly suitable for Yellow Rail.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Variability of phytoplankton in the Caspian Sea (CS) is related to the complex orography, the variety of physical and chemical processes, and climatic indices. Here, interannual and intra-annual variability of satellite-derived chlorophyll -a concentrations (Chl-a) were studied using wavelet analysis during 2002-2019 in different regions of the CS. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analysis performed to classify the CS into the areas of similar variability of satellite-derived Chl-a. Wavelet spectral analysis showed that the Chl-a variability regulated by four primary periodic cycles: 0.5-year, 1-year, 2 to 2.5-year, and 3 to 5-year. The 0.5 and 1-year wavelet cycles mostly depicted the intensity of seasonality patterns. The 2-2.5-year and 3-5-year cycles of Chl-a showed non-stationary coherence with corresponding low-frequency cycles of NAO and ENSO. The 3-5-year wavelet amplitudes of Chl-a strongly correlated with NAO and ENSO in the southern CS. Weak correlations of 2-2.5-year cycle wavelet amplitudes of Chl-a with NAO and ENSO suggested that variations do not always directly translate to a biological response. A negative anomaly in the Chl-a autumn peaks observed during 2011-2016 in the middle and southern CS, when NAO phases were persistently positive. The interannual variations of summer peaks in the northern CS, and autumn peaks in the middle and southern CS were broadly related to the precipitation. SST and wind stress. Moreover, it was shown that the Volga discharge has a significant influence on Chl-a variability in the northern CS. (c) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The rate of transformation of natural land use land cover (LULC) to the built-up areas is very high in the peri-urban areas of Indian metropolitan cities. Delhi National Capital Region (Delhi NCR) is an inter-state planning region, located in the central part of India. The region has attracted a larger chunk of population by providing better economic opportunities during last few decades. This has resulted in large-scale transformation of the LULC pattern in the region. Thus, this study is intended to analyze and quantify the LULC change and its drivers in the peri-urban areas of Delhi NCR using Landsat datasets. Based on an extensive literature survey, several potential drivers of the LULC change have been analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographical weighted regression (GWR) for the Delhi NCR. The results from LULC classification showed that the built-up area has increased from 1.67 to 7.12% of the total area of Delhi NCR during 1990-2018 while other LULC types have declined significantly. The OLS results showed that migration and employment in the tertiary sector are the most important drivers of built-up expansion in the study area. The standard residuals and local R-2 results from GWR showed spatial heterogeneity among the coefficients of the explanatory variables throughout the study area. This study can be helpful for the urban policy makers and planners for making better master plan of Delhi NCR and other cities of developing countries.

TI  - Retrieval of Simultaneous Water-Level Changes in Small Lakes With InSAR
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water level changes is necessary to manage, conserve and restore natural, and anthropogenic lake systems. However, the in-situ monitoring of lake systems is unfeasible due to limitations of costs and access. Furthermore, current remote sensing methods are restricted to large lakes and low spatial resolutions. We develop a novel approach using subsequential pixel-wise observations of the Sentinel-1B sensor based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar to detect water level changes in small lakes. We used 24 small ungauged lakes of the Cajas Massif lake system in Ecuador for development and validation. We found Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR)-derived water level changes across lakes to be consistent with precipitation, capturing the peak of the wet seasons. Furthermore, accumulated water level changes could be explained by differences in lake area among lakes. Although with limitations, this study shows the underutilized potential of DInSAR to understand water level changes in small lakes with current radar data availability.

TI  - Sector-Based Top-Down Estimates of NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO Emissions in East Asia
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Top-down estimates using satellite data provide important information on the sources of air pollutants. We develop a sector-based 4D-Var framework based on the GEOS-Chem adjoint model to address the impacts of co-emissions and chemical interactions on top-down emission estimates. We apply OMI NO2, OMI SO2, and MOPITT CO observations to estimate NOx, SO2, and CO emissions in East Asia during 2005-2012. Posterior evaluations with surface measurements show reduced normalized mean bias (NMB) by 7% (NO2)-15% (SO2) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) by 8% (SO2)-9% (NO2) compared to a species-based inversion. This new inversion captures the peak years of Chinese SO2 (2007) and NOx (2011) emissions and attributes their drivers to industry and energy activities. The CO peak in 2007 in China is driven by residential and industry emissions. In India, the inversion attributes NOx and SO2 trends mostly to energy and CO trend to residential emissions.Plain Language Summary Satellite observations are widely used to estimate air pollutant emissions and evaluate their trends. We design a new method based on Bayesian statistics to estimate emissions of major air pollutants in East Asia according to their sources (e.g., energy, industry, transportation, etc.). Results from this approach show better agreement with independent surface measurements than the previous estimates that use observations to optimize emissions by species and estimates that compile emissions using activity data and emission factors. This method provides a new perspective to analyze the trend of air pollutants by sources and is crucial for countries and regions that lack detailed and timely emission estimates for each source sector.

TI  - Attitudes in the US Toward Hormonal and/or Surgical Interventions for Adolescents Experiencing Gender Dysphoria
T2  - ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to align with their inner sense of gender identity, adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria are increasingly being treated with cross-sex hormones and irreversible surgeries to alter their bodies. The present study is the first to examine attitudes about these recently emergent medical practices in a national population. We used data from the 2018 Post-Midterm Election Study, a survey representative of adults in the USA ages 20 to 65 years (N = 5285), to examine the social factors associated with approval or disapproval of hormonal and/or surgical interventions for adolescents seeking medical treatment for gender dysphoria. Higher fertility, race/ethnicity (in this case, black), sex (male), and heterosexual self-identity were each robustly associated with disapproval. Nested regression models revealed that a range of religion measures were statistically significant (toward disapproval). However, all but evangelical self-identification were no longer significant after accounting for support for abortion rights, the spectrum of political self-identification, and voting behavior. These findings, prompted by a high percentage of variance explained, led us to consider perspectives on medical transitions for adolescents as fitting the "culture war" framework, largely polarized between a "progressive" worldview of bodily autonomy and an "orthodox" worldview of bodily integrity.

TI  - Detection of Expanded Reformed Geographical Area in Bi-temporal Multispectral Satellite Images Using Machine Intelligence Neural Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of changes using bi-temporal multispectral images is an important processing tool and widely used to predict changes over the earth's surface and for various applications in agricultural and environmental monitoring, natural hazards assessment, urban drafting, and map redrafting. All the traditional methods used to detect changes are not realistic to predict real changes. Therefore, finding actual changes in satellite images is still a challenging task. In the solution, the real changes occurring on the Earth's surface are being explored using artificial intelligence techniques. To complete this challenging task, we recommend a novel machine intelligence learning model based on terrestrial prediction for multispectral satellite image change detection. The main objective of our algorithm is to discover the changes without any additional computations, which has the maximum learning characteristics from bi-temporal satellite images. Machine intelligence learning model has been trained with seven transposed features of training data set and used to predict for bi-temporal image target data set and ultimately obtained good quality difference image. The accuracy of the designed machine intelligence learning model is obtained 99.94% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.9985. The water expanded reformed geographical area near Poyang Lake is calculated with 1749.918628 km(2). Due to the sudden rise of water, there was a lot of damage near Poyang Lake, which can be estimated from the enlarged water area. Such a good accuracy has been obtained from the proposed method, which is much better than other previous methods. This proposed method can be applied to correctly estimate any unexpected damage or change.

TI  - Springtime Stratospheric Volcanic Aerosol Impact on Midlatitude Cirrus Clouds
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Explosive volcanic eruptions can reach the stratosphere and cause elevated concentrations of sulphate particles for months to years. When these particles descend into the troposphere, they can impact cirrus clouds though to what degree is unknown. In this study, we combine three satellite data sets to investigate the impact of downwelling sulphate aerosol on midlatitude cirrus clouds during springtime. The results show that cirrus clouds in the northern hemisphere (NH) have lower ice water content (IWC), ice crystal number concentrations, and cloud fraction (CF) when the aerosol load in the lowermost stratosphere is elevated by volcanism. These changes are largest for the coldest clouds at the highest altitudes. The cirrus clouds in the southern hemisphere on the other hand show no significant changes with downwelling aerosol levels. The reduction in cirrus IWC and CF in the NH implies that volcanic aerosol can cool the climate through reduced warming from cirrus clouds.

TI  - Resolving temperature limitation on spring productivity in an evergreen conifer forest using a model-data fusion framework
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The flow of carbon through terrestrial ecosystems and the response to climate are critical but highly uncertain processes in the global carbon cycle. However, with a rapidly expanding array of in situ and satellite data, there is an opportunity to improve our mechanistic understanding of the carbon (C) cycle's response to land use and climate change. Uncertainty in temperature limitation on productivity poses a significant challenge to predicting the response of ecosystem carbon fluxes to a changing climate. Here we diagnose and quantitatively resolve environmental limitations on the growing-season onset of gross primary production (GPP) using nearly 2 decades of meteorological and C flux data (2000-2018) at a subalpine evergreen forest in Colorado, USA. We implement the CARbon DAta-MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM) model-data fusion network to resolve the temperature sensitivity of spring GPP. To capture a GPP temperature limitation - a critical component of the integrated sensitivity of GPP to temperature - we introduced a cold-temperature scaling function in CARDAMOM to reg- ulate photosynthetic productivity. We found that GPP was gradually inhibited at temperatures below 6.0 degrees C (+/- 2.6 degrees C) and completely inhibited below -7.1 degrees C (+/- 1.1 degrees C). The addition of this scaling factor improved the model's ability to replicate spring GPP at interannual and decadal timescales (r = 0.88), relative to the nominal CARDAMOM configuration (r = 0.47), and improved spring GPP model predictability outside of the data assimilation training period (r = 0.88). While cold-temperature limitation has an important influence on spring GPP, it does not have a significant impact on integrated growing-season GPP, revealing that other environmental controls, such as precipitation, play a more important role in annual productivity. This study highlights growing-season onset temperature as a key limiting factor for spring growth in winter-dormant evergreen forests, which is critical in understanding future responses to climate change.

TI  - Dynamics of the alpine timberline and its response to climate change in the Hengduan mountains over the period 1985-2015
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal change in the alpine timberline, an ecosystem ecotone, is an ideal indicator for use in climate change research. In order to gain a quantitative understanding of the response of the alpine timberline to climate change, the Hengduan Mountains region of China was selected as a study area and a series of 136 Landsat images covering this area that were acquired in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015 were collected. First, the alpine timberline was retrieved and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the timberline were explored. The effect of topography on the location of the alpine timberline was also analyzed. The results indicate that the average elevation of the timberline increased by about 55 (+/- 8.54) m from 3992.58 m in 1985 to 4047.60 m in 2015; however, there was obvious spatial heterogeneity in these changes. On the whole, the average elevation of the timberline on shaded slopes (northern, northeastern, and northwestern slopes) were found to be about 160 m higher than on sunward slopes (southern, southeastern, and southwestern slopes). It was also found that, over the period 1985-2015, there has been an obvious acceleration in the upward tendency of the alpine timberline. Finally, the climate variables that are driving this timberline shift were identified and evaluated using the partial least squares (PLS) regression method. The results indicate that the average annual temperature (TEM_Year), total precipitation during the growing season (PRE_Grow), and growing season temperature (TEM_Grow) were the significant positive factors driving the rise in the timberline elevation; the total annual precipitation (PRE_Year) was found to have an unexpected negative influence. Besides, other climatic factors (e.g., strong winds) and non-climate variables (e.g., human influence and soil properties) should be also included in future related studies to enhance the understanding of the link between forest vegetation and climate change under extreme conditions.

TI  - Quantifying water storage within the north of Lake Naivasha using sonar remote sensing and Landsat satellite data
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Endorheic freshwater lakes can be vital water resources for sustaining large populations. However, their land-locked nature can lead to overexploitation and long-term sediment accumulation, reducing water storage and quality. Lake Naivasha supports a rapidly expanding population and agricultural industry. Therefore, maintaining good water storage and quality within this endorheic lake is crucial for the Kenyan economy and population. The lake has a long history of level fluctuations and the region is considered to be suffering from a chronic imbalance between water supply and demand.This study quantifies the sediment deposition rate and its impact on Lake Naivasha's water levels and volume, using inexpensive remote sensing techniques that could be easily replicated for future monitoring.Evidence of sedimentation in the northern area averaging 23 mm yr(-1) was identified, which is likely annually displacing between 40.2 - 576 x10(3) m(3) of water. The volume displaced each year is equivalent to the water required to sustain between 40 - 1152 people. These results imply that current abstraction management, based purely upon lake level readings that govern a 'traffic lights' system, are detrimental to the long-term survival of the lake. The results also imply that lake health is decreasing. We recommend that future monitoring of this water resource and all endorheic lakes consider measurements of available water volume in combination with lake level data using the remote sensing methods we describe.

TI  - Improving the Estimate of Summer Daytime Planetary Boundary Layer Height Over Land From GPS radio Occultation Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation measurements have been widely used to estimate global planetary boundary layer heights (H) using the minimum refractivity gradient method. This method is directly tested here using radiosonde data in China and is found to overestimate summer daytime H over land primarily in the presence of multi-inversions in the lower troposphere. This deficiency is largely reduced by adding a constraint with lifting condensation level (LCL) in the derivation of H, particularly for LCL < 2 km (usually over humid regions). The primary reason is that our new method effectively avoids estimating H near the strong inversion corresponding to the minimum refractivity gradient in the free atmosphere. Applying our new method to the GPS radio occultation data, with LCL derived from surface automatic weather stations, yields more reasonable daytime variation and spatial distribution of H over land in China as compared to the ERAS reanalysis and radiosonde data.Plain Language Summary The radio signals from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites have been widely used to estimate global planetary boundary layer heights (H) by computing the minimum refractivity variation with height. This method is directly tested here using radiosonde data in China and is found to overestimate summer daytime H over land primarily in the presence of multi-inversions (where air temperature increases with height) in the lower troposphere. We use a new method to largely reduce this deficiency by combining the original method with lifting condensation level (LCL) in the derivation of H, particularly for LCL < 2 km (usually over humid regions). LCL is the level at which a parcel becomes saturated, representing a reasonable estimate of cloud base height. Our new method effectively avoids the misidentification of H near the top of deep clouds. We then apply our method to the GPS satellite data, with LCL derived from surface automatic weather stations. The new results show more reasonable daytime variation and spatial distribution of H over land in China as compared to the radiosonde observations and ERA5 reanalysis that makes consistent use of observational data from surface, aircraft, and satellite measurements.

TI  - Deriving Tidal Flat Topography Using ICESat-2 Laser Altimetry and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring accurate and timely datasets on tidal flat topography is fundamental for studies, management, and policy-making in coastal zones. In this study, we report a fusion method of freely accessed and global-scale Sentinel-2 (imagery) and Ice,Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) (laser altimetry) datasets for deriving tidal flat topography. The basic idea is to construct a model on characterizing the specific relationship between the elevations of the tidal flat (from ICESat-2 data) and corresponding inundation frequencies (from Sentinel-2 time-series). The proposed method was validated for the largest tidal flat on the Chinese continental shelf with a root mean square error of 0.23 m. We highlight that this method solely relies on satellite data and does not require any in-situ data because ICESat-2 provides dense and accurate along-track points as valuable prior elevation information, which enhance the ability to obtain tidal flat topography in many coastal regions even in the absence of local in-situ data.

TI  - Distributions of Heavy Metals in Rice and Corn and Their Health Risk Assessment in Guizhou Province
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term exposure to heavy metals from high geological background area may lead to varieties of diseases. Therefore, risk assessment from agricultural products in these areas was crucial to ensure the health of customers. However, the effects of geological background on distributions of heavy metals and their accumulation in plant remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the distributions of mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) in 1036 corn and rice samples collected from 9 locations in Guizhou province and to evaluate their health risks. The concentrations of Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cr and Cu in these two crops were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and their health risk were estimated by the target risk quotient approaches. Results showed that the mean concentrations of Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cr and Cu in corn and rice were 0.01, 0.07, 0.06, 0.27, 0.56 and 1.86 mg/kg which were lower than their respective maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) of 0.02, 0.20, 0.70, 0.20, 0.50 and 10.00 mg/kg except Pb and Cr. The concentrations of Cr and Cu in corn were higher than in rice while Cd, As and Pb in rice were higher than in corn. Moreover, the distributions of Hg, Cd and Cu in corn and rice samples were mainly observed from QDN located at southeast of Guizhou province while Pb, As and Cr were most detected at ZY, QXN and BJ areas, southwest zone. The hazard indices (HIs) values for corn and rice were 0.20 and 2.61. The high HIs (> 1) in rice indicated that the health risk of heavy metals in rice was relatively high and Pb was the major component that attributed to the risk, followed by Cd. These results could provide a reference for the distributions of heavy metals in agricultural products in Guizhou province under crop cultivation conditions, and to provide scientific basis for health risk assessment and ensure food safety.

TI  - Statistical validation of Aeolus L2A particle backscatter coefficient retrievals over ACTRIS/EARLINET stations on the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Observing System (GOS) has encountered some limitations due to a lack of worldwide real-time wind measurements. In this context, the European Space Agency (ESA) has developed the Aeolus satellite mission, based on the ALADIN (Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument) Doppler wind lidar; this mission aims to obtain near-real-time wind retrievals at the global scale. As spin-off products, the instrument retrieves aerosol optical properties such as particle backscatter and extinction coefficients. In this work, a validation of Aeolus reprocessed (baseline 10) co-polar backscatter coefficients (beta(part)(Aeolus)) is presented through an intercomparison with analogous ground-based measurements taken at the ACTRIS (Aerosols, Clouds and Trace gases Research InfraStructure Network)/EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) stations of Granada (Spain), Evora (Portugal) and Barcelona (Spain) over the period from July 2019 until October 2020. Case studies are first presented, followed by a statistical analysis. The stations are located in a hot spot between Africa and the rest of Europe, which guarantees a variety of aerosol types, from mineral dust layers to continental/anthropogenic aerosol, and allows us to test Aeolus performance under different scenarios. The so called Aeolus-like profiles (beta(part)(Aeolus) (like, 355)) are obtained from total particle backscatter coefficient and linear particle depolarization art ratio (delta(part)(linear)) profiles at 355 and 532 nm measured from the surface, through a thorough bibliographic review of dual-polarization measurements for relevant aerosol types. Finally, the study proposes a relation for the spectral conversion of delta(part)(linear), which is implemented in the Aeolus-like profile calculation. The statistical results show the ability of the satellite to detect and characterize significant aerosol layers under cloud-free conditions, along with the surface effect on the lowermost measurements, which causes the satellite to largely overestimate copolar backscatter coefficients. Finally, the Aeolus standard correct algorithm middle bin (SCAmb) shows a better agreement with ground-based measurements than the standard correct algorithm (SCA), which tends to retrieve negative and meaningless coefficients in the clear troposphere. The implementation of Aeolus quality flags entails a vast reduction in the number of measurements available for comparison, which affects the statistical significance of the results.

TI  - A High-Resolution Whole-Atmosphere Model With Resolved Gravity Waves and Specified Large-Scale Dynamics in the Troposphere and Stratosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new version of the HIgh Altitude Mechanistic general Circulation Model (HIAMCM) with specified dynamics. We utilize a spectral method that nudges only the large-scale flow to MERRA-2 reanalysis. The nudged HIAMCM simulates gravity waves (GWs) down to horizontal wavelengths of about 200 km from the troposphere to the thermosphere like the free-running model, including the generation of secondary and tertiary GWs. Case studies show that the simulated large-scale GWs are consistent with those in the reanalysis, while the medium-scale GWs compare well with observations in the northern winter 2016 stratosphere from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS). GWs having wavelengths larger than about 1,350 km can be described with the nonlinear balance equation. The GWs relevant in the stratosphere, however, have smaller scales and require a different approach. We propose that the GW amplification due to kinetic energy transfer from the large-scale flow combined with GW potential energy flux convergence helps to identify the mesoscale GW sources due to spontaneous emission. The GW amplification is strongest in the region of maximum large-scale vertical wind shear in the mid-stratosphere. Maps of the time-averaged stratospheric GW activity simulated by the HIAMCM and computed from AIRS satellite data show a persistent hot spot over Europe during January 2016. At about 40 km, the average GW amplitudes are maximum in the region of fastest large-scale flow. We argue that refraction of GWs originating in the troposphere, as well as GWs from spontaneous emission in the stratosphere contribute to this effect.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: An Integrated Approach using Geographic Information Value, Remote Sensing, and Weight of Evidence Method
T2  - GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide events cause significant financial losses, human casualties, and irreversible changes in the natural landscape. In this paper, we have addressed the mapping of landslides zones using the extracted Cartosat-1 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a knowledge-based numerical rating system. The main objective of the study is to use the Weight of Evidence (WoE) technique to produce a Landslide Hazards Zonation (LHZ) map and a Landslide Susceptible Map (LSM) to establish a relationship between landslide causality factors and past landslide locations. For the prediction and generation of the LSM, accurate DEM is extracted using the noise-free stereo images of the Cartosat-1 sensor. This research proposed a prediction model for landslide susceptibility mapping based on the combination of a knowledge-based numerical rating system, remote sensing, and the WoE technique. The WoE technique and information value method are used to calculate the weightage and ranking of each landslide causality factor. The sum of the landslide causality factor products calculates the Landslide Susceptible Index (LSI) value for every pixel. The area under concern was classified into five susceptibility classes based on the derived LSI, ranging from very low to scars. The overall prediction and forecast accuracy of the LSM generated using the WoE technique is 92.68%.

TI  - Breast MRI in patients after breast conserving surgery with sentinel node procedure using a superparamagnetic tracer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY EXPERIMENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A procedure for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using superparamagnetic iron-oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles and intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection was developed to overcome drawbacks associated with the current standard-of-care SLNB. However, residual SPIO nanoparticles can result in void artefacts at follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We present a grading protocol to quantitatively assess the severity of these artefacts and offer an option to minimise the impact of SPIO nanoparticles on diagnostic imaging. Methods Follow-up mammography and MRI of two patient groups after a magnetic SLNB were included in the study. They received a 2-mL subareolar dose of SPIO (high-dose, HD) or a 0.1-mL intratumoural dose of SPIO (low-dose, LD). Follow-up mammography and MRI after magnetic SLNB were acquired within 4 years after breast conserving surgery (BCS). Two radiologists with over 10-year experience in breast imaging assessed the images and analysed the void artefacts and their impact on diagnostic follow-up. Results A total of 19 patients were included (HD, n = 13; LD, n = 6). In the HD group, 9/13 patients displayed an artefact on T1-weighted images up to 3.6 years after the procedure, while no impact of the SPIO remnants was observed in the LD group. Conclusions SLNB using a 2-mL subareolar dose of magnetic tracer in patients undergoing BCS resulted in residual artefacts in the breast in the majority of patients, which may hamper follow-up MRI. This can be avoided by using a 0.1-mL intratumoural dose.

TI  - Valproate prescription to women of childbearing age in English primary care: repeated cross-sectional analyses and retrospective cohort study
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Valproate is a teratogenic drug that should be avoided during the preconception period and pregnancy. The aim was to explore general practitioners' (GPs) prescription patterns over time, describe trends, and explore inter-practice variation within primary care. Methods We identified women of childbearing age (12-46 years old) in the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network. We performed repeated cross-sectional analyses from 2004 to 2018 to determine rates of prescription and a retrospective cohort estimated the prevalence of use of valproate during pregnancy. Results In 2004, 0.31% (95% Confidence Interval (95%CI):0.18 to 0.44%) women were prescribed valproate, decreasing to 0.16% (95%CI:0.07 to 0.24%) by 2018. Among women with epilepsy, the rate fell from 15.2% (95%CI:14.4 to 16.0%) to 8.8% (95% CI:8.2 to 9.7%) over the same period. In 2018, almost two thirds (62.2%) of women who were prescribed valproate had epilepsy only, whereas bipolar disorder and migraine accounted for 15.8% and 7.4% respectively. Contraceptive prescriptions did not increase over time, and only in 2018 was there greater odds of being prescribed contraception (OR 1.41, 95%CI:1.08 to 1.45). Just under a fifth (19.7%) of women were prescribed valproate during their pregnancy; two out of three of these pregnancies were preceded by folic acid prescription (5 mg). While some practices reduced their rate of valproate prescription, others did not. Conclusions Regulatory guidelines have changed GPs' prescription patterns in women of childbearing potential for valproate but not for contraception. Further research is needed to identify the barriers of GPs and women of childbearing potential to undertaking contraception.

TI  - Is there any difference on cyanobacterial blooms patterns between Lake Chaohu and Lake Taihu over the last 20 years?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Serious cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) caused by lake eutrophication have become a global ecological and environmental problem and have adversely affected the production, life, and health of human beings. Lake Chaohu and Lake Taihu are two large closed shallow eutrophication lakes in the Yangtze River Delta in China with frequent CBs. In this study, the floating algae index (FAI) algorithm was applied to detect a long-time CBs sequence using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2000 to 2019. The common characteristics and differences of the CBs patterns were further explored in both lakes over the last 20 years. The results showed that the severity of CBs in Lakes Chaohu and Taihu presented a similar trend of decreasing and then increasing during the period of 2000-2004 and 2005-2007, respectively. Although the severity of CBs in the two lakes was alleviated after 2008, CBs in Lake Taihu has gradually increased since 2011 and severe CBs broke out again in 2017 and 2019. Meanwhile, the CBs in Lake Chaohu have varied significantly in different years, and severe CBs were observed in 2012, 2014-2015, and 2018-2019, while in other years, CBs remained relatively low level. The high-frequency regions of CBs were mainly concentrated in the western part in Lake Chaohu and in Zhushan Bay and Meilian Bay in Lake Taihu in the initial years of 2000. However, since 2005, the CBs in Lake Chaohu gradually expanded to the central and eastern parts, and to the northwestern and western shore in Lake Taihu. Furthermore, the relationship between the monthly mean area of CBs (CBs(mean)) and environmental factors based on principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that temperature was the most important driving factor affecting CBs patterns. Compared to the period from 2001 to 2007, TP played a more important role in both lakes from 2008 to 2019. Various management measures have been adopted to reduce CBs in both lakes and these methods can effectively remove cyanobacteria in a short time, but they do not change CBs patterns in the long period.

TI  - Estimation of high-resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations based on gap-filling aerosol optical depth using gradient boosting model
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) may affect people's health. At present, aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have been used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. However, AOD always has a low coverage rate. High-resolution products cannot provide a wide range of data. The purpose of this study was to deal with the missing data problem using the interpolation technique and to estimate high-resolution PM2.5 concentrations by fitting the spatial and temporal variations of AOD and PM2.5. Firstly, we developed a gradient boosting model (XGBoost) to fill in the missing values. Secondly, we corrected the altitude and humidity of meteorological variables. We then used the mixed-effects model with the gap-filling AOD data to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations in this study area. Finally, we obtained the complete PM2.5 concentrations picture. The AOD coverage rate reached 100% after model estimation. Meanwhile, the estimation results of PM2.5 concentrations were also validated and the model worked well. The results indicate that it is necessary to fill in the missing values of AOD data for PM2.5 estimations. This study can provide complete AOD data, which makes the results of PM2.5 estimations more accurate and has some research value.

TI  - Remote sensing of vegetation prolonged drought at the salt playas of Hail-Saudi Arabia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex natural phenomenon with a wide variety of natural and socioeconomic impacts, including water scarcity, health, agriculture, etc. This study provides a short-term (2000-2019) trend assessment of drought in Hail region, Saudi Arabia, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and rainfall dataset synchronized by the assessment of the decadal trends of the local land surface temperatures (LST). The NDVI and LST data were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, while rainfall data were acquired from the Tropical Rainfal Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation database. The impacts of drought on soils and natural vegetation of the region were also considered. Results evidenced that natural vegetation witnessed a prolonged decline between 2000 and 2019, accompanied by a regional increase of the decadal LST trends and decline of rainfall. However, it seems that vegetation communities in this hyper-arid region are of high tolerance to soil salinity and drought. There is a general consensus that drought conditions prevailing in this region reflect the context of climate change prevailing in the region and worldwide.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Predictive Values of Pathological and Clinical Risk Factors for Positivity of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Thin Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background:& nbsp;The indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for thin melanoma are still unclear. This meta-analysis aims to determine the positive rate of SLNB in thin melanoma and to summarize the predictive value of different high-risk features for positive results of SLNB.& nbsp;Methods:& nbsp;Four databases were searched for literature on SLNB performed in patients with thin melanoma published between January 2000 and December 2020. The overall positive rate and positive rate of each high-risk feature were calculated and obtained with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Both unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted ORs (AORs) of high-risk features were analyzed. Pooled effects were estimated using random-effects model meta-analyses.& nbsp;Results:& nbsp;Sixty-six studies reporting 38,844 patients with thin melanoma who underwent SLNB met the inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of SLNB was 5.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9%-5.3%]. Features significantly predicted a positive result of SLNB were thickness & GE;0.8 mm [AOR 1.94 (95%CI 1.28-2.95); positive rate 7.0% (95%CI 6.0-8.0%)]; ulceration [AOR 3.09 (95%CI 1.75-5.44); positive rate 4.2% (95%CI 1.8-7.2%)]; mitosis rate > 0/mm2 [AOR 1.63 (95%CI 1.13-2.36); positive rate 7.7% (95%CI 6.3-9.1%)]; microsatellites [OR 3.8 (95%CI 1.38-10.47); positive rate 16.6% (95%CI 2.4-36.6%)]; and vertical growth phase [OR 2.76 (95%CI 1.72-4.43); positive rate 8.1% (95%CI 6.3-10.1%)].& nbsp;Conclusions:& nbsp;The overall positive rate of SLNB in thin melanoma was 5.1%. The strongest predictor for SLN positivity identified was microsatellites on unadjusted analysis and ulceration on adjusted analysis. Breslow thickness & GE;0.8 mm and mitosis rate > 0/mm(2) both predict SLN positivity in adjusted analysis and increase the positive rate to 7.0% and 7.7%. We suggest patients with thin melanoma with the above high-risk features should be considered for giving an SLNB.

This phenomenon was observed in plants where mutations in some RNA-related factors lead to the production of RNA-quality control small interfering RNAs and several mutants show enhanced silencing of reporter transgenes. To assess the potential of RNAi activation on endogenous transcripts, we sequenced small RNAs from a set of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in various RNA metabolism pathways. We observed a global production of siRNAs caused by inefficient pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation leading to read-through transcription into downstream antisense genes. In addition, in the lsm1a lsm1b double mutant, we identified NIA1, SMXL5, and several miRNA-targeted mRNAs as producing siRNAs, a group of transcripts suggested being especially sensitive to deficiencies in RNA metabolism. However, in most cases, RNA metabolism perturbations do not lead to the widespread production of siRNA derived from mRNA molecules. This observation is contrary to multiple studies based on reporter transgenes and suggests that only a very high accumulation of defective mRNA species caused by specific mutations or substantial RNA processing defects trigger RNAi pathways.

TI  - Methyl Salicylate Can Benefit Ornamental Pest Control, and Does Not Alter <i>Per Capita</i> Predator Consumption at Close-Range
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is an herbivore-induced plant volatile widely tested for attracting natural enemies for pest control. MeSA is commercially sold as slow-release lures or as a spray. While MeSA application has increased the abundance of natural enemies in numerous food crops, its ability to reduce pests for crop protection is not as frequently demonstrated. Our first objective was to test MeSA lures in ornamental fields where few studies have been done, and monitor natural enemies, pests, and crop protection. A 2-year study in spruce container yards revealed more aphid parasitoids (Pseudopraon sp.), fewer aphids (Mindarus obliquus) on shoot tips, and less shoot tip damage in MeSA plots during the first year. A 2-year study in red maple fields revealed more predatory lady beetles and rove beetles, and parasitic Ceraphronidae, Diapriidae, and Chalcidoidea in one or both years with MeSA. Fewer pest thrips were also captured in MeSA plots, though it is not clear whether this was due to enhanced predation or reduced colonization. Maple growth as measured by stem diameter change did not differ with MeSA use. A 2-year study examining predation on sentinel Halyomorpha halys eggs in various mature ornamental stock blocks found no increase in predation except for 1 month, though green lacewings, lady beetles, and predatory thrips occurred more in MeSA plots in the first year. While MeSA is expected to enhance biological control by herding in natural enemies, the impacts that applied volatiles have on predator efficiency is mostly unknown. Thus, our second objective examined how volatiles would impact feeding rates at close-range. Adult carabid Pterostichus melanarius, adult coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis, and larval lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris consumed their prey at similar rates in the presence/absence of MeSA when food was presented directly in a 28 cm(2) or 30 ml arena, or when foraging in a 520 cm(2) outdoor soil arena or 946 ml arena with aphids on leaves.

TI  - Aerial Images Meet Crowdsourced Trajectories: A New Approach to Robust Road Extraction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land remote-sensing analysis is a crucial research in earth science. In this work, we focus on a challenging task of land analysis, i.e., automatic extraction of traffic roads from remote-sensing data, which has widespread applications in urban development and expansion estimation. Nevertheless, conventional methods either only utilized the limited information of aerial images, or simply fused multimodal information (e.g., vehicle trajectories), thus cannot well recognize unconstrained roads. To facilitate this problem, we introduce a novel neural network framework termed cross-modal message propagation network (CMMPNet), which fully benefits the complementary different modal data (i.e., aerial images and crowdsourced trajectories). Specifically, CMMPNet is composed of two deep autoencoders for modality-specific representation learning and a tailor-designed dual enhancement module for cross-modal representation refinement. In particular, the complementary information of each modality is comprehensively extracted and dynamically propagated to enhance the representation of another modality. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our CMMPNet for robust road extraction benefiting from blending different modal data, either using image and trajectory data or image and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. From the experimental results, we observe that the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

TI  - Can corporate governance structure effect on corporate performance: an empirical investigation from Indian companies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research foremost intention is to investigate the corporate governance structure effect on the firm's performance of the Indian-listed companies. The study was based on a six-year financial figure from FY 2014-2015 to FY 2019-2020 of Indian-listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The study applied the panel data statics model such as pooled OLS, fixed effect and random effect model, Hausman test and the Sys-GMM models for testing the study hypotheses. The study findings indicate that higher board size has a positive significant impact with the ROA, Tobin's Q on the firm's performance, and this helps in strengthen the decision-making process. Besides, the study results show statistically insignificant correlation among the ROA, EPS and NPM with the board independence. The results also reflected the positively correlation among the board meetings and the performance indicators of Tobin's Q, and these scenarios lead to that enhancement of corporate governance practices. Besides, the results negatively revealed correlation amongst the ROE, NPM and corporate governance indicators of CEO duality. The results of the study suggested that companies likely implement proper corporate governance practices leading to sophisticated effectiveness in firm's performance and minimize agency cost. The study attempted corporate governance issues with the several different measures and firm's variables other than using a single-measure context. Additionally, various model descriptions and statistical techniques are applied for analyzing the corporate governance structure and firm-related performance.

TI  - A national extent map of cropland and grassland for Switzerland based on Sentinel-2 data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Agricultural landscapes support multiple functions and are of great importance for biodiversity. Heterogeneous agricultural mosaics of cropland and grassland commonly result from variable land use practices and ecosystem service demands. Switzerland's agricultural land use is considerably spatially heterogeneous due to strong variability in conditions, especially topography and climate, thus presenting challenges to automated agricultural mapping. Nationwide knowledge of the location of cropland and grassland is necessary for effective conservation and land use planning. We mapped the distribution of cropland and permanent grassland across Switzerland. We used several indices largely derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery captured over multiple growing seasons and parcel-based training data derived from landholder reporting. The mapping was conducted within Google Earth Engine using a random forest classifier. The resulting map has high accuracy in lowlands as well as in mountainous areas. The map will act as a base agricultural land cover dataset for researchers and practitioners working in agricultural areas of Switzerland and interested in land cover and landscape structure. The map as well as the training data and calculation algorithms (using Google Earth Engine) are freely available for download on the EnviDat platform https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.205 (Pazur et al., 2021).

TI  - <i>Tu Bienestar es mi Bienestar</i>: A Psychosociocultural Understanding of Latinx Immigrant Well-Being Through a Qualitative Lens
T2  - JOURNAL OF LATINX PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current theories, frameworks, and measures informing the conception of well-being draw heavily from a nonminority worldview, which often neglect both cultural factors and frameworks. Using a qualitative design, we investigated how Spanish-speaking immigrant adults conceptualize and experience well-being from a psychosociocultural framework, an integrative approach addressing three interdependent dimensions: psychological (e.g., perception), social (e.g., relational connections), and cultural (values and worldviews). Latinx adults were recruited from a small town in the Midwest and invited to participate in semistructured interviews. Ten participants, five women and five men, took part in the study. The importance of experiencing inner tranquility, which stemmed from having knowledge that family members and loved one's were physically and emotionally well, emerged as the only theme from the psychological domain. From a social domain, connectedness (ability to share life with others) informed well-being. Cultural themes that emerged included responsibility to the family and having a relationship with God and faith. Our findings suggest that well-being for the current sample of Latinxs was holistic, interdependent (contingent on the wellness of others), spiritual, and centered on the value of familismo. Interventions aimed at increasing the well-being of Latinxs may be adapted to include community (family) healing strategies, strong focus on interpersonal factors, and religious-spiritual practices.Public Significance Statement The present study suggests that well-being among the Latinx community is informed by cultural values, factors, and practices. Additionally, it highlights the importance of a holistic approach to understanding well-being, one that incorporates the mind, body, and spirit.

TI  - Uncertainty in Aerosol Optical Depth From Modern Aerosol-Climate Models, Reanalyses, and Satellite Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the implication of aerosols for the radiation budget, there are persistent differences in data for the aerosol optical depth (tau) for 1998-2019. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the large-scale spatio-temporal patterns of mid-visible tau from modern data sets. In total, we assessed 94 different global data sets from eight satellite retrievals, four aerosol-climate model ensembles, one operational ensemble product, two reanalyses, one climatology and one merged satellite product. We include the new satellite data SLSTR and aerosol-climate simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models Phase 3 (AeroCom-III). Our intercomparison highlights model differences and observational uncertainty. Spatial mean tau for 60 degrees N - 60 degrees S ranges from 0.124 to 0.164 for individual satellites, with a mean of 0.14. Averaged tau from aerosol-climate model ensembles fall within this satellite range, but individual models do not. Our assessment suggests no systematic improvement compared to CMIP5 and AeroCom-I. Although some regional biases have been reduced, tau from both CMIP6 and AeroCom-III are for instance substantially larger along extra-tropical storm tracks compared to the satellite products. The considerable uncertainty in observed tau implies that a model evaluation based on a single satellite product might draw biased conclusions. This underlines the need for continued efforts to improve both model and satellite estimates of tau, for example, through measurement campaigns in areas of particularly uncertain satellite estimates identified in this study, to facilitate a better understanding of aerosol effects in the Earth system.

TI  - Sentinel Events and Miscommunication What do we know in 2021: A Language and Social Psychology Framework
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper explored the extent to which hospital appointed official root cause analysis (RCA) panels consider antecedent and proximal events when they investigate communication related sentinel events (CRSEs) in hospitals. It also explored which CRSEs are most common in the hospital setting in Hong Kong and the communication modes most commonly associated with CRSEs. The data consisted of Risk Alert and Annual Report on SEs issued by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority from October 2007 to September 2017. Over the period studied, there were 379 reported sentinel events (SEs). In 186 of these SEs we identified communication as a contributing factor. We examined the RCA panels' reports on contributing factors and subsequent recommendations in these 186 SEs and found that their recommendations only highlighted the proximal contributing factors and not antecedent factors that may be relevant. RCA panels most often recommended that communication should be enhanced or documentation improved. We propose that it is time to review the RCA process to recognize that many CRSEs may occur because of antecedent factors that result from the complex hospital organizational structure and its associated hierarchical culture. We suggest two ways forward, 1) applying a language and social psychology perspective to the investigations of CRSEs and, 2) the involvement of experts from different disciplines who can work with clinicians during RCA investigations.

TI  - Satellite data track spatial and temporal declines in European beech forest canopy characteristics associated with intense drought events in the Rhon Biosphere Reserve, central Germany
T2  - PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing intensity and frequency of droughts under climate change demands effective ways to monitor drought impacts. We sought to determine how different satellite remote sensing sources influence our ability to identify temporal and spatial impacts on European beech forest canopy health during intense drought events. Imagery from three satellite series (MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel-2) was used to observe changes in canopy health during the intense droughts of 2003 and 2018 in the Rhon Biosphere Reserve, central Germany. Monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) anomalies were calculated for each satellite between 2000-2020 and compared against temperature, precipitation and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Severe canopy impacts in 2003 and 2018 were associated with low NDVI in August and September. At the stand-scale, Sentinel-2 data allowed a spatially detailed understanding of canopy-level impacts, while MODIS provided the clearest temporal progression of the drought's impacts on the forest canopy. Low NDVI values were not exclusively associated with extremes of either temperature and precipitation individually; however, low canopy NDVI in August was associated with SPEI values below -1.5. Although the intense drought of 2018, as defined by meteorological parameters, peaked in July, canopy NDVI did not decline until August, highlighting that our ability to detect canopy impact during drought events is sensitive to the timing of image acquisition. No single satellite sensor affords a full picture of the temporal or spatial progression of drought impacts. Consequently, using sensors in tandem provides the best possible representation of canopy health during intense drought events.

AB  - Study region: Han River mainstream, China.Study focus: Human activities and climate change are synergistically impacting on the spatiotemporal features of Han River surface water, which affects the ecological environment evolution and economic development of the basin. However, the long-term changes of the area and spatial characteristics of Han River surface water have not been well quantified for lack of sufficient data and data processing powers. The study produced the annual surface water products of Han River mainstream from 1986 to 2020 based on Google Earth Engine and Landsat images, and then analyzed the long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water and the influence of climatic factor and water conservancy projects construction.New hydrological insights for the region: During the past 35 years, the surface water area of Han River mainstream has shown a fluctuating upward trend overall, and the dynamic changes have obvious regional and phased differences. Precipitation is the main climatic factor affecting the surface water area changes. With precipitation changes and the implementation of water conservancy projects in Han River, the surface water area has increased significantly and many reaches have gradually widened in upstream, while the surface water area has slowly decreased and many reaches have gradually narrowed in mid-downstream. The latest information about the spatiotemporal dynamics of Han River surface water provided by the research can be used for the optimal allocation and management of the river's water resources.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation species succession and composition are significant factors determining the rate of ecosystem biodiversity recovery after being disturbed and subsequently vital for sustainable and effective natural resource management and biodiversity. The succession and composition of grasslands ecosystems worldwide have significantly been affected by accelerated environmental changes due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Therefore, understanding spatial data on the succession of grassland vegetation species and communities through mapping and monitoring is essential to gain knowledge on the ecosystem and other ecosystem services. This study used a random forest machine learning classifier on the Google Earth Engine platform to classify grass vegetation species with Landsat 7 ETM+ and ASTER multispectral imager (MI) data resampled with the current Sentinel-2 MSI data to map and estimate the changes in vegetation species succession. The results indicate that ASTER MI has the least accuracy of 72%, Landsat 7 ETM+ 84%, and Sentinel-2 had the highest of 87%. The result also shows that other species had replaced four dominant grass species totaling about 49 km(2) throughout the study.

AB  - In this study, the changes in forest areas and land cover in the period of 2001-2011 and 2011-2021 in the Yenice Forestry Operation Directorate of Turkey were examined in time interval, category and transition levels by using the density analysis method. Landsat images of the study area for the relevant years were classified according to the supervised classification method, land cover change maps and matrices were produced. Method of Intensity Analysis dissects the transition matrices of 2001-2011 and 2011-2021 time period for six categories: Coniferous, Broad-Leaved, Mixed, Settlement, Agriculture and Water. Interval results of the analysis show that the accelerated change in the second period resulted in a decrease in mixed forest and agricultural areas (2%, 8%, respectively) and an increase in residential and pure forests (1% and 9%, respectively) in 20 years. According to the category level results, Broad-Leaved category is active in gain in the first time interval and dormant in terms of loss and gain in the second time interval. Mixed, on the other hand, is an active loser in the first timeframe and active in terms of gains in the second timeframe. According to the Transition level results, the gains of Coniferous and Mixed categories showed that they targeted each other's losses in both time intervals. While Broad-Leaved targeted Mixed losses in the first timeframe, Agriculture losses were targeted as gains in the second timeframe.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to the examination of the levels and effects of organobromine compounds (polybrominated diphenyl ethers: PBDEs and methoxylated brominated diphenyl ethers: MeO-PBDEs), in Sparus aurata native to the Lagoon of Bizerte. For that, different biomarkers of exposure (somatic indices, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities) and effect (malondial-dehyde level, histopathologic alterations, and DNA damage) as well as pollutant levels were measured in specimens collected from this impacted ecosystem and the Mediterranean Sea as a reference site. Bizerte Lagoon PBDE fish levels were higher than the Mediterranean Sea, whereas MeO-PBDEs were higher in the reference site. Fish from Bizerte Lagoon presented a higher hepatosomatic index, lower catalase and superoxide dismutase activity, higher level of malondialdehyde, and higher percentage of DNA tail in comparison to fish from the reference area. The histological study of the liver indicated substantial lesions in fish from the polluted site. The results showed strong positive correlations between the concentrations of the PBDE or MeO-PBDE and the MDA and DNA tail % levels and negative correlations for the activities of enzymes of SOD and CAT. Consequently, these findings could suggest a potential link between exposure to these pollutants and the observed biomarker responses in the Bizerte Lagoon seabream. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of biomarker selection and the selected sentinel fish species as useful tools for biomonitoring of aquatic pollution.

TI  - Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Variation of Waterlogged Areas Lying Between Lower Gandak and Burhi Gandak Basins, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lower Gandak command of Bihar, India lying between Gandak and Burhi Gandak river suffers due to waterlogging and drainage congestion causing adverse effect on its agriculture and other economic activities. In the present study, remote sensing and geographic information system were used to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of waterlogged areas lying between these rivers of lower Gandak basin using satellite data of 21 years from 2000 to 2020. It is seen that on average, more than 50% of the total area of 4933 km(2) chosen for the study remains uncultivated due to the presence of wet soil, open barren land, and water body. These water bodies are shallow with large areal extent. The maximum surface waterlogging was found in the post-monsoon season of the year 2004 (9.44% of the total area). From these, waterlogged pockets more than 50 ha (91 nos, 2.78% of the total area) were taken for further analysis as smaller areas become insignificant during non-monsoon months. Variation of the extent of each of the waterlogged pockets from the year 2000 to 2020 was computed and found to be significant. On average, only 12% of the extent of maximum waterlogging is available 75% of the time (probability) while 78% is available for 10% of the time. Therefore, there exists a possibility to reduce the areal extent of these waterlogged pockets depending on their individual physical characteristics. In the study, shrinking extent of one of the ecologically important water body in the area namely 'Baraila Tal' was also done and found that the 'tal' is losing its existence since 2002. From the outcomes of this research, it is recommended to take immediate measures to convert these waterlogged pockets into permanent water bodies with reduced areal extent accommodating the same maximum volume and utilize them for irrigation, ecological, and other economic activities.

TI  - Environmental monitoring approaches for the detection of organic contaminants in marine environments: A critical review
T2  - TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - This review reports different approaches for monitoring the presence of organic contaminants in marine environments. From the traditional standard chromatographic methodologies coupled to different detectors to the recent advances in sensor technology, different strategies have been adopted by researchers aiming to provide more comprehensive, realistic and accurate environmental monitoring data sets. Reports on chemical analysis by different techniques of marine water and sediments, using grab and passive sampling techniques, are the most abundant in literature, showing relevant developments. Analysis of the marine biota (biomonitoring) has also been widely used as a proxy for the detection of organic chemicals in seawater, with bivalves being the most used as sentinel specie. Such biomonitoring can provide insights on bioavailability and bioaccumulation of organic pollutants, which is not possible to obtain by water and sediment analysis solely. Furthermore, effect-based methods are also presented as an important approach when it comes to obtain environmental meaningful data, such as potential toxicity and hazards posed by the complex chemical mixtures to local biota. This approach is reported to be a useful tool for screening areas without any previous knowledge on chemical composition, with subsequential qualitative and quantitative characterization being performed by chemical analysis. Finally, some of the most recent developments in sensor and biosensor technology for environmental purposes are also discussed, with some proof-of-concept studies showing promising results. However, further development and validations work is strongly advised prior to the use of those sensing platforms in real field trials.

TI  - The Solar Activity Monitor Network - SAMNet
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Solar Activity Magnetic Monitor (SAMM) Network (SAMNet) is a future UK-led international network of ground-based solar telescope stations. SAMNet, at its full capacity, will continuously monitor the Sun's intensity, magnetic, and Doppler velocity fields at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere (from photosphere to upper chromosphere). Each SAMM sentinel will be equipped with a cluster of identical telescopes each with a different magneto-optical filter (MOFs) to take observations in K I, Na D, and Ca I spectral bands. A subset of SAMM stations will have white-light coronagraphs and emission line coronal spectropolarimeters. The objectives of SAMNet are to provide observational data for space weather research and forecast. The goal is to achieve an operationally sufficient lead time of e.g., flare warning of 2-8 h and provide many sought-after continuous synoptic maps (e.g., LoS magnetic and velocity fields, intensity) of the lower solar atmosphere with a spatial resolution limited only by seeing or diffraction limit, and with a cadence of 10 min. The individual SAMM sentinels will be connected to their master HQ hub where data received from all the slave stations will be automatically processed and flare warning issued up to 26 h in advance.

TI  - Association between satellite-detected tropospheric nitrogen dioxide and acute respiratory infections in children under age five in Senegal: spatio-temporal analysis
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is growing evidence to suggest that exposure to a high concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can lead to a higher incidence of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) in children; however, such an association remains understudied in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the limited availability of exposure data. This study explored this association by using the satellite-detected tropospheric NO2 concentrations measured by Sentinel-5 Precursor and ARI symptoms in children under age five collected in the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Senegal. Methods We matched the daily tropospheric NO2 exposure with the individual ARI symptoms according to the DHS survey clusters spatially and temporally and conducted a logistic regression analysis to estimate the association of exposure to NO2 with ARI symptoms in two preceding weeks. Results We observed a positive association between exposure to continuous levels of NO2 and ARI symptoms after adjusting for confounders (OR 1.27 per 10 mol/m(2), 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.52). When the association was further examined by quartile exposure categories, the 4th quartile category was positively associated with symptoms of ARI after adjusting for confounders (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.08-2.69). This suggests that exposure to certain high levels of NO2 is associated with the increased risk of children having symptoms of ARI in Senegal. Conclusions This study highlights the need for increased research on the effects of ambient NO2 exposure in Africa as well as the need for more robust, ground-based air monitoring in the region. For a country like Senegal, where more than 90% of the population lives in areas that do not meet the national air quality standards, it is urgently required to implement air pollution prevention efforts to protect children from the health hazards of air pollution.

TI  - Predicting spatial-temporal patterns of diet quality and large herbivore performance using satellite time series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adaptive management of large herbivores requires an understanding of how spatial-temporal fluctuations in forage biomass and quality influence animal performance. Advances in remote sensing have yielded information about the spatial-temporal dynamics of forage biomass, which in turn have informed rangeland management decisions such as stocking rate and paddock selection for free-ranging cattle. However, less is known about the spatial-temporal patterns of diet quality and their influence on large herbivore performance. This is due to infrequent concurrent ground observations of forage conditions with performance (e.g., mass gain), and previously limited satellite data at fine spatial and temporal scales. We combined multi-temporal field observations of diet quality (weekly) and mass gain (monthly) with satellite-derived phenological metrics (pseudo-daily, using data fusion and interpolation) to model daily mass gains of free-ranging yearling cattle in shortgrass steppe. We used this model to predict grazing season (mid-May to October) mass gains, a key management indicator, across 40 different paddocks grazed over a 10-year period (n = 138). We found strong relationships between diet quality and the satellite-derived phenological metrics, especially metrics related to the timing and rate of green-up and senescence. Satellite-derived diet quality estimates were strong predictors of monthly mass gains (R-2 = 0.68) across a wide range of aboveground net herbaceous production. Season-long predictions of average daily gain and cattle off-mass had mean absolute errors of 8.9% and 2.9%, respectively. The model performed better temporally (across repeated observations in the same paddock) than spatially (across all paddocks within a given year), highlighting the need for accurate vegetation maps and robust field data collection across both space and time. This study demonstrates that free-ranging cattle performance in rangelands is strongly affected by diet quality, which is related to the timing of vegetation green-up and senescence. Senescing vegetation suppressed mass gains, even if adequate forage was available. The satellite-based pseudo-daily approach presented here offers new opportunities for adaptive management of large herbivores, such as identifying within-season triggers to move livestock among paddocks, predicting wildlife herd health, or timing the grazing season to better match earlier spring green-up caused by climate change and plant species invasion.

TI  - Satellite passive microwave sea-ice concentration data set intercomparison using Landsat data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on results of an intercomparison of 10 global sea-ice concentration (SIC) data products at 12.5 to 50.0 km grid resolution from satellite passive microwave (PMW) observations. For this we use SIC estimated from > 350 images acquired in the visible-near-infrared frequency range by the joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat sensor during the years 2003-2011 and 2013-2015. Conditions covered are late winter/early spring in the Northern Hemisphere and from late winter through fall freeze-up in the Southern Hemisphere. Among the products investigated are the four products of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) and European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) algorithms SICCI-2 and OSI450. We stress the importance to consider intercomparison results across the entire SIC range instead of focusing on overall mean differences and to take into account known biases in PMW SIC products, e.g., for thin ice. We find superior linear agreement between PMW SIC and Landsat SIC for the 25 and the 50 km SICCI-2 products in both hemispheres. We discuss quantitatively various uncertainty sources of the evaluation carried out. First, depending on the number of mixed ocean-ice Landsat pixels classified erroneously as ice only, our Landsat SIC is found to be biased high. This applies to some of our Southern Hemisphere data, promotes an overly large fraction of Landsat SIC underestimation by PMW SIC products, and renders PMW SIC products overestimating Landsat SIC particularly problematic. Secondly, our main results are based on SIC data truncated to the range 0 % to 100 %. We demonstrate using non-truncated SIC values, where possible, can considerably improve linear agreement between PMW and Landsat SIC. Thirdly, we investigate the impact of filters often used to clean up the final products from spurious SIC over open water due to weather effects and along coastlines due to land spillover. Benefiting from the possibility to switch on or off certain filters in the SICCI-2 and OSI-450 products, we quantify the impact land spillover filtering can have on evaluation results as shown in this paper.

TI  - Affective Orientation and School Persistence among African American Youth: Implications for Afrocentric Youth Research and Practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Completion of high school is a critical juncture predicting future success among adolescents. However, Black youth are often subjected to structural and micro-manifestations of structural barriers in schools, hindering their success. Moreover, research on resiliency factors associated with the academic success of Black adolescents facing structural barriers is woefully underdeveloped. In response, this study tested the associations between a resiliency factor (proposed by the Nguzo Saba and African-Centered theory) and three predictors of school success (i.e., engagement, initiative-taking and diligence). The study sample was derived from the Templeton Flourishing Children Project Pilot Study, which measured variables that contribute to "flourishing" and are important for improving youth outcomes. The sample of Black youth was evenly representative of both Black boys and girls. The results suggest that dimensions of school success can be bolstered by increased relational and personal concern among Black youth for their fellow peers, which supports that an Afrocentric worldview may be a relevant developmental asset for positive outcomes in Black adolescents. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed, including opportunities and strategies for school behavioral health workers to assist Black youth who may be at risk for school failure.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest ecosystem in Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM) is the largest primary forest in northern China Accurate assessment of the regional carbon (C) pool of soils and analysis of the control factors are essential for setting appropriate forest management policies. Our study was designed to prove the hypothesis that forest soil acts as a C sink owing to continuous C accumulation, which results from constant biomass production within the GKM forests. We investigated topsoil (0-20 cm) C dynamics and diving force in GKM forests (both the Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang sectors) based on field data from 2000 to 2019. The mean soil organic C density (SOCD) in the topsoil was 10.64 +/- 0.83 kg C m(-2) across the GKM, and the increase rate was 0.15 +/- 0.05 kg C m(-2) y(-1). Our results also demonstrated the critical role of precipitation and under vegetation diversity in shaping soil organic C dynamics across the GKM, suggesting that the relationship between the soil C cycle and temperature is unstable in northern ecosystems. Our results provided a new reference range for estimating surface soil C pools in GKM forests ecosystems based on field measurements.

TI  - Factors influencing the theoretical orientations of early career psychologists
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The theoretical orientation/s adopted by psychologists is the informing framework for understanding from which their practice is grounded. How early-career psychologists come to adopt the theoretical orientation/s they utilise in their applied therapeutic practice is unclear. This qualitative study explored the key influences on Australian early-career psychologists' choice of theoretical orientations including the role of psychology higher education. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 Australian early-career psychologists. Interviews focused on the broad influences of theoretical orientations and the impact of postgraduate education, with transcripts analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results Participants discussed the importance of personal factors, training factors, clinical practice and professional factors, factors related to the stage in professional development, and limiting factors. Conclusions This study has described the key influences on Australian early-career psychologists' choice of theoretical orientations. Findings highlight the need for psychology education programmes to increase the diversity in training on theoretical orientations. What is already known about this topic: Theoretical orientations serve as the foundation to psychotherapeutic practice, through which psychologists come to understand and provide the interventions necessary to address the difficulties of their clients. Consistent with the rest of the western world, eclecticism appears to be the most prevalent approach in Australia clinical practice, although the endorsement of cognitive-behavioural theoretical orientations also appears to be popular. Early-career psychologists represent a unique demographic within the psychology profession, however limited research has examined the influences on their choice of theoretical orientations. What this topic adds: Participants reported that they were drawn to theoretical orientations which resonated with their personal experience, worldview and personality. The needs of their clients was also a fundamental influence. Participants acknowledged the crucial role of postgraduate training, however many expressed that Australian psychology training programmes would benefit from diversifying training exposing them to different theoretical orientations. Participants reported that their perceptions of theoretical orientations were particularly susceptible to the influence of external factors (i.e., supervisors, peers, colleagues and workplace) during the early-career phase.

TI  - Evaluating Urban Heat Islands Using the Urban Viability Index (Case Study: Karaj Metropolis)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most significant aspects of rapid growth without urban planning, reduction in vegetation is often replaced by unauthorized surfaces such as buildings and other impervious surfaces. Karaj metropolis is one of the significant urban areas located 20 km west of Tehran with such rapid growth. The present study evaluates the temporal-spatial variations of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Urban Liveability Index (ULI). It also seeks to examine the Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) using the data of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) over 32 years (1987-2019). The Fractal Net Evolution Approach (FNEA) was employed to calculate UHIs, and the deductive Environmental Critical Condition (ECI) method based on LST and NDVI was used for probing the urban environmental situation. The results indicated that the average LST in Karaj metropolis is between 22 and 35 degrees C. Furthermore, in 1990, the standard deviation of the LST was increased so that more than seven degrees C was observed for LST. Analysis of temperature zones and their effective parameters such as construction, transportation, and road construction in Karaj metropolis shows a significant negative correlation between LST and NDVI and a positive one between LST and constructed urban areas.

AB  - This article examines Rievssat (2018), one of the six games developed during the 2018 Sami Game Jam, as a case study to demonstrate how digital games on Indigenous issues afford opportunities to embed Indigenous ways of knowing into the core of game design. In particular, by exploring Rievssat's themes and game mechanics, this article identifies the way its procedural rhetoric models an understanding of and relationship to the game environment that reflects the dialogic connection with nature and animistic worldview unique to the Sami people. This article thereby demonstrates the value of new media in recentering Indigenous systems of knowledge and cultural practices by engaging with and incorporating Indigenous epistemologies into the foundation of game design, revealing how Sami digital games can offer insight into Sami ways of knowing and experiencing the world to Indigenous and non-Indigenous players alike.

TI  - Choice of Mastectomy May Increase the Extent of Axillary Surgery in Women with Breast Cancer
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Based on the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, women who undergo breast conservation therapy (BCT) and have limited disease in the axilla on sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy do not require axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). In this study we investigate the incidence of ALND in patients undergoing elective mastectomy with limited disease in the axilla to identify how many women may have been spared additional axillary surgery if they chose BCT. Methods All women with invasive breast cancer treated at a single tertiary care breast center from 2010-2018 who were candidates for BCT but elected mastectomy and underwent SLN biopsy were identified through retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of ALND in women found to have a limited burden of disease in the axilla (1-2 positive SLNs). Results The study population comprised 151 patients with invasive breast cancer eligible for BCT who chose mastectomy. On final pathology, 34 patients had 1-2 positive SLNs, and 16 of these patients underwent completion ALND. These 16 patients out of 151 overall lumpectomy candidates electing mastectomy (10.6%) could have been spared ALND if they did not elect mastectomy. Discussion BCT candidates electing mastectomy have a 10.6% chance of undergoing more extensive axillary surgery than would have been recommended with BCT alone. The increased risk of undergoing additional axillary surgery should be incorporated into the preoperative discussion for patients choosing between BCT and mastectomy.

AB  - In India, agribusiness is directly dependent on the precise monitoring of paddy areas to take considerable supportive actions toward food security. For this, satellite-based data is considered one of the effective solutions. The goal of this study is to design an intelligent framework to determine the crop area by using satellite data that is easily available. In this article, a Multi-resolution Deep Neural Network (MR-DNN) is proposed to determine rice fields by performing multi-streaming classification. The task of prediction is performed on Landsat 8 satellite images with high spatial resolution. The prediction performance of the proposed model is justified by comparing the calculated outcomes from a few selected methods. The proposed model has achieved the highest prediction performance in terms of the F1 score with the accuracy of 95.40% and 95.12% for Punjab and West-Bengal dataset as compared to the selected models, such as DeepLabV3+, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Light-Gradient Boosting Method (LGBM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Spectral, and Threshold. In this manner, the empirical evaluation defines the prediction performance of the proposed model over the visual interpretation of the maps as well as seasonal impacts.

TI  - Investigation of Source Parameters of the 2020 Elazig-Sivrice Earthquake (Mw 6.8) in the East Anatolian Fault Zone
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Anatolian Fault Zone in Turkey produced a major earthquake (Mw 6.8) on 24 January 2020. In this study, we analyze the displacements of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) stations. We also use the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to determine deformation caused by the earthquake. For this analysis, interferograms were produced with Sentinel-1 coseismic pairs. The coseismic displacement is about 60 cm as a maximum in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction from ascending and descending tracks. The displacements are modeled with uniform slip modeling to understand the fault mechanism and to estimate the source parameters of the earthquake. In addition, horizontal and vertical displacements are calculated using the decomposition of LOS solutions. According to the InSAR results, the fault length measured 37 km, and the magnitude of the earthquake was calculated as 6.6, not 6.8. The InSAR results were inverted into the elastic half-space model and estimated the earthquake source parameters as follows: depth 17 km, strike 242 degrees, dip 80 degrees, rake 1 degrees.

TI  - Uptake and outcomes of sentinel lymph node mapping in women undergoing minimally invasive surgery for endometrial cancer
T2  - BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To examine the patterns and outcomes of sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment in women with endometrial cancer. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting United States inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Population Women with endometrial cancer who underwent a laparoscopic or robotic-assisted hysterectomy. Methods The Perspective Database from 2012 to 2018 was used. Performance of lymph node dissection was classified as SLN mapping, lymph node dissection or no nodal evaluation. Adjusted regression models were developed to examine the association between SLN mapping and morbidity and cost. Main Outcome Measures Utilisation rates, morbidity and cost of both lymph node dissection and SLN mapping. Results Among 45 381 patients, SLN mapping was performed for 7768 patients (17.1%), lymph node dissection was performed for 23 214 patients (51.2%) and no lymphatic evaluation was performed for 14 399 patients (31.7%). SLN mapping increased from 1.8% in 2012 to 35.3% in 2018, whereas the rate of lymph node dissection decreased from 63.5% to 39.1% (p < 0.001). Among women who underwent nodal evaluation, residence in the west, White race and use of robotic-assisted hysterectomy were associated with SLN mapping (p < 0.05 for all). The complication rate was 5.9% for SLN mapping, compared with 7.3% in those that underwent lymph node dissection (aRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.95). The median hospital costs for women who underwent SLN mapping ($10 479) and lymph node dissection ($10 747) were higher than for those who did not undergo nodal assessment ($9149) (p < 0.001). Conclusions The performance of SLN mapping is increasing for endometrial cancer. Compared with lymph node dissection, SLN mapping is associated with lower morbidity. SLN mapping significantly increases the costs compared with hysterectomy alone.

TI  - A North American dust emission climatology (2001-2020) calibrated to dust point sources from satellite observations
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of atmospheric dust have long influenced our understanding of dust sources and dust model calibration. However, assessing dust emission magnitude and frequency may reveal different dust source dynamics and is critical for informing land management. Here we use MODIS (500 m) albedo-based daily wind friction estimates to produce a new dust emission climatology of North America (2001-2020), calibrated by the novel use of dust point sources from optical satellite observations (rather than being tuned to dust in the atmosphere). Calibrated dust emission occurred predominantly in the biomes of the Great Plains (GP) and North American Deserts (NAD), in broad agreement with maps of aerosol optical depth and dust deposition but with considerably smaller frequency and magnitude. Combined, these biomes produced 7.2 Tg y(-1) with contributions split between biomes (59.8% NAD, 40.2% GP) due to the contrasting conditions. Dust emission is dependent on different wind friction conditions on either side of the Rocky Mountains. In general, across the deserts, aerodynamic roughness was persistently small and dust sources were activated in areas prone to large wind speeds; desert dust emissions were wind speed limited. Across the Great Plains, large winds persist, and dust emission occurred when vegetation cover was reduced; vegetated dust emissions were roughness limited. We found comparable aerodynamic roughness exists across biomes/vegetation classes demonstrating that dust emission areas are not restricted to a single biome, instead they are spread across an 'envelope' of conducive wind friction conditions. Wind friction dynamics, describing the interplay between changing vegetation roughness (e.g., due to climate and land management) and changing winds (stilling and its reversal), influence modelled dust emission magnitude and frequency and its current and future climatology. We confirm previous results that in the second half of the 21st century the southern Great Plains is the most vulnerable to increased dust emission and show for the first time that risk is due to increased wind friction (by decreased vegetation roughness and / or increased wind speed). Regardless of how well calibrated models are to atmospheric dust, assuming roughness is static in time and / or homogeneous over space, will not adequately represent current and future dust source dynamics.

TI  - Regional soil organic matter mapping models based on the optimal time window, feature selection algorithm and Google Earth Engine
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) is highly significant to the assessment of the regional carbon balance, food security and cultivated land quality. Due to climate change and the increasing food demand, the intensity of cultivated land development in the Northeast China black soil region is increasing, and it is urgent to accurately map the SOM content in this region. Remote sensing technology has been widely applied in the field of soil mapping, but large-scale and high-precision soil mapping remains a significant challenge. In this study, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is adopted to generate synthetic soil images based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images capturing bare soil periods at 20-d intervals. Then, the spectral index and band are adopted as input variables to evaluate the prediction accuracy of these synthetic images depicting different periods using random forest (RF) regression. Finally, two feature selection methods (Boruta and recursive feature elimination (RFE)) are employed to evaluate the performance of these two methods. The results indicate that 1) the optimal time window for SOM prediction is day of year (DOY) 120-140 for the Songnen Plain; 2) the performance of SOM prediction based on Landsat-8 synthetic images is better than that based on Sentinel-2 synthetic images; and 3) both feature selection methods improve the SOM prediction accuracy, but RFE has the highest accuracy(Landsat-8 with Coefficient of Determination (R-2) of 0.702, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.681%; Sentinel-2 with R-2 of 0.5963, RMSE of 0.793%). This study provides a new model for large-scale and high-spatial resolution SOM prediction and verifies the importance of the time window to the SOM prediction accuracy.

TI  - The parasitoid complex of diamondback moth, <i>Plutella xylostella</i> (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), in Canada: impact and status
T2  - CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), a globally important pest of Brassicaceae crops, migrates into all provinces of Canada annually. Life tables were used to determine the mortality levels contributed by the parasitoid complexes associated with diamondback moth in British Columbia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and insular Newfoundland. Overall, diamondback moth populations showed high generational mortality (> 90%) in all provinces, although parasitism levels were generally low. The net reproductive rate of increase in diamondback moth was less than 1.0 (populations declined) in both years in British Columbia and in each of two years in Newfoundland and Ontario, but it was greater than 1.0 in all three years in Prince Edward Island. Lower parasitism levels were found in Prince Edward Island (3.0-6.3%) compared with other provinces (8.4-17.6%, except one year in British Columbia). Diadegma insulare was the main larval parasitoid found; it was present in all provinces. Microplitis plutellae was present in all provinces except British Columbia. Oomyzus sokolowskii was found in British Columbia and Ontario. The parasitoid community documented from sentinel sampling was less diverse than that found through destructive sampling. Hypotheses are provided to explain the presence of major parasitoids. Increasing larval parasitism would have the largest effect on diamondback moth population growth in Canada.

TI  - Lightning patterns in the Pantanal: Untangling natural and anthropogenic-induced wildfires
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of fire causes and characteristics is of fundamental importance to better understand fire regimes and drivers. Particularly for Brazil, there is a gap in the quantification of lightning-caused fires. Accordingly, this work is a novel probabilistic assessment of the spatial-temporal patterns of lightning-ignited wildfires in the Pantanal wetland. Here, remote sensing information such as VIIRS active fires, MODIS burned area (BA) and STARNET lightning observations from 2012 to 2017, were combined to estimate the location, number of scars and amount of BA associated with atmospheric discharges on a seasonal basis. The highest lightning activity occurs during summer (December-Febru-ary), and the lowest during winter (June-August). Conversely, the highest fire activity occurred during spring (September-November) and the lowest during autumn (March-May). Our analysis revealed low evidence of an association between fires and lightning, suggesting that human-related activities are the main source of ignitions. Weak evidence of natural-caused fire occurrence is conveyed by the low spatial-temporal match of lightning and fire throughout the studied period. Natural-caused fires accounted for only 5% of the annual total scars and 83.8% of the BA was human-caused. Most of the fires with extension larger than 1000 ha were not related to lighting. Lightning-fires seem an important element of the summer fire regime given that around half of the total BA during this season may be originated by lightning. By contrast, in the rest of the year the lightning-fires represent a minor percentage of the fire activity in the region. The density of lightning-ignited fires varies considerably, being higher in the north part of the Pantanal. This work provides a basis for a better understanding of lightning-related fire outbreaks in tropical ecosystems, particularly wetlands, which is fundamental to improve region-based strategies for land management actions, ecological studies and modeling climatic and anthropogenic drivers of wildfires.

TI  - A review of machine learning methods for drought hazard monitoring and forecasting: Current research trends, challenges, and future research directions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Machine learning is a dynamic field with wide-ranging applications, including drought modeling and forecasting. Drought is a complex, devastating natural disaster for which it is challenging to develop effective prediction models. Therefore, our review focuses on basic information about machine learning methods (MLMs) and their potential applications in developing efficient and effective drought forecasting models. We observed that MLMs have achieved significant advances in the robustness, effectiveness, and accuracy of the algorithms for drought modelling in recent years. The performance comparison of MLMs with other models provides a comprehensive conception of different model evaluation metrics. Further challenges of MLMs, such as inadequate training data sets, noise, outliers, and observation bias for spatial data sets, are explored. Finally, our review conveys in-depth understanding to researchers on machine learning applications in forecasting and modeling and provides drought mitigation strategy guidance for policymakers.

TI  - Urbanization Impact on Regional Climate and Extreme Weather: Current Understanding, Uncertainties, and Future Research Directions
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Urban environments lie at the confluence of social, cultural, and economic activities and have unique biophysical characteristics due to continued infrastructure development that generally replaces natural landscapes with built-up structures. The vast majority of studies on urban perturbation of local weather and climate have been centered on the urban heat island (UHI) effect, referring to the higher temperature in cities compared to their natural surroundings. Besides the UHI effect and heat waves, urbanization also impacts atmospheric moisture, wind, boundary layer structure, cloud formation, dispersion of air pollutants, precipitation, and storms. In this review article, we first introduce the datasets and methods used in studying urban areas and their impacts through both observation and modeling and then summarize the scientific insights on the impact of urbanization on various aspects of regional climate and extreme weather based on more than 500 studies. We also highlight the major research gaps and challenges in our understanding of the impacts of urbanization and provide our perspective and recommendations for future research priorities and directions.

TI  - A new method for pixel classification for rice variety identification using spectral and time series data from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the agriculture sector food productivity, security, and sustainability, imposed challenges on farmers, regulatory bodies, and policymakers due to increasing demand and depleting natural resources and environmental concerns. Rice crop holds a prominent place in Pakistan's agriculture sector, it is not only consumed locally but also exported to many countries including China. Gathering crop information such as variety maps, yield estimation, or etc. can help farmers, regulatory bodies, policymakers, and rice mills in decision-making. In Pakistan, crop information is collected through manual field surveys that require a lot of human labor, are costly, and are time-consuming. One cannot ignore human error and bias in the process. A new framework for pixel classification is proposed that uses both spectral and time-series data of Sentinal-2 satellite for mapping two rice varieties "Basmati" and "IRRI, grown in Pakistan. The data were collected from twelve rice fields (approx. 307 acres) of different geographical locations at 16-time instances to cover the complete rice-growing season (May-October) in 2019. A linear spectral unmixing model is used to determine sub-pixel information of water, soil, and vegetation content, which is used for labeling each pixel for supervised learning. The input to our classifier is a 16 x 15 image formed using 15 spectral features (12 spectral bands and 3 radiometric indices) of 16 carefully selected different time instances for each pixel. The output is a pixel-level classification (semantic segmentation) of each pixel into Basmati, IRRI, and others (soil, water, etc.). Experimental results have exhibited an excellent overall accuracy of 98.6% with the proposed approach. The Basmati rice obtained higher accuracy of 99.7% as compared to IRRI rice with an accuracy of 95.2%.

TI  - Temperature-precipitation background affects spatial heterogeneity of spring phenology responses to climate change in northern grasslands (30°N-55°N)
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatial heterogeneity of grassland phenology responses to climate change is of crucial importance for revealing regional and species differences in ecosystem processes. In this study, three spring phenology models, namely, growing-degree-day model (GDD), temperature-precipitation parallel model (TPP) and temperature-precipitation sequential model (TPS) were employed to simulate the growing season start (GSS) retrieved from remote sensing data during 1981-2014 in mid-latitude (30 degrees N-55 degrees N) grasslands of the Northern Hemisphere. Results show that the average accuracies of predicted GSS based on TPP (root mean square errors (RMSE) = 9.9 days) and TPS (RMSE = 9.7 days) models are slightly higher than that based on GDD model (RMSE = 10.1 days) overall. Meanwhile, TPP/TPS model also exhibits a stronger capacity to simulate interannual variation of GSS (correlation coefficient (R) = 0.38/0.41 on average) than the GDD model (R = 0.3 on average). A revised Akaike information criterion (AICc_R) by including correlation coefficient between predicted and retrieved GSS was designed for the optimal model selection. The optimal models based on AICc_R present a stronger power in capturing the temporal pattern of spring phenology. GDD, TPP, and TPS model account for 32.7%, 20.7%, and 46.6% of the whole study region, respectively. Sub-regionally, TPS model dominates the temperate grasslands (66.1%), whereas GDD model dominates the cool semidesert grasslands (58.1%). Regions occupied by GDD model as the optimal model are generally cooler and wetter during February to May than those taken up by TPP and TPS model. Further analysis indicates higher heat and water requirements are needed in the most of warmer places. Overall, this study emphasizes the important role of thermal-moisture background in controlling the spatial pattern of spring phenology of northern grasslands in response to climate change. Precipitation is very important for triggering spring phenology in the temperate grasslands but not in the cool semidesert grasslands.

TI  - Dam type and lake location characterize ice-marginal lake area change in Alaska and NW Canada between 1984 and 2019
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice-marginal lakes impact glacier mass balance, water resources, and ecosystem dynamics and can produce catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) via sudden drainage. Multitemporal inventories of ice-marginal lakes are a critical first step in understanding the drivers of historic change, predicting future lake evolution, and assessing GLOF hazards. Here, we use Landsat-era satellite imagery and supervised classification to semi-automatically delineate lake outlines for four similar to 5-year time periods between 1984 and 2019 in Alaska and northwest Canada. Overall, ice-marginal lakes in the region have grown in total number (+183 lakes, 38 % increase) and area (+483 km(2), 59 % increase) between the time periods of 1984-1988 and 2016-2019. However, changes in lake numbers and area were notably unsteady and nonuniform. We demonstrate that lake area changes are connected to dam type (moraine, bedrock, ice, or supraglacial) and topological position (proglacial, detached, unconnected, ice, or supraglacial), with important differences in lake behavior between the sub-groups. In strong contrast to all other dam types, ice-dammed lakes decreased in number (six fewer, 9% decrease) and area (-51 km(2), 40 % decrease), while moraine-dammed lakes increased (56 more, 26 % and +479 km(2), 87 % increase for number and area, respectively) at a faster rate than the average when considering all dam types together. Proglacial lakes experienced the largest area changes and rate of change out of any lake position throughout the period of study and moraine-dammed lakes which experienced the largest increases are associated with clean-ice glaciers (< 19 % debris cover). By tracking individual lakes through time and categorizing lakes by dam type, subregion, and topological position, we are able to parse trends that would otherwise be aliased if these characteristics were not considered. This work highlights the importance of such lake characterization when performing ice-marginal lake inventories and provides insight into the physical processes driving recent ice-marginal lake evolution.

TI  - Ni/CNT/Zeolite-Y composite catalyst for efficient heptane hydrocracking: Steady-state and transient kinetic studies
T2  - APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of integrating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into a bi-functional Ni-Zeolite-Y catalyst was studied for the hydrocracking of heptane at 350 and 400 degrees C (total pressure of 5 bar). It was shown that the growth of CNTs on the surface of Ni-Zeolite-Y (Ni-ZY) results in enhanced stability and catalytic activity (conversion increased by 22% at 350 degrees C) compared to the conventional Ni-ZY. A significant increase in the initial transient kinetic rates of CH4 and C2H6 formation was also noticed. The CNT/Ni-ZY also showed reduced coke formation during the reaction as entailed by transient isothermal (400 degrees C) oxidation experiments. The formation of a crystalline NixCy phase on the zeolite surface was observed in the case of CNT/Ni-ZY, potentially responsible for its enhanced catalytic performance. This work demonstrates that the integration of CNTs in hydrocracking catalysts offers new opportunities for enhancing their catalytic activity, selectivity and coking resistance.

TI  - Nearshore suspended sediment concentration and transport pattern along the southern Karnataka coast, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The nearshore variation in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is essential to understand the circulation and sediment transport in and around the coastal area. SSC was derived from shoreline to 20 m bathymetric contour for thirteen transects selected between Malpe and Talapady along the southern Karnataka coast, India. Ocean colour monitor (OCM) and in-situ derived SSC was compared for validation of satellite data. High SSC in the southern side of the study area is due to high wave activity, beach erosion, sediment discharge from the river, dredging activity of New Mangalore Port, and construction of offshore reef at Ullal. In-situ samples show high SSC concentration in the bottom waters in estuaries which signify the dominance of bed load transport over suspended load. In nearshore waters, high concentration in the surface, mid and bottom waters are observed along the stations impacted by anthropogenic activities. The in-situ data is observed to be positively correlating (+/- 10 mg/l) with OCM data. SSC values deciphered using the modified Tassan algorithm provides accurate estimates in coastal waters off south-west India. The sediment transport pattern derived from statistical parameters of bed sediment samples showed offshore, southward and northward direction. Natural and anthropogenic structures act as a barrier to coastal sediment transport. The direction of sediment transport patterns in the coastal waters is useful for the maintenance of navigational channels and planning the coastal structures in the coastal zone.

TI  - Daytime and Nighttime Sea Surface Temperature (SST) along with Diurnal Variability (D-SST) in the Northern Bay of Bengal: A Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - THALASSAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined daytime and nighttime sea surface temperature (SST) and its diurnal variability (D-SST) in three regions of the northern Bay of Bengal (BoB) during 2000-2019 by using MODIS Terra satellite data. An increasing trend of SST was observed in the Bangladesh coast, outer coast, and offshore. The trend was ranged around 0.10-0.16 degrees C per decade during daytime and 0.18-0.27 degrees C per decade during nighttime. The increased SST in the study area may be attributed due to rapid industrialization and global warming. Monthly SST represented four successive phases, such as warming-cooling and warming-cooling, which started in February. Month wise SST concentrations varied from 29.74 degrees C to 23.32 degrees C during nighttime and 29.613 degrees C to 23.446 degrees C during daytime in the northern BoB. The comparative SST among three different stations showed that annual offshore SST was higher during daytime and lower during nighttime than the outer & Bangladesh coast. Annual daytime maximum and minimum SST were observed at 28.45 degrees C and 27.27 degrees C, respectively. During the nighttime, it was ranged from 28.33 degrees C to 27.05 degrees C. The presence of nearby landmass may be the factor behind the variation of SST during day and nighttime. About 65-80% of monthly D-SST and 70-80% of annual D-SST value was recorded below 0.3 degrees C in our study area. A significantly (p < 0.001) moderate correlation (r = 0.54) was found between the MODIS Terra satellite data and NODC in-situ data.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island effect created by urbanization is to be one of the most worrisome urban environment issues, and impervious surface (IS) is the main driving factor of the urban heat island effect. Therefore, it is nesscessy to analyze the impact of IS on urban thermal environment from multiple perspectives. Using Landsat images from 2000 to 2020, we explored the spatiotemporal changes of IS area and urban heat islands, then investigated the impact of IS on LST with regression analysis, bivariate spatial autocorrelation, and deviation degree and contribution degree in Huai'an city. The results showed that (1) IS area in Huai'an CUA has increased dramatically from 2000 to 2020, moving towards the east and south, a net increase of 164.26 km(2); (2) LST values were linearly positively correlated with IS abundance (ISA%), 10 increased in ISA% resulted an increase of 0.08 to 0.35 degrees C in LST, when ISA% is greater than 50%, the influence weakened; (3) IS had a significant positive spatial correlation with LST, the High-High type agglomeration area continued to expand and first agglomerated and then dispersed; (4) The deviation degree of LST in IS expansion area was less than that of original IS area, but IS expansion area contributed most to the urban thermal environment due to the vast region covered. The findings attribute a better understanding of the impact of impervious surface on urban thermal environment and should be helpful for city planners.

TI  - Comparison of evapotranspiration upscaling methods from instantaneous to daytime scale for tea and wheat in southeast China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately converting instantaneous evapotranspiration (lambda ETi) at satellite over-passing time into daily evapotranspiration (lambda ETd) is a key issue of applying remotely sensed data to estimate regional evapotranspiration (lambda ET) from remote sensing satellites, which plays an important role for effective water resource management. The scaling methods that take advantage of the relationship between lambda ET and other environmental factors and can be used to convert lambda ETi into lambda ETd. In this study, five scaling methods of converting lambda ETi into lambda ETd, including the evaporative fraction method (Eva-f method), revised evaporative fraction method (R-Eva-f method), crop coefficient method (K-c-ET0 method), revised crop coefficient method (R-K-c-ET0 method) and direct canopy resistance method (Direct-r(c) method), were evaluated based on the detailed meteorological data measured from 2016 to 2018 in a tea field and 2018 to 2020 in a wheat field in southeast China. The estimated lambda ETd was compared with the measured lambda ETd by the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method. The results indicated that the Eva-f and R Eva-f methods with the mean root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of efficiency (epsilon) equaled 9.02 W m(-2) and 0.92; 12.06 W m(-2) and 0.89, respectively, were superior to the K-c-ET0, R-K-c-ET0 and Direct-r(c )method; the K-c-ET0 method with the mean RMSE and epsilon equaled 20.62 W m(- 2) and 0.79 was also a good option for simulating the lambda ETd of tea and wheat; while the R-K-c-ET(0 )method simulated the lambda ETd well for the wheat with mean RMSE and epsilon equaled 36.29 W m(-2) and 0.71, but significantly overestimated the tea lambda ETd with the mean RMSE and epsilon values of 39.61 W m(-2) and 0.59 for tea; the Direct-r(c) method overestimated lambda ETd of tea and wheat for the most of intervals with the mean RMSE and epsilon of 39.58 W m(-2) and 0.62, and was not recommended to use in the present study areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal estimation of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and human health risks combining the three-dimensional landscape pattern index and machine learning methods to optimize land use regression modeling in Shaanxi, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 pollution endangers human health and urban sustainable development. Land use regression (LUR) is one of the most important methods to reveal the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5, and the introduction of characteristic variables of geographical factors and the improvement of model construction methods are important research directions for its optimization. However, the complex non-linear correlation between PM2.5 and influencing indicators is always unrecognized by the traditional regression model. The two-dimensional landscape pattern index is difficult to reflect the real information of the surface, and the research accuracy cannot meet the requirements. As such, a novel integrated three-dimensional landscape pattern index (TDLPI) and machine learning extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST) improved LUR model (LTX) are developed to estimate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the fine particle concentration in Shaanxi, China, and health risks of exposure and inhalation of PM2.5 were explored. The LTX model performed well with R-2 = 0.88, RMSE of 8.73 mu g/m(3) and MAE of 5.85 mu g/m(3). Our findings suggest that integrated three-dimensional landscape pattern information and XGBOOST approaches can accurately estimate annual and seasonal variations of PM2.5 pollution The Guanzhong Plain and northern Shaanxi always feature high PM2.5 values, which exhibit similar distribution trends to those of the observed PM2.5 pollution. This study demonstrated the outstanding performance of the LTX model, which outperforms most models in past researches. On the whole, LTX approach is reliable and can improve the accuracy of pollutant concentration prediction. The health risks of human exposure to fine particles are relatively high in winter. Central part is a high health risk area, while northern area is low. Our study provides a new method for atmospheric pollutants assessing, which is important for LUR model optimization, high-precision PM2.5 pollution prediction and landscape pattern planning. These results can also contribute to human health exposure risks and future epidemiological studies of air pollution.

TI  - Lympho-vascular invasion impacts the prognosis in breast-conserving surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Background It is estimated that breast cancer (BC) incidence, especially that of early-stage breast cancer cases continues to rise due to increased universal screening. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the main intervention for early-stage BC. Lympho-vascular invasion (LVI) is reported to influence breast cancer prognosis but its prognostic value in breast-conserving treatment is controversial. Methods A search was conducted on the Cochrane library, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE from inception to December 1(st), 2021, without language restrictions, to identify studies that explored the prognosis of lympho-vascular invasion in breast-conserving surgery. Reviews of each study were conducted, and data extracted. The meta-analysis was performed with StataSE 16. Study quality assessment was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results Overall, 15 studies with 21,704 patients deemed eligible for this study. Event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant metastases (DM), loco-regional recurrence (LRR), local recurrence (LR), breast recurrence (BR), disease specific survival (DSS), and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS), were extracted from each study. We found that LVI leads to poor OS (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.17-1.83), DM (HR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.66-2.60) and LR (HR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.54-2.61). Conclusions We confirmed that early-stage BC patients with LVI-positive have poorer OS, DFS, LRR, BCSS, DM and LR following receiving BCS than those LVI-negative patients. Mastectomy, in combination with radical systemic therapies could be considered, especially in those requiring second surgery. How to change the impact of LVI on the local recurrence rate and long-term survival in patients who undergo BCS may be a valuable research direction in the future.

TI  - Passive and Active Remote Sensing Data as Indicators of Vegetation Condition in Dry Woodland
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An important challenge is getting to know the condition of vegetation in dry woodlands, fragile ecosystems with high ecological value, to propose conservation strategies. Our objectives were: (1) to quantify on-the-ground vegetation composition and structure in dry Ramorinoa girolae-dominated woodlands on three study sites, using (A) field-based methods and (B) passive and active remotely sensed data at multi-scale and (2) to assess whether the integration of different remote sensors allows for a better estimation. We recorded field-based data on 36 plots of 50 x 30 m distributed in three sites (Ischigualasto n = 16; Valle Fertil n = 10; Private land n = 10). On each plot, we estimated the standard deviation (SD) of passive (EVI-Enhanced Vegetation Index-and SATVI-Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) and active imagery data (SD of VV and VH polarisation) at multi-scale. The results of this approach show that passive and active remote sensing data were good indicators of almost all field-based data recorded at stand scale, except for richness, which was not related to remote sensing data. Shrub biomass, tree biomass and abundance of R. girolae were better explained by multi than single-sensor models. Only the variance in canopy cover of R. girolae was explained by single-sensor models. This work expands our understanding of the relationship of field-based data with both passive and active remotely sensed data, providing evidence that they could be used as a proxy for vegetation structure in dry R. girolae-dominated woodlands.

TI  - Machine learning algorithms for soil moisture estimation using Sentinel-1: Model development and implementation
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study provided the first-time comprehensive evaluation of 12 advanced statistical and machine learning (ML) algorithms for the Soil Moisture (SM) estimation from dual polarimetric Sentinel-1 radar backscatter. The ML algorithms namely support vector machine (SVM) with linear, polynomial, radial and sigmoid kernel, random forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), Wang and Mendel's (WM), subtractive clustering (SBC), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), hybrid fuzzy interference system (HyFIS), and dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) were used. Extensive field samplings were performed for collection of in-situ SM data and other parameters from the selected sites for seven different dates and at two different locations (Varanasi and Guntur District, India), concurrent to Sentinel-1 overpasses. The backscattering coefficients were considered as input variables and SM as output variable for the training, validation and testing of the ML algorithms. The site at Varanasi was used for the training, validation and testing of the models. On the other hand, the Guntur site was used as an independent site for checking the model performance, before finalizing the algorithms. The performances of different trained algorithms were evaluated in terms of correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE) (in m(3)/m(3)) and bias (in m(3)/m(3)). The study identified the RF, SBC and ANFIS as the top three best performing models with comparable and promising SM estimation. In order to test the robustness of these best models (RF, SBC and ANFIS), further performance analysis was performed to the independent datasets of the Varanasi and Guntur test sites, which indicates that the performance of these three models were consistent and SBC can be recommended as the best among all for SM estimation.

TI  - Development of a three-source remote sensing model for estimation of urban evapotranspiration
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of urban evapotranspiration (ET) is meaningful for evaluating the urban heat island effect and promoting urban water conservation. While multi-source satellite-based ET models for farmland and natural ecosystems have been developed, these models lack the object-oriented solutions for the urban areas. In view of this, the present study proposed a Three-source Remote sensing model for Urban areas (TRU) to simulate the urban ET, which can discriminate between urban soil evaporation, vegetation transpiration, and impervious surface evaporation. The new parameterization scheme proposed herein is characterized by the theory of complementary relationship to estimate the urban soil evaporation. Evaporation losses in the impervious areas were independently estimated in accordance with the distribution of urban land use and land cover (LULC). The developed TRU model was evaluated for 63 cloud-free test days in Tianjin, China by using 30 m Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images. The outcomes of this study revealed a root-mean square-error (RMSE) of 40.2 W/m(2) and a bias of 10.8 W/m2 compared with the two eddy correlation (EC) observations for the instantaneous latent heat flux (LE) simulation. Moreover, the RMSE and bias were 0.092 and-0.023, respectively in simulating the vegetation latent heat flux fraction (LEv/LE) when verified with respect to the stable water isotope measurements. Due to limited water availability, the impervious urban surface evaporation magnitude was found quite low with minimal variation on different test days. The results emphasize the importance of coupling LULC information in the urban ET modeling conceptualization. Certainly, the TRU model improved the ET simulation accuracy in urban areas and could facilitate the mapping of urban ET components at high spatial resolution.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of chlorophyll-a concentration from MODIS data inversion in the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang River, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to limitations in monitoring technologies, monitoring the algae content index of water has lagged behind the conventional water quality index. As a result, sample monitoring in many rivers has been too sparse, and the monitoring data have been inconsistent; thus the evolution of water eutrophication has not been fully reflected. This study focused on the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang River, China, and correlated moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data with measured chlorophyll-a concentrations. Algorithm settings for chlorophyll-a inversion in the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang River were established via the trial and error method. The algorithm model for the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang River chlorophyll-a concentration inversion, and the results of the inversion analysis for the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics were subsequently used to determine the influence of various environmental factors on changes in the chlorophyll-a concentration. The results indicate that (1) the band combinations B7/(B6 + B5), B7/B5, B4-B2, and B4/(B3 + B2) are well-correlated with the chlorophyll-a concentration; (2) the back propagation (BP) neural network model inversion achieved a better fit and more accurate inversion results than the band ratio model; (3) temporally, algal outbreaks were mostly concentrated occurring in February and March, with higher chlorophyll-a concentrations in the water column during 2000, 2006, 2007, and 2008; (4) spatially, high chlorophyll-a concentrations were observed in the Zhongxiang, the Shayang, and upper Xiantao sections; and (5) increases in the water temperature and decreases in the water level and flow rate could lead to higher chlorophyll-a concentrations; similarly, nutrient salts were identified to be a major factor contributing to changes in the chlorophyll-a concentrations.

TI  - An inventory of supraglacial lakes and channels across the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Quantifying the extent and distribution of supraglacial hydrology, i.e. lakes and streams, is important for understanding the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet and its consequent contribution to global sea-level rise. The existence of meltwater on the ice surface has the potential to affect ice shelf stability and grounded ice flow through hydrofracturing and the associated delivery of meltwater to the bed. In this study, we systematically map all observable supraglacial lakes and streams in West Antarctica by applying a semi-automated Dual-NDWI (normalised difference water index) approach to > 2000 images acquired by the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites during January 2017. We use a K-means clustering method to partition water into lakes and streams, which is important for understanding the dynamics and inter-connectivity of the hydrological system. When compared to a manually delineated reference dataset on three Antarctic test sites, our approach achieves average values for sensitivity (85.3% and 77.6 %), specificity (99.1% and 99.7 %) and accuracy (98.7% and 98.3 %) for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 acquisitions, respectively. We identified 10 478 supraglacial features (10 223 lakes and 255 channels) on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Antarctic Peninsula (AP), with a combined area of 119.4 km(2) (114.7 km(2) lakes, 4.7 km(2) channels). We found 27.3% of feature area on grounded ice and 54.9% on floating ice shelves. In total, 17.8% of feature area crossed the grounding line. A recent expansion in satellite data provision made new continental-scale inventories such as these, the first produced for WAIS and AP, possible. The inventories provide a baseline for future studies and a benchmark to monitor the development of Antarctica's surface hydrology in a warming world and thus enhance our capability to predict the collapse of ice shelves in the future. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5642755 (Corr et al., 2021).

AB  - The Iron Quadrangle (IQ) in Brazil is one of the world's largest reserves of iron ore, and besides its economic importance, the region also plays a key role in nature conservation with the endemic Campo Rupestre vegetation. Despite a large number of protected areas (PAs) offering refuge for the remaining Campo Rupestre vegetation in the IQ, studies on the current situation of these natural remnants, and the real functionality of these PAs are scarce. This study aimed to map the remaining natural phytophysiognomies of the IQ, evaluating the proportion of Campo Rupestre on ferruginous and non-ferruginous substrates in PAs. We applied the object-oriented classification using Sentinel 2A and 2B satellite images, vegetation indexes, iron oxide index and terrain attributes, with field-collected validation points. We identified thirteen types of land use and cover, of which five represented natural phytophysiognomies. The most common phytophysiognomies in the IQ are Seasonal Forests and Cerrado (all types included), accounting for more than 60% of the total area. Campo Rupestre on ferruginous and non-ferruginous substrates accounts for 5.4% of the total mapped area only. On the other hand, about 42.5% of the Campo Rupestre (ferruginous or not) are protected and correspond to 17.7% of the PAs. We show that an appropriate mapping of the phytophysiognomies in the IQ region is key for improving landscape ecology knowledge and future conservation planning, especially of the endangered Campo Rupestre vegetation.

TI  - Land cover classification of spaceborne multifrequency SAR and optical multispectral data using machine learning
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares the utility of multifrequency SAR and Optical multispectral data for land-cover classification of Mumbai city and its nearby regions with a special focus on water body mapping. The L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, X-band TerraSAR-X, C-band RISAT-1, and Sentinel-2 datasets have been used in this work. This work is done as a retrospective study for the dual-frequency L and S-band NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. The ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data has been pre-processed before the implementation of machine learning algorithms for image segmentation. Multi-looking is performed on ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data to generate square pixels of size 5.78 m and then target decomposition is applied to generate a false-color composite RGB image. While in the case of TerraSAR-X and RISAT-1 datasets, no multi-looking was performed and direct target decomposition was applied to generate false-color composite RGB images. Similarly, for the optical dataset that has a resolution of 10 m, a true color composite, and a false color composite RGB image are generated. For the comparative study between ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2 dataset, the RGB images are divided into smaller chunks of size 500*500 pixels each to create a training and testing dataset. Ten image patches were taken from the large dataset, out of which eight patches were used to train the machine learning models Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and two patches were kept for testing and validation purpose. For training the machine learning models, feature vectors are generated using the Gabor filter, Scharr filter, Gaussian filter, and Median filter. For patch 1, the mIOU for true-color composite based Optical image varies from 0.2323 to 0.2866 with the RF classifier performing the best and the mIOU for false-color composite based Optical image varies from 0.4130 to 0.4941 with the RF classifier performing the best while for ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, the mIOU varies from 0.4033 to 0.4663 with the RF classifier outperforming the KNN and the SVM classifiers. For patch 2, the mIOU for true-color composite based Optical data varies from 0.3451 to 0.4517 with KNN performing the best and the mIOU for false-color composite based Optical image varies from 0.5156 to 0.5832 with the RF classifier performing the best while for ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, the mIOU varies from 0.4600 to 0.5178 with the RF classifier outperforming the KNN and the SVM classifiers. The gap between the performance of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data and Sentinel-2 optical data is observed when the IOU of water class is compared, with IOUw for the true-color composite based optical image at a maximum of 0.2525 and for false color composite based optical image at a maximum of 0.7366 while for ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data a maximum IOUw of 0.7948 is achieved. The better performance of SAR data as compared to true-color composite based optical image data is due to the misclassification of ground and water classes into urban and forest in the case of the true-color composite based optical dataset which can be attributed to the high similarity between water and forest classes in the case of true-color composite based optical data whereas both these classes are easily separable in case of SAR data. This issue is however resolved by using the false color composite based optical image dataset for the classification task which performs slightly better than ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data in the overall classification task.How- ever, the SAR data works best in water body detection as notable from the high IOU for water class in the case of SAR data. In addition to the comparative analysis between Sentinel-2 optical and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, land-cover classification has been performed on X- band TerraSAR-X and C-band RISAT-1 data on a single patch and it has been found that the RF classifier performs the best, recording the mIOU 0.5815 for X-band TerraSAR-X data, mIOU of 0.4031 for the C-band RISAT-1 data, and mIOU of 0.6153 for the L-band ALOS-2 data.

TI  - Potential of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 StripMap data for lithofacies identification and geological lineament mapping in vegetated fold-thrust belt of Nagaland, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study statics-based textural analysis GLCM (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) of high resolution L band SAR data from ALOS-2 of JAXA has been used to discriminate between lithological facies of the fold-thrust belt of Nagaland, India. Sandstones, shales, siltstones and clays have been separated in the analysis. Importantly, the lithological facies with second-order compositional variance have been distinguished from each other. The study of 27 lithological pairs indicates a Transformed Divergence index greater than 1.7 except one pair which shows an index of 1.6. The average GLCM texture values of different stratigraphic units in VV and VH polarization shows appreciable differences. Coefficient of variation of the texture samples from each descriptor show uniform distribution around their mean. The mean has thus been used as a lithological index in this study. Further, the medium scaled geological lineaments have been extracted and mapped at 1: 25,000 scale. The Compass Edge Detector on the first Principal Component of full polarized ALOS-2 scene has been used for this purpose. Fracture network, outcrop length, density, and orientation have also been analyzed. The study is successful in rock characterization within vegetation-covered landscape, using L band SAR remote sensing. It may provide an important tool in geological mapping in inaccessible terrains with limited ground data control. The fracture map and its study can provide some useful insights about reservoir characterization and reduce exploration risk in this terrain that has a proven petroleum system.

TI  - Clinical impact of low-volume lymph node metastases in early-stage cervical cancer: A comprehensive meta-analysis
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. In order to define the clinical significance of low-volume metastasis, a comprehensive meta analysis of published data and individual data obtained from articles mentioning micrometastases (MIC) and isolated tumor cells (ITC) in cervical cancer was performed, with a follow up of at least 3 years. Methods. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis, following Cochrane's review methods guide and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The primary outcome was the disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary outcome was the overall survival (OS). The hazard ratio (HR) was taken as the measure of the association between the low-volume metastases (MIC+ITC and MIC alone) and DFS or OS; it quantified the hazard of an event in the MIC (+/- ITC) group compared to the hazard in node-negative (N0) patients. A random-effect meta-analysis model using the inverse variance method was selected for pooling. Forest plots were used to display the HRs and risk differences within individual trials and overall. Results. Eleven articles were finally retained for the meta-analysis. In the analysis of DFS in patients with low volume metastasis (MIC + ITC), the HR was increased to 2.60 (1.55-4.34) in the case of low-volume metastasis vs. N0. The presence of MICs had a negative prognostic impact, with an HR of 4.10 (2.71-6.20) compared to N0. Moreover, this impact was worse than that of MIC pooled with ITCs. Concerning OS, the meta-analysis shows an HR of 5.65 (2.81-11.39) in the case of low-volume metastases vs. N0. The presence of MICs alone had a negative effect, with an HR of 6.94 (2.56-18.81). Conclusions. In conclusion, the presence of MIC seems to be associated with a negative impact on both the DFS and OS and should be treated as MAC. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Cross-platform classification of level and deformed sea ice considering per-class incident angle dependency of backscatter intensity
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide-swath C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been used for sea ice classification and estimates of sea ice drift and deformation since it first became widely available in the 1990s. Here, we examine the potential to distinguish surface features created by sea ice deformation using ice type classification of SAR data. Also, we investigate the cross-platform transferability between training sets derived from Sentinel-1 Extra Wide (S1 EW) and RADARSAT-2 (RS2) ScanSAR Wide A (SCWA) and fine quad-polarimetric (FQ) data, as the same radiometrically calibrated backscatter coefficients are expected from the two C-band sensors. We use a novel sea ice classification method developed based on Arctic-wide Si EW training, which considers per-ice-type incident angle (IA) dependency of backscatter intensity. This study focuses on the region near Fram Strait north of Svalbard to utilize expert knowledge of ice conditions during the Norwegian young sea ICE (N-ICE2015) expedition. Manually drawn polygons of different ice types for S1 EW, RS2 SCWA and RS2 FQ data are used to retrain the classifier. Different training sets yield similar classification results and IA slopes, with the exception of leads with calm open water, nilas or newly formed ice (the "leads" class). This is caused by different noise floor configurations of Si and RS2 data, which interact differently with leads, necessitating dataset-specific retraining for this class. SAR scenes are then classified based on the classifier retrained for each dataset, with the classification scheme altered to separate level from deformed ice to enable direct comparison with independently derived sea ice deformation maps. The comparisons show that the classification of C-band SAR can be used to distinguish areas of ice divergence occupied by leads, young ice and level first-year ice (LFYI). However, it has limited capacity in de-lineating areas of ice deformation due to ambiguities between ice types with higher backscatter intensities. This study provides reference to future studies seeking cross-platform application of training sets so they are fully utilized, and we expect further development of the classifier and the inclusion of other SAR datasets to enable image-classification-based ice deformation detection using only satellite SAR.

TI  - Radiometric Stability Assessment of the DSCOVR EPIC Visible Bands Using MODIS, VIIRS, and Invariant Targets as Independent References
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The DSCOVR mission was designed to take advantage of the first Lagrangian position (L1) to continuously observe the Earth sunlit disk. To facilitate EPIC V03 data product validation and fusion, the EPIC V03 navigation and calibration stability is assessed. The Aqua-MODIS, NPP-VIIRS, and N20-VIIRS based radiometric scaling factors are also provided. The V03 navigation error was 15.5 km, a 50% improvement over V02 and within what can be achieved by an objective image alignment algorithm. Both the navigation accuracy and precision were improved in V03 and were found to be comparable across all EPIC visible channels. The all-sky tropical ocean and deep convective cloud ray-matched MODIS- and VIIRS-referenced EPIC inter-calibration gains are within 0.4% of one-another, and are also within 0.4% of a previous study's NPP-VIIRS-referenced gains. The inter-calibration study reveals that EPIC bands 5 and 6 degraded mostly within the first year of operation and becoming stable thereafter, whereas bands 7 and 10 were stable during the 6-years record. The capability of the V03 navigation allowed EPIC stability to be monitored using DCC and Libya-4 invariant targets. The EPIC V03 calibration was mostly stable within 0.3% over the 6-years record, as determined from inter-calibration and invariant target monitoring methods. Remarkably, both the DCC- and Libya-4-based methods were able to confirm the stability of the E-8 and E-9 oxygen absorptions-a stability comparable to that of the E-7 and E-10 reference bands. No significant change in the navigation accuracy or calibration stability was observed after the DSCOVR 2019 safe mode incident. The impressive stability of the DSCOVR EPIC L1B V03 channel radiances can greatly benefit the Earth remote sensing community by providing diurnally complete daytime radiative flux and environmental retrievals for future sensors located at L1.

TI  - Incidence and patterns of lymphatic drainage to the epitrochlear and popliteal sentinel lymph nodes in malignant melanoma of the distal extremities: a single-institution retrospective study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In most cutaneous melanomas of the distal extremity, sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are identified in the axillary or inguinal basin; however, they may be occasionally found in the epitrochlear or popliteal basins. The incidence and patterns of lymphatic drainage to the epitrochlear or popliteal SLNs are unclear. Methods To clarify the incidence and clinical characteristics of melanoma draining to these ectopic SLNs, we performed a retrospective study of the patients with distal extremity melanoma who underwent SLN biopsy at the National Cancer Center Hospital between April 2010 and December 2017. Results We identified 27 patients with melanoma of the distal upper extremity and 113 patients with melanoma of the distal lower extremity. All patients with distal upper and lower extremity melanomas had SLNs in the axillary and inguinal basins. Epitrochlear SLNs were found in 14.8% (4/27) of the patients with upper extremity melanoma, and the frequency increased by 36.4% (4/11) when the primary melanoma was located in the basilic vein area (P = 0.00188). Popliteal SLNs were found in 21.2% (24/113) of the patients with lower extremity melanoma, and the frequency increased by 37.9% (22/58) when the primary melanoma was located in the lesser saphenous vein area (P < 0.0001). Conclusion The incidence of SLNs identified in the epitrochlear or popliteal basin is not uncommon, and physicians need to be aware of these ectopic SLNs, especially when the primary melanoma is located in the basilic vein or lesser saphenous vein areas accordingly.

TI  - Channel responses to flooding of Ganga River, Bihar India, 2019 using SAR and optical remote sensing
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Indo Gangetic flood plains are subjected to recurring floods due to large low-lying land areas adjacent to major Himalayan Rivers. Recent floods in the Ganga River during the late withdrawal phase of Indian summer monsoon rains in 2019 had reportedly caused death of similar to 200-500 people and damaged major infrastructures in different parts of Bihar state, India. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the spatial extent and temporal pattern of flood inundation areas in Patna district of Bihar using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The results obtained using K-means classification show that about 1268 km(2) (20% of the studied portion) of the land area were inundated during the peak flooding conditions on 9th October 2019. The peak flooding lasts for more than 20 days, with a maximum water depth of 18 m in the main river. Owing to the continually changing nature of river morphology by recurring floods, we also analyzed the channel morphology and bar characteristics before, during, and after the floods. Geomorphic change assessment indicates that the total bar occupied area was decreased from 661 km(2) for pre-flood time to 446 km(2) in peak flood time, whereas it retains its original shape in post-flood images.

TI  - Development of a data-assimilation system to forecast agricultural systems: A case study of constraining soil water and soil nitrogen dynamics in the APSIM model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As we face today's large-scale agricultural issues, the need for robust methods of agricultural forecasting has never been clearer. Yet, the accuracy and precision of our forecasts remains limited by current tools and methods. To overcome the limitations of process-based models and observed data, we iteratively designed and tested a generalizable and robust data-assimilation system that systematically constrains state variables in the APSIM model to improve forecast accuracy and precision. Our final novel system utilizes the Ensemble Kalman Filter to constrain model states and update model parameters at observed time steps and incorporates an algorithm that improves system performance through the joint estimation of system error matrices. We tested this system at the Energy Farm, a well-monitored research site in central Illinois, where we assimilated observed in situ soil moisture at daily time steps for two years and evaluated how assimilation impacted model forecasts of soil moisture, yield, leaf area index, tile flow, and nitrate leaching by comparing estimates with in situ observations. The system improved the accuracy and precision of soil moisture estimates for the assimilation layers by an average of 42% and 48%, respectively, when compared to the free model. Such improvements led to changes in the model's soil water and nitrogen processes and, on average, increased accuracy in forecasts of annual tile flow by 43% and annual nitrate loads by 10%. Forecasts of aboveground measures did not dramatically change with assimilation, a fact which highlights the limited potential of soil moisture as a constraint for a site with no water stress. Extending the scope of previous work, our results demonstrate the power of data assimilation to constrain important model estimates beyond the assimilated state variable, such as nitrate leaching. Replication of this study is necessary to further define the limitations and opportunities of the developed system.

TI  - Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 for cropland mapping with special emphasis on the usability of textural and vegetation indices
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional as well as global cropland database at a high spatial resolution like 10 m is not available. This study aims to integrate the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and Sentinel-2 optical data in a more robust way to map the croplands at 10 m spatial resolution. It also examines the effectiveness of different derived products from the SAR and multispectral data. The VH and VV polarizations of the SAR data were used to generate the 80 textural parameters at four different kernel sizes. The multispectral bands of the optical data were used to create nine different spectral indices. The SAR and optical data were classified separately and integrated with the other derived products, using the random forest classifier, to identify the most potential way to use the two datasets for LULC classification. The classification accuracy was the least when only the Sentinel 1 data was used, with an overall accuracy of 59.48% and a kappa value of 0.51. The best accuracy (97.94% overall accuracy and 0.98 kappa value) was achieved by combining the Sentinel 1 and 2 data and their optimal textures and spectral indices. Overall, this study suggests the suitability of the SAR data along with optical data to map the croplands with higher accuracy.

TI  - Reconstruction of active surface deformation in the Rishi Ganga basin, Central Himalaya using PSInSAR: A feedback towards understanding the 7th February 2021 Flash Flood
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Active surface deformation, displacement pattern, and erosional variability is estimated using the geomorphologically sensitive morphometry along with the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique using the Sentinel-1 Adata (119 images) acquired between 07- 02-2017 and 10-02-2021. The average velocities for this dataset are estimated to be between +/- 11 mm/y. The Raunthi River catchment from where the flood was triggered is undergoing similar to 8 mm/y subsidence and similar to 10 mm/y uplift. Compared to this the basin wide deformation (Rishi Ganga basin) is estimated to be around +/- 10 mm/y with commulative ground displacement of around +/- 45 mm. The times series analysis suggests an increase in the ground displacement by around 5 mm/y and seems to be responsible for the expansion of pre-existing cracks in the vicinity of the Vaikrita Thrust (VT) and subsequent failure of the northern face of Nandi Peak on 7th February 2021. The Global Positioning System (GPS) derived strain distribution pattern indicate a relatively higher accumulation of strain (>0.35 mu strain/y). The normalized steepness index (k(sn)) variation along the longitudinal section of Rishi Ganga and Raunthi River sub-basin in Central Himalayan region shows anomalous increase at the glacio-fluvial transitional processes. Moreover, the chi profiles as well as planform plots shows anomalously lower values within the Raunthi River sub-basin when compared with the Rishi Ganga basin. Based on the lower values of chi it is observed that Raunthi River sub-basin is undergoing high erosion which can be caused by the presence of sheared lithology and incision of the relict glacial and paraglacial sediments. We negate the suggestion that abrupt rise in the temperature was the major triggering mechanism for the recent disaster, instead it is the sheared lithology and preexisting fissure developed because of differential uplift and subsidence in Raunthi River that led to the wedge failure and subsequent flash flood. Had the climate was the major driver of the recent tragedy ?, it should have impacted multiple hanging glaciers in the Rishi Ganga valley. Therefore, the study calls for detailed geomorphological, structural and glaciological investigation in regions dominated by glacial and paraglacial processes in the strategic regions of the Himalaya. Towards this, the state of art PSInSAR technique seems to provide fast and reliable detection of terrain instability/stability along with identification of potential areas of slope failures in near future in the glacial and preglacial zones.

TI  - Polarimetric calibration of spaceborne and airborne multifrequency SAR data for scattering-based characterization of manmade and natural features
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) systems use electromagnetic radiations of different polarizations in the micro-wave frequency to collect the scattering information from targets on the Earth. Nevertheless, as with any other electronic device, the PolSAR systems are also not ideal and subjected to distortions. The most important of these distortions are the polarimetric distortions caused due to the channel imbalance, phase bias, and crosstalk between the different polarization channels. For the spaceborne PolSAR systems, the Earth's ionosphere also contributes to an additional polarimetric distortion known as the Faraday rotation. An effort was made in this study to perform the polarimetric calibration of the Quad-pol and Compact-pol PolSAR datasets acquired using different airborne and spaceborne PolSAR systems to estimate and minimize these polarimetric distortions. The investigation was also done to analyze the impact of these polarimetric distortions on the scattering mechanisms from ground targets and on its dependency on the radar wavelength. The study was done using the UAVSAR L-band Quad-pol dataset, RADARSAT-2 Quad-pol dataset, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, ISRO's L&S-Band Airborne SAR (LS-ASAR) Quad-pol and Compact-pol datasets, and the RISAT-1 Compact-pol data-set. Calibration of the airborne PolSAR data was carried to understand the level of polarimetric distortions in the LS-ASAR product that is a precursor mission to the spaceborne Dual-Frequency L&S Band NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. It is understood that the crosstalk is the dominant polarimetric distortion, which severely affects the PolSAR datasets compared to the other polarimetric distortions, and it is more for the higher wavelength PolSAR systems. The Quegan, Improved Quegan, and Ainsworth algo-rithms for crosstalk estimation and minimization was performed for the different Quad-pol datasets and it was found that the Improved Quegan algorithm is suitable for removing crosstalk from datasets having high crosstalk and the Ainsworth algorithm is suitable for removing crosstalk from datasets having low crosstalk. The Freeman method of the polarimetric calibration was implemented for the compact-pol datasets and it was able to considerably minimize the polarimetric distortions. The coherency matrix, scattering matrix, model-based decomposition, polarimetric signatures, and roll invariant parameter-based analysis revealed that all the datasets after polarimetric calibration were showing the correct scattering responses expected from the ground targets.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution, abundance, and host interactions of two invasive vectors of arboviruses, <i>Aedes albopictus</i> and <i>Aedes japonicus</i>, in Pennsylvania, USA
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Aedes albopictus and Aedes japonicus, two invasive mosquito species in the United States, are implicated in the transmission of arboviruses. Studies have shown interactions of these two mosquito species with a variety of vertebrate hosts; however, regional differences exist and may influence their contribution to arbovirus transmission.Methods: We investigated the distribution, abundance, host interactions, and West Nile virus infection prevalence of Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus by examining Pennsylvania mosquito and arbovirus surveillance data for the period between 2010 and 2018. Mosquitoes were primarily collected using gravid traps and BG-Sentinel traps, and sources of blood meals were determined by analyzing mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences amplified in PCR assays.Results: A total of 10,878,727 female mosquitoes representing 51 species were collected in Pennsylvania over the 9-year study period, with Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus representing 4.06% and 3.02% of all collected mosquitoes, respectively. Aedes albopictus was distributed in 39 counties and Ae. japonicus in all 67 counties, and the abundance of these species increased between 2010 and 2018. Models suggested an increase in the spatial extent of Ae. albopictus during the study period, while that of Ae. japonicus remained unchanged. We found a differential association between the abundance of the two mosquito species and environmental conditions, percent development, and median household income. Of 110 Ae. albopictus and 97 Ae. japonicus blood meals successfully identified to species level, 98% and 100% were derived from mammalian hosts, respectively. Among 12 mammalian species, domestic cats, humans, and white-tailed deer served as the most frequent hosts for the two mosquito species. A limited number of Ae. albopictus acquired blood meals from avian hosts solely or in mixed blood meals. West Nile virus was detected in 31 pools (n = 3582 total number of pools) of Ae. albopictus and 12 pools (n = 977 total pools) of Ae. japonicus.Conclusions: Extensive distribution, high abundance, and frequent interactions with mammalian hosts suggest potential involvement of Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus in the transmission of human arboviruses including Cache Valley, Jamestown Canyon, La Crosse, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika should any of these viruses become prevalent in Pennsylvania. Limited interaction with avian hosts suggests that Ae. albopictus might occasionally be involved in transmission of arboviruses such as West Nile in the region.

TI  - Mapping active paddy rice area over monsoon asia using time-series Sentinel-2 images in Google earth engine; a case study over lower gangetic plain
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We proposed a modification of the existing approach for mapping active paddy rice fields in monsoon-dominated areas. In the existing PPPM approach, LSWI higher than EVI at the transplantation stage enables the identification of rice fields. However, it fails to recognize the fields submerged later due to monsoon floods. In the proposed approach (IPPPM), the submerged fields, at the maximum greenness time, were excluded for better estimation. Sentinel-2A/2B time-series images were used for the year 2018 to map paddy rice over the Lower Gangetic Plain (LGP) using Google earth engine (GEE). The overall accuracy (OA) obtained from IPPPM was 85%. Further comparison with the statistical data reveals the IPPPM underestimates (slope (beta(1)) = 0.77) the total reported paddy rice area, though R-2 remains close to 0.9. The findings provide a basis for near real-time mapping of active paddy rice areas for addressing the issues of production and food security.

TI  - Synergistic evaluation of Sentinel 1 and 2 for biomass estimation in a tropical forest of India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit measurement of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) is crucial for the quantification of forest carbon stock and fluxes. To achieve this, an integration of Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite datasets could provide an accurate estimation of forest biomass. This will also help in removing the uncertainties associated with the single sensor-based estimation approaches. Therefore, the present study attempts to integrate Sentinel-2 optical data with Sentinel-1 SAR dataset to estimate AGB in the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Gujarat, India. In this study, two non-parametric machine learning algorithms viz Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with different kernel functions-linear, sigmoidal, radial and polynomial and Random Forest (RF) were employed for the prediction of AGB using different combinations of VV, VH, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Incidence Angle (IA). Ground based AGB was estimated through allometric equation at 35 sampling sites with the help of tree height and Diameter at Breast's Height (DBH). Standalone collinearity analysis among different parameters resulted in poor correlation of AGB with VH (r = 0.05) and IA (r = 0.015), whereas a significantly good correlation with NDVI (r = 0.80) and VV (r = 0.74) were observed. Inclusion of NDVI with VV and VH together also resulted in a better correlation (r = 0.85) than other combinations. The SVM with linear kernel utilizing parametric the combinations of VV + VH + NDVI and VV + VH + NDVI + IA were found to be best performing on the basis of evaluation metrics. The outcome of this study highlighted the significance of machine learning techniques and synergistic use of different remote data for an AGB in forests.

TI  - Estimation of ground subsidence of New Delhi, India using PS-InSAR technique and Multi-sensor Radar data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally the land subsidence is a significant problem of the rapidly growing urban area. The factor responsible for the land subsidence caused by over-exploitation of the underground fluid such as water, petroleum, and gas respectively. In present study we present the result of detail investigation of active ground subsidance in New Delhi, National Capital Region (NCR). This area indicates a high rate of urban growth during the past decades. To analyze the land subsidence, we used multiple SAR sensor data and exploited the PS-InSAR technique. The data used for this study are Cosmo-skymed acquired between 08/06/2011 to 15/11/2017, Sentinel-1A-B (18-12-2014 to 2711-2018), and ALOS PALSAR acquired between 19/01/2007 and 20/01/2011. These radar sensors operate in X, C, and L-band, which covers over ten years, from 2007 to 2018. The PSI results of Cosmo-skymed reveals that the Delhi NCR region has undergone an average deformation +/- 15 mm/y, a maximum surface deformation observed from ALOS-PALSAR is 10 to 18 mm/y and the ground displacement observed from the SENTINAL-1A data is -2 to 16 mm/y. Groundwater level data also collected for the same period and a ground water level depletion compared with the subsidence. Monitoring land subsidence with ground-based conventional technology is timeconsuming and can be carried out in a limited area due to the financial implication. PS-InSAR is an established method to detect the surface movement using the SAR sensor's time-series data. The result shows that a twenty centimeter of land subsidence is visible in some areas, validated with the collected ground evidence. The affected area is also showing resemblance to the groundwater depleting condition in those areas. This study also establish that multiple sensor data can be used to monitor the long term land subsidence. (c) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysing the relationship between drought and soil erosion using vegetation health index and RUSLE models in Godavari middle sub-basin, India
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural phenomenon posing severe implications for soil, groundwater and agricultural yield. It has been recognized as one of the most pervasive global change drivers to affect the soil. Soil being a weakly renewable resource takes a long time to form, but it takes no time to degrade. However, the response of soil to drought conditions as soil loss is not manifested in the existing literature. Thus, this study makes a concerted effort to analyze the relationship between drought conditions and soil erosion in the middle sub-basin of the Godavari River in India. MODIS remote sensing data was utilized for driving drought indices during 2000-2019. Firstly, we constricted Temperature condition index (TCI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) from Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS data. TCI and VCI were then integrated to determine the Vegetation Health Index (VHI). Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was utilized for estimating soil loss. The relationship between drought condition and vegetation was ascertained using the Pearson correlation. Most of the northern and southern watersheds experienced severe drought condition in the sub-basin during 2000-2019. The mean frequency of the drought occurrence was 7.95 months. The average soil erosion in the sub-basin was estimated to be 9.88 t ha (1) year (1). A positive relationship was observed between drought indices and soil erosion values (r value being 0.35). However, wide variations were observed in the distribution of spatial correlation. Among various factors, the slope length and steepness were found to be the main drivers of soil erosion in the sub-basin. Thus, the study calls for policy measures to lessen the impact of drought and soil erosion. (C) 2021 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI  - A multi-criteria landslide susceptibility mapping using deep multi-layer perceptron network: A case study of Srinagar-Rudraprayag region (India)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility analysis is vital for understanding precursors, associated risk, and early rescue operations. In the past, numerous attempts have been made to develop landslide susceptibility maps using various tools. This research work aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) by developing a deep multi-layer perceptron network named as DMLP-LSM and to demonstrate it over Srinagar-Rudraprayag region, a landslide prone region recognized by the Geological Survey of India (GSI). Initially, training datasets are generated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) enabled multi-criteria analysis, which involves information from various land-slide causative factors. In a first, one dimensional line of sight (1D LOS) velocity, one of the critical inputs and prominent indicator for landslide susceptibility, is generated by processing 60 Sentinel-1A scenes using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) algorithm. The 1D LOS velocity map, generally used for quantitative monitoring slow moving landslides, is used here as a thematic layer. The thematic layers and LSMs were fed to the proposed DMLP-LSM network as input and output, respectively. The developed model reached an accuracy of 91.47% with precision, specificity and ROC AUC score as 92.11%, 95.55% and 0.9072, respectively. It further identified nearly 15 square km area as susceptible to landslide. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with two well-known machine learning models for LSM preparation, namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). In terms of accuracy, DMLP-LSM and RF had similar performance, but better than SVM. The velocity maps derived from MT-InSAR processing played a prominent role in the generation of LSM, supporting model training and performance. The proposed model achieved highest precision and specificity, and its performance would also improve LSM preparation when using larger datasets. The obtained results are promising, and the trained model can help in the rapid generation of LSMs. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of Thermal anomaly Preceding Northern Red Sea Earthquake, the 16th June 2020
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the 16th June, 2020, a moderate earthquake (Mw = 5.2) hit the Northern Red Sea region, Egypt, that was felt throughout the Hurghada and Sharm El-Sheikh cities and the surrounding areas without any damages. The thermal anomaly before the earthquakes was widely studied with satellite data, such as NOAA/AVHRR and MODIS. The case study aims to monitor and demonstrate the possibility of any variation of the thermal anomaly of sea surface temperature (SST) before and after the 16th June 2020 earthquake and to correlate the results with the previous heat flow study (deep thermal action). The Daytime/Nighttime (SST) data are retrieved from the OBPG serves as a Distributed Active Archive Center (OB. DAAC). The outputs indicated a thermal anomaly on the June 12th, 2020 a few days before the earthquake, covered a large area around the epicenter 60 km impact area, and reached a high value on the 15th June 2020, one day before the earthquake. For the deep thermal action of the entire crust, the earthquake frequency distributions presumed from the reviewed catalogue indicated that the peak of the seismicity is concentrated close to the center of the rift axis in the Northern Red Sea. The heat flow measurements are increased toward the center of the Red Sea rift and decreased toward both sides, generating some partial melt of the rocks and producing crustal subsidence at the center of the Red Sea rift. These results are compatible with the pattern of the seismic activity and heat flow effect around the epicenter. It could be considered as a short-term precursor of the earthquake.

TI  - The comparative study of three nonparametric methods of SAR tomography for building reconstruction
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) has indicated significant potentials for threedimensional (3D) reconstruction of buildings in urban areas. A large number of SAR images are thus required to perform tomographic inversions in non-parametric spectral estimators. To this end, in the case of a limited choice of SAR acquisitions, the present study aims to evaluate the capabilities of five non-parametric spectral estimation (SE) techniques, including linear prediction (LP), maximum entropy (ME), and minimum norm (MN), Capon, and beamforming (BF) in the tomographic reconstruction of urban environments. The performance analysis is carried out by using both simulated and real SAR datasets. The study results demonstrate that the proposed efficient LP estimator, minimizing the average output signal power over the antenna array elements, can separate the layover scatterers along the height direction. This low-computational SE method is thus able to clean side lobes while using a small number of observations. The proposed algorithms, as applied on TerraSAR-X strip-map images of the city of Tehran, Iran, verify the effectiveness of the non-parametric LP reconstruction technique for urban buildings. The estimated height of the scatterers also indicates that the LP estimator is similar to the field-based measurements once compared with ME, MN, Capon, and BF reconstruction methods.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity and estimation of PM10 concentration over Brahmaputra Valley using geographic weighted regression model assimilating surface, MODIS, and ERA-interim reanalysis data
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The geographic weighted regression (GWR) model is utilized to estimate PM10 from a 3-year (2016 to 2018) collocated monthly mean of predictive variables, aerosol optical depth (AOD 550 nm), planetary boundary layer (PBL), and air temperature (AT) over the intermontane Brahmaputra River Valley (BRV). The coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.62) and the root mean square error (RMSE = 22.74 mu g/m(3)) obtained from the GWR model fitting decreased by 0.09 (R-2 = 0.53) and 0.14 mu g/m(3) (RMSE = 22.60) in cross-validation analysis. Regression coefficient (beta) values computed by GWR reflect the heterogeneity of relationship among the variables. The PM10-AOD 550-nm relationship showed asymmetry (strong positive to negative beta values) at spatial scale from the west (beta(1) = 5.94 to 23.91), central (beta(1) = -2.92 to -17.68), to the east (beta(1) = -4.19 to -27.27) valleys of the BRV due to the effect of local meteorological conditions. Results of monthly mean value of PM10 and the predictive variables indicate surface PM10 and AOD 550-nm mean values vary strongly in sites over the valley. This variation is dependent on the proximity to sources and dispersal mechanisms within the PBL. Further in this study, the PM10 (mu g/m(3)) is predicted at valley site scale for 2016 based on annual mean of AT, PBL, and AOD 550 nm at higher spatial resolution. The results show interesting spatial contrast of AOD 550 nm and PM10 with PBL.

TI  - SAR based flood risk analysis: A case study Kerala flood 2018
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A short span of abnormal precipitation in the year 2018 has ravaged the southwestern state of Kerala. It has resulted in widespread flooding and landslides with more than 400 casualties. The present study has implemented the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)-based Sentinel 1C band satellite data. The researchers have analyzed the remotely sensed data to examine the severely affected areas. The study area included Alappuzha, Kottayam, Thrissur, and Pathanamthitta districts. The daily and monthly precipitation data is acquired from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). During 2018, Kerala has experienced a severe escalation in the volume of rainfall from June onwards till September. The current study has analyzed the spatial and temporal variation in the extent of severe flooding in Kerala during the monsoon months of 2018. The south-central parts of Kerala are most severely impacted by flooding. The districts of Alappuzha and Kottayam were severely affected, followed by Thrissur and Pathanamthitta, moderate to low. The outcomes of this assessment would be helpful for risk-informed planning in the pre-disaster context and help in decision-making for response planning and early recovery. (c) 2021 COSPAR.

AB  - Purpose Despite recommendations from national organizations supporting the use of lymph node assessment (LNA) among patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at time of mastectomy, variation in practice patterns across the United States has been observed. However, few studies have evaluated LNA differences and rurality. Methods Data from the SEER Patterns of Care studies were used to identify women who underwent mastectomy for newly diagnosed DCIS during 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Weighted multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between rural-urban residence and the use of LNA. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing the use of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) versus sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Results Of the 504 patients included in the analysis, approximately 81% underwent LNA at time of mastectomy with lower rates of use observed among rural patients (66%) versus urban patients (82%). In multivariate analysis, LNA increased over time (p < 0.0001), and rural patients were less likely to receive LNA compared to urban patients [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06-0.66]. However, the likelihood of undergoing ALND relative to SLNB was lower among rural compared to urban patients (aOR = 0.16; 95% CI 0.03-0.73). Conclusions Over time, the use of LNA with mastectomy has increased among DCIS patients. However, significant rural-urban differences in the use and type of LNA persist. The findings of this study highlight the importance of continued research aimed at examining the impact of rurality on the receipt of high-quality cancer care.

TI  - Cannabis industry lobbying in the Colorado state legislature in fiscal years 2010-2021
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The cannabis industry has an interest in creating a regulatory environment which maximizes profits at the cost of public health, similar to the tobacco, alcohol, and food industries. This study sought to describe the cannabis industry's lobbying activities in the Colorado State Legislature over time.Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed publicly available lobbying expenditures data from fiscal years (FY) 2010-2021. Measures included inflation-adjusted monthly lobbying expenditures by funder and lobbyist, origin of funding, and lobbyist descriptions of cannabis industry clients. This dataset was supplemented with business license documentation, legislative histories, and public testimony.Results: The cannabis industry spent over $7 million (inflation adjusted) from FY 2010-2021 to lobby the Colorado legislature on 367 bills. Over $800,000 (11% of total cannabis spending) was from out-of-state clients. In 48% of lobbyist reports lobbyists did not disclose their funder's cannabis affiliation, and cannabis organizations used strategies that may have obscured the true amount and source of funding. Lobbyists and agencies concurrently represented the alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis industries, possibly facilitating inter-industry alliances when interests align.Conclusion: The cannabis industry dedicated significant resources towards lobbying the Colorado State Legislature on behalf of policies intended to increase cannabis use. Creating transparency about the relationships between the cannabis industry, related industries, and policymakers is essential to ensure appropriate regulation of cannabis products.

TI  - Economic values for production, fertility and mastitis traits for temperate dairy cattle breeds in tropical Sri Lanka
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic values for annual milk yield (MY, kg), annual fat yield (FY, kg), annual protein yield (PY, kg), age at first calving (AFC, days), number of services per conception (NSC), calving interval (CI, days) and mastitis episodes (MS) were derived for temperate dairy cattle breeds in tropical Sri Lanka using a bio-economic model. Economic values were calculated on a per cow per year basis. Derived economic values in rupees (LKR) for MY, FY and PY were 107, -162 and -15, while for AFC, NSC, CI and MS, economic values were -59, -270, -84 and -8,303. Economic values for FY and PY further decreased with higher feed prices, and a less negative economic value for FY was obtained with increased price for fat. Negative economic values for FY and PY show that genetic improvement for these traits is not economical due to the high feed costs and/or the insufficient payment for fat and protein. Therefore, revision of milk fat and protein payments is recommended. Furthermore, the breeding objective developed in this study was dominated by milk production and fertility traits. Adaptability and functional traits that are important in a temperate dairy cattle breeding programme in tropical Sri Lanka, such as longevity, feed efficiency, disease resistance and heat tolerance should be recorded to incorporate them in the breeding objective. Continued trait recording of all traits is recommended to ensure dairy cows can be selected more effectively in a tropical environment based on a breeding objective that also includes adaptability and functional traits.

TI  - Establishment of SAR calibration site at Antarctica: Pre-NISAR calibration activity
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Upcoming Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions with larger swath like NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) (similar to 250 km) requires a large, flat and homogeneous low-background site, free from human-made structures for point targets deployment for calibration. Finding out such a large, flat, homogeneous area devoid of perceived sources of radar clutter is a challenging task. In this regard, Antarctica is a potential site for calibration as it fulfills many of the criteria required for the ideal calibration site and suitable for setting up a corner reflector (CR) network for SAR calibration. This network will help in the calibration study and aid the studies related to Interferometric SAR (InSAR) viz. ice velocity estimation. As a part of this activity, in-house designed and developed CRs were installed near Indian research base stations Maitri and Bharati at Antarctica during the 38th Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (ISEA) during 2018-2019. Corner reflectors were designed keeping in mind the harsh environment of Antarctica, such as high katabatic winds, blizzards, snowfall and low temperature. Temporal and seasonal analysis of radar backscatter data using available Indian Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT-1) and European SENTINEL-1 SAR satellite over Maitri and Bharati was carried out to find out the suitable CR deployment site. Super-hydrophobic microwave transparent cover was designed and installed over CRs to protect snow accumulation. Hydrophobic radar absorbing materials were installed over central-mount to decrease the background noise due to it. Various tests such as structural analysis of total CR system, thermal analysis of materials and Radar Cross Section (RCS) characterization of CR were done before sending it to Antarctica. Integrated Wide Swath (IW) mode data of Sentinel-1 satellite was used for analyzing time-series response of CR in SAR image. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The accuracy of intraoperative frozen section examination of sentinel lymph nodes in squamous cell cancer of the vulva
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative pathologic examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and patient outcomes in vulva cancer.Methods. This retrospective study included patients with unifocal, <4 cm, invasive vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and dinically negative groin nodes treated with SLN biopsy from January 2008-March 2020. Intraoperative SLN frozen section and final pathology were compared. If the SLN was negative, inguinal femoral lymphadenectomy (IFLD) was omitted. Recurrence location and groin recurrence free survival (RFS) were assessed.Results. The SLN cohort included 173 patients, with 258 groins. On frozen section, there were 36/258 positive and 222 negative groins. On final pathology, there were 39/258 positive: 31 macrometastases, 6 micrometastases, 2 isolated tumor cells (ITCs) and 219 negative groins. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for intraoperative detection of metastatic disease, was 89.7% and 99.5%, 97.2% and 98.2%, respectively. There was 1 false positive and 4 false negative frozen section results where final pathology revealed 2 ITCs, 1 micrometastasis and 1 macrometastasis. Based on intraoperative results, thirty patients (173%) underwent immediate IFLD.Median follow up was 38.0 (1-137.8) months. The 3-year groin RFS was 91.6% (95% CI 862-97.4%) for negative SLNs and 64.6% (95% CI 46.5-89.7%) for positive SLNs on frozen section. Similarly, the 3-year groin RFS was 91.7% (95% CI 86.3-97.4%) for negative, 58.4% (95% CI 38.5-87.7%) for macrometastases and 100% for miaometastases/ITCs on final pathology.Conclusions. Intraoperative assessment of SLNs is accurate to determine need for IFLD and does not compromise patient outcomes in vulvar cancer. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cerambyx miles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and Oobius rudnevi (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae): a new host-parasitoid association revealed by laboratory tests and sentinel eggs in the wild
T2  - ANNALES DE LA SOCIETE ENTOMOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The parasitism of the encyrtid wasp Oobius rudnevi (Nowicki, 1928) on the eggs of the longhorn beetle Cerambyx (Cerambyx) miles Bonelli, 1812, is recorded for first time through field and laboratory trials. Field trials with sentinel eggs of C. miles were conducted in SW Spain oak forests in which O. rudnevi was known to occur, using as positive controls sentinel eggs of both Cerambyx (Cerambyx) cerdo Linnaeus, 1758, and Cerambyx (Cerambyx) welensii (Kuster, 1845), the only two O. rudnevi hosts known to date. Laboratory assays were conducted using non-choice tests and choice tests (C. miles vs. C. cerdo). Results showed that C. miles eggs were attacked and successfully parasitised by O. rudnevi in the wild, uncorrected parasitism rates (P-U) being similar to those of C. cerdo and C. welensii (2.2-5.2%), and net parasitism rates (P-N) even significantly higher in C. miles (8.9%) than in C. welensii (3.3%). Interestingly, C. miles sentinel eggs were parasitised in holm oak forests in which C. miles was unknown to occur, suggesting that egg-derived volatile cues were important in host location. In the laboratory, non-choice tests showed no differences in P-N among C. miles, C. cerdo and C. welensii (80-88%), signifying that O. rudnevi performed alike in the three hosts. Choice tests showed that O. rudnevi did not exhibit host preference between C. miles (53%) and C. cerdo (47%). Similar tests proved that eggs of Cerambyx (Microcerambyx) scopolii Fuessly, 1775, and Prinobius myardi Mulsant, 1842, were never selected as hosts by O. rudnevi. Our results and the chorological, ecological and phylogenetic available evidence suggest that O. rudnevi behaves as an oligophagous egg parasitoid, which could be associated to other Cerambyx (s. str.) species over the Western Palaearctic realm.

TI  - Utilisation of spaceborne C-band dual pol Sentinel-1 SAR data for simplified regression-based soil organic carbon estimation in Rupnagar, Punjab, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a measure of the total carbon content of the soil and is a vital soil health indicator. Over the decades, SOC has been estimated using sampling followed by rigorous laboratory-based testing methods. Spaceborne Microwave/Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) remote sensing has proven to be a versatile tool for various soil study applications. However, there have been very few studies conducted for SOC estimation using SAR remote sensing. This study utilises time-series, C-band remotely sensed SAR data from Sentinel-1 A satellite for SOC estimation and compared the performances of Random Forest (RF) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression models over agricultural areas of Rupnagar district of Punjab in India. A set of 96 soil samples were collected from 32 different agricultural field locations in Rupnagar district between November 2019 to January 2020. SAR backscatter of Vertically emitted and Vertically received (VV) and Vertically emitted and Horizontally received (VH) polarisation channels, from Sentinel-1, soil moisture, electrical conductivity, pH, temperature and SOC from the laboratory-based testing methods were used as regression parameters. The RF regression gave a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.78 and R2 statistics of 0.887, while the OLS method performed better with an RMSE of 0.53 and an R2 value of 0.907. It was also observed that the backscatter from VV and VH polarisation channels, when used synergistically with field data, have the highest Feature Importance (FI) score in both RF and OLS regression models for SOC estimation.

TI  - Unravelling drivers of field-scale digital mapping of topsoil organic carbon and its implications for nitrogen practices
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is essential for sugarcane growth, with one source mineralisation of soil organic carbon (SOC, %). To assist farmers determine suitable N fertiliser rates, the Six-Easy-Steps nutrient guidelines were devised by Sugar Research Australia and based on topsoil (0-0.3 m) SOC. Given the heterogeneous nature of SOC, a digital soil mapping (DSM) approach may be useful to map SOC at the field scale. This study aims to examine various models to predict SOC, including ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging (RK), machine learning (ML) such as random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), and hybrid models that combine ML with RK (i.e., RFRK and SVMRK). Various digital data sources, including proximal (i.e., gamma-ray [gamma-ray] and electromagnetic [EM] induction data) and remote (i.e., land surface temperature [LST, degrees C]) sensing data were explored in combination and alone. Minimum calibration sample size (i.e., 110-10) was also investigated. The comparisons were validated using a hold-out dataset, with prediction agreement (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient [LCCC]) and accuracy (ratio of performance to deviation [RPD]) assessed. The most statistically significant digital data used in combination included gamma-ray (i.e., total count [TC]), EM (i.e., 1mHcon and 2mHcon), remote (i.e., LST) and northing. The SVMRK model performed best when using all calibration data, producing moderate agreement (LCCC = 0.73) and fair (RPD = 1.65) accuracy. This was also the case when sample size was >= 50, but when it was < 50, RFRF returned equivalent agreement (0.70) and accuracy (1.55). Similar results were achieved when only gamma-ray (i.e., TC) was used, however, RFRK produced moderate agreement and fair accuracy using as few as 20 and as many as 70 samples, with the optimal being 40 (i.e., LCCC = 0.79 and RPD = 1.7). By comparison, OK and RK generally produced poor agreement (<= 0.65) and accuracy (< = 1.4) regardless of sample size. The final DSM using RFRK provided an indication of soil condition that limits soil capability to store N as a function of SOC and acts a means to replenish soil capital with N application rates according to the Six-Easy-Steps. Specifically, Tenosols and Rudosols require 130 kg/ha to 120 kg/ha, whereas Kandosols require 110 and 100 kg/ha. The DSM equates to a potential similar to 22 % decrease in the cost of N fertiliser application, relative to a one-size fits all approach.

TI  - Evaluation and projection of a snow coverage rate over the Upper Yarkant River Basin, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on snow coverage remote sensing data NOAA, the simulation ability of the snow coverage rate from the core experiments of the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) over the Upper Yarkant River Basin was evaluated. The ensemble mean of the eight models was used to project future changes in the snow coverage rate over the basin under the three different representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The results show that the snow coverage rate of the eight models can basically simulate a sharp drop of the spatial distribution from the west to the northeast; all the eight models have the capacity to simulate the snow coverage rate of the Yarkant River Basin analyzed from the correlation analysis (R), the ratio of spatial standard deviation (SDR) and the S index. The simulation capacity of the eight models in spring, autumn and winter is stronger than the one in summer, and the ensemble mean of the eight models simulates the best. Under the scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, changes in the snow coverage rate show negative differences in most areas over the basin, only the local part shows positive differences. Under the scenario of RCP8.5, changes in the snow coverage rate in all seasons present negative differences in the whole basin, and the decreasing trends are more obvious. Under the same emission scenario, the negative differences in winter are weaker than those of other seasons, and the most significant negative difference appears in spring and autumn. The projection scenarios indicate a clearly decreasing trend under the different emission scenarios. Under the scenario of RCP2.6, the decreasing trend is not obvious as it fails the 90% confidence level test. Under the scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the decreasing trend of the snow coverage rate is significant, passing the 99% confidence level test.

TI  - Trends and variability in snowmelt in China under climate change
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt is a major fresh water resource, and quantifying snowmelt and its variability under climate change is necessary for the planning and management of water resources. Spatiotemporal changes in snow properties in China have drawn wide attention in recent decades; however, country-wide assessments of snowmelt are lacking. Using precipitation and temperature data with a high spatial resolution (0.5'; approximately 1 km), this study calculated the monthly snowmelt in China for the 1951-2017 period, using a simple temperature index model, and the model outputs were validated using snowfall, snow depth, snow cover extent and snow water equivalent. Precipitation and temperature scenarios developed from five CMIP5 models were used to predict future snowmelt in China under three different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The results show that the mean annual snowmelt in China from 1951 to 2017 is 2.41 x 10(11) m 3 yr(-1). The mean annual snowmelt values in Northern Xinjiang, Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau - China's three main stable snow cover regions - are 0.18 x 10(11), 0.42 x 10(11) and 1.15 x 10(11) m(3) yr(-1), respectively. From 1951 to 2017, the snowmelt increased significantly in the Tibetan Plateau and decreased significantly in northern, central and southeastern China. In the whole of China, there was a decreasing trend in snowmelt, but this was not statistically significant. The mean annual snowmelt runoff ratios are generally more than 10 % in almost all third-level basins in West China, more than 5 % in third-level basins in North and Northeast China and less than 2 % in third-level basins in South China. From 1951 to 2017, the annual snowmelt runoff ratios decreased in most third-level basins in China. Under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the projected snowmelt in China in the near future (2011-2040; mid-future -2041-2070; far future - 2071-2099) may decrease by 10.4 % (15.8 %; 13.9 %), 12.0 % (17.9 %; 21.1 %) and 11.7 % (24.8 %; 36.5 %) compared to the reference period (1981-2010), respectively. Most of the projected mean annual snowmelt runoff ratios in third-level basins in different future periods are lower than those in the reference period. Low temperature regions can tolerate more warming, and the snowmelt change in these regions is mainly influenced by precipitation; however, the snowmelt change in warm regions is more sensitive to temperature increases. The spatial variability in snowmelt changes may lead to regional differences in the impact of snowmelt on water supply.

TI  - Initial risk perception and feeling of preparedness of primary care physicians regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, France and Spain in February 2020
T2  - BMC PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The knowledge of risk perceptions in primary care could help health authorities to manage epidemics. Methods A European multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted in France, Belgium and Spain to describe the perceptions, the level of anxiety and the feeling of preparedness of primary healthcare physicians towards the COVID-19 infection at the beginning of the pandemic. The factors associated with the feeling of preparedness were studied using multivariate logistic regressions. Results A total of 511 physicians participated to the study (response rate: 35.2%). Among them, only 16.3% (n=82) were highly anxious about the pandemic, 50.6% (n=254) had the feeling to have a high level of information, 80.5% (n=409) found the measures taken by the health authorities suitable to limit the spread of COVID-19, and 45.2% (n=229) felt prepared to face the epidemic. Factors associated with feeling prepared were: being a Spanish practitioner (adjusted OR=4.34; 95%CI [2.47; 7.80]), being a man (aOR=2.57, 95%CI [1.69; 3.96]), finding the measures taken by authorities appropriate (aOR=1.72, 95%CI [1.01; 3.00]) and being highly informed (aOR=4.82, 95%CI [2.62; 9.19]). Conclusions Regarding the dramatic evolution of the pandemic in Europe in the weeks following the study, it appears that information available at this time and transmitted to the physicians could have given a wrong assessment of the spread and the severity of the disease. It seems essential to better integrate the primary care physicians into the information, training and protection channels. A comparison between countries could help to select the most effective measures in terms of information and communication.

TI  - Phenotyping a diversity panel of quinoa using UAV-retrieved leaf area index, SPAD-based chlorophyll and a random forest approach
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Given its high nutritional value and capacity to grow in harsh environments, quinoa has significant potential to address a range of food security concerns. Monitoring the development of phenotypic traits during field trials can provide insights into the varieties best suited to specific environmental conditions and management strategies. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a promising means for phenotyping and offer the potential for new insights into relative plant performance. During a field trial exploring 141 quinoa accessions, a UAV-based multispectral camera was deployed to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) and SPAD-based chlorophyll across 378 control and 378 saline-irrigated plots using a random forest regression approach based on both individual spectral bands and 25 different vegetation indices (VIs) derived from the multispectral imagery. Results show that most VIs had stronger correlation with the LAI and SPAD-based chlorophyll measurements than individual bands. VIs including the red-edge band had high importance in SPAD-based chlorophyll predictions, while VIs including the near infrared band (but not the red-edge band) improved LAI prediction models. When applied to individual treatments (i.e. control or saline), the models trained using all data (i.e. both control and saline data) achieved high mapping accuracies for LAI (R-2 = 0.977-0.980, RMSE = 0.119-0.167) and SPAD-based chlorophyll (R-2 = 0.983-0.986, RMSE = 2.535-2.861). Overall, the study demonstrated that UAV-based remote sensing is not only useful for retrieving important phenotypic traits of quinoa, but that machine learning models trained on all available measurements can provide robust predictions for abiotic stress experiments.

TI  - A comparative study in quantification of maize evapotranspiration for Iranian maize farm using SEBAL and METRIC-1 EEFLux algorithms
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the key components of the hydrological cycle, and its accurate estimation is very important in agricultural usages. In this study, actual daily ET (ETa) from the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration/Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFLux) algorithms were used to compare the relative performance of the algorithms for the Landsat 8 images during the maize growth period. The results indicated that ETa was low at the beginning of the growing season and then came up to the middle of the growing season and then decreased due to decreasing temperature as well as changes in maize cover. The EEFLux algorithm has estimated about 7.71% of daily ET more than the SEBAL algorithm at the Arak maize farm. The results of performance evaluation showed that root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE), percent bias error (PBIAS), and coefficient of determination (R-2) criteria were obtained 0.711, 0.807, 7.398, and 0.885, respectively, based on the EEFLux algorithm and for SEBAL algorithm were equal to 1.046, 0.582, 15.080, and 0.793, respectively. According to the Taylor diagrams and observed data (lysimeter data), the EEFLux algorithm was closer to measured ETa values and had a higher correlation and a less standard deviation than the SEBAL algorithm. Therefore, the EEFLux algorithm had better estimation than the SEBAL algorithm.

TI  - Initial Experience Using Magseed for Breast Lesion Localization Compared With Wire-Guided Localization: Analysis of Volume and Margin Clearance Rates
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Detection of nonpalpable lesions requiring surgical intervention has increased during the past several decades. Techniques have evolved to help surgeons locate lesions in the operating room. Disadvantages of wire localization has led to the use of new approaches for surgical guidance. Magnetic seeds have been suggested to improve workflow and cosmetic result. Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzed consecutive patients undergoing lumpectomy or excisional biopsy with the guidance of wire localization or magnetic seeds. The optimal and total resected volumes were calculated from pathology records, and the calculated resection volumes were compared by localization approach. Margin positivity and need for reoperation were reviewed and compared. Results Each group included 148 patients. The majority were treated with lumpectomy and did not undergo preoperative chemotherapy. The operative characteristics did not vary by group. Considering only lumpectomy cases, total volume resected (13.7 vs. 17.1; p = 0.003) and calculated resection ratios (1.8 vs. 2.5; p = 0.02) were significantly lower in the magnetic seed group. The rates of positive margins (10% vs. 14%) and reoperation (12.8% vs. 17.3%) were non-significantly lower than in the wire localization cases. Conclusions Magnetic seeds were successfully used for lesion localization in this cohort. Pathologic examination of specimens suggested that the surgeons were able to remove closer to optimal volumes of tissue than those using wire-guided intervention. Removal of less tissue did not result in higher rates of margin positivity or a need for re-intervention to achieve negative margin status. Magnetic seeds are a feasible and non-inferior approach that overcomes many drawbacks of other localization methods.

TI  - Aerosol-Cloud Interaction over South-Central India and Adjoining Coastal Areas
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrieved (2009-2015) aerosol and cloud products over South-Central India, including adjoining coastal areas, were quantitatively analyzed to explore aerosol-cloud interaction and to estimate aerosol indirect effect (AIE). The spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed high AOD(550 nm) (similar to 0.7) over the northern India and is attributed to the long- and short-range transport of desert dust aerosols, dense population, and industrialization. The mean seasonal AOD(550 nm) over region decreases from (0.55 +/- 0.11) to (0.45 +/- 0.05) and to (0.39 +/- 0.04) for monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons, respectively. The western Indian regions, particularly Pune and Jaipur, showed higher mean AOD(500 nm) as compared to other cities. The positive correlation of aerosol indirect effect (AIE) with AOD for Pune and Pondicherry through pre- as well post- monsoon seasons for all cities except Pondicherry is ascribed to hygroscopic aerosol particulate growth. The aerosol size spectra undergo significant transformation from dominant high accumulation-mode during September-February months [with Angstrom exponent (AE) > 1.0] to dominant augmented coarse-mode (AE < 1.0) through March to June-July period. The AOD(500 nm)-to-cloud fraction (CF) correlation coefficients range between 0.05 and 0.46 for coastal region, while for Jaipur, Pune, and overall study region, the CFs are 0.53, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively. The pre-monsoon months recorded lower (0.4-0.6 mu m) cloud effective radii values than monsoon season (0.8-1.3 mu m). The AOD-to-cloud liquid water path correlations for Goa and Pune (0.30-0.48) are higher than other cities (0.01-0.19). The AIE average values for metropolitan, semi-arid, coastal, high-altitude sites, and overall study region were found to be - 0.168, - 0.025, - 0.104, - 0.101, and - 0.128, respectively. There occurs a noticeable negative AIE for three categories (viz., Metropolitan, coastal, and high-altitude station), while for semi-arid category, there exists a prominent Twomey (positive AIE) effect.

TI  - Assessment of PRISMA Level-2 Hyperspectral Imagery for Large Scale Satellite-Derived Bathymetry Retrieval
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, several satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) workflows are based on a variety of satellite imagery which are analyzed by empirical or analytical methods. The latest availability of PRISMA hyperspectral data provides a new opportunity for testing their application in shallow water bathymetry mapping. Here we utilize two Level-2 PRISMA scenes from the Caribbean Sea capturing seafloor areas with diverse benthic features and we analyze them using the shallow water analytical models provided by the water-color simulator (WASI) software. The presented study examines the influence of spatial resolution and end-member spectra on the SDB output. Consequently, in one study area we apply inversion using additional reference spectra and in the other study area we exploit the PRISMA panchromatic band for producing a pan-sharpened, hyperspectral cube for bathymetry inversion. The results show good correlation with reference bathymetry data (sonar and admiralty chart) suggesting that PRISMA imagery has a clear potential in optical bathymetry studies. The use of appropriate end-member spectra assists in enhancing the accuracy of SDB, and pan-sharpened PRISMA imagery assists in improving the results when detailed bathymetry is required. PRISMA imagery can be effectively analyzed with open-source software WASI-2D and thus contribute new bathymetric data to regional-scale seafloor mapping projects.

TI  - Genome-wide association study for milk production traits in Dual-Purpose Belgian Blue cows
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to estimate genetic parameters and identify genomic regions associated with milk production traits during the first three parities in Dual-Purpose Belgian Blue (DPBB) cows. Edited data were 135,646 test-day milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), fat percentage (FP), protein percentage (PP), and somatic cell count (SCC) collected from 1988 to 2020 on 20,744 lactations obtained from 10,345 cows in 128 herds. Data of 28,466 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), located on 29 Bos taurus (BTA) autosomes, for 1,699 animals (639 males and 1,060 females) were used. Random regression test-day models were used to estimate genetic parameters through the Bayesian Gibbs sampling method. The SNP solutions were estimated using a single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction approach. The proportion of genetic variance explained by windows of 25 adjacent SNPs (with an average size of similar to 2 Mb) was calculated, and regions accounting for at least 1.0 % of the total additive genetic variance were used to search for candidate genes. Mean heritability (h2) estimated for milk yield traits (MY, FY, PY, FP, and PP) ranged from 0.32 (FP) to 0.41 (PP), 0.30 (FP) to 0.41 (PP), and 0.29 (FP) to 0.39 (PP), in the first, second, and third parity, respectively. Mean h2 estimated for SCS in the first three parities ranged from 0.17 to 0.27. The highest genetic correlations were found between daily MY and PY, followed by those found between daily FY and PY. Negative genetic correlations were found between yield traits (MY, FY, PY) and SCS. In total, seven genomic regions (BTA1 (n = 2), BTA2, BTA7, BTA10, BTA22, and BTA26) were identified to be associated with the included traits. The identified genomic regions showed contrasting results between parities and among the different stages of each parity. It suggests that differential sets of candidate genes underlie the phenotypic expression of the considered traits among parities and lactation stages of each parity. The findings of this study may be used for future implementation of genomic evaluation to improve lactation performances in DPBB cows.

TI  - Land use changes and raptor population trends: A twelve-year monitoring of two common species in agricultural landscapes of Western
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There are serious concerns about the ecological degradation caused by modern agriculture and its impact on top-chains predators. But, scientists still disagree on how to assess which are the winners and losers of Anthropocene biodiversity changes. In this field of research, many studies have been carried out on passerine birds but long-term ones, and especially on raptors, are still missing. Our study reports a twelve-year survey on two diurnal common raptors (the Buzzard, Buteo buteo and the Eurasian kestrel, Falco tinnunculus) facing recent land use changes in Western France farmland landscapes. Precise remote sensing data were analyzed each year, allowing us to precisely describe land use changes and stability along this time series. Buzzards showed reduced abundances in intensified landscapes and responded negatively to wood habitat instability while kestrels were more abundant and stable when areas of meadows increased. According to life history traits of these two-raptor species, we may suppose that buzzards, as generalist predators, mainly suffer of nesting site decrease while kestrels suffer of food depletion and namely voles living in meadows. No decreasing or increasing regional or local trends was observed for buzzards during these 12 years confirming that populations seem adjust their numbers to fit to local resources. Inversely, kestrels exhibit significant population collapses at both regional and local scales. If limiting wood habitats fragmentation or disturbance would optimize buzzard densities, drastic management measures improving surfaces and quality of grassland habitats will be necessary to reverse the decline of the Eurasian kestrel, highlighted by this study.

TI  - Does political resource endowment promote carbon productivity? A case study of counties along the Long March areas in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - whether political resource endowment affect regional low-carbon economic development has attracted the attention of many relevant stakeholders. Given that, by using remote sensing data such as nighttime light data and introducing the spatial econometric models, this paper selected 519 counties covering 69 prefecture-level cities in China's 14 provinces to explore the impact of political resource endowment on carbon productivity at the county level. The results showed that regional carbon productivity along the Long March areas was more 12% higher than that along non-Long March areas. Moreover, a series of robustness tests also verify that political resource endowment can effectively promote regional carbon productivity. Additionally, regional industrial structure is the most significant influencing factor in reducing carbon productivity. Our results also showed economic benefits generated from per unit carbon emissions in these counties along the Long March areas were obviously higher than those of counties along the non-Long March areas, indicating that counties along non-Long March areas should pay more attention to improving the balanced development of economic growth and environmental protection. Finally, for counties along the Long March areas and their surrounding regions, their carbon productivity spatially presents the typical spatial autocorrelation trend. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the transformation of industrial structure with the optimization of industrial spatial layout, and formulate the targeted improvement plan on carbon productivity for counties along the Long March areas to achieve coordinated low-carbon development.

T2  - NANOMEDICINE-NANOTECHNOLOGY BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphatic metastasis plays an important role in malignant tumor invasion. Efficient identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN) is extremely significant for designing therapeutic strategies and assessing prognosis. In this work, we developed a natural cuttlefish melanin nanoprobe for the preoperative and intraoperative evaluation of lymphatic metastasis. The cuttlefish melanin nanoparticle could improve the water-solubility and biocompatibility of the near-infrared-II (NIR-II) dye, and extend the retention time of small molecule dye. The NIR-II imaging results verified that the nanoparticles have a high accumulation, high sensitivity, and high signal-to-noise ratio in the lymphatic system. Moreover, the nanoparticles have obvious naked-eye identification potential due to their natural brownish-black color. Additionally, the nanoparticles can combine with Gd ions to achieve preoperative lymphatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results of this study provide a unique approach to effectively identify and accurately remove lymph nodes before operation and during surgery, exhibiting tremendous potential in clinical translation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Desert landform detection and mapping using a semi-automated object-based image analysis approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional landform modeling approaches are labor-intensive and time-consuming. We proposed and developed a semi-automated object-based image analysis (OBIA) rule set approach for desert landforms detection and mapping. Sentinel-2 image and digital elevation model (DEM) were acquired for the study area. The multi resolution segmentation algorithm was employed on the datasets to select relevant features to define appropriate segmentation scales for all landform categories. Object-based rule sets were then employed using spatial (DEM and its derivatives, e.g., slope, aspect, and hillshade) and spectral information for semi-automated classification of the desert landforms. Desert landforms are detected and classified into four classes: saline dome, barchan, playa, and dune. The Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation (FSE) technique was applied in concert with the error matrix to validate the accuracy of the classification results based on field data, Google Earth, and geological maps. Our findings demonstrated the highest confidence of overall accuracy (OA) 96.21%, 92.58%, 95.99%, and 95.05% respectively, for the saline dome, barchan, playa, and dune. Results showed the strong potential of the rule-based OBIA remote sensing approach for desert landform detection and delineation. Results further demonstrated the efficiency of spatial and spectral features for desert landforms detection and delineation.

TI  - A new nonlinear method for downscaling land surface temperature by integrating guided and Gaussian filtering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST), retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) bands of remote sensing satellites, is an important parameter for various climate and environmental models. TIR bands detect a range of low-energy wavelengths, resulting in a coarser spatial resolution than other multispectral bands, and limiting applicability in heterogeneous urban regions. In this study, a new nonlinear method for LST downscaling, called Three Layers Composition (TLC), was proposed. The TLC integrates large-scale temperature variations, re-constructed detailed characteristics of LSTs, and strong boundary information. The performance of TLC is compared with disaggregation of radiometric surface temperature (DisTrad), thermal imagery sharpening (TsHARP), and random forest (RF) for a complex landscape in Beijing city, which has agriculture, forest, and massive impervious surfaces. The scale effects on the downscaled LSTs (DLST) were analyzed from the aspects of spatial resolution and spatial contexts. The experimental results indicate that the nonlinear algorithms (TLC and RF) perform better than linear methods (DisTrad and TsHARP). Indicated by coefficient of determination (R-2), centered root-mean square error (CRMSE), and correlation coefficient (CC), TLC (R-2 = 0.901, CRMSE = 0.319, CC = 0.951) was the most effective and workable technique for predicting LSTs, followed by RF (0.768, 0.502, 0.874), TsHARP (0.544, 0.652, 0.734), and DisTrad (0.518, 0.751, 0.719). Larger experimental regions and larger ratios between initial and target resolution weaken the accuracy of DLST. TLC indicated a stronger ability to resist the influence of such scale effects. Traditional downscaling methods (DisTrad, TsHARP, and RF) are trained with global LSTpredictor relationships and predict the DLST point by point, which can result in significantly biased estimates for very high or very low temperatures. Addressing this issue, TLC advantageously preserves the texture similarity between LST and its predictors, and yields more precise DLST, which showed higher consistency with the reference LST. Considering high accuracy and low computation time, TLC may be a safe technique for LST downscaling in other regions and different remote sensing sensors.

Long-term AOD trends across the globe are obtained from the multi satellite measurements that include MODerate resolution Imaging Spectral-radiometer (MODIS on-board Terra (T) and Aqua (A), between 2001 and 2020), Multi-angle Imaging Spectral-Radiometer (MISR, 2001-2020), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP, 2006-2020) observations using both the linear as well as multivariate regression analysis. Before evaluating the trends, a detailed comparison has been made with the ground-based AEronet RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations (2001-2020) obtained from more than 80 stations covering the globe. A high (above 0.7) to medium (from 0.3 to 0.7) spatial correlation is noticed among all the satellite measurements except the CALIOP (over a few sites) observations. However, MISR (CALIOP) observed AOD values underestimated (overestimated) with that measured by the AERONET AOD over the high aerosol loaded regions. In addition, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application version-2 (MERRA-2) AOD dataset is also able to simulate the mean as well as trend values across the globe. A decreasing trend in AOD is mostly seen in connection with the implementation of emission control policies (Eastern North America, Europe, and Eastern and Central China), reduction in forest fires (South America), and the stilling of surface winds over arid regions (Western North Africa). On the other hand, AOD trends perceived over the South Africa region have increased in comparison to the values reported earlier. Surprisingly, the CALIOP sensor has shown a rather significantly decreasing trend values over the Middle-East region. When compared, the region-wise linear regression trend analysis declined to give any statistically significant values over huge aerosol variability regions such as North Africa, South Africa, Middle-East, China, and the Indian regions. These robust findings will form a firm basis to evaluate the dependence of physical and chemical characteristics of aerosol on the observed AOD trends so that the impact of varied aerosols emission sources can be quantified accurately across the different regions.

TI  - A Maximum Caliber analysis of the Foldon Hypothesis
T2  - PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Different models of protein folding favor different mechanisms. Some models rely on a defined pathway, while other models rely on a more heterogeneous set of pathways. The Foldon Hypothesis is based on the concept of a defined pathway. According to the Foldon Hypothesis, protein folding is characterized by the stepwise assembly of small, cooperative units called foldons. The Maximum Caliber (Max Cal) method provides an opportunity to test this model. The Max Cal method gives the probabilities for dynamical trajectories, in much the same way that the maximum entropy principle gives the probabilities for equilibrium states. In this study, the Max Cal method was applied to folding data for the protein cytochrome c (cyt c; Hu W, Kan ZY, Mayne L, Englander SW. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016;113:3809-3814). The overall picture to emerge from this analysis is that the data do not require a dominant, defined pathway. The folding of cytochrome c is likely a heterogeneous process that includes multiple pathways.

TI  - Landsat-based multi-decadal spatio-temporal assessment of the vegetation greening and browning trend in the Eastern Indian Himalayan Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Indian Himalayan region (EIHR) is biodiversity-rich and ecologically sensitive. The region is under tremendous pressure due to a variety of challenges such as population pressure, shifting cultivation, and climate change leading to impact the vegetation. Therefore, the present study focuses on the evaluation of spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation utilizing the trend and rate of change of annual median NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) of EIHR. The annual median NDVI composite of EIHR was prepared for each year from 1990 to 2019 using Landsat satellite data collection available for the entire year in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The time series annual median NDVI data were analysed for the non-parametric (Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen) trend analysis. Based on these trends, regions of greening (increasing NDVI) and browning (decreasing NDVI) was assessed. It revealed that the majority of the EIHR has a more greening trend than browning with an annual rate of increase of NDVI between 0.002 and 0.007 with a very high (p<0.01) to high (p<0.05) level of confidence. Further, the NDVI trend was also analysed for its spatial distribution in forest type and forest cover of EIHR. It was found that while about 58% of the total forest area has shown a continuously increasing NDVI trend, only less than 1% area has a decreasing trend. The increase in the forest area and greening trends in NDVI may be attributed to the conservation efforts. The outcome of the study may help in the better management of forest ecosystems besides the future planning for landscape and regional development.

TI  - Mastectomy or Margin Re-excision? A Nomogram for Close/Positive Margins After Lumpectomy for DCIS
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Anatomic extent of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be uncertain in spite of clinical, pathologic, and imaging data. Consequently close/positive margins are common with lumpectomy for DCIS and often lead to a challenge in deciding whether to perform a re-excision or mastectomy. Patients and Methods From a single health system, we identified cases of lumpectomy for DCIS with close/positive margins who underwent re-excision for the purpose of constructing a nomogram. In total, 289 patients were available for analysis. The patients were randomly divided into two sets allocating 70% to the modeling and 30% to the validation set. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of overall positive margin status using multiple clinicopathologic predictors. Nomogram validation included internal tenfold cross-validation, internal bootstrap validation, and external validation for which a concordance index was calculated to assess the external validity. Results Significant predictors of persistent positive margins from regression modeling included necrosis at diagnosis (non-comedo or comedo); DCIS not associated with calcifications on core biopsy; high-grade DCIS; progesterone receptor positivity; and number of positive margins at initial surgery. When subjected to internal validation, the nomogram achieved an uncorrected concordance index of 0.7332, a tenfold cross-validation concordance index of 0.6795, and a bootstrap-corrected concordance index of 0.6881. External validation yielded an estimated concordance index of 0.7095. Conclusion Using clinical and pathologic variables from initial diagnosis and surgery for DCIS, this nomogram predicts persistent positive margins with margin re-excision, and may be a valuable tool in surgical decision-making.

TI  - Geospatial Mapping of Minerals Identified Using X-ray Diffraction in the Soils of Punjab State in the North-West of Indian Subcontinent
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image interpretation of 1:2,50,000 scale Landsat 4 MSS (band 2, 3, 4) composites was undertaken for delineating landforms using visual elements followed by transfer of physiographic boundaries on 1:2,50,000 scale Survey of India toposheets, which were used as base map for soil resource mapping of Punjab state. One hundred and fifty-one surface samples pertaining to all the soil mapping units representing dominant soil families of Punjab were collected using global positioning system. Samples were prepared and analysed for physical, chemical and mineralogical analysis using standard procedures. Mineral suite of coarse and fine fraction of soils of the Punjab state was identified using X-ray diffraction. In sand size mineral assemblage, quartz dominated with a decreasing abundance of mica, feldspar, chlorite and calcite minerals in all the agro-eco-subregions except the south-western agro-eco-subregion, where mica dominated. Geospatial thematic mapping of mineral assemblage of different fractions of soils was carried out using ArcGIS 9.2. Among the coarse fraction minerals; the QFMCCA mineral association (Q: quartz, F: feldspar, M: mica, C: chlorite, CA: calcite) occupied 48.40 per cent of the state in the districts of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Tarn Taran. The FCMQCA mineral association (F: feldspar, C: chlorite, M: mica, Q: quartz, CA: calcite) covered only 0.28 per cent area of the state. In the fine fraction mineralogy, illite dominated with decreasing order of chlorite, kaolinite, vermiculite, mixed layer and smectite. Fourteen sand size mineral associations were mapped. In the clay size mineral assemblage, twenty-three associations were identified and mapped. The ICKMVS mineral association (I: illite, C: chlorite, K: kaolinite, M: mixed layer, V: vermiculite and S: smectite) covered 23.08 per cent of the state in the districts of Bathinda and Muktsar. The ICVKSM (I: illite, C: chlorite, V: vermiculite, K: kaolinite, S: smectite, M: mixed layer) association covered only 0.03 per cent area in the district Hoshiarpur. Illite dominated in twenty-two mineral associations. Smectite was dominant in only one minerals association SKIVCM (S: smectite, K: kaolinite, I: illite, V: vermiculite, C: chlorite and M: mixed layer) representing 0.52 per cent of the state in the districts of Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib. The mineral assemblage seems to relate directly to the source of alluvium that formed the parent material of these soils irrespective of their geomorphological position. Most of the minerals in sand as well as clay fraction seem to be transported as such. If there is any alteration in the minerals, it must have taken place prior to their transportation by the ancient river system in the geological stage itself.

TI  - Retrieval of Svalbard ice flow velocities using Sentinel 1A/1B three-pass Differential SAR Interferometry
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier velocity is an important parameter to characterize glacier dynamics and to derive ice thickness and mass balance. The 2-pass/3-pass Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) techniques are advantageous in estimating glacier movements. However, the 2-pass DInSAR requires an external Digital Elevation Model (DEM), whereas the 3-pass DInSAR does not. The 3-pass DInSAR technique is adopted with Sentinel-1A/1B to map the Svalbard glacier flow velocities. Furthermore, the effect of glacier surface elevation change on the 2-pass DInSAR results were revealed by comparing glacier velocity with the two time period topographic information. The coherence indicates that Sentinel-1A/1B has a high potential to infer operational glacier velocity using the 3-pass DInSAR method with an average atmospheric uncertainty of 0.24 cm/day over the studied region. The precision of the 3-pass DInSAR is analyzed by comparing 2-pass derived line-of-sight (LOS) velocity on the same dates. The 3-pass DInSAR achieves high-resolution and detailed information.

TI  - Delineation of structural and tectonic features in the Mahanadi basin, eastern India: New insights from remote sensing and land gravity data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - During Gondwana dispersal, the Mahanadi basin experienced rifting and reactivation of preexisting structures, causing terrain deformation with faulting. The landform around Proterozoic Sukinda Thrust in the Mahanadi basin provides an opportunity to map the geomorphic expressions and correlate them with the tectonics of the graben using remote sensing images, digital elevation model, and gravity data. The subsurface extensions of the identified structures using SAR data and relief image analysis are modeled with the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The mapped tectonic features correlate well with the gravity gradient trends in residual gravity anomalies. The EW and NW-SE trending residual gravity lineaments match well with the mapped faults and suggest their extension within the shallow crust. The two-dimensional (2-D) gravity model realistically constrains the subsurface geology, and by incorporating other published data, we suggest that the Gondwana rifting had reactivated the preexisting shear zones in the cratonic basement down to a depth of - 5 km and subsequently deposited sediments into the fault-bound shallow basin of the Mahanadi graben.

TI  - Time series enable the characterization of small-scale vegetation dynamics that influence fine-scale animal behavior - an example from white storks' foraging behavior
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural activities and vegetation growth cause rapid small-scale vegetation changes which dynamically alter habitat suitability. Time series enable to track down such variations of vegetation structure and are promising to examine their impact on animals' life. Nevertheless, their potential to characterize vegetation dynamics in ways pertinent to animals' fine-scale habitat use has not been adequately explored and ecologically meaningful proxies are lacking. To address this gap, we exemplary investigated foraging activities of breeding white storks in an agricultural landscape. Reflecting on the understanding that storks require short vegetation to access prey, we examined if good foraging conditions - early growth and post-harvest/mowing periods - are detectable using the points between local minima/maxima in NDVI profiles (half-maximum). We processed 1 year of Landsat imagery to identify half-maximum periods (HM: good prey access) and non-half-maximum periods (non-HM: poor prey access) on field-scale in croplands and grasslands. Additionally, we mapped used/unused fields and retrieved foraging duration/daily visitation rates from GPS tracks of the storks. We then explored habitat use, compared habitat use with habitat availability and tested temporal predictors distinguishing between HM/non-HM in habitat selection models. Examining habitat use, storks revisited croplands and grasslands significantly more often during HM than during non-HM, while foraging duration was only prolonged in croplands during HM. However, comparing habitat use with habitat availability, we observed that storks used croplands and grasslands in significantly higher proportions during HM than during non-HM. Additionally, we found that temporal information affected storks' habitat selection and improved model performance. Our findings emphasize that the half-maximum proxy enables to coarsely distinguish temporal resource variations in storks' foraging habitats, highlighting the potential of time series for characterizing behaviorally-relevant vegetation dynamics. Such information helps to create more species-centered landscape scenarios in habitat models, allowing to unravel effects of small-scale environmental changes on wildlife to ultimately guide conservation and management.

TI  - Using ground-based thermography to analyse surface temperature distribution and estimate debris thickness on Gran Zebru glacier (Ortles-Cevedale, Italy)
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we used ground-based thermal infrared imaging to investigate the spatial variability of surface temperatures on a mountain glacier at high spatial resolution and to estimate the supraglacial debris thickness distribution. The surveyed area is the eastern tongue of Gran Zebru glacier, a small mountain glacier of the Ortles-Cevedale group (Italy). A FLIR E85 Thermal Camera was used to obtain a panoramic thermal image of the glacier surface on 30 September 2019 that was calibrated and georeferenced in order to obtain surface temperatures. Based on field data, debris thickness and debris surface temperature were correlated by using an exponential equation. The equation was used to estimate debris thickness on the glacier from the temperature data. The results show a spatial variability of surface temperatures, with the lowest temperatures found on snow and ice surfaces, and the highest on supraglacial debris. The estimated debris thicknesses show an inhomogeneous distribution, with a calculated mean debris thickness of 0.09 m in the areas of continous debris coverage. We found a good correspondence between measured and estimated debris thickness at 30 validation points (RMSE = 0.04 m and r = of 0.92). We demonstrated that ground-based thermal imaging can provide very high resolution maps of glacier surface temperatures and of debris thickness that can be used for the estimation of glacier ablation, with a spatial resolution more suitable than that offered by satellite data, especially for glaciers with a small area and with a heterogeneous surface.

TI  - Attention mechanism-based generative adversarial networks for cloud removal in Landsat images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of clouds affects the quality of optical remote sensing images. Cloud removal is an important preprocessing procedure to effectively improve the utilization of optical remote sensing images. Thin clouds partly obscure the land surfaces beneath them, making it possible to correct the cloudy scenes according to the available information. In this research, we introduce the attention mechanism-based generative adversarial networks for cloud removal (AMGAN-CR) method for Landsat images. First, attention maps of the input cloudy images are generated to extract the cloud distributions and features through an attentive recurrent network. Second, clouds are removed by an attentive residual network under the guidance of the attention maps. Finally, the generated feature maps are fed to a reconstruction network to restore the final cloud-free images. The networks are trained by cloudy and cloud-free Landsat image pairs, and the cloudy images are tested to validate the effectiveness of AMGAN-CR. Both simulated and real cloud experimental results show that the proposed method is more outstanding than the other five state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning methods in removing cloud.

TI  - A preoperative nomogram for predicting the risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with T1-2N0 breast cancer
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To establish a preoperative nomogram based on the multimodal ultrasonographic features and biopsy results of primary lesion to predict the risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) in patients with T1-2N0 breast cancer. Methods This study included 114 patients with T1-2N0 breast cancer who underwent ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy and multimodal ultrasound (Gray scale, Elastography, and Contrast-enhanced ultrasound) preoperatively. The pathological results of SLN were obtained from sentinel lymph node biopsy. Factors associated with sentinel lymph node metastasis were studied. Results The regression analysis identified the maximum diameter of tumor (p = 0.003), Doppler resistive index (p = 0.030), HER-2 status (p = 0.016) and the extended range of enhancement lesion (p = 0.010), which were used to establish a nomogram. The prediction model indicated that the value of area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.798. The calibration curve revealed that the nomogram possesses an excellent consistency between the predicted value and the actual value of SLNM (Hosmer-Lemeshow test: p = 0.436). Conclusions The preoperative nomogram can effectively guide clinicians in predicting SLNM of breast cancer, and assist management of breast cancer patients through intuitive risk values to develop personalized treatment strategies.

TI  - Assessment of Aeolian Activity in the Bodele Depression, Chad: A Dense Spatiotemporal Time Series From Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There are several hotspots of dust production in the central Sahara, the Bodele Depression (BD) in northern Chad is considered the largest source of aerosol dust worldwide, with the fastest Barchan dunes that migrate southwesterly. Less is known about the complex patterns of dune movement in the BD, especially on a short time scale. Time-series inversion of optical image cross-correlation (TSI-OICC) proved to be a valuable method for monitoring historical movements with low uncertainties, high spatial coverage, and dense temporal coverage. We leveraged similar to 8 years of Landsat-8 and similar to 6 years of Sentinel-2 data to capture the dune migration patterns at BD. We used TSI-OICC, creating four independent networks of offset maps from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images, and forming three networks by fusing data from the two sensors. We depended on the multi spatial coherence estimated from Sentinel-1 interferograms to automatically discriminate between the active and stagnant regions, which is important for the postprocessing steps. We combined the data from the two sensors in areas of overlap to assess the performance of the fusion between two sensors in increasing the temporal scale of the observations. Our results suggest that dune migration at BD is subject to seasonal and multiyear variations that differed spatially across the dune field. Seasonal variations were observed with migration slowing during the summer months. We estimated the median for velocities belonging to the same season and calculated the seasonal sliding coefficient (SSC) representing the ratio between seasonal velocities. The median SSC reached a maximum value of similar to 2 for winter/summer, while the ratios were similar to 1.10 and similar to 1.35 for winter/spring and winter/autumn, respectively. The seasonal variability of the temporal patterns was strongly supported by the wind observations. Between (1984-1998 and 1998-2007) and (1998-2007 and 2013-2021), decelerations in dune velocities were observed with percentages of similar to 4 and similar to 28%, respectively, and these decelerations were supported by a deceleration in wind velocities. Inversion of time series provides dense spatiotemporal monitoring of the dune activity. The fusion between two sensors allows condensing the temporal sampling up to a weekly scale especially for locations exposed to contamination of high cloud cover or dust.

TI  - Proper orthogonal decomposition of ice velocity identifies drivers of flow variability at Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn IsbrÆ)
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing volume and spatio-temporal resolution of satellite-derived ice velocity data have created new exploratory opportunities for the quantitative analysis of glacier dynamics. One potential technique, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), also known as empirical orthogonal functions, has proven to be a powerful and flexible technique for revealing coherent structures in a wide variety of environmental flows. In this study we investigate the applicability of POD to an openly available TanDEM-X/TerraSAR-X-derived ice velocity dataset from Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbr AE), Greenland. We find three dominant modes with annual periodicity that we argue are explained by glaciological processes. The primary dominant mode is interpreted as relating to the stress reconfiguration at the glacier terminus, known to be an important control on the glacier's dynamics. The second and third largest modes together relate to the development of the spatially heterogenous glacier hydrological system and are primarily driven by the pressurisation and efficiency of the subglacial hydrological system. During the melt season, variations in the velocity shown in these two subsidiary modes are explained by the drainage of nearby supraglacial melt ponds, as identified with a Google Earth Engine Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dynamic thresholding technique. By isolating statistical structures within velocity datasets and through their comparison to glaciological theory and complementary datasets, POD indicates which glaciological processes are responsible for the changing bulk velocity signal, as observed from space. With the proliferation of optical- and radar-derived velocity products (e.g. MEaSUREs, ESA CCI, PROMICE), we suggest POD, and potentially other modal decomposition techniques, will become increasingly useful in future studies of ice dynamics.

TI  - Combining Participatory Mapping and Geospatial Analysis Techniques to Assess Wildfire Risk in Rural North Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Participatory mapping (PM) is a valuable research tool for assessing fire risk, especially in regions where data are difficult to collect or inconsistent; in such areas, the integration between crowdsourced data and geospatial techniques plays a fundamental role in gathering more consistent and reliable information. This study combines a participatory (community-based) mapping approach with geospatial techniques to assess fire risk in Van Chan district, northern Vietnam, an area where the economy relies mainly on forestry activities. Local stakeholders designed a map of wildfires, which was modelled as a function of a set of physical and socio-economic variables. A fire-probability map of the district was obtained and compared with MODIS data (2000-2020). The results suggest that higher fire probability occurs in areas with lower human pressure, and they provide information on related socio-economic drivers that affect this phenomenon. This study highlights the importance of combining participatory approaches and geospatial techniques to assess fire dynamics and prevent wildfires in terms of understanding and predicting the risks. The involvement of local communities is fundamental to this innovative participatory approach with regard to better supporting decision-making and prevention actions and to developing fire control management guidelines.

TI  - The rate of use of Veterans Affairs chiropractic care: a 5-year analysis
T2  - CHIROPRACTIC & MANUAL THERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has initiated various approaches to provide chiropractic care to Veterans. Prior work has shown substantial increase in use of VA chiropractic care between fiscal years (FY) 2005-2016. However, the extent of the availability of these services to the Veteran population remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze the rate of Veteran use of VA chiropractic services, both from on-site care at VA facilities and VA purchased care from community care providers. This study analyzed facility characteristics associated with chiropractic use by both care delivery mechanisms (on-site and in the community). Methods Cross-sectional analyses of administrative data were conducted for FY 2014-2019. Data were obtained from VA's Corporate Data Warehouse. The variables extracted included number of unique Veterans receiving VA chiropractic care on-site and in the community, total Veteran population of the VA facilities, size of the VA chiropractic workforce (measured as Full-Time Equivalent, FTE), and facility characteristics (geographic region and the facility complexity). Descriptive statistics, mixed model, and multivariant models were used to analyze data. Results Use of VA chiropractic care increased over the six-year period for both on-site and community care. National average for on-site use of the population was 1.27% in FY14 and 1.48% in FY19. Community care use was 0.29% and 1.76% for the same years. Use at individual facilities varied widely in each FY. Factors such as chiropractor FTE, geographic locations, and the complexity of the VA facility are associated with use of chiropractic services. Conclusion The VA has expanded the non-pharmacologic treatments available to Veterans by providing chiropractic services, yet chiropractic use remains low compared to other US populations. As Veterans have a high prevalence of pain and musculoskeletal conditions, continued work to assess and achieve the optimal levels of chiropractic use in this population is warranted.

TI  - Urban green space mediates spatiotemporal variation in land surface temperature: a case study of an urbanized city, Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization with an increasing rate of urban built-up area is decreasing urban green space resulting in changing urban microclimate conditions showing increasing land surface temperature. A better understanding of these effects is important to formulate effective strategies in addressing the impact of increasing built-up area. Land surface temperature patterns in an urbanized city in Bangladesh (Mymensingh district) were investigated using Landsat satellite sensor data from 1988 to 2016. A total of nineteen Landsat satellite images were used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The radiative transfer equation (RTE) model was applied to derive LST for the years 1988, 1992, 1999, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. Further, the Landsat-derived LST results were compared with MODIS Terra satellite outputs (MOD11A1) for the validation of our study results. Our results showed NDVI higher in 2008 and lower in 2004, LST maximum in 1988 and minimum in 2008, and NDBI higher in 2004 and lower in 2012. Seasonally, summer was characterized by higher LST and winter by lower LST, while NDVI was higher in autumn and lower in winter, however, NDBI was higher in winter and lower in autumn. Spatially, a relatively higher LST and NDBI was observed in the southwest, followed by central, and northern regions, whereas the trend was opposite for NDVI. Using Pearson's correlation, results showed a strong significant negative correlation between LST and NDVI and a positive significant correlation between LST and NDBI. Further, simple linear regression analysis revealed that LST decreased with increasing NDVI most quickly in 2012, followed by the years 2016, 2008, 1992, 1988, 1999, and 2004. On the other hand, LST increased with increasing NDBI most quickly in 1999, followed by the years 2016, 1988, 1992, 2012, 2004, and 2008. Thus, long-term observation suggested that urbanization had driven a decrease in green space while simultaneously increasing the land surface temperature within an urbanized area. This study has concluded that the protection of urban green spaces is needed as an effective step toward addressing adverse effects of regional climate change and desertification.

TI  - Regulation of Algal Bloom Hotspots Under Mega Estuarine Constructions in the Changjiang River Estuary
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive large-scale engineering projects have been built in river estuaries around the world, but their effects on environments in the surrounding coastal waters were less emphasized compared to those due to the watershed projects. In this study, we used the Changjiang River Estuary as an example to show that a significant consequence can be resulted in such a situation. Through analyzing the harmful algal bloom events data and the chlorophyll satellite data, we investigate the spatiotemporal variations of algal blooms in the estuary and its adjacent water. The results indicate that the location of algal bloom hotspot changed over the period of the estuarine constructions. Furthermore, using a well-validated numerical model, we explored the mechanisms responsible for such an ecosystem regime shift. It was found that after the estuarine constructions were built, the surface chlorophyll maximum was attenuated and part of it migrated landward north of the river mouth but was strengthened south of the river mouth and extended seaward. Alternations of the nutrient concentration distribution and turbidity distribution induced by river plume deviation are responsible for the redistribution of the high chlorophyll concentration area. By contrast, the direct impact of the Three Gorges Dam through changing the runoff and sediments flux, which has been highlighted in numerous studies, was less important than expected. Given the fact that Three Gorges Dam and mega estuarine constructions were built in a similar period, any observed regime shift of hydrodynamic and ecological status outside the estuary should be interpreted with particular caution.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of the effect of human migration on the landslides after the 2010 Haiti earthquake using Landsat imagery
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2010 Haiti earthquake displaced millions of people and induced numerous landslides. Migrants triggered staggering deforestation since new settlers need wooden resources. This deforestation caused soil degradation, erosion, flooding, and landslides. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of human displacement on landslide distribution and its frequency changes by comparing land use and land cover (LULC) maps of pre- and post-earthquake landslide distributions in Port-au-Prince, Artibonite, and Grande Anse. To assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on landslides, we employed a maximum likelihood method to produce LULC maps from Landsat images from 2002 to 2015. Landslide inventory maps were created through visual detection from high resolution satellite imagery. LULC characteristics of new landslide areas were assessed to find land cover types experienced landslides and their distribution characteristics, along with the changes in human influx. The result shows that there was no obvious increase in the number of landslides in forested land after the earthquake while grassland and barren showed an increase in the number of landslides (22% in Port-au-Prince and 77.1% in Artibonite, respectively). Migrants had not explored the forest because there were not enough resources to access remote areas and cut down trees. Since the human migration are more likely to be occurred in grassland and barren, anthropogenic impacts were more evident.

TI  - A case study on the impact of severe convective storms on the water vapor mixing ratio in the lower mid-latitude stratosphere observed in 2019 over Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme convective events in the troposphere not only have immediate impacts on the surface, but they can also influence the dynamics and composition of the lower stratosphere (LS). One major impact is the moistening of the LS by overshooting convection. This effect plays a crucial role in climate feedback, as small changes of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) have a large impact on the radiative budget of the atmosphere. In this case study, we investigate water vapor injections into the LS by two consecutive convective events in the European mid-latitudes within the framework of the MOSES (Modular Observation Solutions for Earth Systems) measurement campaign during the early summer of 2019. Using balloon-borne instruments, measurements of convective water vapor injection into the stratosphere were performed. Such measurements with a high vertical resolution are rare. The magnitude of the stratospheric water vapor reached up to 12.1 ppmv (parts per million by volume), with an estimated background value of 5 ppmv. Hence, the water vapor enhancement reported here is of the same order of magnitude as earlier reports of water vapor injection by convective overshooting over North America. However, the overshooting took place in the extratropical stratosphere over Europe and has a stronger impact on long-term water vapor mixing ratios in the stratosphere compared to the monsoon-influenced region in North America. At the altitude of the measured injection, a sharp drop in a local ozone enhancement peak makes the observed composition of air very unique with high ozone up to 650 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) and high water vapor up to 12.1 ppmv. ERA-Interim does not show any signal of the convective overshoot, the water vapor values measured by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) in the LS are lower than the in situ observations, and the ERA5 overestimated water vapor mixing ratios. Backward trajectories of the measured injected air masses reveal that the moistening of the LS took place several hours before the balloon launch. This is in good agreement with the reanalyses, which shows a strong change in the structure of isotherms and a sudden and short-lived increase in potential vorticity at the altitude and location of the trajectory. Similarly, satellite data show low cloud-top brightness temperatures during the overshooting event, which indicates an elevated cloud top height.

TI  - Analysing transition of land surface temperature and derived indices with respect to elevation values in Kohima Saddar
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have affected the urban environment resulting in a drastic change in the surface temperature. The impact of urban heat islands is noticeable in urban areas than in rural areas. The thermal band of Landsat 8 data is used to retrieve the spatial distribution of land surface temperature (LST) over Kohima Sadar for the years 2009, 2015 and 2020 with the Mono-window algorithm. Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) is used to assess the ecological condition in the area impacted by LST. Cartosat-1 Digital Elevation Model (Carto DEM) is used to understand the variations of LST and indices values with reference to the elevation profile located at different random points. The variations in the land cover are categorized as per the values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and built-up density index (BUI). This work estimates the influence of elevation over LST, vegetation, and the built-up area. Results implies a negative correlation between LST and NDVI whereas a positive correlation between LST and BUI. Likewise, NDVI and BUI show a strong negative correlation. It is observed that LST is independent of elevation profile but the variation of LST depends on the impact of change in topography urbanization, deforestation, and afforestation. There is no significant relationship of elevation with the variations in NDVI and BUI values. It is observed that the impact of emissivity influences the estimation of LST values. For the locations having the highest and lowest LST, NDVI, and BUI values, 50 random points are generated for the entire region, and validation is executed with the google earth historical image.

TI  - Social Evolution in Jurgen Habermas: Towards a Weak Anthropological Naturalism between Kant and Darwin
T2  - THEORIA-A SWEDISH JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Issues concerning naturalism have increasingly become the subject of philosophical reflections involving ontological, epistemological, and even ethics affairs. The most popular topic for contemporary philosophy has been the relationship between ontological results of Darwinism and epistemology. Despite the varied circumstances of its establishment, naturalism almost always produces recommendations that reflect a worldview much "weaker" (as in the case of Habermas) than the strong one more common among scientism. There are good structural reasons for this difference. The aim of this paper is to elucidate some of distinctive social features of Habermas's conception of the human being and its implications in the Theory of Communicative Action (1982). Therefore, it is shown that his anthropology takes a naturalistic and Darwinist perspective in the weak naturalism perspective. In the first part, Darwins legacy is analysed as a research program, and Habermass studies on biological anthropology are compared with the latest research in genetics and palaeontology. In the second part, we will show Habermas's proposal to confront an epistemological dualism through a weak non-reductionist naturalism as a critique of modern metaphysics, which structures a new pragmatic realism.

TI  - Is There a Relationship Between TILs and Regression in Melanoma?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The relationship between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and regression in melanoma is unknown. This report describes a large multicenter study assessing the association between TILs and regression. Methods The Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group database was queried from 1993 to 2018 for cases with TILs and regression data. Clinicopathologic factors were correlated with regression and TIL status, sentinel lymph node (SLN) status, and overall survival (OS). Results The study enrolled 2450 patients. In 1811 cases, TILs (73.9%) were present, with regression present in 328 of these 1811 (18.1%) cases and in 49 (7.7%) of 639 cases without TILs. The presence of TILs was significantly associated with regression (p < 0.0001) as well as a negative SLN (p < 0.05). However, when TILs were stratified by regression status, only absence or presence of both TILs and regression were significantly associated with SLN metastases (p = 0.038). Although the presence of TILs was associated with OS (p < 0.05), regression status by itself was not (p = 0.2058 and 0.252, respectively). Furthermore, when TILs were stratified by regression status, only the presence of TILs with or without regression was significantly associated with improved OS (p = 0.0081 and 0.0137, respectively) versus the absence of both TILs and regression, with regression status not significantly affecting OS for patients with or without TILs (p = 0.2314 and 0.65, respectively). Conclusions Regression is highly correlated with TILs, but only TILs are significantly associated with SLN metastasis and OS in melanoma patients, whereas regression is not. The impact of regression on outcomes ultimately appears dependent upon the absence or presence of TILs.

TI  - Foraging Behaviours of Breeding Arctic Terns <i>Sterna paradisaea</i> and the Impact of Local Weather and Fisheries
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the breeding season, seabirds are central place foragers and in order to successfully rear chicks they must adjust their foraging behaviours to compensate for extrinsic factors. When foraging, arctic terns Sterna paradisaea are restricted to the first 50 cm of the water column and can only carry a few prey items back to their nests at once. In Iceland, where 20-30% of the global population breed, poor fledging success has been linked to low food availability. Using GPS loggers, we investigated individual foraging behaviours of breeding adults during incubation from a large colony over four seasons. First, we tested whether foraging trip distance or duration was linked to morphology or sex. Second, we examined how trips vary with weather and overlap with commercial fisheries. Our findings reveal that arctic terns travel far greater distances during foraging trips than previously recorded (approximately 7.3 times further), and they forage around the clock. There was inter-annual variability in the foraging locations that birds used, but no relationship between size or sex differences and the distances travelled. We detected no relationship between arctic tern foraging flights and local prevailing winds, and tern heading and speed were unrelated to local wind patterns. We identified key arctic tern foraging areas and found little spatial or temporal overlap with fishing pelagic vessels, but larger home ranges corresponded with years with lower net primary productivity levels. This suggests that whilst changing polar weather conditions may not pose a threat to arctic terns at present, nor might local competition with commercial fisheries for prey, they may be failing to forage in productive areas, or may be affected by synergistic climatic effects on prey abundance and quality. Shifts in pelagic prey distributions as a result of increasing water temperatures and salinities will impact marine top predators in this region, so continued monitoring of sentinel species such as arctic terns is vital.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Planning an event-based monitoring campaign on the regional scale is challenging, e.g. the timing and location of monitoring visits can dramatically impact monitoring efficacy and depends on the optimal environmental conditions required by the measurement parameters and the overarching monitoring goal. Therefore we developed a generic campaign planning approach utilizing interactive visualization methods and implemented this approach into the component-based web tool called Tocap: Tool for Campaign Planning. As a case study, we are determining the most suitable time and location for event-driven, ad-hoc monitoring in hydrology using soil moisture measurements as our target variable. Our approach supports: (1) data acquisition from various digital data sources, (2) identification of the most suitable location for measurements, (3) identification of the most suitable time for measurements at the selected locations, and (4) planning an optimized monitoring route.

TI  - Evaluation of the Sentinel-FOB gold faecal immunochemical test for the presence of haemoglobin using the automated Roche Cobas 8000 system
T2  - PRACTICAL LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) for the detection of haemoglobin are widely used in the diagnostic pathway of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients presenting with lower abdominal symptoms. Several quantitative immunochemical tests are available, however only a few tests are available on high throughput automated analyzers. Here we report the analytical and clinical evaluation of the Sentinel-FOB Gold assay on the Roche Cobas 8000 automated system.Design: and Methods: The assessment of the analytical performance of the assay on the Roche Cobas analyzer comprised determination of imprecision, accuracy, limit of detection, linearity, carryover and pmzone effect. In the clinical evaluation part of the study 163 patients presenting for coloscopy with lower abdominal symptoms were included in the study. Diagnostic accuracy and optimal cutoff of the FIT-assay were determined by comparing faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) concentrations with coloscopy findings as reference.Results: We confirmed good analytical performance of the assay on the Roche Cobas system. Patients with CRC had significant higher f-Hb concentrations than patients with non-advanced adenomas and patients with normal findings by coloscopy. When applying a cutoff of 10 mu g/g the sensitivity and specificity were 96.2% and 51.8%, respectively for CRC and 84.6% and 57.7% for CRC and advanced adenoma.Conclusion: The Sentinel-FOB Gold assay is appropriate for application on the automated Roche Cobas 8000 analyzer. The assay shows good analytical performance on the system. With regard to early detection of significant colorectal diseases a cutoff of 10 mu g/g seems to be optimal.

AB  - The aim of the study was to show the possibilities of fluorescent immunocytochemistry in urgent intraoperative examination of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with early breast cancer. The authors analyzed the data on the state of the lymph nodes in 94 patients with early breast cancer who had been operated on since December 2016 to January 2018 in the Department of reconstructive plastic surgery of the breast and skin of the P.A. Herzen Moscow Oncological Institute. As a result of the use of the Tekhnefit99ᵐTc radiopharmaceutical during the operation, sentinel lymph nodes were isolated, the state of which was assessed by the method of urgent intraoperative cytology. In difficult-to-diagnose cases, fluorescent immunocytochemistry was used, which made it possible to avoid hypo- and overdiagnosis in 30 patients with early breast cancer. The sensitivity of the urgent cytological method for examining the sentinel lymph nodes smears was 83.3%, the specificity - 100%, the efficiency -83%, the predictive value of a positive result - 83.3%, and the predictive value of a negative result - 100%. Thus, the diagnostic accuracy of urgent cytological examination of the sentinel lymph node was 94%.

TI  - Hierarchical fusion of optical and dual-polarized SAR on impervious surface mapping at city scale
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combined use of the data from Sentinel-1 (S1) dual-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Sensor Images (MSI) has been successfully applied in many remote sensing applications. However, when it comes to the mapping of impervious surface (IS), the non-negligible shadows on S2 images can severely degrade the mapping accuracy. How to effectively incorporate S1 and S2 data to precisely extract IS from cities has not been well investigated yet. Besides, it still remains challenging to extract appropriate polarimetric features of S1 to discriminate IS and supplement the drawbacks of S2. In this research, we explore more effective polarimetric features of S1 and propose a hierarchical framework for IS mapping at the city scale by synergetic fusion of dual polarized SAR and multispectral information. The new polasrimetric features of S1 is initially explored based on the backscattering mechanism of dual polarized SAR. Then the IS is identified from shadow-free and shadow areas in two consecutive steps with different feature sets. The result indicates that our new polarimetric features of S1, i.e., the diagonal elements of coherence matrix, are more suitable for IS mapping due to their associated physical meaning with different land covers. With suitable feature sets, our proposed methods performed well on the urban area with abundant shadows, with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 93.9% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.92 achieved.

TI  - Kelp detritus: Unutilized productivity or an unacknowledged trophic resource?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Kelp beds are one of the most productive marine systems and, while little of this production is directly consumed, there is growing evidence that kelp detritus is an essential food source for many detrital and suspension feeders, and forms an important component of offshore sedimentary carbon pools. However, the extent of the contribution of kelp detritus to the nutrition of coastal fauna is not well resolved. In this study, we compare the contribution of phytoplankton, kelp detritus, and waste from fish cages to the diet of a sentinel suspension feeder, the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) using stable isotopes. We found a significant depletion in both C-13 and N-15 in kelp tissue with age (distance from stipe to the deteriorating distal end of the kelp frond) which may have biased dietary estimates in previous studies which have applied isotopic source values derived from fresh kelp. Our mixing models indicate that macroalgal detritus formed 59% of the diet of the mussels in Berehaven, Bantry Bay, Ireland. We support the isotopic mixing model results by modelling the relative production of phytoplankton, kelp, and salmon farm waste, and found the supply of C and N from kelp and phytoplankton far exceeded the requirements of the mussels with much less coming from the nearby fish cages. Monthly chlorophyll measurements indicated there was only sufficient phytoplankton density to support mussel growth during the spring and autumn, explaining our observation of patterns in the relative importance of utilization of kelp detritus. Where there is pressure to harvest kelp beds, this study highlights the supporting ecosystem service they provide as an important dietary source in coastal food webs and emphasises the need for appropriate management measures for this resource.

TI  - Pulsed electric field promotes the growth metabolism of aerobic denitrifying bacteria <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> W207-14 by improving cell membrane permeability
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the stimulation mechanism of low pulsed electric field (PEF) strength treatment to promote the growth metabolism of aerobic denitrifying bacteria Pseudomonas putida W207-14. The results indicated that compared with the control group, the strain W207-14 treated with PEF entered the logarithmic growth phase 5 h earlier, the growth time to reached the maximum cell optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.935 +/- 0.04 was only 24 h, which shortened by half. With the reduction of growth time, the metabolic rate of the strain increased significantly, in which the removal efficiency of COD, NO3--N and TN was 97.67 +/- 1.12%, 90.34 +/- 0.73% and 90.13 +/- 0.10% in 24 h, respectively. The maximum nitrate removal rate increased from 3.49 mg/L/h to 7.53 mg/L/h. A large number of cells with simultaneous cell membrane damage and high physiological activity were observed by flow cytometry (FCM) in combination with fluorescence staining analysis, which confirmed the reversible electroporation on the cell membrane of strain W207-14 treated with PEF. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that PEF activated the highly significant differential expression of membrane porin (opdB, opdC, and oprB) and cytochrome oxidoreductase related genes (ccoP, ccoN, cioA and cioB) on the cell membrane, which promoted the transport of nutrients through the cell membrane and electron transfer during aerobic respiration and provided an explanation for the possible mechanism of PEF promoting the growth metabolism of strain W207-14 at the micro level. These results lay a foundation for the practical application of PEF enhanced aerobic denitrification technology.

TI  - Large discrepancies of global greening: Indication of multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming has a great impact on the activities of terrestrial vegetation. A consensus has been reached that the global vegetation is greening from the 1980-2010s. However, the trends of global vegetation are highly uncertain after 2000. Therefore, we used multi-source remote sensing vegetation index (VI), climate data, and Mann-Kendall trend analysis to explore the global vegetation trend and its uncertainty from 2001 to 2016. The effects of climate on the changes in vegetation were also investigated. We found that GIMMS-based VIs exhibited decreasing trends. By contrast, MODIS-based VIs and GLOBMAP LAI tended to increase. Evergreen broad-leaf forest contributed the most to the uncertainty of global vegetation trends, and the uncertainty of December-January-February and September-October-November was higher than that in the other seasons. The correlation of forest VI and temperature was the highest in March-April-May, whereas the correlation of non-forest VI and precipitation was higher than that of the forest. The anomalies of GIMMS-based VIs and mean annual precipitation were more consistent in the evergreen broad-leaf forest, woody savannas, mixed forest, evergreen needle-leaf forest, and deciduous needle-leaf forest than those in biomes under the impact of 2015-2016 El Nino.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The success and rate of forest regeneration has consequences for sustainable forest management, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity, among others. Systematically monitoring forest regeneration over large and often remote areas is challenging. Remotely sensed data and associated analytical approaches have demonstrated consistent and transparent options for spatially-explicit characterization of vegetation return following disturbance. Moreover, time series of satellite imagery enable the establishment of spatially meaningful recovery baselines that can provide a benchmark for identifying areas that are either under-or over-performing relative to those baselines. This information allows for the investigation and/or prioritization of areas requiring some form of management intervention, including guiding tree planting initiatives. In this research, we assess recovery following stand replacing disturbances for the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada for the period 1985-2017, wherein-51 Mha of Canada's forested ecosystems were impacted by wildfire, and -21 Mha were impacted by harvesting. For quantification of forest recovery, we implement the Years to Recovery or Y2R metric using Landsat time series data based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) to relate the number of years required for a pixel to return to 80% of its pre-disturbance NBR value. By the end of the analyzed period, 76% of areas impacted by wildfire were considered spectrally recovered compared to 93% of harvested areas. On average, we found that harvest areas had more rapid spectral recovery (mean Y2R = 6.1 years) than wildfire (mean Y2R = 10.6 years) and importantly, that Y2R varied by ecozone, disturbance type, pre-disturbance land cover, and latitude. We used airborne laser scanning data to assess whether pixels that were considered spectrally recovered had attained United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization benchmarks of canopy height (>5 m) and cover (>10%) across four geographic regions representing different forest types. Overall, 87% and 97% of recovered pixels sampled in harvests and wildfires, respectively, had achieved at least one of the benchmarks, with benchmarks of height more readily achieved than benchmarks of cover. By analyzing spatial patterns of Y2R, we identified areas that had significant positive or negative spatial clustering in their rate of spectral recovery. Approximately 3.5-4% of areas disturbed by wildfire or harvest had significant positive spatial clustering, indicative of slower spectral recovery rates; these areas were also less likely to have attained benchmarks of height and cover. Conversely, we identified significant negative spatial clustering for 0.94% of areas recovering from harvest and 1.93% of areas recovering from wildfire, indicative of spectral recovery that was more rapid than the ecozonal baseline. Herein, we demonstrated that remote sensing can provide spatial intelligence on the nature of disturbance-recovery dynamics in forested ecosystems over large areas and moreover, can retrospectively quantify and characterize historic forest recovery trends within the past three decades that have implications for forest management, climate change mitigation, and restoration initiatives in the near term.

T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Robust disease and syndromic surveillance tools are underdeveloped in the United States, as evidenced by limitations and heterogeneity in sociodemographic data collection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota, we developed a federated data network in March 2020 using electronic health record (EHR) data from 8 multispecialty health systems. Materials and Methods: In this serial cross-sectional study, we examined patients of all ages who received a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test, had symptoms of a viral illness, or received an influenza test from January 3, 2016, through November 7, 2020. We evaluated COVID-19 testing rates among patients with symptoms of viral illness and percentage positivity among all patients tested, in aggregate and by zip code. We stratified results by patient and area-level characteristics. Results: Cumulative COVID-19 positivity rates were similar for people aged 12-64 years (range, 15.1%-17.6%) but lower for adults aged >= 65 years (range, 9.3%-10.7%). We found notable racial and ethnic disparities in positivity rates early in the pandemic, whereas COVID-19 positivity was similarly elevated across most racial and ethnic groups by the end of 2020. Positivity rates remained substantially higher among Hispanic patients compared with other racial and ethnic groups throughout the study period. We found similar trends across area-level income and rurality, with disparities early in the pandemic converging over time. Practice Implications: We rapidly developed a distributed data network across Minnesota to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the utility of using EHR data to monitor the current pandemic as well as future public health priorities. Building partnerships with public health agencies can help ensure data streams are flexible and tailored to meet the changing needs of decision makers.

TI  - A novel regression method for harmonic analysis of time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmonic analysis of time series is an important technique to reveal seasonal land surface dynamics using remote sensing information. However, frequency selection in the harmonic analysis is often difficult because high-frequency components are useful for delineating seasonal dynamics but sensitive to noise and gaps in time se -ries. On the other hand, it is challenging to obtain temporally continuous satellite data with high quality because of atmospheric contamination. We developed a novel regression method named Harmonic Adaptive Penalty Operator (HAPO) for harmonic analysis of unevenly distributed time series. We introduced a new penalty function to minimize unexpected fluctuations in the model, which can substantially reduce the overfitting issue of regression in time series with temporal gaps. Specifically, the new penalty function minimizes the length of the model curve and the value range difference between the model and time series observations. We compared HAPO with three widely used regression methods (OLS: Ordinary Least Squares; LASSO: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; and Ridge) with different scenarios using Landsat time series data across the United States. First, we evaluated methods using Landsat surface reflectance time series within a single year. HAPO showed small and consistent monthly Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values, in which most of the time RMSD values of predicted reflectance were less than 0.04. More importantly, HAPO showed consistent and less bias given varying density and irregularity of time series. Second, we evaluated methods using multi-year time series and the result suggested that HAPO was a better predictor of relatively short time series (>= 4 years) with steady small RMSD values. When a longer time series (& GE;4 years) was used, all four methods disclosed similar RMSD values, but HAPO outperformed other three methods when there were temporal gaps. Last, we preliminarily tested how regression methods affected change detection and classification accuracy. HAPO showed the highest change detection accuracy of all tests in terms of F1 score when using the change threshold of 0.9999. In classification, HAPO produced the highest accuracy for short time series segments (one- or two-year time series). In contrast, all methods reached similar accuracy for 5-year time series. These results suggest that for areas that have large seasonal observation gaps or for time series that have less than 4 years records, HAPO can provide more consistent and accurate analytical results than other regression methods for harmonic analysis of time series.

TI  - Automated aerial animal detection when spatial resolution conditions are varied
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing where livestock are located enables optimized management and mustering. However, Australian farms are large meaning that many of Australia's livestock are unmonitored which impacts farm profit, animal welfare and the environment. Effective animal localisation and counting by analysing satellite imagery overcomes this management hurdle however, high resolution satellite imagery is expensive. Thus, to minimise cost the lowest spatial resolution data that enables accurate livestock detection should be selected. In our work, we determine the association between object detector performance and spatial degradation for cattle, sheep and dogs. Accurate ground truth was established using high resolution drone images which were then downsampled to various ground sample distances (GSDs). Both circular and cassegrain aperture optics were simulated to generate point spread functions (PSFs) corresponding to various optical qualities. By simulating the PSF, rather than approximating it as a Gaussian, the images were accurately degraded to match the spatial resolution and blurring structure of satellite imagery. Two existing datasets were combined and used to train and test a YoloV5 object detection network. Detector performance was found to drop steeply around a GSD of 0.5 m/px and was associated with PSF matrix structure within this GSD region. Detector mAP performance fell by 52% when a cassegrain, rather than circular, aperture was used at a 0.5 m/px GSD. Overall blurring magnitude also had a small impact when matched to GSD, as did the internal network resolution. Our results here inform the selection of remote sensing data requirements for animal detection tasks, allowing farmers and ecologists to use more accessible medium resolution imagery with confidence.

TI  - Histone acetyltransferase NAA40 modulates acetyl-CoA levels and lipid synthesis
T2  - BMC BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Epigenetic regulation relies on the activity of enzymes that use sentinel metabolites as cofactors to modify DNA or histone proteins. Thus, fluctuations in cellular metabolite levels have been reported to affect chromatin modifications. However, whether epigenetic modifiers also affect the levels of these metabolites and thereby impinge on downstream metabolic pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we tested this notion by investigating the function of N-alpha-acetyltransferase 40 (NAA40), the enzyme responsible for N-terminal acetylation of histones H2A and H4, which has been previously implicated with metabolic-associated conditions such as age-dependent hepatic steatosis and calorie-restriction-mediated longevity. Results Using metabolomic and lipidomic approaches, we found that depletion of NAA40 in murine hepatocytes leads to significant increase in intracellular acetyl-CoA levels, which associates with enhanced lipid synthesis demonstrated by upregulation in de novo lipogenesis genes as well as increased levels of diglycerides and triglycerides. Consistently, the increase in these lipid species coincide with the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets and impaired insulin signalling indicated by decreased glucose uptake. However, the effect of NAA40 on lipid droplet formation is independent of insulin. In addition, the induction in lipid synthesis is replicated in vivo in the Drosophila melanogaster larval fat body. Finally, supporting our results, we find a strong association of NAA40 expression with insulin sensitivity in obese patients. Conclusions Overall, our findings demonstrate that NAA40 affects the levels of cellular acetyl-CoA, thereby impacting lipid synthesis and insulin signalling. This study reveals a novel path through which histone-modifying enzymes influence cellular metabolism with potential implications in metabolic disorders.

TI  - Reference-free method for investigating classification uncertainty in large-scale land cover datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, land cover products are produced at a global scale and updated with an unprecedent speed with the development of earth observation and mapping techniques. However, assessing large-scale land cover datasets is always a challenging task because of lack of ground truth and high dependency on manual inspection. To promote the efficiency of assessment, this study introduces a generic framework that identifies potential land cover classification errors without traditional reference data. Depending on rich features in remote sensing data, the overall procedure of can be regarded as a multi-class anomaly detection problem. To improve the performance in dealing with complex classification scheme, a pairing strategy is firstly proposed for pairwise analysis on each two classes, so that the multi-class problem is decomposed into multiple smaller binary-class problems. Secondly, the proximity matrix of each class pair is generated on the basis of extra trees model, which is applicable to mixed numerical and categorical data and provides robust proximity measurement by including multiple levels of randomness. Finally, an improved proximity-based anomaly detection algorithm is applied, and the detection results of each class pair are ensembled to obtain the final anomaly score of each land instance. Experiments show that the overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score reaches approximately 0.9 for synthetic datasets and 0.8 for real-life datasets. The proposed method is expected to provide users valuable data for a more efficient assessment in the absence of ground truth in practice.

TI  - Global divergent trends of algal blooms detected by satellite during 1982-2018
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms (ABs) in inland lakes have caused adverse ecological effects, and health impairment of animals and humans. We used archived Landsat images to examine ABs in lakes (>1 km(2)) around the globe over a 37-year time span (1982-2018). Out of the 176032 lakes with area >1 km(2) detected globally, 863 were impacted by ABs, 708 had sufficiently long records to define a trend, and 66% exhibited increasing trends in frequency ratio (FRQR, ratio of the number of ABs events observed in a year in a given lake to the number of available Landsat images for that lake) or area ratio (AR, ratio of annual maximum area covered by ABs observed in a lake to the surface area of that lake), while 34% showed a decreasing trend. Across North America, an intensification of ABs severity was observed for FRQR (p < .01) and AR (p < .01) before 1999, followed by a decrease in ABs FRQR (p < .01) and AR (p < .05) after the 2000s. The strongest intensification of ABs was observed in Asia, followed by South America, Africa, and Europe. No clear trend was detected for the Oceania. Across climatic zones, the contributions of anthropogenic factors to ABs intensification (16.5% for fertilizer, 19.4% for gross domestic product, and 18.7% for population) were slightly stronger than climatic drivers (10.1% for temperature, 11.7% for wind speed, 16.8% for pressure, and for 11.6% for rainfall). Collectively, these divergent trends indicate that consideration of anthropogenic factors as well as climate change should be at the forefront of management policies aimed at reducing the severity and frequency of ABs in inland waters.

TI  - Landslide detection using deep learning and object-based image analysis
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent landslide detection studies have focused on pixel-based deep learning (DL) approaches. In contrast, intuitive annotation of landslides from satellite imagery is based on distinct features rather than individual pixels. This study examines the feasibility of the integration framework of a DL model with rule-based object-based image analysis (OBIA) to detect landslides. First, we designed a ResU-Net model and then trained and tested it in the Sentinel-2 imagery. Then we developed a simple rule-based OBIA with only four rulesets, applying it first to the original image dataset and then to the same dataset plus the resulting ResU-Net heatmap. The value of each pixel in the heatmap refers to the probability that the pixel belongs to either landslide or non-landslide classes. Thus, we evaluate three scenarios: ResU-Net, OBIA, and ResU-Net-OBIA. The landslide detection maps from three different classification scenarios were compared against a manual landslide inventory map using thematic accuracy assessment metrics: precision, recall, and f1-score. Our experiments in the testing area showed that the proposed integration framework yields f1-score values 8 and 22 percentage points higher than those of the ResU-Net and OBIA approaches, respectively.

TI  - A 30 m-resolution land use-land cover product for the Colombian Andes and Amazon using cloud-computing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use-land cover (LULC) data are critical inputs for policy and scientific research in hydrology, climatology, territory planning and conservation. Colombia, a megadiverse country and deforestation hotspot on Earth, critically needs recent and high-resolution information on land use and land cover. Using Landsat OLI 8 data, we here present a new LULC product for the Colombian Amazon and Andes at 30 m x 30 m resolution for year 2018, using classification and validation procedures based on the Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform. The novel products show high overall accuracy (>90%), are achieved with high automatization and improve current coarser LULC datasets for Colombia. All the processing procedures used are open access and distributable to the scientific community.

TI  - Soil moisture content estimation in winter wheat planting area for multi-source sensing data using CNNR
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is an important part of precision agriculture, and it is also one of the key problems to be solved in field real-time monitoring and precision irrigation. Most of the existing studies are limited to SMC monitoring of bare soil, which can be obtained by optical remote sensing (e.g., multispectral, hyperspectral) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). However, for the soil covered by vegetation, such as farmland, there are some theoretical defects with only one of the measuring methods. Meanwhile, in order to break through the limitations of low spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite remote sensing, it is of great significance to study SMC retrieval based on multi-source remote sensing data for the near earth UAV remote sensing systems. Based on this, this paper, taking the winter wheat planting area in Guanzhong plain of China as the research area, combines the advantages of ultra-wideband (UWB) radar, and multispectral remote sensing data, to reduce the influences of vegetation coverage on the estimation accuracy. A one-dimensional regression convolution neural network model is constructed to realize the quantitative prediction and estimation of SMC in farmland. The carried out experiments show that the proposed CNNR model has a better performance than traditional SVR and GRNN models and the R-2, RMSE and RPD are 0.7453, 0.0140 cm(3)/cm(3) and 1.9246, respectively. After introducing NDVI, MSAVI and DVI vegetation indices generated from multispectral images, the accuracy of the three models increased significantly. Among the three models, the constructed CNNR model has the best performance, and its R-2, RMSE and RPD reach 0.9168, 0.0089 cm(3)/cm(3), and 3.0201. Furthermore, after adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the original radar echoes, the CNNR model constructed in this paper still has the highest prediction accuracy and the strongest noise robustness.

TI  - The accuracy of the Sentinel-3A altimetry over Polish rivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is the first attempt to assess the accuracy of water levels measured by the Sentinel-3A altimetry at virtual stations (VS) located along Polish rivers. The studied rivers (Vistula, Odra, Warta, Bug, Narew, San) drain predominantly lowlands, and - based on width - can be classified as small and medium rivers (40-610 m in width). The accuracy assessment is based on a comparison between water level anomalies from 34 VS and water level data from the nearest adjacent gauges, acquired from April 2016 to August 2019. The time lags between water level time series (VS vs. gauge) are estimated so that pairs of hydrographs agree in phase, which enables the comparison. It is found that the root mean square error ranges from 0.12 to 0.44 m, with mean of 0.22 m. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) varies between 0.40 and 0.98 (with mean of 0.84) for 67 pairs of time series, out of 68 considered. It is also argued that river width does not reveal any impact on the performance of the altimetric measurements over the study area. Likewise, land cover has not been identified as an environmental factor to constrain the data accuracy. However, it is found that complex river channel morphology and unfavourable geographical setting occur more frequently at VS with lower NSE (<= 0.8). The study confirms the usability of the Sentinel-3A altimetry along small and medium rivers, identifies factors to constrain the accuracy and - most importantly - provides yet another regional-scale investigation into quality of satellite radar measurements over inland waters.

TI  - Remote sensing and relief data to predict soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in a calcareous watershed, Iran
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) is a crucial property in hydrology, soil erosion and conservation, water resource and agriculture. In this study, we developed regression models for predicting Ks by employing easily-to-measure soil properties, remote sensing and relief data in a calcareous watershed, Iran. Surfer soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected in 106 points under different land uses (i.e. farmlands, rangelands and bare lands). Various easily-to-measure soil properties including sand, silt, clay, organic carbon, bulk density, calcium carbonate equivalent and soil moisture were determined for each sampling point. Moreover, the remote sensing data were derived from Landsat 8 satellite and relief data were acquired from DEM with 30 m resolution. The Ks was predicted by developed PTFs in literature and by using four new scenarios including the easily-to-measure soil properties (Scenario I), relief indices (Scenario II), remote sensing indices (Scenario III) and easily-to-measure soil variables plus relief indices plus remote sensing indices (Scenario IIII). The results indicated that for all data, the Crosby's model was the best model for predicting Ks (ME =-31.37 mm h(-1), RMSE = 40.45 mm h(-1) and R-2 = 0.585). Models used soil particles (sand and clay) and soil particles plus organic matter showed the highest performance for predicting Ks in farmlands, rangelands and bare lands, respectively. Additionally, applying the scenario IIII in all data resulted a high accuracy for predicting Ks data (ME =-4.186 mm h(-1), RMSE = 21.908 mm h(-1) and R-2 = 0.713). Moreover, scenario IIII in different land uses yielded better results in the prediction of Ks compared to other scenarios. It was concluded that the combining the soil data and environmental data could highly improve Ks prediction.

TI  - Inferring subsidence characteristics in Wuhan (China) through multitemporal InSAR and hydrogeological analysis
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wuhan (China) is facing severe consolidation subsidence of soft soil and karst collapse hazards. To quantitatively explore the extent and causes of land subsidence in Wuhan, we performed multitemporal interferometry (MTI) analysis using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the TerraSAR-X satellite from 2013 to 2017 and the Sentinel-1A satellite from 2015 to 2017. MTI results reveal four major subsidence zones in Wuhan, namely, Hankou (exceeding-6 cm/yr), Xudong-Qingshan (-3 cm/yr), Baishazhou-Jiangdi (-3 cm/yr), and JiansheYangluo (-2 cm/yr). Accuracy assessment using 106 levelling benchmarks and cross-validation between the two InSAR-based results indicate an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.5 and 3.1 mm/yr, respectively. Geophysical and geological analyses suggest that among the four major subsiding zones, Hankou, Xudong-Qingshan, and Jianshe-Yangluo are located in non-karstic soft soil areas, where shallow groundwater (< 30 m) declines driven by engineering dewatering and industrial water depletion contribute directly to soft soil compaction. Subsidence in the Baishazhou-Jiangdi zone develops in the karst terrain with abundant underground caves and fissures, which are major natural factors for gradual subsidence and karst collapse. Spatial variation analysis of the geological conditions indicates that the stage of karst development plays the most important role in influencing kart subsidence, followed by municipal construction, proximity to major rivers, and overlying soil structure. Moreover, land subsidence in this zone is affected more via coupling effects from multiple factors. Risk zoning analysis integrating subsidence horizontal gradient, InSAR deformation rates, and municipal construction density show that the high-risk areas in Wuhan are mainly distributed in the Tianxingzhou and BaishazhouJiangdi zone, and generally spread along the metro lines.

TI  - Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Extramammary Paget Disease
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - IMPORTANCE Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a frequently recurring malignant neoplasm with metastatic potential that presents in older adults on the genital, perianal, and axillary skin. Extramammary Paget disease can precede or occur along with internal malignant neoplasms.OBJECTIVE To develop recommendations for the care of adults with EMPD.EVIDENCE REVIEW A systematic review of the literature on EMPD from January 1990 to September 18, 2019, was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Libraries. Analysis included 483 studies. A multidisciplinary expert panel evaluation of the findings led to the development of clinical care recommendations for EMPD.FINDINGS The key findings were as follows: (1) Multiple skin biopsies, including those of any nodular areas, are critical for diagnosis. (2) Malignant neoplasm screening appropriate for age and anatomical site should be performed at baseline to distinguish between primary and secondary EMPD. (3) Routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection is not recommended. (4) For intraepidermal EMPD, surgical and nonsurgical treatments may be used depending on patient and tumor characteristics, although cure rates may be superior with surgical approaches. For invasive EMPD, surgical resection with curative intent is preferred. (5) Patients with unresectable intraepidermal EMPD or patients who are medically unable to undergo surgery may receive nonsurgical treatments, including radiotherapy, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy, carbon dioxide laser therapy, or other modalities. (6) Distant metastatic disease may be treated with chemotherapy or individualized targeted approaches. (7) Close follow-up to monitor for recurrence is recommended for at least the first 5 years.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinical practice guidelines for EMPD provide guidance regarding recommended diagnostic approaches, differentiation between invasive and noninvasive disease, and use of surgical vs nonsurgical treatments. Prospective registries may further improve our understanding of the natural history of the disease in primary vs secondary EMPD, clarify features of high-risk tumors, and identify superior management approaches.

TI  - Predicting suitable breeding areas for different locust species - A multi-scale approach accounting for environmental conditions and current land cover situation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present a fused multi-scale approach to model habitat suitability index (HSI) maps for three different locust species. The presented methodology was applied for the Italian locust (Calliptamus italicus, CIT) in Pavlodar oblast, Northern Kazakhstan, for the Moroccan locust (Dociostaurus maroccanus, DMA) in Turkistan oblast, South Kazakhstan and for the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) in Awash river basin, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia. The main novelty is based on implementing results from ecological niche modelling (ENM) with timeseries analyses of high spatial resolution remote sensing data (Sentinel-2) and further auxiliary datasets in a fused HSI model. Within the ENM important climatic variables (e.g. temperature, rainfall) and edaphic variables (e.g. sand and moisture contents) are included at a coarse spatial resolution. The analyses of Sentinel-2 time-series data enables mapping locust breeding habitats based on recent remotely sensed land observation at high spatial resolution and mirror the actual vegetation state, land use, land cover and in this way identify areas with favorable conditions for egg survival and breeding. The fused HSI results for year 2019 were validated based on ground field observation and reach area under curve (AUC) performance of 0.747% for CIT, 0.850% for DMA and 0.801% for desert locust. The innovation of this study is a multi-scale approach which accounts not only for climatic and environmental conditions but also for current vegetation and land management situation. This kind of up-to-date spatial detailed information on breeding suitability could enable area prioritization for risk assessment, monitoring and early intervention of locust pests.

TI  - Studies of the movement ecology of sharks justify the existence and expansion of marine protected areas in the Eastern Pacific Ocean
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a compilation of published telemetric results, complemented by the addition of new results where necessary, to justify the expansion of the marine protected areas in the Eastern Pacific. In addition, we furnish evidence that fishing effort by commercial vessels, carrying position-monitoring, satellite-communicating radio beacons, has diminished within their boundaries. Researchers have described the movement ecology of nine species of sharks at these insular sites: the Galapagos archipelago off Ecuador, Malpelo Island off Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and the Revillagigedo archipelago off Mexico. Mainly two telemetric techniques have been utilized: (1) placing coded ultrasonic beacons on individuals and detecting their presence with autonomous receivers deployed along the coasts of the islands and (2) outfitting individuals with SPOT and PSAT tags: the former enabling the ARGOS satellite to detect surface-swimming individuals, the latter releasing from individuals and rising to the surface to transmit geolocation based-positions to the same satellite. This information has enabled Mexico to create the Revillagigedo National Park, Colombia to increase the size of the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary, and Costa Rica to create a protective corridor between Cocos and the Las Gemelas seamounts. Satellite tracking of sharks outside the current boundaries of the Galapagos Marine Reserve supports the need to increase its size in the future. Hence, telemetric studies have played and continue to serve an essential role in providing a well-supported rationale for research managers to match the size of their marine reserves to the spatial ecologies of the species within them.

TI  - Melanocytic nevi in sentinel lymph nodes: association with cutaneous nevi and clinical relevance in patients with cutaneous melanomas
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Melanocytic nevi in lymph nodes (NNs) are an important histological differential diagnosis of initial sentinel lymph node (SN) metastasis in melanoma. Our aim was to associate NN in SNs with clinicopathologic features and survival rates in 1, 250 patients with SN biopsy for melanoma. Methods To compare patients with present and absent NN, we used Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U test, and multivariate logistic regression models in this retrospective observational study based on a prospectively maintained institutional database. Results NN prevalence in axillary, cervical, and groin SNs was 16.5%, 19.4%, and 9.8%, respectively. NN were observed in combination with all growth patterns of melanoma, but more frequently when the primary was histologically associated with a cutaneous nevus. We observed a decreasing NN prevalence with increasing SN metastasis diameter. Multiple logistic regression determined a significantly increased NN probability for SNs of the neck or axilla, for individuals with >= 50 cutaneous nevi, midline primary melanomas, and for individuals who reported non-cutaneous malignancies in their parents. Cancer in parents was also significantly more frequently reported by melanoma patients who had more than 50 cutaneous nevi. In SN-negative patients, NN indicated a tendency for slightly lower melanoma-specific survival. Conclusions We found a highly significant association between NN diagnosis and multiple cutaneous nevi and provided circumstantial evidence that cutaneous nevi in the drainage area of lymph nodes are particularly important. The trend toward lower melanoma-specific survival in SN-negative patients with NN suggests that careful differentiation of SN metastases is important.

TI  - Total water vapour columns derived from Sentinel 5P using the AMC-DOAS method
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapour is the most abundant natural greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere, and global data sets are required for meteorological applications and climate research. The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) launched on 13 October 2017 has a high spatial resolution of around 5 km and a daily global coverage. Currently, there is no operational total water vapour product for S5P measurements. Here, we present first results of a new scientific total column water vapour (TCWV) product for S5P using the so-called air-mass-corrected differential optical absorption spectroscopy (AMC-DOAS) scheme. This method analyses spectral data between 688 and 700 nm and has already been successfully applied to measurements from the Global Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on ERS-2, the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) on Envisat and GOME-2 on MetOp.The adaptation of the AMC-DOAS method to S5P data requires an additional post-processing procedure to correct the influences of surface albedo, cloud height and cloud fraction. The quality of the new AMC-DOAS S5P water vapour product is assessed by comparisons with data from GOME-2 on MetOp-B retrieved also with the AMC-DOAS algorithm and with four independent data sets, namely reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF ERA5), data obtained by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager and Sounder (SSMIS) flown on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platform 16 and two scientific S5P TCWV products derived from TROPOMI measurements. Both are recently published TCWV products for S5P provided by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC) in Mainz and the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON), Utrecht. The SRON TCWV is limited to clear-sky scenes over land.These comparisons reveal a good agreement between the various data sets but also some systematic differences between all of them. On average, the daily derived offset between AMC-DOAS S5P TCWV and AMC-DOAS GOME2B TCWV is negative (around -1.5 kg m(-2)) over land and positive over ocean surfaces (more than 1.5 kg m(-2)). In contrast, SSMIS TCWV is on average lower than AMC-DOAS S5P TCWV by about 3 kg m(-2).Monthly averaged ERA5 TCWV and AMC-DOAS S5P TCWV comparison shows spatial features over both land and water surface. Over land, there are systematic spatial structures. There are larger differences between AMCDOAS S5P TCWV and ERA5 TCWV in tropical regions. Over sea, AMC-DOAS S5P TCWV is slightly lower than ERA5 TCWV by around 2 kg m(-2). The AMC-DOAS S5P TCWV and S5P TCWV from MPIC agree on average within 1 kg m(-2) over both land and ocean. TCWV from SRON shows daily global averaged differences to AMC-DOAS S5P TCWV of around 1.2 kg m(-2). All of these differences are in line with the accuracy of these products and with the typical range of differences of 5 kg m(-2) obtained when comparing different TCWV data sets. The AMC-DOAS TCWV product for S5P provides therefore a valuable new and independent data set for atmospheric applications which also has a higher spatial coverage than the other S5P TCWV products.

TI  - Uncertainty of city-based urban heat island intensity across 1112 global cities: Background reference and cloud coverage
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As an urban heat island (UHI) is closely associated with a wide variety of environmental issues, it is necessary to monitor its spatiotemporal variations in an accurate and timely manner. However, the accuracy of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) estimation is greatly challenged by three issues. Namely, less attention has been given to city-based global studies, LSUHII (SUHII difference) is induced when various methods are used to the determine background reference, and uncertainty arises in the methods for coping with missing land surface temperature (LST). Thus, this paper quantitatively evaluated these different methods and their impacts on spatiotemporal SUHII variations across 1112 global cities. There are two major findings: (1) the modified equal area-rural (MEA-R) method can overcome the limitations of the other methods. The fixed buffer (FB) method is limited by the difficulty of buffer selection and the inapplicability of a single fixed buffer for various cities, particularly in large-scale studies. The simplified urban-extent (SUE) method is challenged by cluster discrepancies and data obsolescence issues, and the modified equal area-suburban (MEA-S) method underestimates SUHII resulting from strong human activities in suburban areas. The daytime LSUHII induced by different methods for the reference definition reaches 0.62 K, accounting for 42% of the average SUHII. LSUHII is 0.34 K (23%) at night. LSUHII with evident spatiotemporal variations indicates that the different methods used to define the background reference introduce a considerable uncertainty to SUHII research. (2) After comparing methods for coping with missing LST, the first spatial and after temporal aggregation with threshold removal (FSAT-T) method is demonstrated to provided improved robustness to data missing over other methods. Daytime LSUHII is over 0.1 K in 62% of cities, and nighttime LSUHII is over 0.1 K in 45% of cities. Strong latitudinal and seasonal variations of LSUHII induced by the different methods used to cope with missing data introduce uncertainty and incomparability to SUHII research. Moreover, various image quality control (QC) methods and the effects from these methods on SUHII are discussed. The accuracy of QC methods changes with the error distribution of the image quality. Further investigations are required to determine the optimal QC method. The questions of whether different background definition affects the atmospheric UHI were also discussed. In this paper, a promising strategy for estimating city-based SUHII is proposed and a global-scale database based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) is established to support further research on the variations and controls of SUHI.

TI  - Characteristics of Pre-summer Daytime Cloud Regimes over Coastal South China from the Himawari-8 Satellite
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the high spatiotemporal resolution (2 km-and-10 min) data from the Advanced Himawari Imager onboard the Himawari-8 satellite, this study documents the fine-scale characteristics of daytime cloud regimes (CRs) over coastal South China during the pre-summer rainy season (April-June). Six CRs (CR1-CR6) are identified based on the joint frequency distribution of cloud top brightness temperature and cloud optical thickness, namely, the optically thin-to-moderate cloud mixture, optically thin warm clouds with cirrus, optically thick warm clouds, weak convective cloud mixture, strong convective clouds, and extreme, deep convective clouds. The optically thick warm clouds are the major CR during April and May, with higher frequencies over land, especially along the urban agglomeration, rather than the offshore which may be an indicator of the higher aerosol concentrations being a contributing factor over the cities. The CRs with weak convective cloud mixtures and strong convective clouds appear more frequently over the land, while the two CRs with optically thinner clouds occur mainly offshore. Synoptic flow patterns (SPs) are objectively identified and examined focusing on those favoring the two major rain-producing CRs (CR5 and CR6) and the highly reflective CR with optically thick warm clouds (CR3). The two SPs favoring CR5 and CR6 are characterized by abundant moisture with low-level jets after monsoon onset, and a northwest high-southeast low pattern with strong dynamic convergence along the coastline, respectively. The non-convective CR3 with high reflectance is related to a SP that features the western North Pacific subtropical high extending more westward, leading to a moderate moisture supply and a wide range of convective available potential energy, but also, large convective inhibition.

TI  - Acetate Improves the Killing of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> by Alveolar Macrophages <i>via</i> NLRP3 Inflammasome and Glycolysis-HIF-1α Axis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolites produced mainly by the gut microbiota with a known role in immune regulation. Acetate, the major SCFA, is described to disseminate to distal organs such as lungs where it can arm sentinel cells, including alveolar macrophages, to fight against bacterial intruders. In the current study, we explored mechanisms through which acetate boosts macrophages to enhance their bactericidal activity. RNA sequencing analyses show that acetate triggers a transcriptomic program in macrophages evoking changes in metabolic process and immune effector outputs, including nitric oxide (NO) production. In addition, acetate enhances the killing activity of macrophages towards Streptococcus pneumoniae in an NO-dependent manner. Mechanistically, acetate improves IL-1 beta production by bacteria-conditioned macrophages and the latter acts in an autocrine manner to promote NO production. Strikingly, acetate-triggered IL-1 beta production was neither dependent of its cell surface receptor free-fatty acid receptor 2, nor of the enzymes responsible for its metabolism, namely acetyl-CoA synthetases 1 and 2. We found that IL-1 beta production by acetate relies on NLRP3 inflammasome and activation of HIF-1 alpha, the latter being triggered by enhanced glycolysis. In conclusion, we unravel a new mechanism through which acetate reinforces the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages.

TI  - Insights on fault reactivation during the 2019 November 11, <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 4.9 Le Teil earthquake in southeastern France, from a joint 3-D geological model and InSAR time-series analysis
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019, M-w 4.9 Le Teil earthquake occurred in southeastern France, causing substantial damage in this slow deforming region. Field observations, remote sensing and seismological studies following the event revealed that coseismic slip concentrates at shallow depth along a similar to 5 km long rupture associated with surface breaks and a thrusting mechanism. We further investigate this earthquake by combining geological field mapping, 3-D geology, InSAR time-series analysis and a coseismic slip inversion. From structural, stratigraphic and geological data collected around the epicentre, we first produce a 3-D geological model of the region surrounding the rupture using the GeoModeller software. Our model includes the geometry of the geological layers and the main faults, including the La Rouviere Fault, (LRF) the Oligocene normal fault that ruptured during the earthquake. We generate a time-series of surface displacement from Sentinel-1 SAR data ranging from early 2019 January to late 2020 January using the NSBAS processing chain. The spatio-temporal patterns of surface displacement for this time span show neither a clear pre-seismic signal nor significant post-seismic transient deformation. We extract the coseismic displacement pattern from the InSAR time-series, highlighting along-strike variations of coseismic surface slip. The maximum relative displacement along the line of sight is up to similar to 16 cm and is located in the southwestern part of the rupture. We invert for the slip distribution on the fault from the InSAR coseismic surface displacement field. Constraining our fault geometry from the geological model, acceptable fault dip ranges between 55 degrees and 60 degrees. Our model confirms the reactivation of LRF, with reverse slip at very shallow depth and two main slip patches reaching, respectively, 30 and 24 cm of slip, both around 500 m depth. We finally discuss how the 3-D fault geometry and geological structure may have impacted the slip distribution and propagation during the earthquake. This study is a step to reassess the seismic hazard of the many faults similar to the La Rouviere one along the Cevennes fault system, in a densely populated area hosting several sensitive nuclear sites.

TI  - V. Bibikhin's practical phenomenology
T2  - STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to understanding the worldview expressed in Vladimir Bibikhin's Leo Tolstoy's Diaries. The most important feature of this worldview is its practical nature: Bibikhin focuses on changing one's view of things instead of trying to develop a doctrine. Practical phenomenology is extremely vulnerable to criticism because of its pre-philosophical nature. Therefore, at this stage, I try to explicate some of the features of this peculiar thought while avoiding trying to find its faults. I draw a connection between Bibikhin's ontological interpretation of the phenomenon with Heidegger's concept of detachment (Gelassenheit) as a form of behavior, and illustrate that practical phenomenology turns out to be an ontology of contact. It thematizes the philosopher's own being and focuses on the problems of the contact made in the "change of view," in which thought, word, and deed converge. Bibikhin's practical phenomenology is on the outskirts of modern academic philosophy, gravitating towards understanding philosophy as a way of life, in which the contemplative attitude takes the leading place, paradoxically combining experiment with their perception of "first things," trust in them, and the ability to describe the indescribable, the "change of view." This makes practical phenomenology related to the experimental phenomenology of Michel Henry.

TI  - History of a disaster: A baseline assessment of the Wakashio oil spill on the coast of Mauritius, Indian Ocean
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills from tanker ships provide adverse and irreversible impacts of a pollutant over coastal and marine environments. Using Sentinel-1 and 2 satellite images, this baseline paper presents the detection, assessment, and monitoring of the aground and further oil spill from the Wakashio ship of August 06, 2020, on the Mauritius coast. The oil spill started on August 06, after cracks developed on the hull, and continued until the total breakup of the ship on August 15, 2020. Data shows displacements in ship position of about 100 m, and a maximum change of 80 degrees in orientation (from NS to NE). The remote sensing results were validated using met-ocean observations and reanalysis, which showed winds, waves, and tides of high magnitude at the accident site during the incident period. Analysis of the results of this event using REAS and CMEMS data indicate their usefulness to study similar future oil spills events.

TI  - A crowdsourced global data set for validating built-up surface layers
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Several global high-resolution built-up surface products have emerged over the last five years, taking full advantage of open sources of satellite data such as Landsat and Sentinel. However, these data sets require validation that is independent of the producers of these products. To fill this gap, we designed a validation sample set of 50 K locations using a stratified sampling approach independent of any existing global built-up surface products. We launched a crowdsourcing campaign using Geo-Wiki (https://www.geo-wiki.org/) to visually interpret this sample set for built-up surfaces using very highresolution satellite images as a source of reference data for labelling the samples, with a minimum of five validations per sample location. Data were collected for 10 m sub-pixels in an 80 x 80 m grid to allow for geo-registration errors as well as the application of different validation modes including exact pixel matching to majority or percentage agreement. The data set presented in this paper is suitable for the validation and inter-comparison of multiple products of built-up areas.

TI  - Research on remote sensing image extraction based on deep learning
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has the advantages of fast information acquisition, short cycle, and a wide detection range. It is frequently used in surface resource monitoring tasks. However, traditional remote sensing image segmentation technology cannot make full use of the rich spatial information of the image, the workload is too large, and the accuracy is not high enough. To address these problems, this study carried out atmospheric calibration, band combination, image fusion, and other data enhancement methods for Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing data to improve the data quality. In addition, deep learning is applied to remote-sensing image block segmentation. An asymmetric convolution-CBAM (AC-CBAM) module based on the convolutional block attention module is proposed. This optimization module of the integrated attention and sliding window prediction method is adopted to effectively improve the segmentation accuracy. In the experiment of test data, the mIoU, mAcc, and aAcc in this study reached 97.34%, 98.66%, and 98.67%, respectively, which is 1.44% higher than that of DNLNet (95.9%). The AC-CBAM module of this research provides a reference for deep learning to realize the automation of remote sensing land information extraction. The experimental code of our AC-CBAM module can be found at https://github.com/LinB203/remotesense.

TI  - Feature selection by genetic algorithm in nonlinear taper model
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree stem profile results from a complex structure of shapes and dimensions determined by ecological processes within the forest. However, the feature selection in the development of taper models has been underinvestigated to date. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) to assess factors that affect the stem taper and volume of Eucalyptus urograndis trees at different ages (2, 7, and 14 years) in Brazil. A total of 213 sample trees were measured in diameter and height along the stem, crown width, crown base height, crown length, and crown ratio. These variables and the stand age were supplied to the GA that selects variables, replacing those of Kozak's 2004 model. The performance of models was evaluated using error statistics and residual plots. The GA model was efficient in predicting diameters and volumes, mainly by increasing the accuracy of the estimates in the extreme portions of the trees. This was attributed to the selection of morphometric variables as predictors of stem taper and volume, making them understandable in ecological terms. We highlight GA as a robust tool, since it incorporated the morphometric variables in Kozak's model that contribute to the estimates.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between ambient temperature and common viral and bacterial gastroenteritis in the Republic of Korea, which has a high-income and temperate climate, considering the different lagged effects of each causative pathogen.Methods: We obtained the number of weekly reported cases of infectious gastroenteritis caused by norovirus, group A rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, Clostridium perfringens, non-typhoidal Salmonella, and Campylobacter between 2015 and 2019 from the Korean Infectious Diseases Sentinel Surveillance System. We obtained weather data from the Korea Meteorological Administration for the same period. Generalized linear models with quasi Poisson distributions and distributed lag non-linear models were utilized after adjusting for relative humidity, precipitation, long-term trends, and seasonality. We investigated the associations between weekly mean temperature and the weekly number of reported cases of each type of infectious gastroenteritis by applying different maximum lags for each type.Results: Compared with the 50th percentile temperature, the lag-cumulative relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at the 5th percentile temperature for norovirus gastroenteritis, rotavirus gastroenteritis, adenovirus gastroenteritis were 11.0 (4.7-25.7), 2.7 (1.4-5.2), and 4.7 (1.4-15.8) by applying the maximum lag of 6, 4, and 3 weeks, respectively. Compared with the 50th percentile temperature, the lag cumulative RRs with 95% CIs at the 95th percentile temperature for C. perfringens gastroenteritis, Salmonella gastroenteritis, and Campylobacter gastroenteritis were 1.2 (0.8-1.9), 3.0 (1.5-6.2), and 2.0 (1.1-3.6), by applying the maximum lag of 2, 3, and 2 weeks, respectively.Conclusions: Cold temperature increased the risk of viral gastroenteritis and showed relatively long lagged effects. Hot temperature increased the risk of bacterial gastroenteritis and showed relatively short lagged effects.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of same-day mastectomy, with or without a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Methods In this retrospective study, we reviewed 913 consecutive women who underwent a simple mastectomy for breast cancer between the years 2014 and 2019 and were treated either with same-day surgery (SDS) or an overnight stay (OS) regime. We reviewed all surgical complications, any unplanned return to care (RTC) and the rehospitalization rate for 30 postoperative days. Results A total of 259 patients (28%) were treated with SDS and 654 patients (72%) with an OS regime. There was no difference in RTC (odds ratio: 0.79 [95% confidence interval: 0.53-1.18], p = 0.26) or any major complications between the groups. None of the investigated subgroups, such as patients with previous neoadjuvant therapy, diabetes, obesity (up to a body mass index of 40 kg/m(2)), the American Society of Anaesthesiologist Class of 3, or elderly patients aged 75-84 years, showed an increased complication rate when treated with the SDS regime. Conclusion A same-day simple mastectomy is safe with SNB and/or ALND. It can be performed safely for most patients with stable co-morbidities.

M3  - Article
AB  - The reserve of Tamarix forest, located in Changyi, China, is the only national marine special reserve taking Tamarix as the main object of protection. Compared with conventional monitoring technology, remote sensing technology can more comprehensively reflect the ecological environment status and spatial-temporal variation of monitoring objects. Based on spectral characteristics and remote sensing vegetation indices, the ecological status and spatial-temporal variation of Tamarix chinensis forest in the reserve deserve further exploration. Therefore, spectral characteristic, typical vegetation indices, comprehensive health index, VFC, and REP were analyzed based on Sentinel-2A images. Spatial-temporal variation analysis during 2014 to 2018 was analyzed based on GF-1 images. The research result indicated that ecological quality of protection zone showed an overall growth trend with the help of artificial ecological restoration, and it is possible to continuously implement ecological recovery towards the protection zone.

TI  - A background-free phenology index for improved monitoring of vegetation phenology
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of vegetation phenology (e.g., the start and end of the growing season, SOS and EOS) is helpful for understanding the impacts of climate change on vegetation and the terrestrial carbon cycle. The remote sensing-based vegetation index (e.g., enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and remote sensing-based phenology index (e.g., normalized difference greenness index, NDGI) are the major data sources for phenology monitoring at regional and global scales. However, these remote sensing-based indices are vulnerable to the influences of backgrounds and their variations. As a result, it is difficult to obtain high-precision vegetation phenology by using only the remote sensing-based indices, especially for the EOS. In this study, we developed a background-free phenology index (BFPI) by coupling the remote sensing-based index and the meteorological factor-based normalized growing season index (calculated by the normalized daily minimum temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and photoperiod). The BFPIs (BFPIEVI and BFPINDGI) were constructed as products of the EVI/NDGI and normalized growing season index. The performances of the BFPIs in phenology monitoring were evaluated by using the gross primary production data from 64 carbon flux towers and green chromatic coordinate data from 57 PhenoCam sites in forests and grasslands in the Northern Hemisphere. The results showed that the BFPIs performed better than the remote sensing-based indices in phenology monitoring for both forests and grasslands. The BFPINDGI performed better than the BFPIEVI for SOS monitoring, and the two BFPIs had nearly equal performances for monitoring the EOS of grasslands. For forests, the BFPIEVI performed better than the BFPINDGI in phenology monitoring. Although the performances of the BFPIs were limited for EOS monitoring, the phenology monitoring accuracy based on BFPIs were still obviously higher than that based on the remote sensing indices. Overall, the newly-developed BFPI that integrates biological and meteorological factors not only improved the precision of phenology monitoring, but also provided a new perspective for multisource data-based phenology monitoring.

TI  - One-Dimensional Variational Retrieval of Temperature and Humidity Profiles from the FY4A GIIRS
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A physical retrieval approach based on the one-dimensional variational (1D-Var) algorithm is applied in this paper to simultaneously retrieve atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles under both clear-sky and partly cloudy conditions from FY-4A GIIRS (geostationary interferometric infrared sounder) observations. Radiosonde observations from upper-air stations in China and level-2 operational products from the Chinese National Satellite Meteorological Center (NSMC) during the periods from December 2019 to January 2020 (winter) and from July 2020 to August 2020 (summer) are used to validate the accuracies of the retrieved temperature and humidity profiles. Comparing the 1D-Var-retrieved profiles to radiosonde data, the accuracy of the temperature retrievals at each vertical level of the troposphere is characterized by a root mean square error (RMSE) within 2 K, except for at the bottom level of the atmosphere under clear conditions. The RMSE increases slightly for the higher atmospheric layers, owing to the lack of temperature sounding channels there. Under partly cloudy conditions, the temperature at each vertical level can be obtained, while the level-2 operational products obtain values only at altitudes above the cloud top. In addition, the accuracy of the retrieved temperature profiles is greatly improved compared with the accuracies of the operational products. For the humidity retrievals, the mean RMSEs in the troposphere in winter and summer are both within 2 g kg(-1). Moreover, the retrievals performed better compared with the ERA5 reanalysis data between 800 hPa and 300 hPa both in summer and winter in terms of RMSE.

TI  - Influence of the transported Canadian wildfire smoke on the ozone and particle pollution over the Mid-Atlantic United States
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of observations and models can improve air quality forecasts (in particular ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM)) for extreme events (e.g., wildfires). We present our work on the Canadian wildfire event on 6-12 June 2015 that impacted the air quality in the Mid-Atlantic region in the U.S. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry package (WRF-Chem), and various measurements from both ground-based and spaceborne observations, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirNow data, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operated TROPospheric OZone lidar (TROPOZ), wind radar profiler, ceilometer, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The objective is to understand the physics of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and its role on the O-3 and PM forecast. The findings show that the model captured the O-3 diurnal variation and PM spatial distribution both horizontally and vertically by comparing with EPA AirNow and MODIS/CALIOP observations, respectively. Wildfire smoke was transported from central Canada through Lake Michigan, passing the Ohio River Valley and down to the Baltimore-Washington D.C. metropolis. The nighttime O-3 mixing ratio reached 30 ppbv, while the daytime O-3 mixing ratio approached larger than 100 ppbv near AirNow stations in Maryland, due to the mixing of the transported smoke into the PBL. The novel NASA TROPOZ lidar at Beltsville resolved the O-3 vertical profile and the ceilometer identified the smoke intrusion at altitudes above 3.5 km, but later mixed down into the PBL and surface which was also resolved by the model. Thus, integrating both model and observations from different platforms confirms the Canadian wildfire source and transport pathway and improves the understanding of the air quality forecast during the extreme wildfire event.

TI  - Review of the Forel-Ule Index based on in situ and remote sensing methods and application in water quality assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Water pollution is considered an acute worldwide environmental issue. At present, the commonly adopted method of water quality characterisation involves the retrieval of optically active water quality parameters based on remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), but this method is subject to the limitation that understanding local scatter and absorption characteristics of light is essential to precisely derive these parameters. Water colour primarily depends on water constituents and is traditionally gauged with the Forel-Ule (FU) scale. In recent years, R-rs within the visible region has been considered to determine the Forel-Ule Index (FUI) for water colour measurement. The FUI exhibits the advantages of remote sensing and does not rely on local retrieval algorithms. Therefore, this index can characterise natural waters in a simple and globally effective manner. As there exists a lack of review articles on the FUI, we present a comprehensive review of this index that may help researchers progress. First, we introduce the most recent techniques for FUI measurement, especially remote sensing-deriving methods. Then, we summarise FUI applications in water quality assessment of oceans and inland waters. Finally, FUI development trends, challenges and application perspectives are examined.

TI  - NIRv and SIF better estimate phenology than NDVI and EVI: Effects of spring and autumn phenology on ecosystem production of planted forests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology plays an important role in affecting carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems in the context of climate change. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to investigate land surface phenology and the effects of phenology on ecosystem production at regional and global scales. Recently, the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have been shown to be more promising metrics of gross primary production (GPP) than the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). However, there is a lack of comparison in the performance of these techniques for deriving phenological metrics. In this study, we explored the consistency in phenological metrics derived from both remote sensing approaches (NDVI, EVI, NIRv, and SIF) and flux tower GPP at six plantations (two broadleaf forests (BF) and four coniferous forests (CF)) in eastern China over the period 2006-2020. The vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NIRv) were derived from MODIS data, and SIF was based on the global, OCO-2 based SIF product (GOSIF). We further evaluated the effects of spring and autumn phenology on GPP. The results showed that the flux tower GPP was effectively tracked by NDVI, EVI, NIRv, and SIF (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the phenological metrics derived from EVI, NIRv, and SIF, including the start of growing season (SOS), the end of growing season (EOS), and the length of growing season (GSL), had significant relationships with those derived from GPP at the six plantations (P < 0.05). NIRv and SIF were more effective at estimating phenological information than NDVI and EVI. In addition, the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values between the GPPand NIRv-retrieved phenological dates were less than those derived from NDVI, EVI, and SIF at the BF sites. However, the differences among RMSD values of NDVI, EVI, NIRv, and SIF were not significant at the CF sites. The linear regression analysis showed that the advance of SOSGPP (i.e., SOS derived from GPP) significantly increased GPP (R2=0.29, P < 0.05) over the period from March to April, and the delay of EOSGPP (i.e., EOS derived from GPP) remarkably enhanced GPP (R2=0.61, P < 0.001) over the period from September to October at the BF sites. The relationship of EOSGPP with GPP (R2=0.90, P < 0.05) over the period September-October was strong at the CF sites. In addition, the variations of annual GPP could be captured by GSLGPP x GPPmax, GSLNIRv x NIRvmax, and GSLSIF x SIFmax effectively across the BF and CF sites. These findings can help us understand the potential ability of NIRv and SIF in estimating phenological metrics and in revealing the effects of vegetation phenology on the carbon cycle.

TI  - Soil moisture content retrieval from Landsat 8 data using ensemble learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although detailed spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture is crucial for numerous applications, current global soil moisture products generally have low spatial resolutions (25-50 km), which largely limit their application at local scales. In this study, we developed a high-resolution soil moisture retrieval framework based on ensemble learning by integrating Landsat 8 optical and thermal observations with multi-source datasets, including in-situ measurements from 1,154 stations in the International Soil Moisture Network, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product, the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset, and auxiliary datasets (terrain, soil texture, and precipitation). Two widely used ensemble learning models were explored and compared using ten-fold cross-validation. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model performed slightly better than the random forest (RF) model, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.047 m(3)/m(3) and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.952, respectively. Further validation using data from four independent soil moisture networks demonstrated that the prediction accuracy of the XGBoost model was comparable to the SMAP soil moisture product, but with a much higher spatial resolution. The model was finally used to map soil moisture over the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau, which is especially sensitive to climate change, from May to September of 2015. The comparison between our fine-scale soil moisture map at 30 m resolution and the coarse-scale SMAP soil moisture product (36 km) revealed high spatial consistency. These results suggest that there is potential to generate accurate soil moisture products globally at 30 m spatial resolution from the long-term Landsat archive. This finding has practical implications in scenarios requiring fine-scale soil moisture maps, such as climate change and permafrost modeling, hydrological and land surface modeling, and agriculture monitoring.

TI  - Earlier snowmelt predominates advanced spring vegetation greenup in Alaska
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is considered a vital component in the northern climate system, however, our understanding of the impacts of snowmelt on spring phenological shifts is still limited for high-latitude ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed the start of growing season (SOS) and its response to the process of snowmelt over 2000-2019 using multiple ground observations, satellite data products, and climate datasets in Alaska and part of Canada Yukon among five ecoregions. We found that the earlier snowmelt resulting from warming spring dominates the advanced spring vegetation phenology in the region. Spring vegetation greenup follows the start of snowmelt (SOM). During 2000-2019, the SOM and SOS advanced in a similar spatial pattern across the ecoregions, and SOS experienced further advancement than SOM. On average, SOS advanced about 0.49 days per day of SOM advancement. The impacts of snowmelt on vegetation phenology are largely driven by the snowmelt-induced synergistic changes in soil temperature and soil water content. As snowmelt starts, the infiltration of snowmelt water and insulation of the remaining snow cover stimulate the vegetation activities below the snow. The responses of SOS to the snowmelt phenology varied among the different ecoregions are associated with the varied climate backgrounds and vegetation types. Greater SOS and SOM advancements were found in the taiga-tundra ecotone, while lower changes were detected over the tundra. This study suggests that the snow cover and snowmelt phenology should be considered to better understand the vegetation seasonality under climate change in the high latitudes.

TI  - Calculating the Climatology and Anomalies of Surface Cloud Radiative Effect Using Cloud Property Histograms and Cloud Radiative Kernels
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud radiative kernels (CRK) built with radiative transfer models have been widely used to analyze the cloud radiative effect on top of atmosphere (TOA) fluxes, and it is expected that the CRKs would also be useful in the analyses of surface radiative fluxes, which determines the regional surface temperature change and variability. In this study, CRKs at the surface and TOA were built using the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM). Longwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) at the surface is primarily driven by cloud base properties, while TOA CRE is primarily decided by cloud top properties. For this reason, the standard version of surface CRK is a function of latitude, longitude, month, cloud optical thickness (tau) and cloud base pressure (CBP), and the TOA CRK is a function of latitude, longitude, month, tau and cloud top pressure (CTP). Considering that the cloud property histograms provided by climate models are functions of CTP instead of CBP at present, the surface CRKs on CBP-tau histograms were converted to CTP-tau fields using the statistical relationship between CTP, CBP and tau obtained from collocated CloudSat and MODIS observations. For both climate model outputs and satellites observations, the climatology of surface CRE and cloud-induced surface radiative anomalies calculated with the surface CRKs and cloud property histograms are well correlated with those calculated from surface radiative fluxes. The cloud-induced surface radiative anomalies reproduced by surface CRKs and MODIS cloud property histograms are not affected by spurious trends that appear in Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) surface irradiances products.

TI  - Predicting plant diversity in beach wetland downstream of Xiaolangdi reservoir with UAV and satellite multispectral images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely acquisition of plant diversity information downstream of the reservoir is helpful to understand the impact mechanism of reservoir operation on wetland plant diversity and formulate reasonable water and sediment regulation strategies. In this study, we conducted field surveys in two communities (Phragmites australis and Tamarix chinensis) at a typical wetland in the lower reaches of Xiaolangdi Reservoir on the Yellow River, and employed UAV and Gaofen 1B multispectral images to estimate the wetland plant diversity. Results showed that most diversity indexes had a higher correlation with the mean of spectral vegetation indexes (DVI, RVI, NDVI, SAVI, and MSAVI). The diversity indexes (C_SP and C_SW) constructed by relative coverage had a better overall correlation with spectral indexes. Interestingly, opposite correlations were found between Tamarix chinensis and Phragmites australis plots. We further gave a deep insight into the interspecific associations in Phragmites australis and Tamarix chinensis plots with the variance ratio (VR) method. It was found that plant species in Tamarix chinensis plot showed positive association (VR 1), with a VR value of 1.095. Plant species in Phragmites australis plot had a negative association (VR < 1), with a VR value of 0.983. In Phragmites australis plot, C_SP and C_SW showed a significant decreasing trend (r(2) of 0.36 and 0.33 respectively, and P values less than 0.001) with the increase of Phragmites australis coverage. Moreover, the effect of spatial resolution was not significant on plant diversity estimation. Correlations between remote sensing indexes and diversity indexes were improved with the quadrat size changing from 2 m x 2 m to 4 m x 4 m. These findings demonstrate promising approaches for remote sensing of wetland plant diversity and indicate that the type of wetland plant community determines the relationship between diversity index and spectral index.

TI  - Investigating the Impact of Land Use/Land Cover Change on Present and Future Land Surface Temperature (LST) of Chittagong, Bangladesh
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has a significant impact on microclimate, which eventually contributes to local and regional climate change. Unplanned urbanization is widespread in developing countries like Bangladesh. Chittagong, the second largest city, is experiencing rapid urban expansion. Since urban growth introduces a number of environmental issues, including changes in land surface temperature (LST), it is important to investigate the association between urbanization pattern and LST in Chittagong. In this work, we have analyzed the influence of land use and land cover (LULC) of Chittagong Metropolitan Area (CMA) on LST using multi-date Landsat data of 1990, 2005 and 2020. We have used an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm for LULC classification and an image-based method to compute LST from Landsat data. The results revealed that built-up areas, waterbodies and agricultural lands have increased by 4.57%, 1.04% and 0.94%, respectively, whereas vegetation has decreased by 0.34% and bare lands by 0.87% between 1990 and 2020. As expected, built-up area experienced maximum temperatures followed by bare lands. Waterbodies, on the other hand, exhibited minimum temperature in all years considered, followed by vegetation. Correlations between biophysical variables, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Bare Soil Index (BSI), and LST indicated that NDVI and MNDWI were in a strong negative relationship, whereas NDBI and BSI have showed positive correlation with LST. Lastly, LST is predicted based on the relationship between LST and biophysical variables with an ANN algorithm, which demonstrated that the temperature may reach to a critical state by 2050, if the present trend of urban growth continues.

TI  - A practical approach to flood hazard, vulnerability, and risk assessing and mapping for Quang Binh province, Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Flood damage is often severe and directly affects housing, transport infrastructure, industrial, service, commercial, and land use. A flood risk assessment based on vulnerability indicators can provide valuable information to support decision-making and operational strategies to reduce disaster damage. The main objective of this study is to propose a framework for assessing flood risk based on flood hazard factor and its relationship with flood vulnerability indicators. We applied an integrated machine learning (ML) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) framework for a case study of Quang Binh province, Vietnam. Several state-of-the-art ML models of AdaBoost, logistic regression, and AdaBoost-Logistic were applied to build a flood hazard map. AHP was employed to integrate vulnerability criteria for the assessment. We used 671 flooding locations of historical flooding events in 2007, 2010, 2016, and 2020 in Quang Binh province; and 14 flood conditioning factors relating to geo-environment to generate and verify the flood susceptibility models. Statistical indexes were applied to verify the used models. The validated result showed that the AdaBoost-Logistic ensemble model has the best performance of AUC = 0.996. The flood hazard map was combined with flood vulnerability maps to generate a valuable flood risk assessment map for Quang Binh province. The result of this study shows that 330,579 ha (40.99%) is in very low-risk zones, 349,511 ha (43.33%) in low-risk zones, 50,628 ha (6.28%) in medium risk zones, 48,688 ha (6.04%) in high-risk zones, and 27,121 ha (3.36%) in extremely high-risk zones. This proposed methodology and flood risk map result can be beneficial for selecting priority measures for flood risk reduction and management.

TI  - Identification and apportionment of shallow groundwater nitrate pollution in Weining Plain, northwest China, using hydrochemical indices, nitrate stable isotopes, and the new Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (MixSIAR)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater nitrate (NO3) pollution is a worldwide environmental problem. Therefore, identification and partitioning of its potential sources are of great importance for effective control of groundwater quality. The current study was carried out to identify the potential sources of groundwater NO3- pollution and determine their apportionment in different land use/land cover (LULC) types in a traditional agricultural area, Weining Plain, in Northwest China. Multiple hydrochemical indices, as well as dual NO3- isotopes (delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3), were used to investigate the groundwater quality and its influencing factors. LULC patterns of the study area were first determined by interpreting remote sensing image data collected from the Sentinel-2 satellite, then the Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (MixSIAR) was used to estimate proportional contributions of the potential sources to groundwater NO3- concentrations. Groundwater quality in the study area was influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors, with anthropological impact being more important. The results of LULC revealed that the irrigated land is the dominant LULC type in the plain, covering an area of 576.6 km(2) (57.18% of the total surface study area of the plain). On the other hand, the results of the NO3- isotopes suggested that manure and sewage (M&S), as well as soil nitrogen (SN), were the major contributors to groundwater NO3-. Moreover, the results obtained from the MixSIAR model showed that the mean proportional contributions of M&S to groundwater NO3- were 55.5, 43.4, 21.4, and 78.7% in the forest, irrigated, paddy, and urban lands, respectively. While SN showed mean proportional contributions of 29.9, 43.4, 61.5, and 12.7% in the forest, irrigated, paddy, and urban lands, respectively. The current study provides valuable information for local authorities to support sustainable groundwater management in the study region.

TI  - Exploiting time series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to detect grassland mowing events using deep learning with reject region
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Governments pay agencies to control the activities of farmers who receive governmental support. Field visits are costly and highly time-consuming; hence remote sensing is widely used for monitoring farmers' activities. Nowadays, a vast amount of available data from the Sentinel mission significantly boosted research in agriculture. Estonia is among the first countries to take advantage of this data source to automate mowing and ploughing events detection across the country. Although techniques that rely on optical data for monitoring agriculture events are favourable, the availability of such data during the growing season is limited. Thus, alternative data sources have to be evaluated. In this paper, we developed a deep learning model with an integrated reject option for detecting grassland mowing events using time series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 optical images acquired from 2000 fields in Estonia in 2018 during the vegetative season. The rejection mechanism is based on a threshold over the prediction confidence of the proposed model. The proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique and achieves event accuracy of 73.3% and end of season accuracy of 94.8%.

TI  - Google Earth Engine-Based Identification of Flood Extent and Flood-Affected Paddy Rice Fields Using Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-1 SAR Data in Bihar State, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is the major cause of fatalities associated with natural disasters in the world. In India especially in the state of Bihar, where about half of the area (North Bihar) gets flooded every year due to the overflow of major rivers during the rainy season. Which severely affects human lives, properties, agricultural production, farmers and their livelihood. Usually, the basins of the Kosi and Gandak rivers are known for their worst affects in Bihar. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is widely used for robust monitoring of flood events due to its ability to image the surface of the earth in all weather conditions. However, limited studies are available on flood patterns of Bihar and their impact on agriculture. Here, we investigated the flood extents and affected paddy rice fields for Bihar during the months of June-October (2020) using all accessible Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI images with additional supporting datasets available on the Google Earth Engine. The study showed that a large portion of Bihar (7019 km(2)) was submerged during monsoon season. The floodwater remains in the agricultural fields for 50 to 65 days causing severe damage to the Kharif crops, mainly rice. The extreme effect of flood was seen in agricultural lands (11.23% of the total area) and populations (15.56% of the total population) in Bihar. Satellite-based identification of flood progression and affected rice fields can be helpful for decision-makers at the time of disaster to prioritize relief and rescue operations.

TI  - Non-linearity between gross primary productivity and far-red solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence emitted from canopies of major biomes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed from vegetation has been considered as a promising proxy of gross primary productivity (GPP) in several studies, and recent work has shown advantages of using the total emitted SIF (SIFtotal) to capture the variation of GPP. The non-linearity between SIF and GPP at the canopy level was often observed in many previous studies, but the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP has not yet been systematically investigated. In this study, based on a theoretical analysis of the relationship between SIF and GPP at the leaf level and how it propagates to the canopy level with the consideration of sunlit and shaded leaf fractions in the canopy, we asserted that non-linear relationships between SIFtotal and GPP at the canopy level are general and physically sound. We derived SIFtotal from two different approaches using TROPOMI SIF data. One is based on the canopy escape ratio of SIF signals observed by satellite sensors (SIFobs), and the other is an angular normalization method. At the site level, we established linear and non-linear (exponential, hyperbolic, and polynomial) regressions between TROPOMI SIF and GPP data from 25 flux tower sites covering the eight biomes. The results indicate that non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP exists among eight major biomes, and expo-nential regression is the best regression method to capture the non-linearity between SIF and GPP at the site level. We developed a simple variable, SIFnon-linear, to capture the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP. R-2 values of the linear correlations between SIFnon-linear and GPP are equal or close to those of exponential corre-lations between SIFtotal and GPP. SIFnon-linear captures the non-linearity well, even though different biomes have different degrees of non-linearity. On the global scale, TROPOMI SIF was compared with GPP simulations of the BEPS model and the SMAP GPP product, showing that SIFnon-linear is a better proxy of GPP than SIFobs and SIFtotal. We find that the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP generally exists among eight major biomes regardless of the spatial or temporal scales. The non-linearity is driven by the seasonal variation of the absorbed photosyn-thetically active radiation (APAR). The degree of the non-linearity varies among different biomes, and it is controlled by three factors: the light saturation point of GPP, the variation of APAR during the growing season, and the ratio between the sunlit and shaded portion of the canopy. Temporal aggregation of SIFtotal reduces the non-linearity. Our results indicate that the simple variable SIFnon-linear can replace SIFobs or SIFtotal to improve global SIF-GPP related studies in the future.

TI  - Three-dimensional deformation and its uncertainty derived by integrating multiple SAR data analysis methods
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) surface deformation data with high accuracy and resolution can help reveal the complex mechanisms and sources of subsurface deformation, both tectonic and anthropogenic. Detailed 3D deformation data are also beneficial for maintaining the position coordinates of existing ground features, which is critical for developing and advancing global positioning technologies and their applications. In seismically active regions, large earthquakes have repeatedly caused significant ground deformation and widespread damage to human society. However, the delay in updating position coordinates following deformation can hamper disaster recovery. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data allow high-accuracy and high-resolution 3D deformation measurements. Three analysis methods are currently available to measure 1D or 2D deformation: SAR interferometry (InSAR), split-bandwidth interferometry (SBI), and the pixel offset method. In this paper, we propose an approach to derive 3D deformation by integrating deformation data from the three methods. The theoretical uncertainty of the derived 3D deformations was also estimated using observed deformation data for each of these methods and the weighted least square (WLS) approach. Furthermore, we describe two case studies (the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence and the 2016 Central Tottori earthquake in Japan) using L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) data. The case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully retrieved 3D coseismic deformation with the standard error of similar to 1, similar to 4, and similar to 1 cm in the east-west, north-south, and vertical components, respectively, with sufficient InSAR data. SBI and the pixel offset method filled the gaps of the InSAR data in large deformation areas in the order of 10 cm accuracy. The derived standard errors for each pixel are also useful for subsequent applications, such as updating position coordinates and deformation source modeling. The proposed approach is also applicable to other SAR datasets. In particular, next-generation L-band SAR satellites, such as ALOS-4 and NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR), which have a wider swath width, more frequent observation capabilities than the former L-band satellites, and exclusive main look directions (i.e., right and left) will greatly enhance the applicability of 3D deformation derivation and support the quick recovery from disasters with significant deformation.

TI  - Effect of the Urban Land Use Dynamics on Land Surface Temperature: A Case Study of Kohat City in Pakistan for the Period 1998-2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades, the majority of the global population has resided in urban areas, which is one of the environmental issues. The rush of people to cities has put a strain on land resources, particularly in emerging nations where the aspiration for a wealthy life persists. Population increase necessitates the expansion and intensification of agriculture, hastening the transition from agricultural to built-up regions. Changes in land use land cover (LULC) impact urban heat and are regarded as one of the most significant human changes to the Earth's climate. With this in mind, the purpose of this research is to investigate the land-use dynamics and their influence on the Land Surface Temperature of Kohat City, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The Landsat satellite images of Kohat city for 1998 were acquired from USGS, 2008 were acquired from SUPARCO, and for 2018 from SAS Planet. The acquired images were classified into 6 different LULC classes i.e. built up, farmland, open spaces/barren land, natural vegetation, orchards, and water bodies. The land surface temperature (LST) was computed with the radiance values of thermal bands from Landsat TM, ETM+, and Landsat OLI data. The analysis reveals an increase in the built-up area from 3969.04 hectares in 2000 to 6147.06 hectares in 2017. The computed LST reveals that in 1998 the LST ranged between 4.24 and 42.80 degrees C, with a mean of 31.81 degrees C. The LST of 2018 ranged from 6.86 to 46.90 degrees C with a mean of 36.17 degrees C. Overall mean temperature showed an increasing trend, i.e. from 31.81 degrees C in 1998 to 36.17 degrees C in 2018. According to the study, the greatest shift in LST occurred in densely populated areas, with 42.8 degrees C in 2000 and 46.9 degrees C in 2018, and the lowest in water and orchards. The LST of farmland was changed from 37.67 degrees C in 2000 to 41.47 degrees C in 2018, water 4.24 degrees C in 2000 to 6.86 degrees C in 2018; natural vegetation 37.19 degrees C and 40.17 degrees C, respectively.

TI  - Multi-decadal changes in phytoplankton biomass in northern temperate lakes as seen through the prism of landscape properties
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecologists collectively predict that climate change will enhance phytoplankton biomass in northern lakes. Yet there are unique variations in the structures and regulating functions of lakes to make this prediction challengeable and, perhaps, inaccurate. We used archived Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite products to estimate epilimnetic chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass in 281 northern temperate lakes over 28 years. We explored the influence of climate (air temperature, precipitation) and landscape proxies for nutrient sources (proportion of wetlands in a contributing catchment, size of the littoral zone, potential for wind-driven sediment resuspension as estimated by the dynamic ratio) or nutrient sinks (lake volume) in a random forest model to explain heterogeneity in peak Chl-a. Lakes with higher Chl-a (median Chl-a = 2.4 mu g L-1, n = 40) had smaller volumes (<44 x 10(4) m(3)) and were more sensitive to increases in temperature. In contrast, lakes with lower Chl-a (median Chl-a = 0.6 mu g L-1, n = 241) had larger volumes (>= 44 x 10(4) m(3)), contributing catchments with smaller proportions of wetlands (<4.5% of catchment area, n = 70), smaller littoral zones (<16.4 ha, n = 137), minimal wind-driven sediment resuspension (as defined by the dynamic ratio; <0.45, n = 232), and were more sensitive to increases in precipitation. Lakes with larger volumes were generally less responsive to climate factors; however, larger volume lakes with a significant proportion of wetlands and larger littoral zones behaved similarly to lakes with smaller volumes. Our finding that lakes with different landscape properties respond differently to climate factors may help predict the susceptibility of lakes to eutrophication under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - How death anxiety influences coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic: investigating the role of spirituality, national identity, lockdown and trust
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has created a highly stressful environment in which reminders of death are constant. This context of permanent mortality salience is likely to arouse death anxiety in individuals around the world that they must manage. This study investigates the effects of death anxiety on the adoption of different coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in five different countries (N = 721, mean age = 32.83). The results show that higher levels of death anxiety mainly lead to the adoption of avoidance coping strategies and that spirituality and national identity moderate this effect, whereas lockdown does not. Moreover, trust in institutions is a mediator in the relationship between death anxiety and avoidance strategies.

TI  - A novel co-cultivation strategy to generate low-crystallinity bacterial cellulose and increase nisin yields
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a co-culturing Enterobacter sp. and Lactococcus lactis strategy was developed to alter bacterial cellulose (BC) properties and increase nisin yields. We generated high nisin yields (6260 IU/mL) by altering inoculum ratios and inoculation times in a novel co-culture system. Critically, these were 85% higher than L. lactis monocultures. By monitoring fermentation broth pH and lactic acid yields, the pH was higher and lactic acid yields lower during co-culture conditions when compared with L. lactis monocultures, suggesting that co culturing was more suitable for L. lactis nisin production. We also determined BC film yields and properties (BC, BC-N, and BC-N after nisin release). BC yields produced by co-culturing were not very different from Enterobacter sp. monocultures, but crystallinity was significantly altered. Collectively, our co-culture system adequately and economically modified BC fibers by interfering with self-assembly and crystallization processes during BC synthesis, with significantly improved nisin yields.

TI  - A prospective study of college student depressive symptoms, sense of purpose, and response to a COVID-19 campus shutdown
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Individual differences can shape the way major life events are experienced. In this study, we explored the unique and interactive effects of depressive symptoms and sense of purpose on downstream appraisals of a COVID-19 college campus shutdown. Data were from a sample of U.S. college students (n = 152) surveyed prior to widespread COVID-19 transmission (Time 1; early fall 2019), and again just after their university closed as a protective measure (Time 2; mid-spring 2020). Depressive symptoms were positively associated, whereas sense of purpose was negatively associated, with cross-sectional reports of social status change due to shutdown. Depressive symptoms at Time 1 positively predicted perceived external control of the situation at Time 2, and sense of purpose at Time 1 positively predicted changes to worldview at Time 2. Purpose and depressive symptoms evidenced high rank-order stability from Time 1 to Time 2. This study represents a rare documentation of college students' feelings and experiences before, and during, a historical moment. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

TI  - Segmentation of multi-temporal polarimetric SAR data based on mean-shift and spectral graph partitioning
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image segmentation is a key step in its interpretation. For the targets with time series changes, the single-temporal PolSAR image segmentation algorithm is difficult to provide correct segmentation results for its target recognition, time series analysis and other applications. For this, a new algorithm for multi-temporal PolSAR image segmentation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the over-segmentation of single-temporal PolSAR images is carried out by the mean-shift algorithm, and the over-segmentation results of single-temporal PolSAR are combined to get the over-segmentation results of multi-temporal PolSAR images. Secondly, the edge detectors are constructed to extract the edge information of single-temporal PolSAR images and fuse them to get the edge fusion results of multi-temporal PolSAR images. Then, the similarity measurement matrix is constructed based on the over-segmentation results and edge fusion results of multi-temporal PolSAR images. Finally, the normalized cut criterion is used to complete the segmentation of multi-temporal PolSAR images. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified based on three temporal PolSAR images of Radarsat-2, and compared with the segmentation algorithm of single-temporal PolSAR image. Experimental results revealed the following findings: (1) The proposed algorithm effectively realizes the segmentation of multi-temporal PolSAR images, and achieves ideal segmentation results. Moreover, the segmentation details are excellent, and the region consistency is good. The objects which can't be distinguished by the single-temporal PolSAR image segmentation algorithm can be segmented. (2) The segmentation accuracy of the proposed multi-temporal algorithm is up to 86.5%, which is significantly higher than that of the single-temporal PolSAR image segmentation algorithm. In general, the segmentation result of proposed algorithm is closer to the optimal segmentation. The optimal segmentation of farmland parcel objects to meet the needs of agricultural production is realized. This lays a good foundation for the further interpretation of multi-temporal PolSAR image.

TI  - Development of high-resolution spatio-temporal models for ambient air pollution in a metropolitan area of China from 2013 to 2019
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling high-resolution air pollution concentrations is essential to accurately assess exposure for population studies. The aim of this study is to establish an advanced exposure model to predict spatiotemporal changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), and ozone (O-3) concentrations in Shanghai, China. The model is constructed on a geo-statistical modeling framework that incorporates a dimension reduction regression approach and a spatial smoothing function to deal with fine-scale exposure variations. We used a dataset with comprehensive observational and predictor variables that included monitoring data from both national and local agencies from 2013 to 2019, a high-resolution geographical dataset of predictor variables, and a full-coverage weekly satellite data of the aerosol optical depth at a 1 x 1 km(2) resolution. Our model performed well in terms of the spatial and temporal prediction ability assessed by cross-validation (CV) for PM2.5 (spatial R-2 = 0.89, temporal R-2 = 0.91), NO2 (R-2 = 0.49, 0.78), and O-3 (R-2 = 0.67, 0.81) at the national monitors over seven years according to the leave-one-out CV. For the predictions at the local agency monitoring stations, the overall CV R-2 was between 0.77 and 0.89 across the air pollutants. We visualized the long-term and seasonal averaged predictions of the PM2.5, NO2, and O-3 exposure on maps with a spatial resolution of 100 x 100 m(2). Our study provides a useful tool to accurately estimate air pollution exposure with high spatial and temporal resolution at the urban scale. These model predictions will be useful to assess both short-term and long-term air pollution exposure for health studies.

TI  - Implementation of the CCDC algorithm to produce the LCMAP Collection 1.0 annual land surface change product
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of high-quality remote sensing data and advanced technologies has spurred land cover mapping to characterize land change from local to global scales. However, most land change datasets either span multiple decades at a local scale or cover limited time over a larger geographic extent. Here, we present a new land cover and land surface change dataset created by the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) program over the conterminous United States (CONUS). The LCMAP land cover change dataset consists of annual land cover and land cover change products over the period 1985-2017 at a 30 m resolution using Landsat and other ancillary data via the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. In this paper, we describe our novel approach to implement the CCDC algorithm to produce the LCMAP product suite composed of five land cover products and five products related to land surface change. The LCMAP land cover products were validated using a collection of similar to 25000 reference samples collected independently across CONUS. The overall agreement for all years of the LCMAP primary land cover product reached 82.5 %. The LCMAP products are produced through the LCMAP Information Warehouse and Data Store (IW+DS) and shared Mesos cluster systems that can process, store, and deliver all datasets for public access. To our knowledge, this is the first set of published 30 m annual land change datasets that include land cover, land cover change, and spectral change spanning from the 1980s to the present for the United States. The LCMAP product suite provides useful information for land resource management and facilitates studies to improve the understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and the complex dynamics of the Earth system. The LCMAP system could be implemented to produce global land change products in the future. The LCMAP products introduced in this paper are freely available at https://doi.org/10.5066/P9W1TO6E (LCMAP, 2021).

TI  - Time series analysis for global land cover change monitoring: A comparison across sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparing the performance of different satellite sensors in global land cover change (LCC) monitoring is necessary to assess their potential and limitations for more accurate and operational LCC estimations. This paper aims to examine and compare the performance in LCC monitoring using three satellite sensors: PROBA-V, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI. We utilized a unique set of global reference data containing four years of records (2015-2018) at 29,263 land cover change/no-change 100 x 100-m sites. The LCC monitoring was conducted using the BFAST(s)-Random Forest (BRF) change detection framework involving 15 global timeseries vegetation indices and three BFAST models. Due to the different spectral characteristics and data availability of the sensors, we designed 30 comparison scenarios to extensively evaluate their performance. The overall results were: 1) for global general LCC monitoring, Landsat 8 OLI slightly outperformed Sentinel-2, and PROBA-V performed the worst. The performance among the three sensors differed consistently despite different data availability and spectral observation regions. Sentinel-2 was more competitive with Landsat 8 when the red-edge 1 band was included; 2) Landsat 8 was more accurate in forest, herbaceous vegetation, and water monitoring. Sentinel-2 performed particularly well in wetland monitoring. In addition, we further observed: 3) missing data in time series decreased the accuracy in all sensors, but had little influence on the relative performance across sensors; 4) combining sensors would not necessarily improve the accuracy because the complementary effects enhanced the accuracy only when there was a large amount of data missing for all sensors; 5) the BRF framework maintained the performance gap among sensors, but obtained a higher and more balanced accuracy overall when compared with using BFAST methods alone, by involving ensemble learning with an embedded sample-balancing strategy; 6) among the random forest variables, the 'magnitude' proved to be the most important contributor, and the NDVI had the most consistently good performance across sensors when compared against other vegetation indices. All sensors using BRF still had some errors in change detection, with a tendency to underestimate the global LCC. A potential reason for this is the complexity of the diverse change/no-change characteristics at the global extent and the fact that smaller, more subtle LCCs might not be well detected. These limitations could be addressed by taking advantage of ensemble learning approaches with a combination of multiple independent region/thematic-adapted LCC monitoring models and using the original Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Landsat 8 (30 m) in the future.

TI  - High-resolution agriculture soil property maps from digital soil mapping methods, Czech Republic
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed maps of soil properties are essential for soil protection planning and management; however, creating very high-resolution maps at the national level with sufficient accuracy is a challenging task and remains unavailable for most countries. For the Czech Republic, very high resolution (20 m center dot pixel(-1)) soil property maps (soil organic carbon-SOC, texture, pH, bulk density, soil depth) were created using digital soil mapping methods, combined with a wide database of soil legacy and current samples. The latest approaches were employed for predictive mapping: a quantile random forest model with the determination of prediction intervals, a mosaic of bare soils from Sentinel-2 satellite data, a Gaussian pyramid of terrain attributes, and a buffer distance map. These variables were found to be among the most important in the resulting models. The properties were mapped with an RMSE accuracy of 0.43% SOC, 5.56-11.14% for texture fractions, 0.70 pH, 0.13 g center dot cm(-3) bulk density, and 20.03 cm for soil depth, thus providing detailed data on soil cover. Greater levels of inaccuracy were found in areas with extreme values, for which further investigation is necessary either through more detailed sampling based on active learning, or adapted methods for enhanced predictive ability.

TI  - How has the University Community Been Coping During the COVID-19 Pandemic? An Iranian Survey
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The present study, one of the first to look at COVID-19 and coping in Iran, aimed at mapping, describing and understanding the coping methods academics employ as protective resources to deal with the psychological challenges and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We specifically aimed at identifying the meaning-making coping methods used and understanding the influence of culture. The guiding research question has been: Are there differences in meaning-making coping methods by gender, age group, work/student status, and place of residence?Design: The study, which used convenience sampling, was a quantitative inquiry. It employed a modified version of the RCOPE scale among faculty/staff members and students in Iran (n = 196, 75% women).Results: The most frequently used coping method among all subgroups of the study sample was thinking that life is part of a greater whole, followed by praying to Allah/God. The least used coping methods were the negative religious ones. Gender differences were found for being alone and contemplating, stronger for men. Thinking that life is part of a greater whole was found mainly among on-campus students. Praying to Allah/God was most common among the youngest staff and students, as well as among women. Two segments of respondents were discovered-the Theists and Non-theists-where the former used more religious coping methods, were more likely to be women, older staff and students, on-campus students, married, have children, and lived in capital.Conclusions: Our conclusion is that the RCOPE methods, which include religious and spiritual meaning-making methods, are of great importance to the studied Iranian informants. However, they use some secular existential meaning-making coping strategies too. This is explained by the role of religion in the larger orientation system and frame of reference in parallel with a secular worldview. Further, a sharp distinction between religious and secular worldviews was not found, which is explained by the fact that secular norms are hardly internalized in ways of thinking in Iran.

TI  - Evaluation on the change characteristics of ecosystem service in Dhanbad district of Jharkhand, India based on land use change
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) simply refer to those services conferred by Mother Nature for the survival of her offspring living within. But the provision of ESs is continuously affected by human activity and related changes like transformations in land use and land cover. The present study has been initiated to evaluate the pattern of landscape transformation and its impact on ecosystem service, along with estimating the per capita availability of ESs based on remotely sensed data in the Dhanbad district, Jharkhand, India. The result shows that the total ecosystem service value (ESV) loss of the district was $2251959.76 during 1990-2020. The highest loss of ESV was recorded due to the conservation of agricultural land to built-up area ($15884988.50) and vegetation cover on agricultural land ($14451545.01), while the increased vegetation cover on other types of land helped the district to gain back some balance over the loss. But in a smaller scale study, 5 out of the 8 spatial units are facing negative change in ESV, and unfortunately, they are altogether inhabited by more than 85% of the district's total population. That means the loss of ESV is greater where it needs to be more as per population. Moreover, the per capita ESs in the district decreased by 68.48%, while among the spatial units in Dhanbad it decreased the most (89.60%), which is a serious cause for worry in the future. Therefore, this study can contribute to the process of decision-making, proposing ecological conservation and sustainable development plans for the region.

TI  - Pathology and virology of natural highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 infection in wild Common buzzards (<i>Buteo buteo</i>)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds is a major emerging disease, and a cause of increased mortality during outbreaks. The Common buzzard (Buteo buteo) has a considerable chance of acquiring the infection and therefore may function as bio-sentinel for the presence of virus in wildlife. This study aimed to determine the virus distribution and associated pathological changes in the tissues of Common buzzards that died with HPAI H5 virus infection during the 2020-2021 epizootic. Eleven freshly dead, HPAI H5 virus-positive Common buzzards were necropsied. Based on RT-PCR, all birds were systemically infected with HPAI H5N8 virus, as viral RNA was detected in cloacal and pharyngeal swabs and in all 10 selected tissues of the birds, with mean Ct values per tissue ranging from 22 for heart to 32 for jejunum. Based on histology and immunohistochemistry, the most common virus-associated pathological changes were necrotizing encephalitis (9/11 birds) and necrotizing myocarditis (7/11 birds). The proventriculus of two birds showed virus-associated necrosis, indicating tropism of this virus for the digestive tract. Our advice is to collect at least a miniset of samples including brain, heart, liver, and spleen, as these tissues were positive both by RT-PCR and for virus-antigen-associated lesions.

TI  - Microestimates of wealth for all low- and middle-income countries
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Many critical policy decisions, from strategic investments to the allocation of humanitarian aid, rely on data about the geographic distribution of wealth and poverty. Yet many poverty maps are out of date or exist only at very coarse levels of granularity. Here we develop microestimates of the relative wealth and poverty of the populated surface of all 135 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) at 2.4 km resolution. The estimates are built by applying machine-learning algorithms to vast and heterogeneous data from satellites, mobile phone networks, and topographic maps, as well as aggregated and deidentified connectivity data from Facebook. We train and calibrate the estimates using nationally representative household survey data from 56 LMICs and then validate their accuracy using four independent sources of household survey data from 18 countries. We also provide confidence intervals for each microestimate to facilitate responsible downstream use. These estimates are provided free for public use in the hope that they enable targeted policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic, provide the foundation for insights into the causes and consequences of economic development and growth, and promote responsible policymaking in support of sustainable development.

TI  - An attention-based U-Net for detecting deforestation within satellite sensor imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we implement and analyse an Attention U-Net deep network for semantic segmentation using Sentinel-2 satellite sensor imagery, for the purpose of detecting deforestation within two forest biomes in South America, the Amazon Rainforest and the Atlantic Forest. The performance of Attention U-Net is compared with U-Net, Residual U-Net, ResNet50-SegNet and FCN32-VGG16 across three different datasets (three-band Amazon, four-band Amazon and Atlantic Forest). Results indicate that Attention U-Net provides the best deforestation masks when tested on each dataset, achieving average pixel-wise F1-scores of 0.9550, 0.9769 and 0.9461 for each dataset, respectively. Mask reproductions from each classifier were also analysed, showing that compared to the ground reference Attention U-Net could detect non-forest polygons more accurately than U-Net and overall it provides the most accurate segmentation of forest/deforest compared with benchmark approaches despite its reduced complexity and training time, thus being the first application of an Attention U-Net to an important deforestation segmentation task. This paper concludes with a brief discussion on the ability of the attention mechanism to offset the reduced complexity of Attention U-Net, as well as ideas for further research into optimising the architecture and applying attention mechanisms into other architectures for deforestation detection.

TI  - Assessment of spatial distribution of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides using geospatial techniques along North Sikkim Road Corridor in Sikkim Himalayas, India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The spatial distribution of landslides is analyzed to understand landslide incidences and triggering factors along North Sikkim Road Corridor in the parts of Sikkim Himalayas. The present study area is also highly prone to landslide which mainly occurred due to heavy rainfall and earthquake. The present study highlights the spatial distribution of rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides based on various preparatory factors. In this study 58 rain-induced landslide locations were identified and assessed the spatial distribution. Earthquake triggered landslides were assessed based on the interpretation of pre and post satellite images on 2011 Sikkim earthquake. Therefore, the study attempts to (i) show the inventory map of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides (ii) evaluate the spatial distribution pattern of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides basis of their event controlling parameters (iii) Finally, to show the characteristics of spatial distribution of rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides in the study area. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Ground Control Points (GCP) were used for verification of rainfall induced landslide locations and the improvement of the planimetric accuracy of the Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images from the Google Earth. For the spatial distribution analysis, all raster maps were prepared using GIS techniques. After that, location wise spatial values were extracted both rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides using multi-data extraction technique in GIS environment. From the present study, it has been observed that the co-seismic landslides initiating under dry conditions could account for steeper slope angles than the rain-induced landslides. It has been also observed that rain-induced landslides on southerly slope facing is maximum, and it decreases with the angle orientation on the northerly slope facing is relatively low. The study also reveals that rain induced and earthquake triggered landslides could be found in the sparsely vegetated areas. The present study is a pathway to develop landslide hazard zonation map, landslide control measures, disaster management, tourism planning and sustainable development in this area.

TI  - A graph-matching approach for cross-view registration of over-view and street-view based point clouds
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide-area 3D data generation for complex urban environments often needs to leverage a mixed use of data collected from both air and ground platforms, such as from aerial surveys, satellite, and mobile vehicles. On one hand, such kind of data with information from drastically different views (ca. 90 and more) forming cross-view data, which due to very limited overlapping region caused by the drastically different line of sight of the sensors, is difficult to be registered without significant manual efforts. On the other hand, the registration of such data often suffers from non-rigid distortion of the street-view data (e.g., non-rigid trajectory drift), which cannot be simply rectified by a similarity transformation. In this paper, based on the assumption that the object boundaries (e.g., buildings) from the over-view data should coincide with footprints of facade 3D points generated from street-view photogrammetric images, we aim to address this problem by proposing a fully automated georegistration method for cross-view data, which utilizes semantically segmented object boundaries as view invariant features under a global optimization framework through graph-matching: taking the over-view point clouds generated from stereo/multi-stereo satellite images and the street-view point clouds generated from monocular video images as the inputs, the proposed method models segments of buildings as nodes of graphs, both detected from the satellite-based and street-view based point clouds, thus to form the registration as a graph-matching problem to allow non-rigid matches; to enable a robust solution and fully utilize the topological relations between these segments, we propose to address the graph-matching problem on its conjugate graph solved through a belief-propagation algorithm. The matched nodes will be subject to a further optimization to allow precise-registration, followed by a constrained bundle adjustment on the street-view image to keep 2D-3D consistencies, which yields well-registered street-view images and point clouds to the satellite point clouds. Our proposed method assumes no or little prior pose information (e.g. very sparse locations from consumer-grade GPS (global positioning system)) for the street-view data and has been applied to a large cross-view dataset with significant scale difference containing 0.5 m GSD (Ground Sampling Distance) satellite data and 0.005 m GSD street-view data, 1.5 km in length involving 12 GB of data. The experiment shows that the proposed method has achieved promising results (1.27 m accuracy in 3D), evaluated using collected LiDAR point clouds. Furthermore, we included additional experiments to demonstrate that this method can be generalized to process different types of over-view and street-view data sources, e.g., the open street view maps and the semantic labeling maps.

TI  - People-centric geo-spatial exposure and damage assessment of 2014 flood in lower Chenab Basin, upper Indus Plain in Pakistan
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is an effort of people-centric geo-spatial exposure and damage assessment of 2014-flood in Upper Indus Plain (UIP). Community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) approach in integration with geo-spatial techniques is implemented to assess the nature and damages as well as community perception in reducing floods. In this regard, a semi-structured questionnaire was designed for micro-level detail investigation. A total of 422 households were surveyed in 22 flood-affected villages in eight districts forms the lower Chenab Basin using random sampling techniques. Secondary data regarding river discharge is collected from Regional Meteorological Centre, Lahore. Shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) Digital elevation model (DEM) having 30 m spatial resolution and Landsat satellite image of September 2014 with same resolution is acquired from open source geo-database of United States Geological Survey (USGS). Landsat satellite image is processed to extract the spatial extent of inundation. Watershed modeling approach is utilized to demarcate Chenab River Basin in a GIS environment. Buffer analysis and inverse distance weighted (IDW) technique of spatial interpolation are used to geo-visualize the spatial extent and depth of flood based on community perception. Analysis reveals that flood is one of the recurring phenomena in the Chenab Basin. The upper catchment areas of Chenab Basin are dominated by flash floods and low-lying areas are prone to riverine floods. The 2014-flood has caused estimated economic damage of 1409.295 million Pakistani Rupees (mPKR). Housing sector suffered the major losses of more than 1000mPKR followed by the agricultural sector. Based on spatial extent, vertical profile and damages the study region is categorized into upper and lower zones. The lower zone is most affected in terms of extent, depth and damages. This study can assist the decision-makers and disaster managers in designing location-specific flood risk reduction.

TI  - Remote sensing and soil moisture data for water productivity determination
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work was initiated in 2019 within the FAO WEPS project framework (2018-2022), aiming to determine the Water Productivity (WP) of the Tunisian olive orchards combining two scales of measurements for soil moisture determination: one for the global analysis (remote sensing) and the other for the field scale application. The experiment was made in 2019 and 2020 in the Centre of Tunisia (Kairouan city, locality of Elhouereb), which is one of the largest irrigation area of Tunisia. WP was computed regarding the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) which was determined following the water balance method as: ETa=R+I-Delta S, where Delta S is the amount of water stored in the soil (0-60 cm) and (R) and (I) are the amounts of the seasonal rainfall and the irrigation volume, respectively. The annual ETa reached 293 mm for the rainfed orchard, 823 mm for the semi-intensive irrigated plantation and 819 mm for the intensive fertigated orchard. The WP defined as being the ratio of Yield (kg olives/tree)/ETa ranged between 0.29 kg/m(3) (rainfed) and 0.77 kg/m(3) (fertigated) depending on the cultivation system. Soil moisture was found to be correlated to the average backscatter coefficient (r =-0.34 for the rainfed and 0.91 for the irrigated orchards) which was determined from the radar images which were treated by using different applications (SNAP, ODK, QGIS.), This result shows the performance of the remote sensing tools for such application. To conclude: WP is at least two times higher in the irrigated orchards than in the rainfed grove; this indicates a great potential of WP improvement if the horticultural practices are well applied in the orchad (pruning, irrigation); so that, the WP can be used as a decision-making-tool for farmers and makers in the future.

TI  - Seawater deterioration and the tourist beta convergence process: A geospatial big data analysis of the Spanish Mediterranean coast
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the role of seawater deterioration in the beta convergence process of tourism demand. We propose an empirical application with observations of tourist arrivals from 2013 to 2019 for 101 municipalities on the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Seawater deterioration is evaluated using a specific indicator of the ecological status of the sea, chlorophyll, derived from images provided by the European Spatial Agency Sentinel-3 satellite. Based on this information, we estimate the beta-convergence specification of tourist arrivals by using a spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR). Our results confirm the existence of an accelerating nonlinear effect of seawater pollution on the beta convergence process of tourism demand. Once a municipality surpasses a threshold value in terms of pollution, tourists who had previously visited popular destinations move to less well-known, less polluted municipalities along the coast. In addition, we find significant spatial spillover effects among municipalities in this process.

TI  - The Study of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Dynamics and the Perception of Local People in Aykoleba, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is believed that since the advent of agriculture, changes in LULC have happened. However, rates, extents, and intensities of LULC changes have become more aggravated at all levels. The current study aims to examine the dynamics and perceptions of LULC change in the last 4 decades (1973-2013) in Aykoleba, Ethiopia using a combination of remote sensing data and the ground truth data. Focus Group Discussions were employed to obtain data on the status of land degradation. Remote sensing data were obtained using Landsat imageries of MSS (1973), Landsat TM, 1986 and 2000, and Landsat ETM + (2013) with 30 m spatial resolution. ArcGIS10.2 and ERDAS Imagine13.1 were used to generate LULC classes. Accordingly, four LULC classes were identified, of which forest and bare LULC have been augmented by 8.8% and 54.9%, respectively. The escalation in forest cover is associated with the plantation of eucalyptus near the home gardens, farmlands, and degraded areas. Nevertheless, open bush and grassland, and cultivated and settlement land cover classes were lessened by 27.4% and 37.8%, respectively, although the increase in bare land is related to the abandonment of the cultivated land in hilly and sloppy areas, and overgrazing, among other factors. The local community perceived that population pressure is a top driver of LULC change in the study area. Overgrazing and lack of appropriate land use policy are also significant causes of change. Thus, we recommend the establishment of the land use plan and appropriate population policy in Ethiopia.

TI  - Empirical investigation regarding ethical decision making: a stakeholder cross-impact analysis (SCIA)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this research was to study senior and middle-level executive perspectives on ethical decision-making exploring stakeholder cross-impact analysis (SCIA). Given the complexities of business today, stakeholder identification, prioritisation and complexities of reciprocal stakeholder influences have become very important. Various philosophical approaches raised questions than responses to these problems. There was a clear need to find ways through which the worldview of agents could be assimilated and understood.Design/methodology/approach - This study used the original hypothetical short case and brought in middle and senior executive reflections of Indian fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) managers. Reflections of ten senior and 178 middle-level Indian FMCG managers were presented, exploring ethical dilemmas using short hypothetical case. These reflections have been analysed using the SCIA framework. The paired t-test was performed to compare the reflections of senior and middle-level executives.Findings - The study results indicated that differences emerged regarding stakeholder identification, prioritisation and reciprocal stakeholder influences between Indian middle and senior FMCG executives. Hence, this study paved a reflective space for SCIA. The findings were in line with the tenets of agents' dilemmas depicted in agency theory.Research limitations/implications - This study made contribution to theory by integrating the perspective of ethical dilemma confronted by organisational decision-making units (DMUs) with respect to stakeholder influence and prioritisation. Specifically, theoretical contribution was made towards SCIA.Practical implications - This study would help middle and senior executives to better understand the needs and complexities of stakeholder identification, prioritisation and complexities of reciprocal stakeholder influences.Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this was one of the first studies from an emerging market context country like India that applied SCIA in the FMCG sector. Organisational DMUs while facing ethical dilemma undertook stakeholder influence vis-a-vis stakeholder prioritisation.

TI  - Characterising Land Cover Change in Brunei Darussalam's Capital District
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In fast-developing regions like Southeast Asia monitoring urban areas presents a challenge given the lack of publicly available data. This is an issue that precludes the nuances of a city's growth and undermines the way land use is considered with respect to planning. The issue of data availability is very much present in the small nation of Brunei. Little is still known about the spatiotemporal evolution of its urban realm in particular, with regard to its national development planning. The country presents an interesting case-study given the pursuit of two highly opposing master-plans within the last 40 years. Its first master plan advocated polycentric growth away from the capital city, Bandar Seri Begawan. Its latest plan, however, currently promotes compact growth within a predefined urban footprint as a development control mechanism. This paper looks at remotely-sensed satellite data to examine the way in which the two implemented master-plan strategies have translated into actual land-use thus far. It employs a supervised classification procedure and characterises urban land into three typologies: urban infill, edge growth, and leapfrog growth. The paper's findings suggest that residential developments play a stronger role in driving urban growth in Brunei. This is particularly true for public housing, which has typically persisted in isolated pockets of low density at the city fringe. This study has produced a novel dataset of urban land use and land cover in Brunei; and, its quantification may prove useful in understanding the impacts of master planning and the formulation of development policies both within Brunei, and the wider Southeast Asian region.

TI  - Characterization of tick-borne encephalitis virus isolated from tick infesting dog in central Hokkaido in 2018
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a zoonotic virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae, causing meningitis or meningoencephalitis in humans. TBEV is widely distributed across the Eurasian northern regions, including Japan. Dogs have been reported to be sentinel hosts of TBEV in endemic areas, but studies of ticks infesting dogs are limited in Japan. This study isolated a novel TBEV strain from a tick (Ixodes ovatus) collected on a dog from central Hokkaido. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the isolated strain belonged to the Far Eastern subtype of TBEV and was classified under a different subcluster of other Japanese isolates. Nanporo-18-44 showed growth properties similar to those of Oshima 5-10 both in vitro and in vivo. The pathogenicity of both viruses was similar in mice infected intracerebrally, however they showed a distinct distribution in the infected neurons of the mouse brain. Our results suggest that infections of humans and animals by unknown strains of TBEV exist in other areas of Japan. Further surveys including those conducted outside of Hokkaido, are required to elucidate the epidemiological risk of TBEV in Japan.

TI  - How Often Does Retrieval of a Clipped Lymph Node Change Adjuvant Therapy Recommendations? A Prospective, Consecutive, Patient Cohort Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Prior studies examining sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for cN1 patients have demonstrated that 20% of biopsied, clipped lymph nodes (cLNs) are nonsentinel lymph nodes (non-SLNs). Our goal was to determine how often the cLN was a non-SLN among both cN0 and cN1 patients and how often cLN pathology impacted management. Methods Overall, 238 patients treated with NAC and surgery January 2019 to June 2020 were prospectively examined. Patients underwent routine axillary ultrasound, biopsy of suspicious nodes, and clip placement. Radioactive iodine-125 seed localization of the cLN was performed in cN1 patients only. Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) were considered node positive (ypN+) for both cN0 and cN1 cohorts. Chart review was performed to determine if cLNs were non-SLN and their ypN status. Results Of 118 cN0 patients, 115 of 118 (97%) underwent successful SLNB, 33 of whom had a cLN present; 21 of 33 (64%) cLNs were non-SLNs. Overall, 9 of 118 (8%) were ypN+; no cLN was ypN+ without additional +SLNs. Of 120 cN1 patients, 104 of 120 (87%) converted to cN0, 98 of 104 (94%) of which had attempted SLNB, and 95 of 98 (97%) successfully mapped. The cLN was a non-SLN in 18 of 95 (19%). Overall, 58 of 104 (56%) cN1 patients were ypN+. One patient had a positive cLN in the absence of +SLNs. This patient underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND); adjuvant treatment recommendations were unchanged. Conclusions The cLN was a non-SLN in 19% of cN1 patients. cLN pathology did not impact adjuvant therapy recommendations, calling into question the utility of routinely clipping biopsied lymph nodes.

TI  - A novel large-scale land degradation remote sensing index and its application in Three River Source Region
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the multiple stresses of global warming and human activities, land degradation in the Three River Source Region is becoming increasingly severe. However, the researches on large-scale land degradation monitoring models based on remote sensing are fewer and not yet mature. In this study, based on MODIS data products, five factors, including surface albedo, greenness index, heat index, topsoil grain size index, and salinity index, are introduced. These five factors are used to propose a novel large-scale land degradation remote sensing index based on the dynamic weighting method in Three River Source Region. Then the spatio-temporal evolution and driving mechanism of land degradation in the past 20 years are analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The land degradation remote sensing index model proposed in this study has good applicability, and its monitoring accuracy is 92.1%. (2) The average intensity of land degradation in the past 20 years in the Three River Source Region is 0.34, which generally belonged to the mild and moderate degradation. The Yangtze River Source Region has the most significant intensity of land degradation. (3) The gravity center of land degradation in the Three River Source Region during 2001-2020 generally shows a trend of eastward migration. (4) From 2001 to 2020, the change of land degradation intensity in the Three River Source Region was small, showing a trend of overall stability and a slight partial improvement. (5) The impacts of temperature, precipitation, and GDP density on land degradation are significantly different. From 2001 to 2020, the soil was the dominant factor determining land degradation, while the correlation between temperature and land degradation intensity in the study area was small. The results can provide relevant theoretical and technical support for land degradation management and ecological environment restoration in the Three River Source Region.

TI  - Effects of stand and landscape level variables on shoot damage ratios caused by shoot beetles in Southwest China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreaks of shoot beetles (Tomicus yunnanensis Kirkendall and Faccoli and Tomicus minor Hartig) have caused widespread tree mortality in Southwest China. However, multi-scale variables explaining the shoot damage ratio (SDR) caused by shoot beetles have never been studied. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of stand-level and landscape-level variables on SDR during outbreaks of shoot beetles in Yunnan pine forests. Sixty-five plots were generated during 2015-2017 based on beetle infestation maps derived from multi-data Landsat images and field survey. Nine explanatory variables were quantified to explain the SDR severity. The forest cover was obtained from a Worldview-3 high-resolution image. We used the forest resource planning and design survey data to develop landscape context variables. The beetle pressure variable was calculated using beetle infestation maps. The relative importance of the explanatory variables was analyzed using multi-model inference. We established that SDR was higher in the plots that were closer to roads and severely damaged forest areas in the previous year. SDR was negatively affected by edge density (ED) and forest cover, but positively affected by the mean shape index (SHAPE MN) and aspect. Landscape-level variables are probably the more important predictor, stand-level variables also had a significant effect on the shoot beetle outbreak. The prediction models including stand-level variables and landscape-level variables were built. Identifying variables that drive beetle-caused SDR contributed to the improvement of the existing strategies for outbreak control.

TI  - Assimilation of leaf Area Index from multisource earth observation data into the WOFOST model for sugarcane yield estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop Growth Models (CGM) have been widely used in estimating crop yield at a local scale while Remote Sensing (RS) data has the advantage of retrieving crop parameters such as leaf Area Index (LAI) at a range of spatial scales. Data Assimilation (DA) is highly useful tool that integrates CGM and RS data derived from satellite imageries to improve the simulated crop state variables and consequently model outputs such as crop total biomass and yield. In this study, we assimilated LAI with the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model to estimate sugarcane yield using an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm. The LAI was retrieved from Landsat 8 (L8) optical and Sentinel 1A (S1A) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries using a Gaussian Process regression (GPR) method. The Deterministic Modeling (DM), independent assimilations of LAI retrieved from L8 and S1A, and assimilation of LAI retrieved from a combined SAR-optical data were tested and validated using field observation data in the Wonji-Shoa sugar plantation, Ethiopia. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of sugarcane yield estimated by the WOFOST model was significantly improved after DA using combined L8 and S1A data. Compared to the DM estimation, the root mean square error (RMSE) was decreased by 2.13 t/ha for the independent assimilations of LAI retrieved from L8, 3.96 t/ha for the independent assimilations of LAI retrieved from S1A and 5.94 t/ha for combined assimilation of L8 and S1A LAI. A coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.36, 0.48, 0.53, and 0.69 and Normalized Root mean square error (NRMSE) of 14.72%, 11.67%, 10.55%, and 8.44% were obtained for DM, L8 LAI assimilation alone, S1A LAI assimilation alone and combined L8 and S1A LAI assimilation, respectively. The results show that combined L8 and S1A LAI DA has better performance because SAR and optical data have complementary effects. Hence, the assimilation of LAI from combined L8 and S1A data into the WOFOST model provides a robust technique to improve crop yield estimations.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of CMIP6 models and MERRA-2 reanalysis AOD against Satellite observations from 2000 to 2014 over China
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid industrialization and urbanization along with a growing population are contributing significantly to air pollution in China. Evaluation of long-term aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from models and reanalysis, can greatly promote understanding of spatiotemporal variations in air pollution in China. To do this, AOD (550 nm) values from 2000 to 2014 were obtained from the Coupled Model Inter comparison Project (CIMP6), the second version of Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research, and Applications (MERRA-2), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; flying on the Terra satellite) combined Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) aerosol product. We used the TerraMODIS DTB AOD (hereafter MODIS DTB AOD) as a standard to evaluate CMIP6 Ensemble AOD (hereafter CMIP6 AOD) and MERRA-2 reanalysis AOD (hereafter MERRA-2 AOD). Results show better correlations and smaller errors between MERRA-2 and MODIS DTB AOD, than between CMIP6 and MODIS DTB AOD, in most regions of China, at both annual and seasonal scales. However, significant under-and over-estimations in the MERRA-2 and CMIP6 AOD were also observed relative to MODIS DTB AOD. The long-term (2000-2014) MODIS DTB AOD distributions show the highest AOD over the North China Plain (0.71) followed by Central China (0.69), Yangtse River Delta (0.67), Sichuan Basin (0.64), and Pearl River Delta (0.54) regions. The lowest AOD values were recorded over the Tibetan Plateau (0.13 +/- 0.01) followed by Qinghai (0.19 +/- 0.03) and the Gobi Desert (0.21 +/- 0.03). Large amounts of sand and dust particles emitted from natural sources (the Taklamakan and Gobi Deserts) may result in higher AOD in spring compared to summer, autumn, and winter. Trends were also calculated for 2000-2005, for 2006-2010 (when China introduced strict air pollution control policies during the 11th Five Year Plan or FYP), and for 2011-2014 (during the 12th FYP). An increasing trend in MODIS DTB AOD was observed throughout the country during 2000-2014. The uncontrolled industrialization, urbanization, and rapid economic development that mostly occurred from 2000 to 2005 probably contributed to the overall increase in AOD. Finally, China's air pollution control policies helped to reduce AOD in most regions of the country; this was more evident during the 12th FYP period (2011-2014) than during the 11th FYP period (2006-2010). Therefore this study strongly advises the authority to retain or extend these policies in the future for improving air quality.

TI  - Unraveling Long-Term Flood Risk Dynamics Across the Murray-Darling Basin Using a Large-Scale Hydraulic Model and Satellite Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - River floods are one of the most devastating extreme hydrological events, with oftentimes remarkably negative effects for human society and the environment. Economic losses and social consequences, in terms of affected people and human fatalities, are increasing worldwide due to climate change and urbanization processes. Long-term dynamics of flood risk are intimately driven by the temporal evolution of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Although needed for effective flood risk management, a comprehensive long-term analysis of all these components is not straightforward, mostly due to a lack of hydrological data, exposure information, and large computational resources required for 2-D flood model simulations at adequately high resolution over large spatial scales. This study tries to overcome these limitations and attempts to investigate the dynamics of different flood risk components in the Murray-Darling basin (MDB, Australia) in the period 1973-2014. To this aim, the LISFLOOD-FP model, i.e., a large-scale 2-D hydrodynamic model, and satellite-derived built-up data are employed. Results show that the maximum extension of flooded areas decreases in time, without revealing any significant geographical transfer of inundated areas across the study period. Despite this, a remarkable increment of built-up areas characterizes MDB, with larger annual increments across not-flooded locations compared to flooded areas. When combining flood hazard and exposure, we find that the overall extension of areas exposed to high flood risk more than doubled within the study period, thus highlighting the need for improving flood risk awareness and flood mitigation strategies in the near future.

TI  - Study on the spatial heterogeneity of urban heat islands and influencing factors
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conflicts between urban expansion and urban heat islands (UHIs) are increasing markedly, because of accelerated urbanization, and it is urgent to mitigate the UHI effect. In this study, we explored the spatial heterogeneity of UHIs from a neighborhood perspective via inversion of land surface temperature (LST) based on Landsat-8 remote sensing image data and using local Moran's I; the central urban area of Jinan City was selected as the study area. Furthermore, by constructing a system of urban spatial structure indicators and adopting methods such as correlation coefficient analysis and spatial econometric modeling, the factors influencing UHI were further revealed. The results showed that (1) There was spatial heterogeneity of the UHI in the central urban area of Jinan. The High-High cluster was mainly distributed in the north of the central urban area of Jinan; the LowLow cluster was primarily distributed in the south of the central urban area of Jinan and the waters. Agglomeration distribution approximately coincided with heat island distribution. (2) The correlations between urban spatial structure indicators and LST in different dimensions were generally high and varied significantly. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional indicators all showed a highly significant positive relationship with LST. The mean and standard deviation of the DEM and absolute building height in the one-dimensional indicators were both negatively and significantly correlated with LST. (3) Building height standard deviation had a significantly positive spillover effect on the LST of the neighboring areas; this spillover effect was greater than the direct effect on these regions.

TI  - Characterizing global satellite-based indicators for coastal vulnerability to erosion management as exemplified by a regional level analysis from Northeast Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of coastal vulnerability to erosion is crucial for decision-making regarding the economy, ecology, health, security, among other issues. Most of the studies gather a large data set about physical and anthropogenic interfer-ence's on the vulnerability of coastal erosion regions around the world. However, for developing nations like Brazil, with extensive shoreline, it is challenging to develop and maintain an in situ infrastructure to offer a systematical scientific data set. In this context, several methods like Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) for monitoring the dynamic behavior of coastal systems require in situ collected data. Therefore, this contribution explores the use of global open source satellite-based indicators to assess coastal vulnerability to erosion at a regional level adopting an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, the data set covers many spheres of the environ-ment like biophysical and social factors, adopting the Pernambuco State's coast, Brazil, as a case study. The results showed the direct relationship between a high level of urbanization and low vegetation with the high coastal vulnera-bility to erosion. PC1 revealed built-up and surface temperature vary inversely to the soil organic carbon and vegetation cover along about 20 km (approximate to 10% of the shoreline extension). The hotspots were in the urban cluster (Paulista, Olinda, Recife, and Jaboatao dos Guararapes), combined with high shoreline change around -2 m/yr. PC2 showed the natural action of wind on wave heights combined with sediment removal and the backshore settlement along 10 km of extension (approximate to 5.5% of the shoreline), with the highly vulnerable sites concentrated in Itamaraca Island and C. S. Agostinho. This approach benefits from the multi-satellite and multi-resolution data sets integration to unravel the statistical influence of each variable able to guide stakeholders.

TI  - Sociodemographic and Clinical Predictors of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in cT1-T2/N0 HER2-Amplified Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The optimal treatment strategy for small node-negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer remains controversial. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may risk overtreatment, whereas surgery first fails to identify patients with residual disease in need of escalated adjuvant systemic therapy. We investigated patient characteristics associated with receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods Adult women with cT1-T2/N0, HER2+ breast cancer between 2013 and 2017 in the National Cancer Database who underwent surgery within 8 months of diagnosis were included. Patients were classified as receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus a surgery-first approach. We assessed the sociodemographic and clinical predictors of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery first and associations between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast cancer treatments using multivariable regression models. Results We identified 56,784 women, of whom 12,758 (22%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 29,139 (53%) received adjuvant chemotherapy, 12,907 (24%) received no chemotherapy, and 1980 were missing chemotherapy information. After adjustment, cT2 stage was the strongest predictor of neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with surgery first. Younger age and later diagnosis year were positively associated with receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, hormone receptor positivity, Black race, rural county, and government-funded or no health insurance were inversely associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In multivariable analyses, patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to have a mastectomy (vs. lumpectomy) and sentinel lymph node biopsy or no nodal surgery (vs. axillary lymph node dissection). Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to receive multi-agent (vs. single-agent) chemotherapy than those who received adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions Substantial differences in the utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy exist in women with HER2+ breast cancer, which reflect both clinical parameters and disparities. Optimal treatment strategies should be implemented equitably across sociodemographic groups.

TI  - Forest cover change in China from 2000 to 2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to favourable afforestation policies in the past few decades, China has become the nation with the greatest afforestation area in the world. However, there are few specific distribution maps of forest change at regional and national level in China. Here, we applied all available Landsat time series images in the growing seasons from 1990 to 2018 on the Google Earth Engine platform to track annual forest changes in China. Our validation indicates that the overall accuracy reached 89%. From 2000 to 2016, most forest change in China occurred on the east side of the Line of Huanyong Hu (a line linking Aihui in Northeast China and Tengchong in Southwest China dividing China into east and west parts). Forest growth is the major change type in China with a forest-area expansion of 494,317 +/- 22,830 km(2). Meanwhile, there have also been some forest losses mostly scattered in southern and northeastern China. The total loss of the forest area was 52,856 +/- 3366 km(2). Thus, from 2000 to 2016, the net increase in forest area in China was 441,461 +/- 26,196 km(2), which is approximately 4.6% of the terrestrial area of China, almost equivalent to the entire Thailand. Among these 16 years, there have also been some forest areas recovered or replanted after disturbances. Meanwhile, afforestation achievements and effectiveness have also met the great risk that some afforested areas are eventually destroyed back to previous nonforest land again. The areas for these two change types are 43,728 +/- 6574 km(2) and 18,457 +/- 2396 km(2), respectively. The results indicated great afforestation achievements, but there was also some loss of forest resources and threats to consolidating afforestation achievements in China. The results of this study offer greater detail of forest change, especially afforestation, and can provide useful information for forest management and ecological restoration evaluation. Additionally, the forest change result will be available online (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5501089).

TI  - The Role of Cultural Worldviews in Willingness to Pay for Environmental Policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research in the social psychology literature suggests that personally held beliefs may play a pivotal role in individuals' acceptance of environmental policy. Using the contingent valuation method framework, we investigate the role of cultural worldview on individuals' support for, and valuation of, an environmental policy that differs by its underlying cause. Results suggest that willingness to pay point estimates for management action (1) can be influenced by cultural worldviews; and (2) are dependent on the cause of environmental degradation. We also extend the examination of potential endogeneity in ex-post perceived survey consequentiality and willingness to pay measures. We find some evidence that cultural worldviews influence consequentiality and that the framing of the environmental policy scenario can also influence whether an endogenous relationship exists between the randomly assigned payment instrument and the consequentiality measure.

TI  - A remote sensing-based approach to estimating the fire spread rate parameter for individual burn patch extraction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the past two decades, satellite-derived activef fire data have been used in a multitude of operational applications and in a large and growing body of research on the role of fire within the Earth system. More recent work with satellite-based active fire data has been directed toward estimating what are in effect broad-scale fire spread rates that are in turn used as an important temporal parameter for the extraction of individual-fire boundaries from burned area maps. Here we use data mining to identify active fire clusters that serve as an input to a fire spread reconstruction algorithm to derive optimal global fire spread rates suitable for fire-perimeter extraction. The spread rates calculated for the active fire clusters, which are useful for applications beyond perimeter extraction, correlate with the spread rates based on reference fire boundaries (R (2) = .82, NRMSE = 2.6%) and are generally compatible with other studies, despite key differences in data acquisition methods and quantities measured.

TI  - Sentinel-1 snow depth retrieval at sub-kilometer resolution over the European Alps
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017-2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 %-30 % of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.

TI  - Can China's national Five-Year Plan for environmental protection induce corporate green innovations?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the effect of China's national Five-Year Plan for environmental protection (FYPEP) on corporate green innovations based on the two-way fixed effect model and panel data about the green patents of China's publicly listed corporations during 1990-2020. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of these green innovations is further discussed with reference to the types of innovation, enterprise ownership, and the location of the corporations. It is found that FYPEP significantly induced corporation green innovations at regional and industrial levels. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the inductive effect of FY PEP is stronger on green utility model patents than on green invention patents. State-owned enterprises react to green innovation policies more significantly than do private businesses. The inductive effect of FYPEP is stronger in Eastern China than in mid- and Western China. From the perspective of government intervention, this research renders a new framework for the formulation of policies of national environmental protection and corporate green innovation.

TI  - Spatial prediction of soil organic matter content using multiyear synthetic images and partitioning algorithms
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of the spatial distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) is of great significance for regional sustainable development. However, due to the strong spatial variability in soil, there is still a lack of robust SOM mapping methods. The use of remote sensing satellite technology to map soil parameters has been effectively applied in many areas. Soil mapping in Northeast China with less cloud cover, higher planting intensity and longer bare soil period of cultivated land is expected. In this study, multiyear Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images of bare soil periods were used to generate median synthetic images according to different time intervals in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Then, the spectral index and image band were used as input variables, and the prediction accuracies of different combinations were evaluated by the random forest (RF) algorithm. Finally, the best combination of two partitioning methods (based on different soil types and cascade simple K-means clustering) was used for SOM prediction of local regression and mapping. The results show that 1) the best time window for SOM prediction in the Songnen Plain is in May, but precipitation will affect the prediction accuracy of SOM; 2) Sentinel-2 synthetic images are not superior to Landsat 8 synthetic images for SOM mapping, although Sentinel-2 has better temporal and spatial resolution; and 3) compared with the global regression model, the local regression method based on two partitioning methods can improve the accuracy of SOM mapping, but the actual mapping effect based on the soil type partitioning algorithms is affected by the distribution of soil samples. This study extends the application of GEE to soil mapping and improve the accuracy of large-scale regional SOM mapping by partitioning images.

TI  - Semi-synthesis and cytotoxicity evaluation of pyrimidine, thiazole, and indole analogues of argentatins A-C from guayule (<i>Parthenium argentatum</i>) resin
T2  - MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Argentatins A-C (1-3), the major cycloartane-type triterpenoids of guayule resin, a byproduct of commercial rubber production, were converted into their pyrimidine (7-12), thiazole (13-15), and indole (16-18) analogues by a molecular hybridization approach. The cytotoxic activities of these fused heterocyclic analogues 7-18 were compared with those of argentatins A-C (1-3) against a panel of three sentinel human cancer cell lines [NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), and SF-268 (central nervous system glioma)], and normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cells. The cytotoxicity data suggest that the pyrimidine analogues 7 and 8 (derived from 1), 9 and 10 (derived from 2), and 12 (derived from 3) had significantly enhanced activity compared to the parent compounds or their thiazole (13-15) and indole (16-18) analogues. These findings indicate that triterpenoid constituents of guayule resin may be exploited to obtain value-added products with potential applications in anticancer drug discovery.

TI  - Trend analysis of land surface temperature over Iran based on land cover and topography
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the features of the land surface and the atmosphere is well identified by its temperature. This parameter is a key tool in investigations of relevant energy equilibrium variations. The purpose of this research is to identify and analyze Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations over Iran using MODIS Aqua data. The modified non-parametric Mann-Kendall test is used for examination of trend significance, and Sen's slope is used in the calculation of changes rate and direction. The results demonstrated that environmental factors including land cover and elevation have significant effects on LST trend. For inland waters and swamps, positive daytime trends have occurred during the warm months of the year, and negative nighttime trends have occurred during the cold months. The highest frequency of variation per decade corresponds to that between -5 and + 5 degrees Celsius per decade (degrees C/Decade). The mountainous regions have experienced severe positive daytime variations in the cold months and similar changes in the warm months. The findings also indicate that changes in land cover and use have resulted in LST variations. There have been greater daytime than nighttime such variations, and have occurred at far higher rates for four land covers: the bodies of water, cropland, urban areas, and barren land. The overall results of the research demonstrated that MODIS Aqua LST data are capable of accurately monitoring spatiotemporal variations over Iran.

T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background It is quite rare for breast cancer to metastasize to the kidney with a tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava. Case presentation A Japanese woman in her forties was diagnosed with cancer of the left breast and underwent left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The final pathological diagnosis was pT1aN0M0, stage IA (ER positive, PgR positive, HER2 negative). Thirteen years later, she presented for care with the complaint of abdominal pain. By imaging findings, right renal carcinoma with a tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava and lung metastases was suspected. However, her tumors were refractory to molecular targeted therapy. In addition, CT-guided needle biopsy of the kidney and lung lesions was done and it was revealed that lesions of the left lung and the right kidney was breast cancer metastases (ER positive, PgR positive, HER2 negative). The patient started combination therapy consisting of abemaciclib, tamoxifen and leuprorelin. Six months later, she died from progression of her metastatic disease. Conclusions It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between primary renal cancer and kidney metastases from breast cancer on imaging. Renal biopsy is recommended before commencing treatment.

TI  - SPECT/CT-Guided Surgical Removal of a Positive External Iliac Sentinel Node in Primary Umbilical Melanoma: Report of a Case, and Up-to-Date Review of the Literature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary umbilical melanoma is rare tumor, representing about 5% of all umbilical malignancies.The lymphatic drainage from the tumor is challenging and can be to inguinal, axillary and retroperitoneal nodes. Dynamic and static lymphoscintigraphy with single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a widely validated technique in patients with clinically localized melanoma to search for and quantify nodal spread of cutaneous melanoma. Moreover, it offers the surgeon the preoperative information about the number and location of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), which makes SLNB easier and quicker. This is the first report of an ulcerated thick melanoma of the umbilicus metastasizing only to an external iliac lymph-node without involvement of superficial inguinal SLNs. The preoperative high-resolution ultrasound (HR-US) examination of the regional lymph node field had been normal. This case-report shows how addition of SPECT/CT to planar imaging in a patient with clinically localized umbilical melanoma can help avoid incomplete SLNB when a deep SLN is not removed. A literature review of umbilical melanoma is also provided.

TI  - Time and path prediction of landslides using InSAR and flow model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides originating from remote steep slopes render people living downhill vulnerable, unaware of the impending danger. Identifications of slow-moving mountain slopes are possible now due to time series measurement from space using microwave satellite data and the InSAR technique, which potentially can detect displacement at millimetre level. Availability of open-source Sentinel-1 data has revolutionised the study involving landslide kinematics and predicting the time of failure. However, identification of accelerating trend, demarcation of release area and prediction of flow path after failure initiation are still challenging. In this paper, we present a novel method for time and path prediction of landslides using two large landslides (Kikruma and Kotropi) located in the Himalayas in India. Sentinel-1 data stack was processed using the Persistent Scatterer and Small Baseline Subset interferometric techniques to analyse the trend of ground deformation leading to slope failures. The displacement time series of the measurement points, analysed using inverse velocity and modified inverse velocity methods, show that the instability had commenced almost a year or more with the final onset of acceleration triggered by heavy rainfall, couple of weeks prior to the actual failure. The acceleration image created from displacement time series data was clustered using image segmentation techniques to demarcate the release area of landslides. The flow simulation was done using the Voellmy friction model with a high-resolution DEM to predict the flow path. The analysis done for Kikruma and Kotropi landslide case studies with the proposed method provided a safe prediction of the time of landslide with similar to 90% accuracy of the flow path prediction. Results show that the method demonstrated in this study may evolve as an effective tool for landslide early warning in hilly areas.

TI  - Park cool island and built environment. A ten-year evaluation in Parque Central, Mendoza-Argentina
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban greening is a strategy for mitigating urban heat island. However, vegetation demands, water and energy, high scarce resources in cities on dry land. Hence, it is necessary to rethink the relationship between green spaces and its surrounding built environment. This work ' s objective is to evaluate the impact of Mendoza ' s Parque Central (Argentina) on the air temperatures of its built environment, taking as a measure the park cool island intensity in the 2007-2017 period. Parque Central has a strategic value for the urban development of a residential area with a low to medium construction density. Methodologically, four monitoring campaigns were carried out during the summer periods of 2007-2008; 2010-2011; 2011-2012 and 2016-2017. In each campaign, temperature and relative humidity sensors were installed in the area. Satellite images from Landsat 7 were analyzed and four spectral indices were determined. The results indicate that during the 2016-2017 summer the forest and meadow structures were cooler than in the 2007-2008 season. Over 10 seasons, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index has increased more than 8 times, while the maximum park cool island intensities have increased 2.31 times. This non-proportionality can be explained by the densification of the built environment, among other factors.

M3  - Article
AB  - This work introduces Sentinel-1 based Inland water dynamics Mapping System (SIMS), an open-source web application developed to enable automated mapping of inland water dynamics using Sentinel-1 radar imagery. SIMS relies on a novel framework built using Python and Google Earth Engine. The underlying algorithm involves a simple binary thresholding technique and an outlier removal method tailored to perform efficiently across complicated flow regimes. Results can be downloaded as numerical data or as time-series of shapefiles representing the variation of inland water extents. Exported geospatial datasets aid the pre-launch study of future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission which is expected to deliver hydrological measurements at unprecedented spatial resolutions. Classification metrics are evaluated at 20 validation sites across the globe using Sentinel-2 based Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) images as reference. Results indicated high overall accuracy ranging from 84.16% to 99.47% for lakes and 87.23%-98.96% for rivers.

TI  - Morphological reconstruction algorithms for urban monitoring using satellite data: proper selection of the marker and mask images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphological processing has found several applications in image analysis and pattern recognition. Some of these techniques, known as morphological reconstruction algorithms, have been employed for land cover classification in remote sensing data. In this paper, we analyse the mathematical foundations, applications, and limitations of reconstruction by dilation and by erosion oriented to urban extraction, using Sentinel-2 satellite data. Different techniques oriented to the proper determination of the marker and mask images, the basis for reconstruction, are proposed in this manuscript. In addition, in order to diminish the long computation time required for reconstruction, two parallel implementations using Multi-core and GPU, are proposed. According to our research, these algorithms can be considered as effective and non-supervised solutions for urban extraction applications based on multispectral satellite imagery.

TI  - Y-Net: A Multiclass Change Detection Network for Bi-temporal Remote Sensing Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multiclass change detection task aims to segment an area of land change and to identify the type of ground change exploiting bi-temporal remote-sensing images. In recent years, this technology has become an important means of analysing remote-sensing data and has shown great potential in accurately understanding changes on the earth's surface. However, the existing methods are mainly for binary change detection tasks and cannot detect the specific information of the change category. Hence, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end densely connected network, entitled Y-Net, employing a Siamese structure for multiclass change detection. The proposed network uses a dual-stream DenseNet to extract bi-temporal change features during the encoding stage and introduces the attention fusion mechanism for the decoding stage to enhance the attention to changing features. Add the dice loss to reduce the impact of sample imbalance on multiclass change detection. The suggested network utilizes a deep supervision strategy for each decoding layer to achieve change graph reconstruction of different levels. Y-Net is evaluated on the challenging multiclass change detection data set SECOND, and the ablation study verified the effectiveness of the attention fusion module and dice loss for multiclass change detection, considering both visual interpretation and quantitative evaluation, confirming that the proposed method is superior to current state-of-the-art change detection methods.

TI  - A CNN-based rescaling algorithm and performance analysis for spatial resolution enhancement of Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for spatial resolution enhancement of Landsat images without finer resolution bands for training the CNN-based model. Its performance was assessed using Landsat 8 images from eight different regions that were dominated by various topographic features, and land use and land cover types by comparison with bicubic (BIC), nearest neighbor (NN) and Lanczos (LZ) resampling. It was found that for spatial resolution enhancement of 30 m resolution images to 15 m, 10 m and 7.5 m, the proposed model increased the average peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) values by 1.7% to 11.5% compared with the compared methods. The PSNR increases were statistically significantly different from zero at the significant level of .05, but the improvement decreased as the spatial resolution of the input images became finer. Moreover, the deeper the CNN model, the better the performance, but after nine layers, the gain of performance slowed down. This indicates that the proposed algorithm is promising for spatial resolution enhancement of optical images without input of finer spatial resolution images.

TI  - Global Land Cover Mapping Using Annual Clear-sky Composites from FY3D/MERSI-II
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) on board FY-3D satellite is a visible and infrared spectral imaging instrument featured with six 250-m spatial resolution channels (blue, green, red, NIR, 10.8 mu m, 12.0 mu m). Such unique spectral and spatial attributes provide significant opportunities and challenges for land cover (LC) mapping research. This paper reports the production of a 250-m spatial resolution global LC classification (under IGBP scheme) from MERSI-II NDVI operational products from May 2019 to April 2020. To extract robust features for discriminating LC types, we adopted three classic compositing criteria (MaxNDVI, Mean8NDVI, and Mean4BT) and two new compositing criteria (3minRedBlue and 3minRedNIR) to obtain high-quality annual composites. Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used for supervised learning, and 10-fold cross validation (CV) based on 'site-splits' was implemented to evaluate classification accuracy. The derived MERIS-II LC map was compared at pixel level with two widely used LC products (MODIS and VIIRS), and consistency among the three maps was investigated. Results showed that the higher resolution afforded by 250-m MERSI-II data in combination with a refined input features produced a global LC map with an overall accuracy of 79-86%. Most classes exhibited low commission and omission errors except for some classes of mixed nature (i.e. wetland, cropland/natural vegetation mosaic, savanna, woody savanna). The MERSI-II LC map generally agreed better with MODIS than with VIIRS, and the proportion of land pixels (excluding Antarctic) for which MERSI-II shows the same LC label with either MODIS or VIIRS is very large (0.70-0.82). Composite data contributed differently to total accuracy, with Mean8NDVI being the most spatial coherent and most contributive and MaxNDVI being the opposite. The other three composites (Mean4BT, 3minRedBlue, and 3minRedNIR) showed moderate spatial coherence and contributed to classification variedly by extracting information from different phenology phases. The unique 250-m blue and green bands of MERSI-II were found to be helpful to discriminate between wetland and needleleaf forest in high latitudes and between cities and grassland. This study confirms that with the RF algorithm (one of the state-of-art supervised machine learning algorithms) and image compositing techniques, accurate LC map can be derived from MERSI-II. Future work will attempt to include more bands and compositing criteria to further improve classification accuracy.

TI  - Combining CERES-Wheat model, Sentinel-2 data, and deep learning method for winter wheat yield estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate regional wheat yield estimates is crucial to food security and sustainable development in the agricultural sector. In this study, a novel long short-term memory network (LSTM) model was developed to estimate wheat yield in Henan Province of China by combining field-measured yields, the time series of leaf area index (LAI) and yields simulated from CERES-Wheat model, and the LAI retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery. The LSTM model was pretrained using the simulated LAI and yields at the agro-meteorological stations, and was retrained by the Sentinel-2 LAI and measured yields, hereafter referred to as retrained LSTM model. The yield estimation accuracy of the retrained LSTM model was compared with that of the LSTM model trained by the simulations alone (hereafter referred to as CGM-trained LSTM model) and that of the LSTM model trained by the Sentinel-2 LAI and measured yields alone (hereafter referred to as RS-trained LSTM model). The results showed that, at both the site and county levels, the retrained LSTM model provided improved accuracies compared with the CGM-trained and RS-trained LSTM models. It was because the accurate estimates of wheat yield at field scales were extended to regional scales through a combination of the advantages of both the crop growth models and satellite imagery. This study portrays the benefits of integrating crop growth models, satellite data and LSTM model in order to perform more reliable crop yield estimations over large areas.

T2  - BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a promising new therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Following the work on the discovery of natural LSD1 inhibitor higenamine, we herein performed further structure-based design, synthesis, and extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, affording structurally new spi-rooxindole derivatives. Particularly, FY-56 was identified to be a highly potent LSD1 inhibitor (IC50 = 42 nM) and showed high selectivity over monoamine oxidases (MAO-A/B). Mechanistic studies showed that FY-56 moderately inhibited the proliferation and clone formation of leukemia cells, induced H3K4me1/2 accumula-tion and p53 activation as well as reduced the mRNA levels of the transcription factors HOXA9 and MEIS1. Meanwhile, FY-56 induced differentiation of MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cells, accompanied by an enhanced per-centage of markers characteristic to differentiated macrophages and monocytes. Further in vivo studies showed that FY-56 obviously reduced the proportion of CD45(+)/CD33(+) leukocytes in peripheral blood and spleen, and significantly prolonged the survival rate of mice. Collectively, FY-56 represents a structurally novel, highly potent and selective LSD1 inhibitor and exhibits therapeutic promise for AML treatment. The spirooxindole scaffold derived from FY-56 could be used to design structurally new LSD1 inhibitors for treating human diseases.& nbsp;

TI  - Monitoring, Prediction, and Evaluation of Mountain Geological Hazards Based on InSAR Technology
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - When traditional geological hazard survey methods are used for deformation monitoring in mountainous areas, it often shows the disadvantages of low applicability of monitoring methods and limited accuracy of detection results. In recent years, synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technology has incomparable advantages in surface deformation monitoring, such as all-weather detection, wide detection range, high detection accuracy, and low detection cost. At the same time, InSAR technology can also provide data and technical support for the subsequent task of potential geological disaster point identification and geological disaster risk zoning in the study area. Alos-2 radar is selected; in this paper the satellite image is the research data, and the InSAR technology is used to complete the surface deformation detection. Then, based on the previous surface deformation monitoring results, the potential geological disaster points in the study area are extracted, and the distribution law and incubation conditions of the disaster points are analyzed and described. According to the field conditions of a certain area, the surface distribution, development causes, and inducing mechanism of the potential geological disaster points are explored; the results show that the development of geological disasters in the study area is affected by many factors such as landform, geological environment, climate, hydrology, and human activities. Based on this, 11 factors such as formation lithology, slope, and river are used as evaluation factors for mountain geological disaster monitoring, prediction, and evaluation analysis. Finally, the improved analytic hierarchy process information model is used to complete the monitoring, prediction, evaluation, and analysis of regional geological hazards in the study area. In this paper, the improved AHP-information method is used to classify the risk of mountain geological disasters in the study area. Finally, the evaluation results are verified, which proves that the improved AHP-information method is reliable, and its mountain geological disaster monitoring and prediction evaluation effect is better than the traditional AHP-information method.

TI  - Accurate real-time monitoring of fine dust using a densely connected convolutional networks with measured plasma emissions
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification and monitoring of fine dust are emerging as a primary global issue for addressing the harmful effects of fine dust on public health. Identifying the source of fine dust is indispensable for ensuring the human lifespan as well as preventing environmental disasters. Here a simple yet effective spark-induced plasma spectroscopy (SIPS) unit combined with deep learning for real-time classification is verified as a fast and precise PM (particulate matter) source identification technique. SIPS promises portable use, label-free detection, source identification, and chemical susceptibility in a single step with acceptable speed and accuracy. In particular, the densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) are used with measured spark-induced plasma emission datasets to identify PM sources at above 98%. The identification performance was compared with other common classification methods, and DenseNet with dropouts (30%), optimized batch size (16), and cyclic learning rate training emerged as the most promising source identification method.

TI  - A modified cyanobacteria prediction model based on cellular automata model using N and P concentration reverse data: a case study in Taihu Lake
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of algal bloom caused by eutrophication has attracted global attention. Many scholars have studied the problem associated with algae bloom, but few have carried out dynamic monitoring, instead focusing on the formation mechanism of cyanobacteria. For our study of the Taihu Lake in China, we used Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat remote sensing image data from 2017 to establish a prediction model. First, we used MODIS data to retrieve the concentration of N, P, and chlorophyll a in water. Then, we applied the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to the inversion results to construct the diffusion potential index. Finally, we used C# to compile the cellular automata (CA) model. We found that the distribution of cyanobacteria predicted by our method was consistent with the algal bloom situation of Taihu Lake in 2017. The results showed that the method effectively predicts the dynamic transfer of cyanobacteria from outbreak to diffusion in a short period of time, which can help decision-makers monitor lake health.

TI  - Dynamic Disturbance Analysis of Grasslands Using Neural Networks and Spatiotemporal Indices Fusion on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland is the vegetation type with the widest coverage on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Under the influence of multiple factors, such as global climate change and human activities, grassland is undergoing temporal and spatially different disturbances and changes, and they have a significant impact on the grassland ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Therefore, timely and dynamic monitoring of grassland disturbances and distinguishing the reasons for the changes are essential for ecological understanding and management. The purpose of this research is to propose a knowledge-based strategy to realize grassland dynamic distribution mapping and analysis of grassland disturbance changes in the region that are suitable for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The purpose of this study is to propose an analysis algorithm that uses first annual mapping and then establishes temporal disturbance rules, which is applicable to the integrated exploration of disturbance changes in highland-type grasslands. The characteristic indexes of greenness and disturbance indices in the growing period were constructed and integrated with deep neural network learning to dynamically map the grassland for many years. The overall accuracy of grassland mapping was 94.11% and that of Kappa was 0.845. The results show that the area of grassland increased by 11.18% from 2001 to 2017. Then, the grassland disturbance change analysis method is proposed in monitoring the grassland distribution range, and it is found that the area of grassland with significant disturbance change accounts for 10.86% of the total area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the disturbance changes are specifically divided into seven types. Among them, the type of degradation after disturbance mainly occurs in Tibet, whereas the main types of vegetation greenness increase in Qinghai and Gansu. At the same time, the study finds that climate change, altitude, and human grazing activities are the main factors affecting grassland disturbance changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and there are spatial differences.

M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms cause widespread damage to social health, economy, welfare, and environment of inhabitants in the affected areas. Although early detection of dust fails to focus on the cause of this phenomenon, it can help develop collective and individual action plans. Therefore, some researchers have become interested in detecting dust concentration in recent years. Accordingly, a hybrid approach based on machine learning was developed in this study to detect dust concentrations by using meteorological and MODIS data. The proposed model consists of two main sections, the first case uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm to extract appropriate features, whereas the second uses innovatively a nonlinear ensemble approach to detect dust concentration and horizontal visibility. First, five machine learning methods included GMDH neural network, a multilayer perceptron neural network, multiple linear regression, a random forest algorithm, and a support vector machine technique are used as reference models. Then, each of the five reference model is used as a nonlinear ensemble model. Also, the common approach of voting-based on ensemble model is used to compare with the result of the proposed approach and to ensure the optimality of the method. Ultimately, it is observed that the ensemble approach has significantly increased the precision of the results with respect to references models.

TI  - Making the leap from ponds to landscapes: Integrating field-based monitoring of amphibians and wetlands with satellite observations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A unifying goal of wetland monitoring programs is to characterize how wetland flooding and drying regimes vary in space and time. In remote and mountainous regions, wetlands have been difficult and labor-intensive to monitor, especially at landscape scales. Here, we demonstrate how data from annual, ground-based monitoring of wetlands and amphibians in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) can be enhanced in time and spatial extent by Landsat-based observations of wetlands. Specifically, we applied spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to the Landsat time series to characterize seasonal variation in wetland surface water area over a 35-year period. This extended our monitoring record backward in time (increasing temporal extent) and allowed us to monitor wetlands outside the boundaries of our long-term monitoring catchments, thereby increasing spatial extent. Additionally, we reconstructed and characterized hydroperiod regimes of 427 wetlands across YNP's Northern Range (NR) as ephemeral, intermittent, semi-permanent, and permanent; these categories relate to the local ecology of these sites. Across the NR, the mean summer surface water area in most wetlands declined, regardless of hydrologic regime. Declines in wetland surface water area were associated with variations in snowmelt runoff for approximately half of NR wetlands. The mean effect of runoff on wetland area was strongest for ephemeral wetlands and weakest for permanent wetlands, which were significantly larger than other wetland types. Ground-based observations from established, long-term monitoring sites (n = 37) showed that amphibians used all wetland hydroperiod regimes. Intermittent and permanent regime types contained sites where amphibian breeding was consistently detected and highlighted the importance of a portfolio of wetland types for amphibian conservation. Through the integration of ground-based and Landsat satellite datasets, we not only took the leap from ponds to landscapes, dramatically expanding the spatial and temporal extent of monitoring, but also successfully used SMA to characterize hydroperiod regimes and evaluate longer-term wetland surface water area trends across a range of wetland sizes. This work will allow wetland managers to place current conditions within longer-term trends, understand broader patterns of surface water change, analyze the relationship between wetland surface water trends and management actions, and calibrate models of climate impacts. Most importantly, the integration of field assessment and remote sensing technologies offers a strategy to detect changes in wetland extent and condition at scales ranging from individual ponds to landscapes.

TI  - Post-Seismic to Co-Seismic Moment Ratios for the 2016 Moderate Earthquakes Along Chaman Fault
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Postseismic-to-coseismic moment ratios (PCMR) for strong (M > 6) earthquakes typically do not exceed similar to 0.3, but there have been limited estimates for moderate-to-small earthquakes. Three M5-class earthquakes and one M4.7 earthquake occurred along the Chaman fault, Pakistan, on May 13 and July 10, 2016. Using Sentinel-1A InSAR time-series from October 2014 to August 2018, we estimate spatial-temporal evolution of the co- and post-seismic fault slip and its velocity. Because of the long-lasting (>1 year) afterslip, the estimated PCMRs of the M5-class events and M4.7 event were 0.7 +/- 0.2 and 8.3 +/- 2.2, respectively, which are both larger than those of M > 6 earthquakes but consistent with previous events that occurred on the Chaman Fault System. Unlike in case of large earthquakes, geodetic inversions are not able to resolve spatial relationships between coseismic slip and afterslip. In case of a non-complementary slip distribution, one explanation might be heterogeneity of friction properties on the fault surface, while other interpretations are possible.

TI  - Assessing the Vertical Velocity of the East Pacific ITCZ
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reanalysis and satellite data sets disagree on the vertical structure of the meridional overturning circulation over the East Pacific (EP) intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Recent observations from the Organization of Tropical East Pacific Convection (OTREC) 2019 field campaign show a meridional slope of vertical motion with a shallow mode from 3 degrees to 7 degrees N, over a strong meridional sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, and a deeper mode from 7 degrees to 10.5 degrees N, where the SST is predominantly warm. However, reanalysis fields from the OTREC period show a predominant shallow mode from 3 degrees to 9 degrees N unless OTREC dropsondes are assimilated; then a weak deep mode is found at 8 degrees N. Vertical motion over the OTREC region derived from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation radar latent heating retrievals has the opposite problem in that the deep mode is predominant from 3 degrees to 10 degrees N. A shallow mode is present with the addition of cloud radar data.Plain Language Summary There is no consensus on where air rises most strongly and to what heights over the tropical East Pacific Ocean because there are very few available in situ observations. Thus, we rely on numerical models or satellite observations to make estimates of where air rises and where storms are deepest and strongest. In this study, we show recent field campaign observations that indicate the existence of two modes of upward motion: a shallow mode (i.e., ascending motion up to 4 km AMSL) in the southern part of the main precipitation band just north of the equator, and a deep mode (i.e., ascending motion up to 10 km AMSL) a few hundred km farther north. While numerical models only produce the shallow mode, satellite algorithms suggest only a deep mode. Improvements were made when the numerical models used in situ data for guidance and the satellite algorithms were supplemented with observations from other sensors. In situ observations were crucial to conclude that currently available numerical model and satellite data sets, independently, are problematic for describing the large-scale air motions in the East Pacific.

TI  - Interval association of remote sensing ecological index in China based on concept lattice
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The correlation coefficient can calculate paired correlations among different ecological indicators as a whole, but it cannot calculate the specific interval association and the correlation among multiple indicators. This paper proposed an interval association (IA) method of the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI), based on the concept lattice and frequent closed itemset. In the IA method, the ecosystem was viewed as a complex system with a hierarchical structure, and the association among multiple indicators was calculated using the information granulation of RSEI. The interval association support degree (IASD) could measure the association clustering strength of these IA concepts. Calculation of MODIS data compiled by Google Earth Engine (GEE) showed that the IA concepts of RSEI in China were primarily composed of selected middle indicator intervals in 2017. The overall eco-environmental condition in China was general when assessed through IA. The spatial distribution of the remote sensing eco-environment in China displayed strong spatial association clustering. Furthermore, the IA of RSEI focused on the first few concepts with high IASD values.

TI  - Airborne Measurements of Surface Albedo and Leaf Area Index of Snow-Covered Boreal Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Helicopter based simultaneous measurements of broadband surface albedo and the effective leaf area index (LAI(eff)) were carried out in subarctic area of Finnish Lapland in spring 2008, 2009, and 2010 under varying illumination and snow cover conditions. Vertical profile measurements show that the found relationship between albedo and LAI(eff) seems to be rather independent of the flight altitude and therefore the footprint scale. Actually, flights above 500 m in altitude revealed low variations of the surface albedo approaching an aerial average at 1 km, meaning that a footprint of 20 km is representative of the landscape. The albedo of the area was beta distributed, and without LAI(eff) values below 0.25, the average albedo value of the area would decrease from 0.49 to 0.44 showing the albedo sensitivity to sparse vegetation. The results agreed with the photon recollision probability based model PARAS and the MODIS satellite albedo product MCD43A3. However, differences between satellite based and airborne albedo values were noticed, which could be explained by a difference in footprint size and/or the strong local heterogeneity as certain flights were operated on specific targets.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of Uplift Pattern in the Western European Alps Revealed by InSAR Time-Series Analysis
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Western European Alps display measurable surface deformation rates from leveling and GNSS data. Based on the time-series analysis of 4 years of Sentinel-1 data, we propose for the first time an InSAR-based mapping of the uplift pattern affecting the Western Alps on a similar to 350 x 175-km-wide area. This approach provides a denser spatial distribution of vertical motion despite the high noise level inherent to mountainous areas and the low expected deformation signal. Our results show consistency with other geodetic measurements at the regional scale, and reveal smaller-scale spatial variations in the uplift pattern. Higher uplift rates are found within the external crystalline massifs compared to surrounding areas, in agreement with the variations expected from recent deglaciation and long-term exhumation data. This work brings the first InSAR-based geodetic clue of differential uplift within the Alpine belt in response to the surface and deep processes affecting the belt.

TI  - Geographical divergence of species richness and local homogenization of plant assemblages due to climate change in grasslands
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions worldwide, grassland plant species richness is highly sensitive to climate change. Studies assessing local grassland richness patterns have yielded inconsistent trends toward climate change, partly due to differences in recording approaches, environmental conditions, and local flora. Remote sensing presents a valuable opportunity to investigate plant richness-climate change relationships in grasslands across large environmental gradients. Based on spectral diversity indices extracted from Landsat satellite imagery, we explore how plant diversity responds to climate change and aim to determine the major climatic drivers of plant diversity patterns in ten grassland nature reserves worldwide. Plot-level plant richness was correlated with 19 bioclimatic variables through stepwise linear regression for each climate change scenario in every nature reserve. The performance of the models was assessed according to the model accuracy. We used the fitted models between climatic variables and plant richness from 1990 to 2000 to predict plant richness in 2050 and 2070 under 33 climatic change scenarios for 1120 plots in each reserve. A general tendency toward a decrease in the plot-level plant richness and beta (beta)-diversity in the future decades were observed in most cases, although there also were some opposite trends in plant richness. The dominant bioclimatic predictors involved in predictive models varied across sites. Spectral plant richness responses diverge geographically, while beta-diversity generally declines under climate change scenarios. Over the next decades, the expected homogeneities in plant species across grasslands encountered on different continents will likely lead to the dominance of climate generalist species. Policy-makers and conservationists therefore need to urgently develop strategies to ensure plant survival, particularly that of locally endemic species under predicted climatic scenarios; human assistance may be required when adjusting their distribution ranges.

TI  - Agricultural Field Extraction with Deep Learning Algorithm and Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic detection of borders using remote sensing images will minimize the dependency on time-consuming manual input. The lack of field border data sets indicates that current methods are ineffective. This article seeks to promote the detection of field borders from satellite images with general process based on a multi-task segmentation model. ResUNet-a is a convolutional neural network with a completely linked UNet backbone that supports sprawling and conditional inference. The algorithm will significantly increase model efficiency and its generalization by re-constructing connected outputs. Then individual field segmentation can be accomplished by post-processing model outputs. The model was extremely exact in field mapping, field borders, and thus individual fields using the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images as inputs. The multitemporal images replacement with a single image similar to the composition time decreased slightly. The proposed model is able to reliably identify field borders and remove irrelevant limits from the image to acquire complex hierarchical contextual properties, thus outstriking classical edge filters. Our method is supposed to promote individual crop field extraction on a scale, by minimizing overfitting.

TI  - Improving Surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> Forecasts in the United States Using an Ensemble of Chemical Transport Model Outputs: 2. Bias Correction With Satellite Data for Rural Areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work serves as the second of a two-part study to improve surface PM2.5 forecasts in the continental U.S. through the integrated use of multisatellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products (MODIS Terra/Aqua and VIIRS DT/DB), multichemical transport model (CTM) (GEOS-Chem, WRF-Chem, and CMAQ) outputs, and ground observations. In Part I of the study, an ensemble Kalman filter (KF) technique using three CTM outputs and ground observations was developed to correct forecast bias and generate a single best forecast of PM2.5 for next day over nonrural areas that have surface PM2.5 measurements in the proximity of 125 km. Here, with AOD data, we extended the bias correction into rural areas where the closest air quality monitoring station is at least 125-300 km away. First, we ensembled all of satellite AOD products to yield the single best AOD. Second, we corrected daily PM2.5 in rural areas from multiple models through the AOD spatial pattern between these areas and nonrural areas, referred to as "extended ground truth" or EGT, for the present day. Lastly, we applied the KF technique to reduce the forecast bias for next day using the EGT. Our results find that the ensemble of bias-corrected daily PM2.5 from three CTMs for both today and next day show the best performance. Together, the two-part study develops a multimodel and multi-AOD bias-correction technique that has the potential to improve PM2.5 forecasts in both rural and nonrural areas in near real time, and be readily implemented at state levels.

TI  - Temporal dynamic drought interpretation of Sawa Lake: case study located at the Southern Iraqi region
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sawa Lake is a historical, cultural, and environmental landmark of great importance in education and tourism. Its unique advantages make it a potential global natural heritage and geopark in 2021. The current research is devoted to investigate and assess the actual reasons behind the rapid decline of the water level of Sawa Lake, which has begun to drop dramatically in an unprecedented situation. Landsat data are employed for interpreting the temporal and spatial changes of both water and vegetation covers. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data are used for water volume estimation. Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index was used in comparing the rainfall rate to the changing of land use-land cover. Additionally, the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index are established on the Landsat OLI imageries using ENVI 5.3 software. The data analysis showed that one of the most important reasons for the Sawa Lake water level drop is the massive pumping of the groundwater from a site located to the south of the lake to feed the Mamlahat Al-Samawa from which NaCl is extracted.

TI  - Complete response of Merkel cell carcinoma with talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) monotherapy.
T2  - Dermatology online journal
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine neoplasm, warranting surgical excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy. In later stages, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation are required owing to its aggressive malignant behavior. We describe a 62-year-old woman who presented with multifocal recurrence of MCC and was not a candidate for immunotherapy or surgery. The patient underwent four treatments of intratumoral talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) and demonstrated a complete response with no histologic evidence of remaining MCC on four scouting biopsies. Although TVEC therapy is currently approved for the treatment of advanced stage melanoma, it is still being investigated in MCC. This case supports the use of TVEC as monotherapy in select patients with locally advanced MCC who are not candidates for surgery or systemic immunotherapy.

TI  - Ocular surface mast cells promote inflammatory lymphangiogenesis
T2  - MICROVASCULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mast cells, sentinel immune cells, are most abundantly expressed in vascularized tissues that interface the external environment, such as the skin and ocular surface. Our previous reports have shown mast cells reside closely with vascular endothelial cells and mediate the pathogenic angiogenic response. However, the contribution of mast cells and their underlying mechanisms on lymphangiogenesis have not been fully deciphered. Using a murine model of inflammatory corneal angiogenesis, we observed adjacent migration of activated mast cells with new lymph vessel growth. Our in vitro co-culture assays demonstrate that mast cells express high levels of of VEGF-D and directly promote lymphatic endothelial cell tube formation and proliferation. Moreover, our loss-of-function approaches, using mast cell knockout mice and cromolyn-mediated mast cell inhibition, showed mast cell deficiency suppresses the induction of inflammatory lymphangiogenesis and VEGF-D expression at the ocular surface following corneal tissue insult. Our findings suggest blockade of mast cells as a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit pathological lymphangiogenesis.

TI  - Spatial soil moisture estimation in agro-pastoral transitional zone based on synergistic use of SAR and optical-thermal satellite images
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S1) surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval is promising but challenging in canopy areas. Additional data from optical-thermal infrared (TIR) sensors (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) have potential to compensate for SSM monitoring from single S1 product, suggesting their synergistic use for SSM retrieval in vegetated terrains. A physical, straightforward and non-calibration synergy method of SAR S1 and optical-TIR MODIS was proposed in this study to enhance SSM estimation in an agro-pastoral transitional zone. Change detection for S1 backscatter (sigma degrees) and simplified triangle method representing land surface temperature (LST) - normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) space (T-s-VI) for MODIS, were combined under a synergistic framework regarding vegetation conditions. The synergy method performance was evaluated against in-situ soil moisture sites for different phenological stages. Correlation analysis results indicated that S1 sigma degrees is highly sensitive to SSM in non-growing season, whereas MODIS LST is negatively linked to root-zone soil moisture during summer crop growth as the seasonal vegetation effect that can be explained via the observed trapezoidal T-s-VI shape. For the synergy, S1 is mainly involved in during non-growing period, while major contribution in growing period was from MODIS, which accounted for 90% improvements in correlation (R, 0.29 - 0.55) and 30% for Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE, 0.093 - 0.065 m(3)m(-3)) during a four-month crop growth as compared to single S1 product. For entire period, the synergy method outperformed single S1 over all sites, where the average R and RMSE improved 30% (0.46 - 0.60) and 14% (0.070 - 0.060 m(3)m(-3)), respectively, with highest values (R = 0.73 and RMSE = 0.039 m(3)m(-3)) observed in a maize site. This synergy suggests a suitability of integrating optical-TIR data to improve SAR SSM estimation in agricultural lands, especially over the crop growth period when water is a major limiting factor.

TI  - Methods for landslide detection based on lightweight YOLOv4 convolutional neural network
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and accurate positioning of the landslides through remote sensing data plays an important role in post-disaster emergency rescue. This paper was proposed a new algorithm for landslide detection in the plateau environment. The YOLOv4 was used as the basic framework, and the MobileNetv3 model was utilized as the feature extraction network to replace the backbone neural network CSPdarknet53 which was to improve the efficiency of landslide detection. By applying depth separable convolution, the parameters of the model are decreasing significantly. To further improve the accuracy of landslide detection, the coordinate attention mechanism was introduced in the bottleneck. 3070 landslide images in the Linzhi area from 2010 to 2019 were obtained through Google Earth to train and test the model. On this basis, we compared the detection speed and accuracy of other single-stage and two-stage target detection algorithms in landslide detection. Moreover, the performances of the model were analyzed under the different attention mechanisms. The results show that our model can reduce the number of parameters by 83.59% compared with the YOLOv4 model. The accuracy of landslide detection by the model is improved to 91.2%, and the detection rate reaches 35f/s. It means that the model proposed in this study would provide useful information and rapid detection for hazard assessment and emergency rescue.

TI  - Surface urban heat island detected by all-weather satellite land surface temperature
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the existing satellite thermal infrared (TIR) land surface temperature (LST) is susceptible to cloud contamination and other factors, surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies based on TIR LST are limited to clear-sky conditions and are not representative of SUHI under all-weather conditions, which result in a possible clear-sky bias for SUHI. This study introduces a newly released 1-km all-weather LST product (TRIMS LST), which is spatiotemporally seamless, to investigate the real SUHI under all-weather conditions for five megacities (i.e. Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu) in China. Firstly, this study compares TRIMS SUHI with MODIS SUHI under clear-sky, partial-cloudy, and cloudy conditions. Secondly, the extent of the influence of cloudiness on SUHI is quantified. Finally, the monthly TRIMS SUHI is used to analyze the clear-sky bias that is caused by using only clear-sky data for the SUHI. Results indicate that (i) the absence of pixel data leads to negative offsets in the SUHI intensities calculated by MODIS LST, and these offsets expand gradually with increases in the number of missing-pixel data, causing the maximum offset to reach -1.83 degrees C under cloudy conditions in Chengdu; (ii) cloud can mitigate the SUHI for most cities: when the cloud coverage in Guangzhou reaches 90-100%, the daytime SUHI intensity decreases from 2.66 degrees C for clear-sky conditions to 1.70 degrees C; the mitigating effect differs at daytime and nighttime; and (iii) clear-sky bias varies significantly across climate zones and seasons, with a varying range of-1.6-1.2 degrees C for the five selected cities.

TI  - Bi-modal near-infrared fluorescence and ultrasound imaging via a transparent ultrasound transducer for sentinel lymph node localization
T2  - OPTICS LETTERS

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy with an indocyanine green-based near-infrared fluorescence imaging system avoids the shortcomings of using a radioisotope or a combination of a blue dye and a radioactive tracer. To improve surgical precision, recent research has provided a depth profile of the sentinel lymph node by fusing fluorescence and ultrasound imaging. Here, we present a combined near-infrared fluorescence and ultrasound imaging system based on a transparent ultrasound transducer. The transparent ultrasound transducer enables seamless coaxial alignment of the fluorescence and ultrasound beam paths, allowing bi-modal observation of a single region of interest. Further, we demonstrate that the sentinel lymph node of mice injected with indocyanine green can be successfully localized and dissected based on information from the bi-modal imaging system.

The extent to which this treatment gap affects patients with diabetes is unclear. This study aimed to compare the risk of secondary fractures and rates of osteoporosis diagnosis and management after sentinel fractures in patients with and without diabetes. Methods: A propensity score-matched cohort study was conducted using the PearlDiver database. Patients aged 50 years and older with primary fragility fractures of the hip, wrist, spine, pelvis, humerus, and other locations were identified. Rates of secondary fractures, dual radiograph absorptiometry (DXA) scans, charted osteoporosis diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions), and osteoporosis pharmacotherapy within 2 years were compared for patients with and without diabetes using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Matching yielded 27,052 patients in each cohort. Index humerus fractures were more common in the diabetic cohort (15.0% versus 11.6%, P < 0.001), whereas wrist fractures were more prevalent among the nondiabetic cohort (15.2% versus 19.3%, P < 0.001). Incidence of secondary fractures at 2 years was higher for diabetic patients than nondiabetic patients (5.2% versus 4.7%; odds ratio [OR] 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99 to 1.17). Diabetic patients were significantly less likely to receive a DXA scan (13.2% versus 13.5%; OR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.98), be diagnosed with osteoporosis (9.3% versus 11.9%; OR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.82), or start pharmacotherapy (8.1% versus 8.7; OR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.99). Conclusion: Despite diabetes being a well-established risk factor for fragility fractures, diabetic patients were significantly less likely to receive DXA scan evaluation, be formally diagnosed with osteoporosis, or be treated with osteoporosis pharmacotherapy after a sentinel fragility fracture. Incidence of secondary fractures within 2 years was also higher among diabetic patients.

M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVETo evaluate ultrasound-guided placement of an anchor wire (AW) or injection of methylene blue (MB) to aid in the intraoperative localization of peripheral lymph nodes in dogs and cats.ANIMALS125 dogs and 10 cats with a total of 171 lymphadenectomies.PROCEDURESMedical records of dogs and cats that underwent peripheral lymphadenectomies with or without (N) the AW or MB localization technique were reviewed. Data retrieved included clinical, surgical, and histologic findings. The proportions of successful lymphadenectomies, lymph node characteristics, and complications among the 3 groups were analyzed.RESULTS143 (84%) lymph nodes were successfully excised. Lymphadenectomy success was significantly affected by the localization technique, with 94% for group AW, 87% for group MB, and 72% for group N. Lymph node size was smaller in groups AW and MB, compared with group N. Duration of lymphadenectomy was shorter in group AW, compared with groups MB and N, and in group MB, compared with group N. Intra- (7%) and postoperative (10%) complications and final diagnosis did not significantly differ among groups.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCEBoth lymph node localization techniques were highly successful and reduced surgery time, compared with unassisted lymphadenectomy. Specifically, these techniques were effective for localization of normal-sized and nonpalpable lymph nodes and were efficient and practical options for peripheral lymphadenectomies, particularly for those that were small or nonpalpable.

TI  - High-resolution modeling of gaseous air pollutants over Tehran and validation with surface and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the question of how skillful regional air quality modeling can be when using downscaled globally-available emission inventories. This paper applies global datasets to prepare fine-resolution priori emission inventories for an urban area. Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), Gridded Population of the World, and output from the Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System are used to downscale the spatiotemporal resolution of global emission inventories to the finer scale. The resultant high-resolution inventory is taken as input for an off-line run of the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system to simulate the concentrations of air pollutants in Tehran during August 2018, November 2018, February 2019, and May 2019. These runs are forced with meteorology from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Retrievals of atmospheric composition from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and surface measurements (split into 'road' or 'city' type stations) are used to compare with the modeled concentrations of NO2, CO, and O-3 to assess the capability of the applied modeling framework and emission inventories in concentration estimations.Comparison of modeled NO2 concentration with NO2 tropospheric column shows that the model captures the spatial and temporal distribution with Pearson correlation above 0.7 and 0.6, respectively and absolute bias under 0.08 ppb. The offline WRF-CMAQ simulations overestimate surface measurements of NO2 and CO and underestimate O-3. The model captures the diurnal variations for NO2, CO, and O-3 with a correlation between 0.7 and 0.91, 0.6-0.8, and 0.5-0.98 and absolute bias less than 69 ppb, 1.15 ppm, and 12.5 ppb, respectively. The overall performance of the observing and modeling system is sufficient for a credible inversion of surface emissions, which is the intended purpose of this modeling set-up.

TI  - Characteristic dissimilarities during high aerosol loading days between western and eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the long-term (2003-2019) variations of high aerosol loading days and their radiative impacts over the western Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and eastern IGP during pre-monsoon season (March-April-May-June). The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) climatology from MODIS (Terra and Aqua) and MERRA-2 reanalysis shows high aerosol burden across the IGP region during the pre-monsoon season. The high aerosol loading days are identified based on a standardized AOD anomaly approach, from MODIS and MERRA-2. The frequency of high aerosol loading days over the western IGP is roughly twice that of the total number of high aerosol loading days over the eastern IGP. The area-averaged percentage differences in AOD between high aerosol loading days and normal days over western IGP is always higher, about 6-8%, than eastern IGP from Terra, Aqua and MERRA-2. The natural (mainly dust) and anthropogenic aerosols (particularly sulfate, black carbon and organic carbon) are majorly contributed to total AOD over western IGP and eastern IGP. Furthermore, the MERRA-2 and ERA5 composite surface and 850 hPa wind anomalies show that strong westerly winds dominate, transporting dust aerosols from arid regions to the western IGP. On the other hand, weak prevailing winds and background pre-monsoonal cyclonic circulations over eastern IGP favor the accumulation of regionally emitted aerosols. During high aerosol loading days, the decrease in ventilation coefficient indicates the high aerosol burden (less dispersion) over both the regions, leading to the deterioration of air quality. The enhanced aerosol loading induced potential atmospheric radiative forcing (19.78 Wm(-2) over western IGP and 20.77 Wm(-2) over eastern IGP) during high aerosol loading days compared to normal days (11.12 Wm(-2) and 12.9 Wm(-2)).

TI  - Quantifying the impact of biomass burning and dust storm activities on aerosol characteristics over the Indo-Gangetic Basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The high aerosol loading over the entire Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) region in the northern India attracted attentions of scientific community especially when about 900 million people living in the areas suffered with poor air quality due to intense fog, haze and smog during the post-monsoon/winter period and dust storm activity during the summer period. The present study focused on first long-term comparative study to quantify the aerosol characteristics during the biomass burning (October-November) and dusty (April-June) periods using satellite measurements from 2004-2018 at three different locations: Jaipur, Kanpur and Ballia over IGB. The highest aerosol optical depth (AOD) values for the biomass (0.74 & PLUSMN; 0.35) and dusty period (0.63 & PLUSMN; 0.34) were observed at Kanpur during the entire study period. The finer particles were found to be dominant during the biomass period at all the locations. During the biomass burning period, an increased AOD trend was observed at Ballia (0.017 year(-1)), followed by Kanpur (0.0144 year (-1)) and Jaipur (0.0061 year(-1)) whereas during the dusty period, an increasing trend was observed at Ballia (0.0074 year(-1)) and decreasing trend over Jaipur (-0.0132 year(-1)) and Kanpur (-0.0083 year(-1)). During the biomass burning period, anthropogenic aerosol (AA) types were found to be dominant over Kanpur (52%) and Ballia (56%) while clean condition (CC) aerosol type was dominant over Jaipur (69%). On the other hand, during dusty period, the highest contribution of desert dust (DD) was observed at Kanpur (37%) and Ballia (30%); however, CC type of aerosol dominated over Jaipur (42%). The potential source sectors and the transport pathways of pollutants have been widely characterized at all the stations using the potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analyses with the backward air mass trajectories. Results revealed that the high levels of aerosol over the stations are mainly from the local areas and also from the upper and middle IGB region.

TI  - Remote sensing-based structural and functional assessments of Phragmites australis diebacks in the Mississippi River Delta
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lower Mississippi River Delta (MRD) is dominated by Phragmites australis which provides a stabilizing force, protecting marsh communities from erosion and storm-related impacts. The MRD has experienced recent die-offs of Phragmites stands, which have coincided with a number of abiotic (hurricane and water-level) and biotic (Phragmites scale) stressors. During this event, previously healthy stands have died or experienced stunted growth, resulting in conversion to replacement species or to open water. This study utilized remote sensing methods to (1) evaluate changes in Phragmites health and distribution in the MRD through time; (2) assess changes in plant cover and floristic quality before, during, and after the dieback event; (3) evaluate changes in landscape patterns (i.e., percentage of landscape, patch density, total edge, and aggregation index); and (4) evaluate changes in channel length and width as a function of the dieback event. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data showed an active delta landscape with below typical plant biomass/health in periods of hurricane and dieback impacts, with recovery to health values more typical for the MRD after the dieback event. Vegetation species level assessments showed the MRD landscape experienced decreasing coverage and floristic quality during the disturbance periods, and low and nominally increasing vegetation cover and quality through the dieback and recovery periods. Landscape metrics showed similar trends, where wetland areas that experienced event-related stress during the hurricane and dieback periods, showed some level of rebound during the recovery period. And finally, bank-line change analyses showed a significant increase in the rate of shortening and widening of the Mississippi River Passes since the die-back event began. This study serves as a methodological basis for deriving vegetation trend assessments and integrating those results with landscape metrics to prioritize areas of interest; all of which are essential for effective management and mitigation of aquatic nuisance vegetation.

TI  - Agroecology and spirituality: reflections about an unrecognized link
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroecologists mainly work with producers from traditional cultures. Ethno-ecological studies conducted in recent decades, clearly demonstrate that the experience these cultures have accumulated can be defined as wisdom, formed as a complex integrating a set of beliefs that lead to a worldview (an ontological dimension), a repertoire of knowledge (an epistemological dimension), and a series of practices (a productive dimension). So far, agroecology has addressed two of these three dimensions interacting with traditional producers (the epistemological and productive dimensions) and, with few exceptions, has neglected the ontological dimension. This paper sets forth the thesis that the ontological perspective leads to spirituality, a theme that has been excluded. Recognizing and integrating spirituality into agroecological practice would reinforce agroecology as a socially and environmentally liberating activity, since it embraces key concepts such as Mother Earth and Harmonious Living (buen vivir, the indigenous principle of harmonizing with the whole of nature).

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of maize drought stress and their effects on biomass in the Northeast and North China Plain from 2000 to 2019
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are characterized by limited water resources and extreme arid climates and have a notable influence on crop yield and food security. Therefore, evaluating the crop drought stress at a large spatiotemporal scale is important. In this study, maize planting areas in the Northeast China Plain (NECP) and North China Plain (NCP) over the past 20 years (2000-2019) were identified from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index, comprising 8-day time-series moving windows. The temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) was retrieved using the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature datasets to evaluate maize drought. Furthermore, by combining MODIS NDVI with measured meteorological data, monthly net primary productivity (NPP) was retrieved based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) to characterize the maize biomass. Thus, the weight of drought stress in different growth stages of maize was obtained by combining the maize phenological information with TVDI and NPP. Moreover, TVDIdrought stress was obtained to comprehensively assess maize drought stress. Finally, we fitted TVDIdrought stress with NPP to establish a conceptual model for the response of maize biomass to drought stress in the NCP and NECP at a large spatiotemporal scale for the first time. The conceptual model revealed that the phenomenon of excessive moisture during maize growth was not evident (TVDIdrought stress < 0.375) and that most maize plants were still affected by drought stress (TVDIdrought stress > 0.375) in the NECP. Correspondingly, in the NCP, there was hardly any excessive moisture, and maize exhibited a certain resistance to low-intensity drought stress (TVDIdrought stress was approximately 0.330). However, after the drought stress exceeded the tolerance range (TVDIdrought stress > 0.375), the maize biomass was significantly affected by drought stress. Our findings illustrate the two response models of drought stress in the major maize producing areas of China for the first time, thereby providing new insights for preventing drought stress risk and improving maize yield on a large scale.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The basement rocks around Baranis-Aswan Road, South Eastern Desert of Egypt encompasses a variety of the oldest Pan-African rock units including medium-grade hornblende schist, a variety of gneisses and migmatite as well as medium-to low-grade metavolcanics. These were intruded by syn-to late tectonic tonalite, granodiorite, quartz diorite as well as gabbros. The exposed basement rock units in the area were discriminated with the detailed lithological mapping using the processed data of ASTER, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Spectral signatures of these rocks were achieved by ASD TerraSpec Halo mineral identifier device. Petrography and geochemistry data enabled to put constraints on their petrogenesis. Geochemically, the schist and gneisses imply K-poor mafic igneous precursors that were developed in a primitive juvenile oceanic environment. The migmatite pertains to stromatic type, whereas granitic magma (neosome) was injected in hornblende schist (paleosome) through cleavage planes. The syn-tectonic tonalite to quartz diorite are also low-K, non-mature calc-alkaline rocks and pertain to oceanic plagiogranite. They display a continuous fractionation evolution trend from quartz-diorite to tonalite and granodiorite. (c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - An improved typical meteorological year for solar energy simulations in Rarotonga, Cook Islands
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Many of the Pacific's small island-nations have traditionally used diesel generators in the operation of their electricity grids. That said, more recently there has been a move towards greater use of renewable energy sources for electricity, in particular solar energy. A challenge to this, however, is ensuring that there is appropriate typical meteorological year data to facilitate an understanding of the output from these systems (especially at utility scale). Although there are numerous typical meteorological year datasets for the Pacific island-nations many of these are based on satellite inferred data. In this study, a typical meteorological year was developed for the island of Rarotonga, Cook Islands, using ground-based measurements. When compared to an existing typical meteorological year derived from satellite data, it was found that the satellite significantly overpredicted global horizontal irradiation for much of the year. This over-prediction was found to be due, at least in part, to the satellite data not resolving the effect of water in the atmosphere, (clouds and rainfall) on the solar irradiation correctly. On this basis, it demonstrates that although typical meteorological year derived from satellite data are a useful starting point for energy simulations in the Pacific island-nations, there is a need to improve these datasets to support their transition to renewable electricity generation.

TI  - Assessing the influence of urban greenness and green stormwater infrastructure on hydrology from satellite remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI), which includes features like rain gardens, constructed wetlands, or urban tree canopy, is now widely recognized as a means to reduce urban runoff impacts and meet municipal water quality permit requirements. Many co-benefits of GSI are related to increased vegetative cover, which can be measured with satellite imagery via spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In urban landscapes, there remain critical gaps in understanding how urban greenness and GSI influence hydrology. Here, we quantify these relationships to assess the feasibility of tracking the effectiveness of urban greening for improving downstream hydrologic conditions. We combined hydrologic data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauges with an NDVI time series (1985-2019) derived from Landsat satellite imagery, and synthesis of GSI implementation data from a set of 372 urbanized watersheds across the United States. We used a multivariate panel modeling approach to account for spatial and time varying factors (rainfall, temperature, urban cover expansion) in an effort to isolate the relationships of interest. After accounting for expansion of urban boundaries, only 32 watersheds (9%) showed significant greenness trends, a majority of which were reductions. Urban greenness had significant influences on downstream flow responses, so that on average, a 10% greenness increase showed a corresponding reduction of total flow (-3.8%), flow variance (-7.7%), peak flows (-4.7%), high flows (-7.6%), flashiness (-2.2%), and high flow frequency (-1.5%); and a corresponding increase in baseflow (4.3%). For a subset of these watersheds for which GSI data were available (n = 48), the level of GSI implementation showed a significant, but weak influence on urban greenness with a 20% increase in BMP density corresponding to a greenness increase of 0.9%. The study results may support valuation and verification of GSI co-benefits in urbanized landscapes at the watershed scale.

TI  - Telomere length in relation to persistent organic pollutant exposure in white-tailed eagle (<i>Haliaeetus albicilla</i>) nestlings from Sweden sampled in 1995-2013
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Telomeres are used as biomarkers of vertebrate health because of the link between their length, lifespan, and survival. Exposure to environmental stressors appears to alter telomere dynamics, but little is known about telomere length and persistent organic pollutant (POP) exposure in wildlife. The white-tailed eagle (WTE; Haliaeetus albicilla) is an avian top predator that accumulates high levels of POPs and may subsequently suffer adverse health effects. Here we study the Baltic WTE population that is well documented to have been exposed to large contaminant burdens, thereby making it a promising candidate species for analyzing pollutant-mediated effects on telomeres. We investigated telomere lengths in WTE nestlings (n = 168) over 19 years and examined legacy POP concentrations (organochlorines and polybrominated diphenyl ethers) in whole blood and serum as potential drivers of differences in telomere length. Although we detected significant year-to-year variations in telomere lengths among the WTE nestlings, telomere lengths did not correlate with any of the investigated POP concentrations of several classes. Given that telomere lengths did not associate with POP contamination in the Baltic WTE nestlings, we propose that other environmental and biological factors, which likely fluctuate on a year-to-year basis, could be more important drivers of telomere lengths in this population.

TI  - Modeling effective tumor burden of primary lesion and metastatic lymph node in breast cancer patients from the SEER database
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Characterizing the role of the primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) in metastasis progression can provide a rational basis for effective local control and systemic treatments. Methods: We employed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to perform survival analysis and modeling to estimate breast cancer (BC) progression in both untreated and treated patients. Effective tumor burden was defined as the number of cancer cells that can lead to distant metastasis. Quantified analysis was conducted for primary lesion and metastatic nodes, respectively. A tumor growth model was built based on mathematical modeling: N(t) = mNT (t) nNN (t)+. In this model, the parameters "m" and "n" represent the contributions of the primary lesion and metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) to distant metastasis, respectively. Results: We found that both the primary lesion and the metastatic LNs contribute to the effective tumor burden. Through fitting the built tumor growth model, "m" in treated groups was determined to be 1, and "n" was determined to be 1.5; while in the untreated group, "m" was determined to be 1, and "n" was 0.15, which was 10 times smaller than in treated groups. Conclusions: Our study revealed that the prognostic value of the anatomic stage in BC progression varied in different historical periods, due to the development of oncological treatments. While tumor size was a significant prognostic factor in both untreated and treated patients, the prognostic value of nodal status was only significant in patients who received locoregional treatment and systemic treatment.

TI  - Application of Non-stationary Extreme Value Analysis to Satellite-Observed Sea Surface Temperature Data for Past Decades
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme value analysis (EVA) has been extensively used to understand and predict long-term return extreme values. This study provides the first approach to EVA using satellite-observed sea surface temperature (SST) data over the past decades. Representative EVA methods were compared to select an appropriate method to derive SST extremes of the East/Japan Sea (EJS). As a result, the peaks-over-threshold (POT) method showed better performance than the other methods. The Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) database was used to calculate the 100-year-return SST values in the EJS. The calculated SST extremes were 1.60-3.44 degrees C higher than the average value of the upper 5th-percentile satellite-observed SSTs over the past decades (1982-2018). The monthly distribution of the SST extremes was similar to the known seasonal variation of SSTs in the EJS, but enhanced extreme SSTs exceeding 2 degrees C appeared in early summer and late autumn. The calculated 100-year-return SSTs were compared with the simulation results of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) climate model. As a result, the extreme SSTs were slightly smaller than the maximum SSTs of the model data with a negative bias of -0.36 degrees C. This study suggests that the POT method can improve our understanding of future oceanic warming based on statistical approaches using SSTs observed by satellites over the past decades.

TI  - Precise orbit determination for LEO satellites: single-receiver ambiguity resolution using GREAT products
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the large Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations have become a hot topic due to their great potential to improve the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) positioning performance. One of the important focus is how to obtain the accurate and reliable orbits for these constellations with dozens of LEO satellites. The GNSS-based Precise Orbit Determination (POD) will be exclusively performed to achieve this goal, where the Integer Ambiguity Resolution (IAR) plays a key role in acquiring high-quality orbits. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the benefit of the single-receiver IAR in LEO POD and discuss its implication for the future LEO constellations. We perform ambiguity-fixed LEO POD for four typical missions, including Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Follow-On (GRACE-FO), Swarm, Jason-3 and Sentinel-3, using the Uncalibrated Phase Delay (UPD) products generated by our GREAT (GNSS+ REsearch, Application and Teaching) software. The results show that the ambiguity fixing processing can significantly improve the accuracy of LEO orbits. There are negligible differences between our UPD-based ambiguity-fixed orbits and those based on the Observable Signal Bias (OSB) and Integer Recovery Clock (IRC) products, indicating the good-quality of UPD products we generated. Compared to the float solution, the fixed solution presents a better consistency with the external precise science orbits and the largest accuracy improvement of 5 mm is achieved for GRACE-FO satellites. Meanwhile, the benefit can be observed in laser ranging residuals as well, with a Standard Deviation (STD) reduction of 3-4 mm on average for the fixed solutions. Apart from the absolute orbits, the relative accuracy of the space baseline is also improved by 20-30% in the fixed solutions. The result demonstrates the superior performance of the ambiguity-fixed LEO POD, which appears as a particularly promising technique for POD of future LEO constellations.

TI  - Estimation of land subsidence hazard using interferometry of satellite radar images
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-FORENSIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased exploitation of underground resources compared is one of the main reasons for subsidence. Subsidence causes infrastructure damage and ultimately leads to increased risk to society and the economy. In some areas of Iran recently, buildings, runways, bridges, tunnels, streets, railways and roads have been severely damaged. In this study, the amount of land subsidence was analysed in the western region of Kerman city using interferometry of radar images of Sentinel-1 satellite data from 2014 to 2020 in Sentinel's Application Platform software. Results show that the subsidence rate in the area changed between 3.3 cm to 13.2 cm, confirms a significant increase. Field studies indicate that increased utilisation of groundwater resources, compaction due to ground drainage and imposition of heavy loads can all cause subsidence, which in turn rate leads to huge damage to infrastructure.

TI  - Risk assessment of coastal erosion for Odisha coast along Bay of Bengal, India using coastal hazard wheel model
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper makes an assessment of the coastal erosion hazard of the Odisha state with the use of 'Coastal Hazard Wheel' methodology which is a multi-hazard assessment as well as a management tool in a changing global climate. This study analyses the coastal environment to assess the vulnerability profile of coastal erosion by using bio-geophysical parameters such as geological layout, tidal range, exposure to waves, balance or deficit of sediments, characteristics of flora and fauna and exposure to storm climate. These are also used in analysing climate change hazards of the coast which are inherent to an area like saline flooding, gradual inundation, ecosystem disruption and salt water intrusion. CHW framework has generated information about the degree to which coastal erosion is inherent in a particular coastal location along the coast. This application has used remote sensing data from the public domain and a GIS approach to screen the problem with an appropriate scale as suitable for regional and national planning purposes with a management perspective because of limited data availability. The study has generated coastal erosion data and maps for the 480 km of the coastline dividing the coast in to 14 different morphological segments. Assessment of this hazard shows that 50 percent of Odisha's coastline is vulnerable to a high or very high inherent hazard of erosion, 45 percent exhibits a lower level of erosion presence and 5 percent is moderately vulnerable to erosion. This study has revealed increasing magnitude of coastal erosion than previous assessments by different researchers which were mostly based on coastal vulnerability indices. The study also identifies a number of possible erosion hazard management and mitigation options which can be used depending on their location specific field data and coastal characteristics. The finding of the study is significant in view of its contribution towards a first step in understanding coastal erosion at the regional level for their management. However, input of local data and manmade structures along the coast in the model would enhance the results for the site-specific mitigation measures.

TI  - Hyperspectral Satellite Remote Sensing of Aerosol Parameters: Sensitivity Analysis and Application to TROPOMI/S5P
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise knowledge about aerosols in the lower atmosphere (optical properties and vertical distribution) is particularly important for studying the Earth's climatic and weather conditions. Measurements from satellite sensors in sun-synchronous and geostationary orbits can be used to map distributions of aerosol parameters in global or regional scales. The new-generation sensor Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) measures a wide variety of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols that are associated with climate change and air quality using a number of spectral bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. In this study, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the forward model parameters and instrument information that are associated with the retrieval accuracy of aerosol layer height (ALH) and optical depth (AOD) using the oxygen (O-2) A-band. Retrieval of aerosol parameters from hyperspectral satellite measurements requires accurate surface representation and parameterization of aerosol microphysical properties and precise radiative transfer calculations. Most potential error sources arising from satellite retrievals of aerosol parameters, including uncertainties in aerosol models, surface properties, solar/satellite viewing geometry, and wavelength shift, are analyzed. The impact of surface albedo accuracy on retrieval results can be dramatic when surface albedo values are close to the critical surface albedo. An application to the real measurements of two scenes indicates that the retrieval works reasonably in terms of retrieved quantities and fit residuals.

TI  - Green space dynamics in response to rapid urbanization: Patterns, transformations and topographic influence in Chattogram city, Bangladesh
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Green spaces have become an essential part of urban development due to the numerous ecosystem services they provide. Rapid urbanization in developing countries like Bangladesh has created enormous pressure on green spaces. The study investigated the changing pattern of green spaces resulting from unplanned urbanization in Chattogram city and how the topographic gradients of elevation and slope influence the change. Landsat TM and Landsat OLI data from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 were used to produce land use/land cover maps. ASTER digital elevation model was used to derive topographic attributes of elevation and slope. Supervised image classification with maximum likelihood classification algorithm was applied for land use/land cover classification using ArcGIS 10.3. Five land use/land cover types were identified with an overall accuracy of 90% and kappa statistics of 87.3. Changes along topographic gradients were assessed in the GIS environment using overlay analysis. The results show that area coverage of green spaces decreased from 68.34% in 1990 to 36.51% in 2020. The study found a decrease in all green spaces-forest cover (9.9%), agricultural land (7.6%) and vegetation cover (14.3%) from 1990 to 2020. The decrease of green spaces was mainly due to the expansion of built-up areas, about 51.32 km2 area of green spaces were transformed into built-up areas during the period. The changes mostly occurred along low to moderate elevation (0-26 m) and gentle to moderate slope (0-15%) gradients. Green spaces decreased along all topographic gradients but the decreasing trend of forest cover was relatively low in high to very high elevation (26-88 m) and steep to very steep slope (15-66%) gradients. Such a setting can be used to expand forest cover in areas with similar topographic conditions. Built-up areas increased along all topographic gradients, increasing the risk of land degradation. The study has the potential to provide practical information to the local planners for sustainable land use management in Chattogram city.
