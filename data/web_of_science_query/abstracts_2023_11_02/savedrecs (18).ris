AB  - The present paper deals with the issues of formation of the concept of NATURE in linguistic consciousness of a schoolchild, since it is exactly in childhood and adolescence that the worldview of surrounding reality emerges. The authors consider the topics of the semantic range and cultural significance of the concept NATURE in the Russian linguistic picture of the world of a child and adolescent. The study reveals and describes the dependence of conceptual content of consciousness on the real environment of existence of a modern child and adolescent assuming that the consequence of fragmentation of the world and "digitalization" of activity via formation of the clip thinking is a gradual loss of deep connections between the concept and related associative phenomena. The conclusions are based on polyparametric analysis of the data of the free associative experiments by means of definitive interpretation of values, comparative analysis and statistical processing of data, observation and description. The authors associate the prospects of the conducted research with a further study of the concept NATURE in different types of discourse in comparison with the eco-concept ENVIRONMENT. In terms of the given paper the eco-concept represents a multidimensional mental unit, having different forms of linguistic expression and possessing emotional, personal, natural, and cultural components. The potential for studying the raised issues in scientific, methodological and didactic aspects is due to the fact that ecological knowledge is a constantly evolving system, supplemented from outside.

TI  - Dimensionality-Transformed Remote Sensing Data Application to Map Soil Salinization at Lowlands of the Syr Darya River
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of saving soil resources and their reclamation measures under current climate change conditions attracts the world community's close attention. It is relevant in the Syr Darya River's lowlands, where the secondary soil salinization processes have intensified. The demand for robust methods to assess soil salinity is high, and the primary purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative analysis method for soil salinity estimation. We found a correspondence between the sum of salts in a topsoil layer to the Landsat 8 data in the Tasseled cap transformation of the image values. After testing several methods, we built a prediction model. The K-nearest neighborhood (KNN) model with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.96 using selected predictors proved to be the most appropriate for soil salinity assessment. We also performed a quantitative assessment of soil salinity. A significant increase in a salt-affected area and the mean soil sum expressing an intensification of secondary soil salinization from 2018 to 2021 was found. The increasing temperature values, decreasing soil moisture, and agricultural use affect the extension of salt-affected ground areas in the study area. Thus, the soil moisture trend in the Qazaly irrigation zone is negative and declining, with the highest peaks in early spring. The maximum temperature has a mean value of 15.6 degrees C (minimum = -15.1 degrees C, maximum = 37.4 degrees C) with an increasing trend. These parameters are evidence of climate change that also affects soil salinization. PCA transformation of the Landsat-8 satellite images helped to remove redundant spectral information from multiband datasets and map soil salinity more precisely. This approach simultaneously extends mapping opportunities involving visible and invisible bands and results in a smaller dataset.

TI  - Open data application to evaluate exposure of wildfire to water resources: A case study in Johor, Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change impacts wildfire events as well as water availability. Exposure of water resources to wildfire can reduce water quality supplied to humans and resulting health problems. On the other hand, water resources such as rivers and ponds are essential in wildfire firefighting. This paper intended to assess spatially the exposure of water resources to wildfire. A case study in Johor, Malaysia is utilised to asses and determine locations of water bodies in an area which are vulnerable to wildfire. Post wildfire runoff water can contaminate water resources. Fire data collected by MODIS from 2000-2020 are used to create a hotspot map. Water resources and waterbody data originated from Department of Surveying and Mapping Malaysia used to identify the stream and dams that are exposed to wildfire. 5 class exposure level has been set to show the degree of closeness of water resources to wildfire hotspot area. Using the spatial analysis method, low to high level of potential wildfire-water exposures were able to be locate. Analysis shows, 7% of Johor's water sources is exposed to medium levels of wildfire, while just 1% is exposed to the highest levels. The majority of the streams have very low levels of exposure. In addition, the wildfire-water exposure map aids in first respondent preparedness and planning.

TI  - Variability of Water Use Efficiency Associated with Climate Change in the Extreme West of Bahia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water has become more important in agricultural implementations over the years, as has the need for water management. Thus, Water Use Efficiency (WUE) has been used as an alternative form of detecting the variability of water management based on the carbon-water cycle. The study aimed to map and quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of WUE based on its interactions with environmental changes. It focused on an agricultural area in the westernmost region of Bahia, Northeast Brazil (NEB). For WUE estimation, data from Collection 6 MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Evapotranspiration (ET) products with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees were obtained from the Earth Explorer website. Subsequently, annual WUE anomalies were calculated based on the 2001-2019 period. The results obtained indicated that the highest values of GPP (580 gC/m(2)), ET (3000 mm), and WUE (3.5 gC/mm center dot m(2)) occurred in agricultural areas, associated with cultural treatments and insertion of irrigation, which helped in the higher WUE values and consequently increased agricultural productivity in the study region. In addition, there was a marked influence of the phases of the climate variability mode-El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-on the annual variability of the WUE, with a reduction of 96% during the La Nina of 2016 (an increase of 89% during El Nino of 2005). During El Ninos, vegetation had greater efficiency resulting from the adaptation of vegetation in maintaining the carbon-water balance, using water more efficiently. However, unlike Las Ninas, with excessive precipitation there is an interference in the WUE, which interferes with the absorption of radiation and nutrients for the biophysical processes of vegetation and agriculture and, consequently, agricultural production. The use of WUE for agriculture is extremely important, especially for Brazil and countries with an economy based on primary production. This information on the way vegetation (native or agricultural) responds to interactions with the environment aids in decision-making about water management, possibly lowering losses or agricultural damage caused by a lack of water.

TI  - Epidemiology and clinical features of malignant melanoma. Analysis of 274 cases
T2  - REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma (MM) is the most fatal cutaneous neoplasm. Its incidence is increasing progressively, which cannot be explained only by early diagnosis. Chilean population, due to the geography of the country, has a very varied solar exposure. Aim: To know the incidence of MM in a Chilean population, according to the level of sun exposure and to describe its clinical and histopathological characteristics. Material and Methods: Two hundred seventy-four surgeries for malignant melanoma with histological confirmation, carried out between 2016 and 2018 in an oncological institute were included. Results: The annualized incidence of MM was 13.83 cases per 100,000 people over 15 years of age in the 2016-2018 period. The geographical distribution of the incidence did not have a clear relationship with sun exposure. The most frequent locations of the primary lesions were trunk, head/neck and lower limb. Sixty-one per cent of cases were invasive MM; lesion thickness and presence of ulceration were associated with a higher risk of sentinel node involvement. Conclusions: No association between the level of sun exposure and the incidence of MM was observed in this study.

TI  - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition for the Analysis of 2D/3D Remote Sensing Data in Geoscience: A Survey
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Historically, geoscience has been a prominent domain for applications of computer vision and pattern recognition. The numerous challenges associated with geoscience-related imaging data, which include poor imaging quality, noise, missing values, lack of precise boundaries defining various geoscience objects and processes, as well as non-stationarity in space and/or time, provide an ideal test bed for advanced computer vision techniques. On the other hand, the developments in pattern recognition, especially with the rapid evolution of powerful graphical processing units (GPUs) and the subsequent deep learning breakthrough, enable valuable computational tools, which can aid geoscientists in important problems, such as land cover mapping, target detection, pattern mining in imaging data, boundary extraction and change detection. In this landscape, classical computer vision approaches, such as active contours, superpixels, or descriptor-guided classification, provide alternatives that remain relevant when domain expert labelling of large sample collections is often not feasible. This issue persists, despite efforts for the standardization of geoscience datasets, such as Microsoft's effort for AI on Earth, or Google Earth. This work covers developments in applications of computer vision and pattern recognition on geoscience-related imaging data, following both pre-deep learning and post-deep learning paradigms. Various imaging modalities are addressed, including: multispectral images, hyperspectral images (HSIs), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, point clouds obtained from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors or digital elevation models (DEMs).

TI  - Satellite based lake bed elevation model of Lake Urmia using time series of Landsat imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a lake bed elevation model of Lake Urmia. In the course of model generation, a time series of the extent of the lake surface was derived from 129 satellite images with different acquisition dates based on the Landsat sensors Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Due to the rapid shrinking of the lake during the last two decades, lake surface areas ranging from 890 km(2) to 6125 km(2) could be covered. The water edge of the various lake extents was then linked to the observed water level on the day of the satellite image acquisition. The resulting contour lines, covering water levels between 1270.04 m and 1278.42 m a.s.l. and thus representing the lakebed morphology in its shallow parts, were merged with existing data (deeper parts) and interpolated to generate a lake bed elevation model. Finally, Lake Urmia's Level-Area-Volume relationships were derived from the lake bed elevation model and compared to bathymetric data previously published. (C) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluating the Potential of Landsat Satellite Data to Monitor the Effectiveness of Measures to Mitigate Urban Heat Islands: A Case Study for Stuttgart (Germany)
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect is a serious health risk for people living in cities and thus calls for effective mitigation strategies in urban areas. Satellite data enable monitoring of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) over large areas at high spatial resolution. Here we analysed SUHI in the city of Stuttgart (Germany) based on land surface temperature (LST) data from Landsat at 30 m resolution. The overall SUHI in Stuttgart decreased by 1.4 degrees C between the investigated time periods 2004-2008 and 2016-2020, while the absolute LST increased by 2.5 degrees C. We identified local hotspots of strong warming and cooling in Stuttgart through the change in SUHI and categorised them based on the predominant land cover change occurring at the hotspot using the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat as well as visual information on land cover changes from Google Earth Pro. The establishment of green roofs, as well as albedo changes, are predominantly responsible for cooling spots, while warming spots are mostly associated with the sealing of surfaces. This highlights that vegetation has a dominant influence on SUHI development in Stuttgart. Combining satellite-based LST data with visual information thus provides an effective method to identify local warming and cooling hotspots, which allows monitoring of the success of city policies against heat stress and guides future policy.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kaledupa Atoll is one of the areas designated as a marine protection zone and local use zone in Wakatobi National Park. Spatial information on the benthic habitat of Kaledupa Atoll is very limited so that this information is expected to be a support in strategies and efforts to conserve marine biodiversity. This study aims to map the benthic habitat of Kaledupa Atoll using a pixel-based and object-based guided classification method/OBIA with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The data used is the Sentinel-2 satellite image with a spatial resolution of 10 x10 m which was acquired on November 4, 2019. Observations of benthic habitats were carried out directly at the study site by placing quadrant transects and taking points on the dominant or homogeneous habitat area. The transect used is 100 x 100 cm2. Image classification uses thematic layer input from field data. The results of the classification of benthic habitats are grouped into six classes. Based on the OBIA method, benthic habitats can be mapped with an accuracy rate of 78.1%, while the pixel-based classification has an overall accuracy of 61.8%. Classification of benthic habitats with the SVM algorithm using the OBIA method provides better information than the pixel-based method.

TI  - Multi-Dimensional Data Fusion for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) Using Fuzzy-AHP Decision-Making Method, Kodegan-Basiran Region, East Iran
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing and fusing information layers of exploratory parameters is a crucial stride for increasing the accuracy of pinpointing mineral potential zones in the reconnaissance stage of mineral exploration. Remote sensing, geophysical, geochemical, and geology data were analyzed and fused for identify metallic mineralization in the Kodegan-Basiran region (East Iran). Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), aeromagnetic data, geological data, and geochemical stream sediment samples were utilized. The study area contains some copper indices and mines. Thus, the main focus of this study was identifying the zones with high potential for metallic copper mineralization. A two-stage methodology was implemented in this study: First, extraction of the exploratory parameters related to metallic mineralization and second is data fusion by the hybrid fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (Fuzzy-AHP) method. Hydrothermal alterations and iron oxides in the area were mapped by applying the optimum index factor (OIF), band ratio (BR), and least squared fit (LS-Fit) to ETM+ data. Intrusive masses were positioned as one of the effective parameters in identifying metallic mineralization zones using the gradient tensor method to assess aeromagnetic data. In order to determine the threshold concentration and the location of mineralization anomalies, the K-means clustering algorithm, vertical geochemical zonality (Vz) index, as well as concentration-area (C-A) multi fractal and singularity analysis were implemented on the geochemical data. In conclusion, the potential zones of metallic mineralization in the Kodegan-Basiran region were displayed in a mineral prospectivity map (MPM) derived from the Fuzzy-AHP decision-making method. Finally, to validate the prospectivity map of metallic mineralization, a control area was selected and surveyed by collecting mineralogical, petrological, and stream sediment samples. Field works confirmed the mineralization of Cu and Fe sulfides, oxides, and hydroxides. The high potential areas identified in the MPM can be considered as targets for future Cu exploration in the Kodegan-Basiran area.

TI  - Validation of Expanded Trend-to-Trend Cross-Calibration Technique and Its Application to Global Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The expanded Trend-to-Trend (T2T) cross-calibration technique has the potential to calibrate two sensors in much less time and provides trends on a daily assessment basis. The trend obtained from the expanded technique aids in evaluating the differences between satellite sensors. Therefore, this technique was validated with several trusted cross-calibration techniques to evaluate its accuracy. Initially, the expanded T2T technique was validated with three independent RadCaTS RRV, DIMITRI-PICS, and APICS models, and results show a 1% average difference with other models over all bands. Further, this technique was validated with other SDSU techniques to calibrate the newly launched satellite Landsat 9 with 8, demonstrating good agreement in all bands within 0.5%. This technique was also validated for Terra MODIS and ETM+, showing consistency within 1% for all bands compared to four PICS sites. Additionally, the T2T technique was applied to a global scale using EPICS Global sites. The expanded T2T cross-calibration gain result obtained for Landsat 8 versus Landsat 7/8, Sentinel 2A/2B, and Terra/Aqua MODIS presented that the difference between these pairs was within 0.5-1% for most of the spectral bands. Total uncertainty obtained for these pairs of sensors using Monte Carlo Simulation varies from 2.5-4% for all bands except for SWIR2 bands, which vary up to 5%. The difference between EPICS Global and EPICS North Africa was calculated using the ratio of trend gain; the difference among them was within 0.5-1% difference on average for all the sensors and bands within a 0.5% uncertainty level difference.

TI  - Large-Scale Automated Sustainability Assessment of Infrastructure Projects Using Machine Learning Algorithms with Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the magnitude, lifespan, and environmental impacts of physical infrastructures, integration of sustainability with development policies has proved to be indispensable; accordingly, several rating systems were nationally developed to enhance implementing sustainability into physical infrastructures. Lack of automation and strategic outlook of the conventional approach to infrastructures' sustainability assessment, exacerbated by the lengthy and costly processes involved, highlights the necessity of adopting comprehensive and innovative measures. This paper principally aims at extending the scope of sustainability rating systems such as Envision by proposing a framework for large-scale and automated assessment of infrastructures. Based on the proposed framework, a single model was developed incorporating remote sensing and GIS techniques alongside the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm into the Envision rating system. The proposed model adds a certain degree of automation in assessment process regarding the criterion N.W.1.2 of Envision rating system (i.e., provide wetland and surface water buffers) as a starting point toward entire automation of the Envision system. Given the quantitative scale of the criterion N.W.1.2, our model automatically extracts (1) wetlands, (2) waterbodies, and (3) roadways through Optical Satellite_Sentinel-2A, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Satellite_ALOS-1 imagery, and shapefile from Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). The image-based model then examines whether certain applicable specifications of Envision scoring system are met. The level of achievement is determined, and the final score in the criteria N.W.1.2 is calculated afterward. The results indicate that more than half of the existing road segments in the study area failed to obtain the minimum required score, regulated by Envision. This emphasizes the criticality of considering sustainability indicators in future infrastructure planning. In addition, the validated results confirm the feasibility of automation of other indicators of the Envision system that will help authorities see the bigger picture and make more sustainable decisions for future practices and policies.

TI  - Spatial Variation and Relation of Aerosol Optical Depth with LULC and Spectral Indices
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current study area (Faridabad, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddha Nagar), the aerosol concentration is very high, adversely affecting the environmental conditions and air quality. Investigating the impact of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) helps us to develop effective solutions for improving air quality. Hence, the spectral indices derived from LULC ((Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), Enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and Normalized difference build-up index (NDBI)) with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) high spatial resolution (1 km) AOD from the years 2010-2019 (less to high urbanized period) has been correlated. The current study used remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques to examine changes in LULC in the current study region over the ten years (2010-2019) and the relationship between LULC and AOD. A significant increase in built-up areas (12.18%) and grasslands (51.29%) was observed during 2010-2019, while cropland decreased by 4.42%. A positive correlation between NDBI and SAVI (0.35, 0.27) indicates that built-up soils play an important role in accumulating AOD in a semi-arid region. At the same time, a negative correlation between NDVI and EVI (-0.24, -0.15) indicates the removal of aerosols due to an increase in vegetation. The results indicate that SAVI can play an important role in PM2.5 modeling in semi-arid regions. Based on these findings, urban planners can improve land use management, air quality, and urban planning.

M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing geodetic observations (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar [InSAR] and optical correlation ["pixel tracking"]) serve an increasingly diverse and important role in earthquake monitoring and response. This study introduces the Geodetic Centroid (gCent) catalog-an earthquake catalog derived solely from space-based geodetic obser-vations-and analysis of 74 earthquakes (Mw 4.3-7.4) imaged from 1 August 2019 to 01 February 2022. For gCent, we use InSAR and optical correlation observations derived from the Sentinel-1 satellites and various publicly available optical satellites to systematically image all global earthquakes Mw 5.5 or larger and shallower than 25 km, Mw 7.0 or larger at any depth, and other high-impact earthquakes or seismic events of special interest. We invert surface displacements from successfully imaged earthquakes for the location, ori-entation, and dimensions of a single slipping fault patch that describes the centroid char-acteristics of the earthquake. These centroid models, in turn, are compiled into a catalog and used in U.S. Geological Survey/Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) operational earthquake response products such as ShakeMaps and finite-fault models. We provide a comparison of the gCent catalog to the ANSS Comprehensive Catalog and Global Centroid Moment Tensor (Global CMT) catalog to compare reported locations, depths, and magni-tudes. We find that global earthquake catalogs not only generally provide reasonably com-parable locations (within 10 km on average), but also they systematically overestimate depth that may have implications for earthquake shaking predictions based solely on earthquake origin information. Geodetic magnitudes are comparable to seismically inferred magnitudes, indicating that gCent models are unlikely to be systematically biased by the presence of postseismic deformation. We additionally highlight limitations of the gCent catalog induced by both the limitations of remote sensing imaging of earthquakes and our imposition of a simplified earthquake source description that does not include spatially distributed slip.

TI  - Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation Network for Semantic Segmentation of Land Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover semantic segmentation is an important technique in land. It is very practical in land resource protection planning, geographical classification, surveying and mapping analysis. Deep learning shows excellent performance in picture segmentation in recent years, but there are few semantic segmentation algorithms for land cover. When dealing with land cover segmentation tasks, traditional semantic segmentation networks often have disadvantages such as low segmentation precision and weak generalization due to the loss of image detail information and the limitation of weight distribution. In order to achieve high-precision land cover segmentation, this article develops a multi-scale feature aggregation network. Traditional convolutional neural network downsampling procedure has problems of detail information loss and resolution degradation; to fix these problems, a multi-scale feature extraction spatial pyramid module is made to assemble regional context data from different areas. In order to address the issue of incomplete information of traditional convolutional neural networks at multiple sizes, a multi-scale feature fusion module is developed to fuse attributes from various layers and several sizes to boost segmentation accuracy. Finally, a multi-scale convolutional attention module is presented to enhance the segmentation's attention to the target in order to address the issue that the classic convolutional neural network has low attention capacity to the building waters in land cover segmentation. Through the contrast experiment and generalization experiment, it can be clearly demonstrated that the segmentation algorithm proposed in this paper realizes the high precision segmentation of land cover.

TI  - A Novel Operational Rice Mapping Method Based on Multi-Source Satellite Images and Object-Oriented Classification
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for crop mapping has become a crucial way to improve classification accuracy, especially in cloudy and rainy areas. However, the acquisition of optical images is significantly unstable due to the influence of cloudy and rainy weather, which seriously restricts the application of this method in practice. To solve this problem, this study proposed an optical-SAR imagery-based rice mapping method which has the advantages of less dependence on optical images, easy operation and high classification accuracy. To account for the trait of sparse availability of optical images, this method only needs one clear sky optical image in the rice growth period and combined it with multi-temporal SAR images to achieve a high accuracy rice mapping result. Meanwhile, this paper also proposed a comprehensively multi-scale segmentation parameter optimization algorithm, which considers the area consistency, shape error and location difference between the segmented object and reference object, and adopts an orthogonal experiment approach. Based on the optical image, the boundaries of the parcel objects can be segmented, which were subsequently used to perform the object-oriented classification. The results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed method in Yangzhou City is 94.64%. Moreover, according to a random pick test, it is encouraging that the proposed method has strong robustness in response to the instability of the acquisition time of SAR images. A relatively high overall accuracy of 90.09% suggested that the proposed method can provide a reliable rice mapping result in cloudy and rainy areas.

TI  - Use of fluorescence imaging and indocyanine green for sentinel node mapping during gastric cancer surgery: Results of an intercontinental Delphi survey
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Understanding the extent of tumor spread to local lymph nodes is critical to managing early-stage gastric cancer. Recently, fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green has been used to identify and characterize sentinel lymph nodes during gastric cancer surgery, but no published guidelines exist. We sought to identify areas of consensus among international experts in the use of fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green for mapping sentinel lymph nodes during gastric-cancer surgery.Methods: In this 2-round, online Delphi survey, 27 international experts voted on 79 statements pertaining to patient preparation and contraindications to fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green during gastric cancer surgery; indications; technical aspects; advantages/disadvantages and limitations; and training and research. Methodological steps were adopted during survey design to minimize bias.Results: Consensus was reached on 61 of 79 statements, including giving single injections of indocyanine green into each of the 4 quadrants peritumorally, administering indocyanine green on the same day as surgery, injecting a total of 1 to 5 mL of 5 mg/mL indocyanine green, injecting endoscopically into submucosa, and repeating indocyanine green injections a second time if sentinel lymph node visualization remains inadequate. Consensus also was reached that fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green is an acceptable single-agent modality for sentinel lymph node identification and that the sentinel lymph node basin method is preferred. However, sentinel lymph node dissection should be limited to T1 gastric cancer and tumors <= 4 cm in diameter, and further research is necessary to optimize the technique and render fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph nodes dissection acceptable for routine clinical use.Conclusion: Although considerable consensus was achieved, further research is necessary before this technology should be used in routine practice.

TI  - Ethical Consciousness of University Students in the Context of Postmodernism
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes theoretical views on the development of ethical consciousness in Ukrainian university students in the context of postmodernism, using the data from quasi-experimental psycho-pedagogical measurements. The article aims to specify the process of developing structural components of ethical consciousness in Ukrainian university students, who de facto (culturally and socially) are still gaining the experience of late postmodernity. The following methods were used at the propaedeutic, quasi-experimental and resumptive levels: theoretical-methodological analysis of relevant scientific-methodical sources; selection of relevant diagnostic methods; modelling of educational conditions; psychodiagnostic methods; methods of mathematical statistics; summarization. The necessary data were collected, with the observance of all ethical norms, at the premises of Ukrainian higher education institutions, with the participation of 280 students-respondents (Years 1-5) who major in the humanities and technology. The obtained results indicate a rather uneven personal development of students under all structural components of ethical consciousness. The main part of the article, as well as conclusions, clarifies the components of ethical consciousness, their dynamics and dependence on one's worldview and experience. The international relevance of the article lies in objectifying ethical consciousness of young people in the post-totalitarian environment. It will allow one to evaluate the interaction between traditional and postmodern systems, justify the prospects of such categories as "meanings" and "values" in the belated postmodern society. The results of the article may influence the modelling of the character-building component in new education systems in the post-cultural society.

TI  - The Influence of River Morphology on the Remote Sensing Based Discharge Estimation: Implications for Satellite Virtual Gauge Establishment
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of river discharge is a key process for water resources management, soil and water conservation, climate change, water cycling, flood or drought warning, agriculture and transportation, especially for the sustainable development of rivers and their surrounding ecological environment. Continuous and comprehensive discharge monitoring was usually impossible before, due to sparse gauges and gauge deactivation. Satellite remote sensing provides an advanced approach for estimating and monitoring river discharge at regional or even global scales. River morphology is generally considered to be a direct factor that affects the accuracy of remote sensing estimation, but the specific indicators and the extent to which it affects the estimation accuracy have not yet been explored, especially for medium to small rivers (width < 100 m). In this paper, six sites with hydrological gauges in the upper Heihe River Basin (HRB) of northwestern China and the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) of southeastern Australia were selected as the study cases. River discharge was estimated from Landsat imagery using the C/M method accordingly. River gradient, sinuosity, and width were obtained from Digital Elevation Model data for each site. Global Surface Water Dataset (GSWD) was also employed for indicating the dynamic status of river morphology. A series of methods were applied to analyze the influence of river morphology on estimation accuracy qualitatively and quantitatively, based on which we established inference about the theory of selecting satellite virtual gauges (SVGs). The results confirm the feasibility of the C/M method for discharge estimation, with the accuracy affected by multiple river morphological indicators. Among them, river width was found to be the most significant one. Moreover, water occurrence and water extent extracted from GSWD also have impact on the discharge estimation accuracy. Another independent river section in MDB was set as an example to demonstrate the reasonability of the established theory. It is anticipated that this study would promote the application of remote sensing for discharge estimation by providing practical guidance for establishing appropriate SVGs.

TI  - Incorporating COVID-19 into Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance Systems, Belize, Kenya, Ethiopia, Peru, and Liberia, 2020-2021
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing acute febrile illness (AFI) surveillance systems can be leveraged to identify and characterize emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with ministries of health and implementing partners in Belize, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, and Peru to adapt AFI surveillance systems to generate COVID-19 response information. Staff at sentinel sites collected epidemiologic data from persons meeting AFI criteria and specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing. A total of 5,501 patients with AFI were enrolled during March 2020-October 2021; >= 69% underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. Percentage positivity for SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 4% (87/2,151, Kenya) to 19% (22/115, Ethiopia). We show SARS-CoV-2 testing was successfully integrated into AFI surveillance in 5 low- to middle-income countries to detect COVID-19 within AFI care- seeking populations. AFI surveillance systems can be used to build capacity to detect and respond to both emerging and endemic infectious disease threats.

TI  - The Relative Timing of Population Growth and Land Use Change-A Case Study of North Taiwan from 1990 to 2015
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is a form of land cover and land use change (LCLUC) that occurs globally, and population growth can be a driver of and be driven by LCLUC. Determining the cause-effect relationship is challenging because the temporal resolution of population data is limited by decadal censuses for most countries. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship and relative timing between population change and land use change based on a case study of northern Taiwan from 1990 to 2015. A unique dataset on population was acquired from annually-updated governmental-based population registers maintained at the district level, and land-use expansion data (Residential, Employment, and Transportation Corridor categories) were derived from dense time series of Landsat imagery. Linear regression was applied to understand the general relationship between population and land use and their changes. The strongest relationships were found between population and areal extent of Residential land use, and between population change and Residential areal change. Lagged correlation analysis was implemented for identifying the time lag between population growth and land use change. Most districts exhibited Residential and Employment expansion prior to population growth, especially for districts in the periphery of metropolitan areas. Conversely, the core of metropolitan areas exhibited population growth prior to Residential and Employment expansion. Residential and Employment expansion were deemed to be drivers of population change, so population change was modeled with ordinary least square and geographically weighted regression with Residential and Employment expansion in both synchronized and time lag manners. Estimated population growth was found to be the most accurate when geographic differences and time lags from urban land use expansion were both incorporated.

TI  - Estimation of Convective Atmospheric Instability during Squalls, Tornadoes, and Large Hail Events from Satellite Observations and ERA5 Reanalysis Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider the applicability of satellite data to the estimation of atmospheric instability and precipitable water for the cases of severe convective events occurring over European Russia and the Ural region. The initial sample includes 305 squalls, tornadoes, and large hail events. We assess the instability parameter Lifted Index (LI) and precipitable water (PW) using MODIS Atmospheric Profile Product data and the ERA5 reanalysis data. It is found that the median values of LI and PW retrieved from MODIS and ERA5 data are close, while the extreme values are substantially different. Local areas with very strong instability and high PW are identified from MODIS data, but not detected by the reanalysis data. The MODIS data are found to be significantly limited because of the low frequency of imagery and the lack of information on the instability parameters for cloudy pixels; therefore, the sample size was reduced from 305 to 95 cases.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Windthrows in the Forest Zone of Western Siberia in 2001-2020
T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal distribution of windthrows in the forest zone of Western Siberia for the period 2001-2020 is considered. Windthrow data are obtained from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images, Global Forest Change project data, and high spatial resolution images from open mapping services. Data from the network of weather stations, images from meteorological satellites, and information on hazardous weather events observed in the region are used to specify dates and time of storm events. The compiled database includes 25774 elementary damaged areas, which refer to 265 different windthrows. These windthrows were caused by 158 different storm events. The data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare. 19582786.v1. The total area of windthrows is 508.3 km(2) or 0.04% of the total forested area, which is four times less than in the European Russia (ER) for the same period. More than 67% of windthrows included in the database were caused by tornadoes. They also account for 25.4% of the total area, which is much more than in the ER. Squall-induced windthrows account for 30% of cases and 40% of the total area, and windthrows caused by nonconvective events account for 2.5% of cases and 34.5% of the total area. The maximum density of windthrows is found in the Kemerovo oblast, as well as in the west of Tomsk oblast and in the southeast of the Khanty-Mansi autonomous okrug. The largest number of windthrows was recorded in 2007 and 2010. Tornadoes and squalls, which cause windthrows, are most often observed in June, and windthrows caused by nonconvective events were observed in October-November in the Ural and Kuznetsk Alatau mountains. Several large outbreaks of squalls and tornadoes are identified. However, with respect to the area of forest damage, they are 10-15 times less than the largest similar events on ER. The area of windthrows in Western Siberia is 77.5 times less than the area of burns during the same period, with a ratio of 3.5/1 for ER.

TI  - A Method for Mapping Protective Forest Plantations Based on Multitemporal Satellite Images of High Spatial Resolution and Bi-Season Forest Index
T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Protective forest plantations (PFPs) are an important component of the sustainable functioning of agricultural landscapes, preventing the development of water- and wind-erosion processes. In recent decades, the pace of creation of PFPs in Russia has decreased many times over compared to the middle of the last century. At the same time, due to natural and anthropogenic factors, existing PFPs are subject to large-scale degradation processes, while information about their current state is practically absent. Existing information products on land cover types and forest monitoring only partially cover PFPs. Protective forest belts with a width of 10-20 m are very fragmentarily reflected on the existing global and national satellite maps of forests. The well-known approaches to PFP mapping are based on expert interpretation of the Earth remote sensing (ERS) data of ultrahigh spatial resolution or ground survey using GPS receivers. These methods are time consuming and cannot be applied over large areas. The study proposes a new method for PFP mapping based on multitemporal ERS satellite data using the BSFI (Bi-Season Forest Index), calculated as a normalized difference in the minimum value of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for the vegetation season and the maximum albedo determined in winter in the presence of snow cover on the Earth's surface. Pixels with positive values of this index can be attributed to areas covered with woody vegetation. A comparison of the PFP area identified on the basis of the BSFI based on satellite-imagery data by the Sentin-el-2 spacecraft was performed with the results of expert interpretation of detailed satellite images and widely used information products of satellite land-cover mapping. Comparative analysis showed the presence of a close connection between the results obtained on the basis of Sentinel-2 data and estimates of the area of PFPs based on expert interpretation of detailed satellite images, which is characterized by correlation coefficient R = 0.99, as well as allowing us to establish the accuracy of forest identification based on this index at the level of 91%. The relative error in identifying protective forest belts in the 50-m zone around the field boundaries was 9%. The proposed approach is recommended for PFP mapping in sparsely forested regions, where it is possible to obtain satellite images of the Earth's surface with the presence of snow cover.

TI  - Outcomes after Acute Malnutrition Program Adaptations to COVID-19, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Somalia
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, protocols for community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) were implemented to support continuity of essential feeding services while mitigating COVID-19 transmission. To assess correlations between adaptation timing and CMAM program indicators, we evaluated routine program data in Uganda, Ethiopia, and Somalia for children 6-59 months of age. We specifically analyzed facility-level changes in total admissions, average length of stay (ALOS), total children screened for admission, and recovery rates before and after adaptations. We found no statistically significant changes in program indicators after adaptations. For Somalia, we also analyzed childlevel changes in ALOS and in weight and mid-upper arm circumference at admission and discharge. ALOS significantly increased immediately after adaptations and then decreased to preadaptation levels. We found no meaningful changes in either weight or mid-upper arm circumference at admission or discharge. These findings indicate that adapted CMAM programs can remain effective.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study shows a possibility of practical application of remote sensing data for digital marking and estimation of the areas of regions with a high content of suspended matter in coastal sea waters. The relations between seasonal and domestic winds and cases of high suspended matter content are shown based on data of high- and medium-resolution optical satellite sensors in 2017-2019 for a region at southwestern coast of Crimea. The contribution of continental runoff depends on the season; it is lower than the wind contribution. The approach suggested can be useful for prompt mapping of the dynamics of suspended matter based on observations from several satellites.

TI  - Clinicopathological characteristics of carcinoma penis over 10 years in a tertiary-level oncology center in Nepal: a retrospective study of 380 cases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL UROLOGY AND NEPHROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study was done to find out the clinicopathological characteristics of carcinoma penis in Nepali population and to evaluate various risk factors that predict its inguinal lymph node metastasis. MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out at the Urology Unit, Department of Surgical Oncology at BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital, Bharatpur, Nepal. Case notes of biopsy-proven penile cancer, from January 2012 to December 2021, who underwent some form of surgical intervention were included. ResultsA total of 380 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 55.92 & PLUSMN; 13.81 years. At presentation, 78.5% had clinically node-positive disease. The most common treatment for the primary tumor was partial amputation of the penis (74.2%). Bilateral inguinal lymph node dissections were done in 370 cases. The most common histology was the usual SCC in 94.2% of cases and 69% were well differentiated. T3 was the most common staging in 49.4% cases. Pathologically nodal negative status was found in 58% cases. In univariate analysis, factors like duration of symptoms (& GE; 6 months), high-risk histopathology (basaloid/sarcomatoid variant), increased T-stage, poorly differentiated tumor, and the presence of PNI or LVI were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. Conclusions Penile cancer is a common cancer in developing countries such as Nepal. The majority of the patients present late. Early recognition and prompt treatment are required to improve the overall outcome.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Poplar Phenophase and Leaf Miner Attack in Urban Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of phenology is adopted as the practice in greenery monitoring. Now research is turned towards the fusion of data from various sensors to fill in the gap in time series and allow monitoring of pests and disturbances. Poplar species were monitored for the determination of the best approach for detecting phenology and disturbances. With the adjustments that include a choice of indices, wavelengths, and a setup, a multispectral camera may be used to calibrate satellite images. The image processing pipeline included different denoising and interpolation methods. The correlation of the changes in a signal of top and lateral imaging proved that the contribution of the whole canopy is reflected in satellite images. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) successfully distinguished among phenophases and detected leaf miner presence, unlike enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Changes in the indices were registered before, during, and after the development of the disease. NDRE is the most sensitive as it distinguished among the different intensities of damage caused by pests but it was not able to forecast its occurrence. An efficient and accurate system for detection and monitoring of phenology enables the improvement of the phenological models' quality and creates the basis for a forecast that allows planning in various disciplines.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of applying the algorithm for detecting specularly reflective layers in high-level clouds based on passive satellite data are presented. We consider cirrus clouds with an optical thickness of less than 5 m and an top altitude of more than 8300 m consisting of horizontally oriented ice crystals, observed over the territory of Western Siberia from 2006 to 2007. The technique for detecting specularly reflecting layers in high-level clouds is described and the statistical analysis of their parameters is performed on the basis of spectroradiometer MODIS satellite data. We discuss the seasonal and latitudinal properties of the parameters of considered clouds over Western Siberia. The typical values of the area, altitude, reflection ratio, and effective emissivity of specularly reflecting layers over different latitudinal zones of the region under study are estimated for the first time.

TI  - Short-Term Variability of the Single-Layer Cloud-Field Structure over Western Siberia from MODIS and VIIRS Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A technique for analyzing the short-term variability of the cloud-field structure and its parameters using night-time and day-time MODIS and VIIRS satellite data is proposed. This approach consists in using detailed results of the cloud classification on serial day-time and night-time images of an individual region of the Earth from space. The proposed methodology makes it possible not only to determine the kind of cloud transformation (from one cloud type into another), but also to obtain quantitative estimates of changes in cloud parameters. Results of testing this approach on the example of satellite data for Western Siberia in 2017-2020 from October to March are discussed. The most frequently occurring types of cloud transformations during the time interval under consideration are identified and the main causes of this modification are singled out. The results of assessing the reliability of cloud classification using night VIIRS images compared with data from ground-based weather stations in the region are presented.

TI  - Characteristics of False-Positive Active Fires for Biomass Burning Monitoring in Indonesia from VIIRS Data and Local Geo-Features
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we explored the characteristics of thermal anomalies other than biomass burning to establish a zone map of false-positive active fires to support efficient ground validation for firefighters. We used the ASCII file of VIIRS active fire data (VNP14IMGML), which provides attributes of thermal anomalies every month from 2012 to 2020 in Indonesia. The characteristics of thermal anomalies other than biomass burning were explored using fire radiative power (FRP) values, confidence levels of active fire, fire pixel areas, and their allocations to permanent geographical features (i.e., volcano, river, lake, coastal line, road, and industrial/settlement areas). The Tukey test showed that there was a significant difference between the mean FRP values of the other thermal anomalies, type-1 (active volcano), type-2 (other static land sources), and type-3 (detection over water/offshore), at a confidence level of 95%. Most thermal anomalies other than biomass burning were in the nominal confidence level with a fire pixel area of 0.21 km(2). High spatial images validated these thermal anomaly types as false positives of biomass burning. A zone map of potential false-positive active fire for biomass burning was established in this study by referring to the allocation of thermal anomalies from permanent geographical features. Implementing the zone map removed approximately 13% of the VIIRS active fires as the false positive of biomass burning. Insights gleaned through this study will support efficient ground validation of actual forest/land fires.

TI  - Assessment of mangrove cover dynamics and its health status in the Gulf of Khambhat, Western India, using high-resolution multi-temporal satellite data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activity is a major driving factor of greenhouse gas emission, leading to climate change worldwide. So, the best natural approach to lowering the carbon from the atmosphere is mangroves which have more potential to sequestrate carbon. But mangroves are under threat due to land use land cover change. This research has been carried out on the mangroves of Gulf of Khambhat, Gujarat, India, where anthropic activity is affecting the mangrove forest cover with spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In the present study, multi-temporal high-resolution satellite data AVNIR-2 (Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type-2) and LISS-4 (Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensors-4) were used for the demarcation of various land use/land cover class (LULC), and change analysis and assessment of mangroves health for the years 2009, 2014, and 2019. The impact of saltpan/aquaculture on mangroves growth and its health status has been calculated by various MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data products such as gross primary productivity (GPP), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and leaf area index (LAI) in Google Earth Engine (GEE), and field-based method was also considered. This study suggests that there is a marginal increase (17.11 km(2)) in mangrove cover during the assessment period 2009-2019; on other side, 65.42 km(2) was degraded also. However, increase in saltpan/aquaculture is imposing an adverse effect on mangroves' basal area, plant density, and productivity. Change analysis also suggests a reduction in healthy mangrove area (from 25.20 to 2.84 km(2)), which will have an impact on ecosystem services.

TI  - Classification and Validation of Spatio-Temporal Changes in Land Use/Land Cover and Land Surface Temperature of Multitemporal Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land transfiguration is caused by natural as well as phylogenesis-driving forces, and its consequences for the regional environment are a significant issue in understanding the relationship between society and the environment. Land use/land cover plays a crucial part in the determination, preparation, and execution of administrative approaches to fulfilling basic human needs in the present day. In this study, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati, A.P., India, is considered as a study area to explain the Land use/land cover (LULC) classification, Land Surface Temperature (LST), and the inverse correlation between LST and the NDVI of Temporal Landsat satellite images at intervals of 5 years from 2000 to 2020. We performed easy and thoroughgoing classifications based on vegetation phenology, using an extended LULC field database, a time series of LANDSAT satellite imagery, and a pixel-based classifier. In total, five land-use and land-cover types have been identified: dense vegetation, vegetation, built-up, barren land, and water. Over the period of inquiry, there were notable increases in the area of built-up land, dense vegetation, and vegetation, whereas there was a marked decrease in water bodies and barren land. The diverse effects of land transformation on the natural environment have been assessed using Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The used technique achieved very good levels of accuracy (90-97%) and a strong kappa coefficient (0.89-0.96), with low commission and omission errors. The variation of the land surface temperature was studied using the Mono-Window algorithm. Change detection, and the transition of the natural land cover to man-made land use, were statistically computed for the study area. Results exposed that there had been significant variations in the land use and cover during the tagged eras. In general, two land use and land cover change patterns were confirmed in the study zone: (i) compatible growth of the zone in built-up areas, barren land, plantations, and shrubs; and (ii) continual diminishment in agriculture and water; maximum urban development took place between 2000 to 2020. The results showed drastic changes in urbanization and decrements in vegetation that had environmental consequences.

TI  - Estimation and validation of 30 m fractional vegetation cover over China through integrated use of Landsat 8 and Gaofen 2 data
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important parameter that reflects the status of vegetation and can be used to quantify vegetation dynamics in system models of Earth. Currently, global FVC products are usually available at coarse spatial resolutions, and so cannot satisfy the requirements for detailed investigations of the distribution of vegetation cover in different regions worldwide. Thus, a fine-resolution FVC product that covers a large spatial extent is needed. In this study, we develop an operational framework to produce Landsat-like spatial resolution FVC products using high-resolution images and a machine learning algorithm. We used 1 m Gaofen 2 data to calculate the 30 m FVC, and then applied as training and testing data for modeling. The random forest regression model using Landsat 8 surface reflectance and solar angle as inputs outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy and efficiency and was selected to estimate the 30 m FVC. The model has a high training accuracy, with an R2 of 0.978 and an RMSE of 0.042. When validated using 346 independent ground measurements from 14 sites around the globe, the R2 was 0.814 and the RMSE was 0.170. We compared three coarse-resolution FVC products at both regional and national scales, including GLASS, GEOV2 and CGLOPS FVC products. The 30 m Landsat FVC from this study was spatially and temporally consistent with all reference FVC products, but provided advantages in revealing the fine spatial details of vegetation cover. The performance of the 30 m FVC model varied with vegetation type, but showed the highest consistency with the GLASS FVC for most vegetation types. Finally, by applying the established 30 m FVC model to all Landsat 8 data over China from 2013 to 2018, we derived a seasonal maximum FVC mosaic, which successfully demonstrated the seasonal and spatial variations in vegetation cover in China. We conclude that the proposed framework enables accurate estimation of FVC at a high resolution over a large spatial scale and so, can be used as part of an operational approach for generating a global fine-resolution FVC product.

TI  - Impacts of 3DEnVar-Based FY-3D MWHS-2 Radiance Assimilation on Numerical Simulations of Landfalling Typhoon Ampil (2018)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The module for assimilating radiance data of the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) onboard the Feng Yun 3D (FY-3D) satellite is built in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model data assimilation (WRFDA) system. The CONV, 3DVar, and EnVar experiments are conducted to investigate the impact of assimilating the new humidity sounder based on Typhoon Ampil (2018). Both the 3DVar and EnVar experiments assimilate FY-3D MWHS-2 radiance data on top of the conventional data, while the CONV experiment only applies conventional data. In the EnVar experiment, notable geopotential height increment is observed around the typhoon, leading the typhoon to move northeast. In addition, the moisture field is improved to some extent. Finally, from the analysis of the dynamic field of the typhoon, it can be found that the EnVar experiment can adjust the dynamic structure of the typhoon. Furthermore, the assimilation of FY-3D MWHS-2 radiance data reduces the forecast error of the typhoon track and intensity. Additionally, the precipitation skill is improved in terms of rainfall pattern and the verification score. This improvement in the precipitation may be closely related to the features of the circulation structure concerning the evolution of the typhoon. The improved prediction of the position and intensity of rainbands in the FY-3D MWHS-2 radiance data assimilation experiment corresponds to a better prediction of typhoon structure.

TI  - Monitoring of dam reservoir storage with multiple satellite sensors and artificial intelligence
T2  - RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Iran is an arid and semi-arid country, for this reason, monitoring dam reservoir storage (DRS) is very important for water resources planning. In this research, Latyan DRS in East Tehran has been studied with 3 artificial in-telligence methods of genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE) and cat swarm optimization (CSO). Landsat, Sentinel-1 and 2 satellite sensors with different bands and indexes are used. DE has an accuracy of 98% in unsupervised classification. Latyan DRS has the lowest area with 1.1 +/- 0.2 km(3) (2022) and the highest area with 2.94 +/- 0.2 km(3) (2016). As DRS decreases, the difference between the 3 algorithms increases due to the complex topography of East Latyan Dam. DRS correlation evaluated with DE and in-situ is more than 0.9 and has high compatibility. From 2010 to 2014, when a single Landsat sensor was used, the three algorithms differed the most. Due to the unprecedented decrease in Latyan DRS, Tehran will most likely face severe water shortages in the upcoming years.

AB  - In this essay, I maintain that although atheism, minimally construed, consists simply of the belief that there is no God or gods, atheists must embrace a secular worldview of one kind or another. Since they cannot be without a worldview, atheists must develop an alternative to the religious, especially the theistic, worldviews which they, by implication, reject. Further, I argue that there are, at the very least, two options available to atheists and that these should not be conflated or treated as one and the same. The two options that I explore and distinguish are scientism and secular humanism. I also maintain that the things that might count as good grounds for or against secular or religious worldviews are shaped significantly by whether atheists embrace scientism or secular humanism.

TI  - The Role of Machine Learning in Remote Sensing for Agriculture Drought Monitoring: A Systematic Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Agricultural drought is still difficult to anticipate even though there have been developments in remote sensing technology, especially satellite imagery that is useful for farmers in monitoring crop conditions. The availability of open and free satellite imagery still has a weakness, namely the level of resolution is low and coarse with atmospheric disturbances in the form of cloud cover, as well as the location and period for taking images that are different from the presence of weather stations on Earth. This problem is a challenge for researchers trying to monitoring agricultural drought conditions through satellite imagery. One approach that has recently used is high computational techniques through machine learning, which is able to predict satellite image data according to the conditions of mapping land types and plants in the field. Furthermore, using time series data from satellite imagery, a predictive model of crop cycles can be regarding future crop drought conditions. So, through this technology, we can encourage farmers to make decisions to anticipate the dangers of agricultural drought. Unfortunately, exploration of the use of machine learning for classification and prediction of agricultural drought conditions has not conducted, and the existing methods can still improve. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of methods that used to monitor agricultural drought using remote sensing and machine learning, which are the subjects of future research.

TI  - Tempo-Spatial Distributions and Transport Characteristics of Two Dust Events over Northern China in March 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Taklamakan Desert and the Gobi Desert in East Asia constitute the second-largest sources of dust in the world. In particular, dust originating from the Gobi Desert is more susceptible to long-range transport, with consequent impacts in downwind Asian countries and the Northwest Pacific region. Two intensive dust events (the 3 center dot 15 dust event and the 3 center dot 28 dust event) were experienced in North China in March 2021. The 3 center dot 15 dust process was rated as the most intensive dust process in China in the past 10 years. In this study, by using a combination of spaceborne remote sensing datasets from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, ground-based columnar observations of aerosol optical parameters, meteorological reanalysis data, and backward trajectory simulations of air masses, the transport pathways and the three-dimensional structure characteristics of dust aerosols during the transport of the two dust events in March 2021 were cross-validated. The results of the study indicated that the two dust events were induced by the Mongolian cyclone. Due to the different configurations of the ground meteorological system conditions, a backflow process occurred during the 3 center dot 15 dust event transmission process. After passing over North China and the Bohai Sea, the direction of transport of the dust plume was reversed. The wind deflected from northwest to northeast, and the dust reached the eastern coastal areas of China and was finally deposited on land. The 3 center dot 28 dust event exhibited aerosol stratification in the transport path, the higher pure dust layer reached up to 9 km height, and the lower layer underwent aerosol mixing and became a polluted dust aerosol. This study implies that the investigation of dust aerosol transport and the deposition processes, the impact on the ocean, and the impact of marine aerosols on land also needs to be taken into consideration; the integration of advanced satellites and ground-based remote sensing data, the meteorological reanalysis data and the backward trajectories simulation, which complemented and verified each other, can enhance the ability to delineate the transport pathways and the three-dimensional structural characteristics of dust events.

TI  - Vegetation Growth Trends of Grasslands and Impact Factors in the Three Rivers Headwater Region
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas of grassland improvement and degradation were mapped and assessed to identify the driving forces of change in vegetation cover in the Three Rivers headwater region of Qinghai, China. Based on linear regression at the pixel level, we analyzed the vegetation dynamics of the grasslands of this region using MODIS NDVI data sets from 2000 to 2010. Correlation coefficients were computed to quantitatively characterize the long-term interrelationship between vegetation NDVI and precipitation/temperature variability during this period. The use of time series residuals of the NDVI/precipitation linear regression to normalize the effect of precipitation on vegetation productivity and to identify long-term degradation was extended to the local scale. Results showed that significant improvements occurred in 26.4% of the grassland area in the Three Rivers Headwater region between 2000 and 2010. The study area, which represents about 86.4% of the total grassland area of this headwater region, showed a general trend of improvement with no obvious trend of degradation.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy of Landsat Vegetation Fractional Cover for Monitoring Australian Drylands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived vegetation fractional cover (VFC) has shown to be a promising tool for dryland ecosystem monitoring. This model, calibrated through biophysical field measurements, depicts the sub-pixel proportion of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and bare soil (BS). The distinction between NPV and BS makes it particularly important for drylands, as these fractions often dominate. Two Landsat VFC products are available for the Australian continent: the original Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) product, and a newer Digital Earth Australia (DEA) product. Although similar validation statistics have been presented for each, an evaluation of their differences has not been undertaken. Moreover, spatial variability of VFC accuracy within drylands has not been comprehensively assessed. Here, a large field dataset (4207 sites) was employed to compare Landsat VFC accuracy across the Australian continent, with detailed spatial and temporal analysis conducted on four regions of interest. Furthermore, spatiotemporal features of VFC unmixing error (UE) were explored to characterize model uncertainty in large areas yet to be field sampled. Our results showed that the JRSRP and DEA VFC were very similar (RMSE = 4.00-6.59) and can be employed interchangeably. Drylands did not show a substantial difference in accuracy compared to the continental assessment; however contrasting variations were observed in dryland subtypes (e.g., semi-arid and arid zones). Moreover, VFC effectively tracked total ground cover change over time. UE increased with tree cover and height, indicating that model uncertainty was low in typical dryland landscapes. Together, these results provide guiding points to understanding the Australian ecosystems where VFC can be used with confidence.

TI  - Regulation of medical activity in Russia and Europe in the 10th - early 20th centuries: correlation between ethical and legal principles
T2  - RUSSIAN OPEN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The legal and ethical regulation of medical activity in Russia vs. European countries has common features and a number of specific differences. The regulation of medical activity in the Old Russian state and European medieval states was carried out within the framework of legal norms and Christian worldview, the main principle of which was service to one's neighbor. For instance, these were ethical issues that came to the fore. The secular state form, began its historical path with the emergence of the first secular doctors at the courts of ancient Russian princes. From the 16th century on, it became part of the state apparatus extending its influence to the social estate of the military servicemen. In the middle of the 19th century, during the period of the Zemstvo Reform, it became the main form of servicing rural population. The specificity of zemstvo medicine was the organization of medical activities based on of local self-government bodies and medical societies. At the beginning of the 19th century, with the increasing complexity of scientific knowledge and organization of medical services, European medical codes of ethics aimed at developing the rules of conduct to be followed by the members of newly emerging national medical associations. Despite regulating medical activity, the issues of healthcare were not given due attention, and there were no specific legislative acts affecting the health care regulation in prerevolutionary Russia. In Europe, too, for a long time, the responsibility of a medical professional for mistakes was considered from the standpoint of private relationships based on contractual and commercial principles.

TI  - Short-Period Internal Waves in Shelf Regions with Intense Tidal Dynamics
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We compare characteristics of short-period internal waves and the mechanisms of their generation in the southwestern part of the Barents Sea and in Avacha Bay of the Pacific Ocean based on in situ data, satellite observations, together with results of a modern global barotropic tidal model. According to in situ data, in the Barents Sea, weakly nonlinear short-period oscillations with a maximum amplitude of 4 m dominate in the region of alternating features of the bottom topography with a mean depth of about 100 m. In Avacha Bay, with a narrow shallow shelf and steep continental slope, strongly nonlinear intense internal waves with amplitudes reaching 8 m are recorded against the background of semidiurnal internal waves. It is found from the satellite data that larger wave trains of surface manifestations of short-period waves are recorded in the Barents Sea when compared to Avacha Bay, both in wavelength and along the length of the leading crest. The directions of propagation of wave manifestations in the studied regions are characterized by a narrow range of variations, which may indicate the dominance of one generation mechanism. An analysis of the TPXO9 atlas data has revealed the similarity of the spatial structure of the semidiurnal tidal waves in the Barents Sea and Avacha Bay, but the maximum speed of tidal currents in the Barents Sea is higher more by factor of three than in Avacha Bay. An assessment of the internal tide generation criteria has made it possible to reveal that the short-period internal waves in the Barents sea are generated at breaking of lee waves in the vicinity of the in situ observation place. In contrast, internal waves in Avacha Bay are caused by the disintergation of internal tide.

TI  - Fire severity and the legacy of mountain pine beetle outbreak: high-severity fire peaks with mixed live and dead vegetation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires are two of the most prevalent disturbances that influence tree mortality, regeneration, and successional trajectories in western North American forests. Subboreal forests have experienced broad overlaps in these disturbances, and recent wildfires have burned through landscapes with substantial tree mortality from prior outbreaks. This study investigated how fuel conditions associated with mountain pine beetle outbreaks influence the probability of high burn severity (i.e. stand-replacing fire) across a range of fire weather conditions in subboreal forests of central interior British Columbia, Canada. We focused on three large fires that occurred in 2012, 2013, and 2014. We characterized outbreak severity, outbreak-influenced prefire vegetation, and subsequent burn severity using Landsat spectral vegetation indices, high-resolution imagery, and field observations. Substantial portions of the prefire landscape contained mixtures of live and dead vegetation created by variable beetle damage and vegetation response-spatial patterns that are related to, but distinct from, peak outbreak severity. We evaluated drivers-fuels, weather, and topography-of high-severity fire under 'extreme,' 'moderate,' and 'benign' fire weather conditions (i.e. burning conditions) using Boosted Regression Trees. While fire weather was a primary driver in most cases, prefire vegetation was an influential predictor variable across all burning conditions, and the probability of high-severity fire was highest when prefire vegetation was a mixture of tree mortality from bark beetles and live vegetation. Thus, while weather and drought are important drivers of wildfires in subboreal forests, bottom-up drivers of elevation and vegetation, including the fuel legacies of bark beetle outbreaks, are crucial factors influencing high-severity burning. The legacy of recent bark beetle outbreaks will continue for decades on these landscapes, affecting fuel structures, future wildfires, forest dynamics, and the broader social-ecological systems of the region.

TI  - Fire Risk in Traditional Villages of Sumba, Indonesia
T2  - HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a global problem for traditional villages, especially those dominated by the use of wood and thatch. These places are often crowded, which leads to the rapid spread of fire. The traditional villages on the island of Sumba are architecturally striking, with their tall houses interspersed with ancestral tombs. They are set on an island of grassland landscapes managed using fire. There is little local ability to suppress village fires as they are remote from firefighting services and access to the dwellings is poor. Documentary evidence along with satellite imagery of hotspots have been used to trace the fires on Sumba since 2001. Little meteorological data are accessible for Sumba, so we have used global homogenized records, reassessments and projections of climate to examine long-term change in Sumba. There is a dry season in July-September, which corresponds with the period of most frequent fires. The number of dry-season fires correlates with the number of consecutive dry days, which has been used to establish a likely increase in the potential for fires in the future. There is increased effort to reduce the impact of village fires. Approaches could include reducing the flammability of traditional materials, detection systems and enhanced support of village firefighting capabilities. These may be difficult to introduce given the importance of the architectural heritage and the religious context of village layout, design and governance.

TI  - An Internal Waves Data Set From Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery and Preliminary Detection
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal waves (IWs) are a widely occurring phenomenon in the global oceans. They have significant impacts on marine environments through their propagation mechanisms. In this study, we collect 390 satellite images with 775 labels from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from 2014 to 2021 to construct a data set containing IW packets in Andaman Sea, South China Sea, Sulu Sea, and Celebes Sea, respectively. All the SAR images acquired are pre-processed to provide clear IW packets for better visualization. To better detect IWs in global oceans automatically, a machine-learning based model is proposed to focus on different channels and the spatial information. The precision, recall, and mean average precision of our improved model applied on the IW data set is up to 98.7%, 96.9%, and 98.9%, respectively. Various cases of IWs images are analyzed to illustrate detection quality in different stripes, scales, and propagation directions of IWs. The experimental results indicate that our data set is helpful to better detect IWs, and proposed network can accurately detect IWs in SAR images under various conditions.

TI  - Assessing the Cloud Adjacency Effect on Retrieval of the Ground Surface Reflectance from MODIS Satellite Data for the Baikal Region
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud adjacency effect on surface reflectance retrievals for the region of the Russian Federation with coordinates 51-54 degrees N, 103-109 degrees E including the southern part of Lake Baikal for the period of 1-23 July 2021 is assessed in this paper. The method is based on the computer program for statistical simulation of radiative transfer in the atmosphere with the stochastic cloud field including a deterministic gap of a given radius. The results of this program are then used in the interpolation formula. Masks of cloudless pixels, for which the cloud adjacency effect (CAE) changes the ground surface reflectance by more than 0.005, are constructed. The analysis of the resulting CAE radii shows that the average radius is 13.7 km for MODIS band 8,11.2 km for band 3, 8.4 km for band 4, 7.2 km for band 1, and 7 km for band 2. For the considered MODIS images and bands, the pixels with strong CAE make up from 2.8 to 100% of the total number of cloudless pixels. The correlation coefficients between the initial data and the CAE radius suggest that the cloud optical depth, cloud cover index, and ground surface reflectance exert the major influence on the considered images. A simplified approximation equation for the CAE radius as a function of the cloud optical depth, cloud cover index, and surface reflectance is derived. The analysis of the approximation shows that for the considered images, the CAE radius decreases nearly linearly with wavelength for low reflective surfaces. However, for high reflective surfaces, its wavelength dependence is nonlinear.

T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of a student's harmonious development in intellectual, emotional, value and volitional dimensions is relevant and urgent for education today. The centre of close attention of pedagogues and psychologists that develop the emotional value approach in the educational process, are strategic documents, emphasizing the importance of the outlined problem at the state level. The subject "foreign language" makes a great contribution to the solution of the priority educational tasks, set in them, related to the achievement of personal, meta-subject and subject learning outcomes, integrated in the concept of "linguistic and cultural personality". The integrated nature of the goal of modern foreign-language education determines the complexity of its content, covering the subject, procedural and emotional value aspects. In the Federal state educational standard of secondary (full) education the last ones are presented as the basic values and achievements of humanity, masterpieces of national and world culture, leading scientific achievements, underlying the worldview of a modern personality as part of society. Mastering such content is possible only in the conditions of including the emotional value component in the system of foreignlanguage education. As constituent parts of this component, the article considers a set of value, emotional, volitional sub-components and personal universal educational actions, as well as their constituent units and elements. Testing the content "filling" of this structure in a school foreign-language educational process revealed that the formation of students' speech skills and abilities and the development of their linguistic creativity are closely related to value, emotional and volitional spheres of a personality. Consequently, the inclusion of the emotional value component in the structure and content of a FLC creates the basis for enriching students' worldview, improving their personal qualities, preparing the younger generation for life in harmony with the surrounding world. These are the key properties of the linguistic and culltural personality as the goal of modern foreign-language education.

TI  - Exploring Long-Term Anomalies in the Vegetation Cover of Peri-Urban Parks Using the Fisher-Shannon Method
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of the Fisher-Shannon statistical method applied to the MODIS satellite time series to search for and explore any small multiyear trends and changes (herein also denoted as inner anomalies) in vegetation cover. For the purpose of our investigation, we focused on the vegetation cover of three peri-urban parks close to Rome and Naples (Italy). For each of these three areas, we analyzed the 2000-2020 time variation of four MODIS-based vegetation indices: evapotranspiration (ET), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). These data sets are available in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and were selected because they are related to the interactions between soil, water, atmosphere, and plants. To account for the great variability exhibited by the seasonal variations while identifying small multiyear trends and changes, we devised a procedure composed of two steps: (i) application of the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to each satellite-based time series to detect and remove the annual cycle including the seasonality and then (ii) analysis of the detrended signals using the Fisher-Shannon method, which combines the Shannon entropy and the Fisher Information Measure (FIM). Our results indicate that among all the three pilot test areas, Castel Volturno is characterized by the highest Shannon entropy and the lowest FIM that indicate a low level of order and organization of vegetation time series. This behaviour can be linked to the degradation phenomena induced by the parasite (Toumeyella parvicornis) that has affected dramatically the area in recent years. Our results were nicely confirmed by the comparison with in situ analyzed and independent data sets revealing the existence of subtle, small multiyear trends and changes in MODIS-based vegetation indices.

TI  - Seasonal land use/land cover change and the drivers in Kafta Sheraro national park, Tigray, Ethiopia.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Kafta Sheraro National Park (KSNP) has experienced rapid and consecutive destruction of dry woodland vegetation due to the influence of anthropogenic activities in the past three decades. However, to date, the change in woodland cover and its driving factors have not been addressed. This study aims to assess the spatial and temporal trends of land use/land cover change, seasonal vegetation cover change via the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and human-induced drivers of change that occurred in the KSNP between 1988 and 2018 by using satellite imagery sensors (TM, ETM+, OLI), field observations, and local community interview data. The 2018 image results showed kappa coefficients of the dry season and wet season of 0.90 and 0.845, respectively. There was a continuous decline in woodland (29.38%) and riparian vegetation (47.11%) and an increasing trend in shrub bush land (35.28%), grassland (43.47%), bare land (27.52%), and cultivated land (118.36 km2) over the thirty-year period. Moreover, the results showed that bare land expanded from wet to drier months, while cultivated land and grazing land increased from dry to wet months. Based on the NDVI results, high to moderate vegetation was decreased by 21.47%, while sparse and non-vegetation expanded by 19.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Settlement and agricultural expansion, human-induced fire, firewood collection, gold mining, and charcoal production were the major proximate drivers that negatively affected park resources. Around KSNP, the local communities' livelihood depends on farming (crop and livestock production). This expansion of farming is the main driver of woodland depletion, which leads to increased resource competition and a challenge for the survival of wildlife. Therefore, urgent sustainable conservation of park biodiversity by encouraging community participation in conservation practices and preparing awareness creation programs should be mandatory.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of Population Distribution in China from 2000 to 2020 Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately and precisely grasping the spatial distribution and changing trends of China's regional population is of great significance in new urbanization, economic development, public health, disaster assessment, and ecological environmental protection. To monitor and evaluate the long-term spatiotemporal characteristics of the population distribution in China, a population monitoring estimation model was proposed. Based on remote sensing data such as nighttime light (NTL) images, land use data, and data from the fifth, sixth, and seventh censuses of China, the population spatiotemporal distribution in China from 2000 to 2020 was analyzed with a random forest algorithm. This study obtained spatial distribution maps of population density at a 1 km x 1 km resolution in 2000, 2010, and 2020. The results revealed the trend of the spatiotemporal pattern of population change from 2000 to 2020. It shows that: the accuracy assessment using the 2020 census population of townships/streets as a reference shows an R-2 of 0.67 and a mean relative error (MRE) of 0.44. The spatial pattern of the population in 2000 and 2010 is generally unchanged. In 2020, population agglomeration is evident in the east, with a slight increase in the proportion of the population in the west. The patterns of population agglomeration and urbanization also change over time. The population spatiotemporal distribution obtained in this study can provide a scientific reference for urban sustainable development and promote the rational allocation of urban resources.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change have intense implications on soil resources, that requires research attention and global collaboration to take urgent actions. The present study attempted to analyze the impact of LULC change on soil erosion and sedimentation in Muger Sub-basin, southwestern parts of Ethiopia. Landsat TM 1986, Landsat ETM+ 2003, and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2020 are used for LULC analysis. We used rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, cover management, and conservation practices to calculate soil erosion and sedimentation between 1986 and 2020. In this study, the integration of revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model and geographic information system (GIS) are used to analyze the impact of LULC change on soil erosion and sedimentation. The average soil loss rate is about 53.2 ton/ha/year in 1986 and increased to 63.6, and 64 ton/ha/year in 2003, 2020, respectively. Result revealed that about 2707.7 ha (33%), 3124.5 ha (38.1%) and 3197.4 ha (38.9%) were exposed to severe erosion in 1986, 2003 and 2020, respectively. The mean sediment yields of the study area is estimated to 7.8 ton/ha/year in 1986, and later increased to 10, and 10.2 ton/ha/year in 2003, and 2020, respectively. Results revealed that the steep slope areas with crop land experience considerable soil loss, with mean soil loss increasing over all study period. Thus, urgent policy on the wise use of natural resources is essential not optional to reduce the current soil loss and sedimentation in Muger Sub-basin.

TI  - Parcel-Level Flood and Drought Detection for Insurance Using Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-1 SAR GRD and Mobile Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods and droughts cause catastrophic damage in paddy fields, and farmers need to be compensated for their loss. Mobile applications have allowed farmers to claim losses by providing mobile photos and polygons of their land plots drawn on satellite base maps. This paper studies diverse methods to verify those claims at a parcel level by employing (i) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and (ii) Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) on Sentinel-2A images, (iii) Classification and Regression Tree (CART) on Sentinel-1 SAR GRD images, and (iv) a convolutional neural network (CNN) on mobile photos. To address the disturbance from clouds, we study the combination of multi-modal methods-NDVI+CNN and NDWI+CNN-that allow 86.21% and 83.79% accuracy in flood detection and 73.40% and 81.91% in drought detection, respectively. The SAR-based method outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy in flood (98.77%) and drought (99.44%) detection, data acquisition, parcel coverage, cloud disturbance, and observing the area proportion of disasters in the field. The experiments conclude that the method of CART on SAR images is the most reliable to verify farmers' claims for compensation. In addition, the CNN-based method's performance on mobile photos is adequate, providing an alternative for the CART method in the case of data unavailability while using SAR images.

TI  - Regional Satellite Algorithms to Estimate Chlorophyll-a and Total Suspended Matter Concentrations in Vembanad Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing coastal population is leading to increased anthropogenic pollution that greatly affects coastal and inland water bodies, especially in the tropics. The Sustainable Development Goal-14, 'Life below water' emphasises the importance of conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources. Pollution management practices often include monitoring of water quality using in situ observations of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM). Satellite technology, including the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor onboard Sentinel-2, enables the continuous monitoring of these variables in inland waters at high spatial and temporal resolutions. To improve the monitoring of water quality in the tropical Vembanad-Kol-Wetland (VKW) system, situated on the southwest coast of India, we present two regionally tuned satellite algorithms developed to estimate chl-a and TSM concentrations. The new algorithms estimate the chl-a and TSM concentrations from the simulated reflectance values as a function of the inherent optical properties using a forward modelling approach. The model was parameterised using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD) and in situ measurements collected in the VKW system. To assess model performance, results were compared with in situ measurements of chl-a and TSM and other existing satellite-based models of chl-a and TSM. For satellite application, two different atmospheric correction methods (ACOLITE and POLYMER) were tested and satellite matchups were used to validate the new chl-a and TSM algorithms following standard validation procedures. The results demonstrated that the new algorithms were in good agreement with in situ observations and outperform existing chl-a and TSM algorithms. The new regional satellite algorithms can be used to monitor water quality within the VKW system to support the sustainable management under natural (cyclones, floods, rainfall, and tsunami) and anthropogenic pressures (industrial effluents, agricultural practices, recreational activities, construction, and demolishing concrete structures) and help achieve Sustainable Development Goal 14.

TI  - Investigating the Performance of Carbon Monoxide and Methane Observations from Sentinel-5 Precursor in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its launch on 13 October 2017, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) mission has been measuring the solar radiation backscattered by Earth's atmosphere and surface. In this study, we evaluate the TROPOMI operational methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) products' performance results covering about 3 years using the only two global Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites in China, i.e., the Hefei site and the Xianghe site. These two sites have recently joined the TCCON, and this study uses the both sites simultaneously to validate the TROPOMI products over China for the first time. We found that the systematic bias with rescaling between the TROPOMI CO products and the Hefei site is on average 1.78 +/- 6.35 ppb or 1.18 +/- 5.35%. The systematic bias with rescaling between the TROPOMI CO products and the Xianghe site is on average 5.33 +/- 14.24 ppb or 3.85 +/- 10.30%. Both the stations show a correlation above 0.9. The TROPOMI CO data are systematically higher than the two TCCON sites measurements in China. We found that the systematic bias with rescaling between the TROPOMI CH4 products and the Hefei site is on average -4.13 +/- 11.65 ppb or -0.22 +/- 0.62%. The systematic bias between the TROPOMI CH4 products and Xianghe site is on average -7.25 +/- 10.72 ppb or -0.39 +/- 0.57%. Both the stations show a correlation above 0.9. The TROPOMI CH4 data are systematically lower than the two TCCON sites measurements in China. We found that the bias between the TROPOMI and the two sites' data as a function of the coincident radius around the two sites is mostly affected by localized emissions for both CO and CH4. We also observe a CO decreasing trend and a CH4 increasing trend in the year-to-year relative changes from 2019 to 2021. Validating against reference from Hefei and Xianghe TCCON site demonstrates the high quality of TROPOMI CO and CH4 data over China.

TI  - Effects of Agricultural Land and Urban Expansion on Peri-Urban Forest Degradation and Implications on Sustainable Environmental Management in Southern Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Policy failure in controlling horizontal urban expansion coupled with agricultural/cultivated land expansion typically leads to forest degradation mostly in developing countries. Peri-urban areas are havens and vulnerable and dispute areas of uncontrolled urban expansion and forest degradation. This study was aimed to assess the effect of cultivated land and urban expansion land use/land cover change (LULCC) dynamics rate on peri-urban forest degradation and implications on sustainable environment management there by identifying the derivers of LULCC. The study used Landsat images of 2002, 2010 and 2018 and examines the underlying factors. The results revealed significant conversion from forest and grass land to built-up and cultivated land. The proportion of built-up area and cultivated land increased to 75 ha yr(-1) and 85 ha yr(-1) of the study area from 2002 to 2018, respectively. The identified drivers were generally grouped as proximate and underlying drivers. The effect of driving factors in shaping LULCC tends to remain stable over time, and the gradual enforcement of spatial planning policies appears to be important factors in dynamics of LULCC. Hence, it was suggested that integrated land-use planning and management has a paramount importance of reducing peri-urban forest degradation and maintaining sustainable environmental management.

TI  - Mangrove restoration in Vietnamese Mekong Delta during 2015-2020: Achievements and challenges
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta plays important roles in protecting coasts from soil erosion and strong waves, supplying seafood, and accumulating carbon. Despite these benefits, mangroves have been and continue to be severely damaged by the impacts of natural and socioeconomic activities. In recent years, large areas of mangrove forest have been restored through planting and other various management actions. In this study, we analyzed high-resolution WorldView-2 images to quantify changes in the mangrove forest in seven coastal provinces (Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Vinh Long, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, and Kien Giang) of the Mekong Delta from 2015 to 2020. Our study is one of the first to analyze mangrove forest change at the commune scale, the smallest official administrative unit in Vietnam, to determine the area of restored mangroves. The potentials and challenges in future mangrove restoration were also assessed by analyzing satellite imagery and field survey data. In the study area, mangrove forest area increased by 11,184 ha (approximately 2,237 ha per year) from 79,593 ha in 2015 to 90,777 ha in 2020. A total area of 16,138 ha (approximately 20.3%) was lost due to mangrove conversion to other land uses, aquaculture activities and coastal erosion, etc., while 27,322 ha (approximately 34.1%) was restored or newly planted during state- and NGO-funded mangrove restoration projects and programs. These results confirmed that mangrove restoration projects and programs have played a significant role in maintaining and increasing mangrove forest cover in Mekong Delta. The results can also assist managers and decision makers in mangrove restoration evaluation, and suggest analyzing WorldView-2 images to monitor mangrove restoration over time in Vietnam.

TI  - The motivic structure of <i>Ascetic Preaching</i> of Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the work of Ignatius (Brianchaninov), holy hierarch, an outstanding Church figure and spiritual writer of the 19th century. Based on the collection of teachings Ascetic Preaching (1866), the significant features of the poetics of his work - an area that is almost not mastered by modern literary criticism - are shown. The texts of the collection are analyzed in order to identify the features of its structure, the characteristics of the factors of its integrity, ideological depth, emotional impact on readers. The author hypothesizes that the convincing force of Brianchaninov's instructing words is caused not only by the mastery of the oratory techniques, but also by the ability to embody the Christian worldview holistically and systematically in the works "bonded" by an internal ideological and conceptual relationships. The method of structural analysis of texts is used to study the internal connections of the semantic elements of Ascetic Preaching. At the first stage of the analysis, the dominant theme of the book is revealed. Further, the motifs related to the main theme are studied, their internal connection is traced, and the principle of correlating the main and accompanying motifs with the text of Holy Scripture is shown. Based on the conducted research, the author infers that Bryanchaninov's works have a motivic structure. The central organizing topic and leading theme of Ascetic Preaching, as well as the semantic dominant of all works by Ignatius, is repentance. This is due to the fact that the call to repentance is the basis of Christian teaching. The theme of repentance permeates all the constituent parts of the book, ensures its integrity and compositional balance, binds the disparate texts and determines the main vector of the theological arguments of its author. This theme is interwoven with related motifs, among which the main are the motifs of faith, prayer, the Last Judgment. They link each specific text with the rest of the works of the collection. Holy hierarch Ignatius correlates these motifs with images of Holy Scripture. A special group of teachings in the collection are texts that interpret the gospel parables. In particular, the motif of prayer is embodied by Brianchaninov in the images of the characters of the gospel parable about the publican and the Pharisee, the theme of repentance and the motif of God's judgment correspond to the parable of the prodigal son. The use of Evangelical images in the development of the main motifs gives visibility to the preacher's texts and defines a trait of his style - biblicism. These motifs are connected with each other, forming a holistic ideological and thematic unity that systematically reveals the Orthodox doctrine of salvation.

TI  - Spectral Characteristics of Tundra and Forest Tundra Landscapes during the Years of Summer Temperature Anomalies
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The warming at high latitudes that remains in recent years has a direct impact on Arctic and Subarctic landscapes. Possible changes in these landscapes with climate warming are closely related with regulatory mechanisms for the underlying surface temperature. The features of the formation of radiation and evapotranspirational mechanisms of surface temperature regulation in the tundra (from Arctic to southern) and the forest-tundra landscapes of Novaya Zemlya and Western Siberia are studied in this paper. The MODIS data of surface spectral characteristics are used: albedo (Al) and surface temperature (Ts) for July 2000-2019. The radiation mechanism of surface temperature regulation is shown to dominate in glacial and polar desert landscapes of the Arctic and Subarctic with the prevalence of stony and rubble types of surfaces with lichens. At the same time, in the mountainous and Arctic tundra of Novaya Zemlya, the radiative mechanism of surface temperature regulation is practically independent of weather anomalies and currently weakly depends on the surface air temperature trend. In the continental tundra and forest tundra, the evapotranspirational type of surface temperature regulation begins to predominate. This is facilitated by an increase in average monthly air temperatures up to 15-16 degrees C, which favorably affects the diversity of vegetation. In the subzone of the southern tundra and forest tundra, the relation between albedo and surface temperature depends on the height of the terrain, the exposure of slopes, and (especially) on extreme temperature anomalies. In lowlands (hydromorphic complexes), in cold years, against the background of waterlogging, the radiative type of surface temperature regulation prevails, while in warm years, a decrease in humidity leads to the maximal development of vegetation, and the communication mechanism can turn into an evapotranspirational one. At higher elevations, the reverse process, which is also associated with changes in moisture conditions, is observed. In the forest tundra, upon an increase in air temperature and an increase in the height of the vegetation cover, the evapotranspiration mechanism of the relation between the Al-Ts spectral parameters weakens. Thus, in the southern tundra and forest tundra, the existence of two stable positions of equilibrium between the spectral properties of the surface depending on the illumination and temperature anomalies is possible.

TI  - Retrieval of Harmonized LAI Product of Agricultural Crops from Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI Time Series
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an approach for the harmonized calculation of the Leaf Area Indices (LAIs) for agronomic crops from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat OLI multispectral satellite data is proposed in order to obtain a dense seasonal trajectory. It was developed and tested on dominant crops grown in the Czech Republic, including winter wheat, spring barley, winter rapeseed, alfalfa, sugar beet, and corn. The two-step procedure harmonizing Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat OLI spectral data began with deriving NDVI, MSAVI, and NDWI_1610 vegetation indices (VIs) as proxy indicators of green biomass and foliage water content, the parameters contributing most to a stand's spectral response. Second, a simple linear transformation was applied to the resulting VI values. The regression model itself was built on an artificial neural network, then trained on PROSAIL simulations data. The LAI estimates were validated using an extensive dataset of in situ measurements collected during 2017 and 2018 in the lowlands of the Central Bohemia Region. Very strong agreement was observed between LAI estimates from both Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat OLI data and independent ground-based measurements (r between 0.7 and 0.98). Very good results were also achieved in the mutual comparison of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-based LAI datasets (rRMSE < 20%, r between 0.75 and 0.99). Using data from all currently available Sentinel-2 (A/B) and Landsat (8/9) satellites, a dense harmonized LAI time series can be created with high potential for use in precision agriculture.

TI  - Urban density stratification and the heat islands monitoring: Case of the city of Tijuana
T2  - REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The densification of the urban spaces reduces heat dissipation leading to the appearance of urban heat islands (UHI) that contribute to environmental deterioration and the decrease in the well-being of the population. This phenomenon manifests itself with the increase in soil surface temperatures (SST) because of the consumption of heat -permeable spaces due to the expansion and densification of the city. Taking advantage of the radiometric and thermal attributes of the LANDSAT images, this research analyzed the incidence of urban density stratification between 1987-2018 on the dynamics of SST in the city of Tijuana, Baja California. Specifically, a statistical validation of a possible relationship between urban density classes and their respective SST was performed. The results seem to indicate that the urban densities stratification is an approach of many lessons to decipher the dynamics of the urban landscape. However, it is not the appropriate tool to discriminate land cover by the SST.

TI  - The Interannual Variability of Sea Ice Area, Thickness, and Volume in the Southern Sea of Okhotsk and Its Likely Factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lowest latitude sea ice in the world (excluding coastal freezing) is in the southern Sea of Okhotsk (south of 46 degrees N), where it has significant impacts on freshwater input and primary production. This region is subject to climate change, and accordingly the monitoring of sea ice conditions is important. However, the interannual variability of the region's sea ice is poorly understood due to its logistical challenges. Sea ice observations have been conducted in this region every winter for the period 1996-2020. The interannual variability of the ice conditions and the likely factors responsible for it were investigated using visual observations following the international ASPeCt protocol, combined with satellite SSM/I-SSMIS ice concentration data (1988-2020). AMSR-derived ice drift data sets and ERA5 meteorological reanalysis data sets were also analyzed to examine the effects of dynamic and thermodynamic processes. Our analysis revealed that (a) sea ice area in this region varies differently from that in the central and northern Sea of Okhotsk, where decreasing trends are reported, (b) sea ice volume has remarkable interannual variation and the peaks appeared much to more affected by dynamically deformed ice than freezing conditions, and (c) prominently deformed ice can be explained by taking shear components into account based on sea ice rheology. These results suggest the importance of including the proper sea ice rheology in numerical sea ice models to reproduce the realistic sea ice volume and deformation processes, for all seasonal ice zones.Plain Language Summary The southern Sea of Okhotsk (south of 46 degrees N) is the southernmost area of the northern hemisphere, excluding coastal freezing, where there is wintertime sea ice cover. Although this sea ice has significant impacts on the surface heat and freshwater balance and biogeochemical cycles across a wide region, its interannual variability is not well understood yet. Long-term field observations from the patrol vessel in this region for 1996-2020, in combination with satellite data, reveals that the variability of sea ice area south of 46 degrees N is uncorrelated with that in the northern and central regions, and that the sea ice thickness and volume is mainly controlled by dynamical pile-up processes, rather than the thermodynamical freezing conditions. Analysis of satellite-derived ice drift datasets shows that the rheology traditionally used in many sea ice models, in which sea ice behaves like a plastic under the ordinary stress, holds consistently explaining the yearly variations of deformed ice contribution. Considering that sea ice rheology is essential to the dynamical part of sea ice models, our result promotes the possibility of accurately predicting sea ice thickness and volume in the seasonal ice zone.

TI  - Cold Spot over the Lofoten Vortex
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper provides a joint analysis of Aqua/MODIS data, global ocean reanalysis GLORYS12V1, and atmospheric reanalysis ERA5. We consider the quasi-permanent Lofoten Vortex located in the Norwegian Sea. Analysis of SST maps reveals the existence of a cold spot in the area of the Lofoten Vortex in the summer-autumn period. A joint analysis of satellite maps and GLORYS12V1 data shows that the main reason for the formation of the cold spot is the rise of the isopicns of the upper dome of the vortex and the destruction of the heated layer, as a result of which colder isopicns come to the surface. It is revealed that in many cases the cold spot shifts to the periphery of the vortex in a southeasterly direction, and the shift can be several tens of kilometers. The reason may be the vortex advection of particles in an anticyclonic vortex. It is shown that along with the formation of the cold spot, there is a 10-30 m decrease in the depth of the upper quasi-homogeneous layer above the Lofoten Vortex in the summer-autumn period. The formation of a cold spot on the water surface is accompanied by a decrease in temperature in the drive layers of the atmosphere.

TI  - Relationship between the Land Surface Temperature and Land Cover Types, a Case Study in Hanoi City, Vietnam
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of an assessment of the relationship between the temperature of the central part of the city of Hanoi and the type of urban surface. Landsat TM and Landsat 8 images collected from 2000 to 2019 are used to calculate the land surface temperature of the study area, as well as indices characterizing the land cover (NDVI), built-up area (NDBI), and water surface (MNDWI). The correlation coefficient between the surface temperature and the NDVI, NDBI, and MNDWI is calculated. The results show that the vegetation cover and the water surface are inversely correlated with the surface temperature, which is expressed by the negative values of the correlation coefficient. On the other hand, the built-up area has a positive correlation with the surface temperature, as is shown by the positive values of the correlation coefficient. During the entire observation period, the correlation coefficient between temperature and housing density according to the NDBI has been constantly increasing and reached its highest level in 2019. Other indices are characterized by a relative constancy of values. The results of the study show the possibility of using the NDBI to assess the housing density and can be used to rationally manage the land use of urban areas.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monthly average values of sea surface temperature from January 1998 to August 2020 are analyzed for the region covering the water area of the Far East seas and the northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean. The time function of the first mode, which describes more than 95% of the variance of a parameter under study, has been shown to have significant positive deviations from the average long-term values in January-April 2020 in the southern part of the study area, which covers the traditional feeding grounds of pink salmon. It may have been these abnormally high temperatures that affected the fish survival conditions and obstructed the spawning passage to the Russian Far East shores in the summer of 2020. In spring (May-June), the anomalies in the southern part of the study area became less expressed, but significant positive deviations from the norm appeared in its northern part and near the eastern (including the Karaginsky Bay) and western coasts of Kamchatka. Only very weak uptrends were revealed in time functions of the principal modes, indicating that there are no significant global warming trends in the region. Their envelopes with respect to lower values involve a clear manifestation of an 11-year cycle that is in antiphase with solar activity indices. No regular (for example, cyclical) components are found in variations of summer maxima in the time function of the first mode. In the oscillations of maxima of the time function of the second mode, the main contribution is made by the cyclic component with a period of 22 years.

TI  - Changes in the impact of high-priced medications on medication wastage in a university hospital
T2  - PHARMAZIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Medication wastage is a global issue. This study aimed to clarify changes in the impact of high-priced medications on medication wastage in our university hospital. We investigated the total number and total cost of medication wastage, and the involvement of high-priced medications in each fiscal year (FY) from FY 2013 to FY 2020. During the eight years, total medication wastage did not increase, but total cost increased steadily from 3,959,779 JPY (36,079 USD) in FY 2013 to 12,157,129 JPY (110,767 USD) in FY 2020. Medication wastage of 50,000 JPY (456 USD) or more and 100,000 JPY (911 USD) or more per case were 11 cases and two cases in FY 2013, respectively; however, this increased to 42 cases and 23 cases in FY 2020, respectively. Furthermore, the costs of medication wastage of 50,000 JPY or more and 100,000 JPY or more per case were 1,018,111 JPY (9,276 USD) and 471,731 JPY (4,298 USD) in FY 2013, respectively, but increased significantly to 8,812,954 JPY (80,297 USD) and 7,510,415 JPY (68,430 USD) in FY 2020, respectively. The most common medication type among medication wastage of high-priced medications was antineoplastic agents such as protein kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. These findings indicate that high-priced medications have the largest impact on the cost of medication wastage and suggest the need for efforts on medication management focusing on antineoplastic agents.

TI  - ArithFusion: An Arithmetic Deep Model for Temporal Remote Sensing Image Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different satellite images may consist of variable numbers of channels which have different resolutions, and each satellite has a unique revisit period. For example, the Landsat-8 satellite images have 30 m resolution in their multispectral channels, the Sentinel-2 satellite images have 10 m resolution in the pan-sharp channel, and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial images have 1 m resolution. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective arithmetic deep model for multimodal temporal remote sensing image fusion. The proposed model takes both low- and high-resolution remote sensing images at t(1) together with low-resolution images at a future time t(2) from the same location as inputs and fuses them to generate high-resolution images for the same location at t(2). We propose an arithmetic operation applied to the low-resolution images at the two time points in feature space to take care of temporal changes. We evaluated the proposed model on three modality pairs for multimodal temporal image fusion, including downsampled WorldView-2/original WorldView-2, Landsat-8/Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-2/NAIP. Experimental results show that our model outperforms traditional algorithms and recent deep learning-based models by large margins in most scenarios, achieving sharp fused images while appropriately addressing temporal changes.

TI  - Area-to-point regression Kriging approach fusion of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 data for assessment of soil macronutrients at Anaimalai, Coimbatore
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral indices-based soil prediction models derived from multispectral datasets are too intricate in terms of accuracy as well as resolution. Complications arise while incorporating multispectral datasets for regional-scale spatial assessment of soil macronutrients. Sporadically satellite image fusion techniques have been used for soil nutrient interpolation to circumvent the complications. The fusion of multispectral bands encompasses precise soil information that cannot be observed as accurate with single satellite dataset. In this study, fusion of near infrared regions of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel 2 has been observed for its contribution on soil macronutrient assessments. Area-to-point regression Kriging (ATPRK) approach is followed in fusing the two satellite imagery and in situ soil spectral have used for the validation of the resultant. Comparative statistical analysis on Landsat 8 OLI band 5 (wavelength: 845-885 nm), Sentine-2 band 8,8A (wavelength: 785-900 nm) datasets and fused satellite bands provides R-2 values of 0.8209, 0.8436, and 0.8763 respectively. Regression models y = (0.25006 +/- 0.00754) + (0.0000313)x, y = (0.25252 +/- 0.0062) + (0.00 00810)x, and y = (0.23715 +/- 0.0062) + (0.0001210)x for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium respectively aids for soil macronutrient interpolation and assessments. Computations reveals the ranges of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that floats from 48 to 295 kg/ha, 5.0 to 37 kg/ha, and 32 to 455 kg/ha in the study area. Fusion of satellite imagery by ATPRK approaches in soil macronutrient study at regional scale brings the novelty of the study.

TI  - Cloudiness and water from cloud seeding in connection with plants distribution in the Republic of Moldova
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play an important role in maintaining the balance in the environment. Cloudiness can influence numerous important ecological drivers, including growth, survival and distribution of plants. The cloud cover dynamics and distribution may provide key information for delineating various types of plant and species distribution. During a year, different types of clouds on a territory can influence the distribution of plants and potential of cloud seeding. New properties of cloudiness may be important for new ecological patterns and new adapted values of ecological drivers. In the territory of the Republic of Moldova, 30 years of cloudiness were taken to show new distribution of clouds properties and their influence on sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) and grapes (Vitis vinifera). The main result of this research is the first established map with the location of water derived from cloud seeding. In the last decade (2010-2020), the cloudiness increased by more than 15%. Another important focus of this research is the possibility of cloud seeding in line with recent deficit of precipitation, especially in dry areas. The territory of Moldova has 37% of semiarid and 6% of arid zones. The distribution and the potential of cloud seeding has been analyzed by means of Remote Sensing and GIS techniques and methodology, along with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Satellite data in the resolution of 1 km(2) were downloaded for the period between 1990 and 2020. The exact distribution of clouds helped to determine the belts for the potential irrigation of crops. Extremely low cloudiness and a long period of drought may jeopardize the agricultural sector in the Republic of Moldova, and therefore, the irrigation from alternative water sources is of utmost importance.

TI  - Landslides Triggered by Medicane Ianos in Greece, September 2020: Rapid Satellite Mapping and Field Survey
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Medicanes, a type of strong hurricanes/cyclones occurring in the Mediterranean, can be the source of major geohazard events in Mediterranean coastal and inland areas. Medicane Ianos that hit Greece during 17-19 September 2020 caused widespread damage, with numerous landsides and floods being the most prominent. Following the landfall of Medicane Ianos, a series of field surveys were launched together with rapid response through satellite imagery. We focused on two of the areas most affected by Medicane Ianos, Cephalonia island and Karditsa, Thessaly, both in Greece. A rapid landslide inventory for the Karditsa region was prepared using Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, the first of its kind for a severe weather event in Greece. The mountainous area of Karditsa region in western Thessaly experienced the unprecedented number of 1696 landslides, mapped through satellite imagery and examined in the field. Cephalonia Island experienced a smaller number of landsides but damaging debris flows and severe structural damages. The rapid landside inventory was then compared to new methods of automated landslide mapping through change detection of satellite imagery.

TI  - Shoreline Change Analysis Using Historical Multispectral Landsat Images of the Pacific Coast of Panama
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The shoreline is the interface between sea and land influenced by natural, anthropogenic factors and climate change. The study of the evolution of the shoreline provides information to evaluate accretion or erosion processes. Shoreline erosion represents a threat to the safety of the coastal population, reducing the extension of the beach zone and making human settlements vulnerable to extreme events. This research presents the analysis of the evolution of the shoreline by multispectral images from Landsat satellites and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) of the Pacific Coast of Panama for the period of 1998-2021. The automated shoreline extraction was generated by combining remote sensing techniques, such as the Histogram Threshold Method and the Band Ratio Method, to generate binary images delineating the land and water zone. The most vulnerable zone, due to erosion processes and the exposition of urban areas, corresponds to the zone of Serena beach and Coronado beach with an average negative distance movement of -23.95 m. Finally, it was concluded that there is a general tendency of erosion processes in the study zone with a rate for long-term analysis of -1.12 m/y (zone I), -1.01 m/y (zone II), and -1.08 m/y (zone III).

TI  - How Weather Affects over Time the Repeatability of Spectral Indices Used for Geological Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geologic remote sensing studies often targets surface cover that is supposed to be invariant or only changing on a geological timescale. In terms of surface material characteristics, this holds for rocks and minerals, but only to a lesser degree for soils (including alluvium, colluvium, regolith or weathered outcrop) and not for vegetation cover, for example. A view unobstructed by clouds, vegetation or fire scars is essential for a persistent observation of surface mineralogy. Sensors with a continuous multi-temporal operation (e.g., Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) can provide the data volume needed to come to an optimal seasonal acquisition and the application of data fusion approaches to create an unobstructed view. However, the acquisition environment always changes over time, driven by seasonal changes, illumination changes and the weather. Consequently, the creation of an unobstructed view does not necessarily lead to a repeatable measurement. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of weather and resulting soil moisture conditions over a 3-year period, with alternating dry and wet periods, on the variance of several "geological" spectral indices in a semi-arid area. Sentinel-2 MSI data are chosen to calculate band ratios for green vegetation, ferric and ferrous iron oxide mineralogy and hydroxyl bearing alteration (clay) mineralogy. The data were used "as provided", meaning that the performance of the atmospheric correction and geometric accuracy is not changed. The results are shown as time-series for selected areas that include solid rock, beach sand, bare soil and natural vegetation surfaces. Results show that spectral index values vary not only between dry and wet periods, but also within dry periods longer than 45 days, as a result of changing soil moisture conditions long after a last rain event has passed. In terms of repeatability of measurements, an overall low soil-moisture level is more important for long-term stability of spectral index values than the occurrence of minor rain events. In terms of creating an unobstructed view, we found that thresholds for NDVI should not be higher than 0.1 when masking vegetation in geological remote sensing, which is lower than what usually is indicated in literature. In conclusion, multi-temporal data are not only important to study dynamic Earth processes, but also to improve mapping of surfaces that are seemingly invariant. As this work is based on a few selected pixels, the obtained results should be considered only indicative and not as a numerical truth. We conclude that multi-temporal data can be used to create an unobstructed view, but also to select the data that give the most repeatability of measurements. Images selection should not be based on a certain number of days without rain in the days preceding data acquisition but aim for the lowest soil moisture conditions. Consequently, weather data should be incorporated to come to an optimal selection of remote sensing imagery, and also when analyzing multi-temporal data.

TI  - Mitigating Imbalance of Land Cover Change Data for Deep Learning Models with Temporal and Spatiotemporal Sample Weighting Schemes
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An open problem impeding the use of deep learning (DL) models for forecasting land cover (LC) changes is their bias toward persistent cells. By providing sample weights for model training, LC changes can be allocated greater influence in adjustments to model internal parameters. The main goal of this research study was to implement and evaluate temporal and spatiotemporal sample weighting schemes that manage the influence of persistent and formerly changed areas. The proposed sample weighting schemes allocate higher weights to more recently changed areas based on the inverse temporal and spatiotemporal distance from previous changes occurring at a location or within the location's neighborhood. Four spatiotemporal DL models (CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, CNN-TCN, and ConvLSTM) were used to compare the sample weighting schemes to forecast the LC changes of the Columbia-Shuswap Regional District in British Columbia, Canada, using data obtained from the MODIS annual LC dataset and other auxiliary spatial variables. The results indicate that the presented weighting schemes facilitated improvement over no sample weighting and the common inverse frequency weighting scheme for multi-year LC change forecasts, lowering errors due to quantity while reducing overall allocation error severity. This research study contributes to strategies for addressing the characteristic imbalances of multitemporal LC change datasets for DL modeling endeavors.

TI  - Neck and Shoulder Morbidity in Patients with Oral Cancer and Clinically Negative Node Neck Status: A Comparison between the Elective Neck Dissection and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Strategies
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The choice for the most optimal strategy for patients with a cT(1-2)N(0) carcinoma of the oral cavity, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or elective neck dissection (END), is still open for debate in many head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment centers. One of the possible benefits of the less invasive SLNB could be reduced neck and shoulder morbidity. Recent studies have shown a benefit in favor of SLNB the first year after intervention, but the long-term consequences and differences in neck morbidity remain unclear. This cross-sectional study aimed to research differences in neck and shoulder morbidity and Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QoL) in patients with a cT(1-2)N(0) carcinoma of the oral cavity, treated with either END or SLNB. Neck and shoulder morbidity and HR-QOL were measured with patient-reported questionnaires (SDQ, SPADI, NDI, NDII, EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-HN35) and active range of motion (AROM) measurements. In total 18 patients with END and 20 patients with SLNB were included. We found no differences between END and SLNB for long-term neck morbidity, shoulder morbidity, and HR-QOL. The significant differences found in the rotation of the neck are small and not clinically relevant.

TI  - How Do Different Land Uses/Covers Contribute to Land Surface Temperature and Albedo?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and land surface albedo (LSA) are the two key regional and global climate-controlling parameters; assessing their behavior would likely result in a better understanding of the appropriate adaptation strategies to mitigate the consequences of climate change. This study was conducted to explore the spatiotemporal variability in LST and LSA across different land use/cover (LULC) classes in northwest Iran. To do so, we first applied an object-oriented algorithm to the 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 images of summer 2019 to generate a LULC map of a 3284 km(2) region in northwest Iran. Then, we computed the LST and LSA of each LULC class using the SEBAL algorithm, which was applied to the Landsat-8 images from the summer of 2019 and winter of 2020. The results showed that during the summer season, the maximum and minimum LSA values were associated with barren land (0.33) and water bodies (0.11), respectively; during the winter season, the maximum LSA value was observed for farmland and snow cover, and the minimum value was observed in forest areas (0.21). The maximum and minimum LST values in summer were acquired from rangeland (37 degrees C) and water bodies (24 degrees C), respectively; the maximum and minimum values of winter values were detected in forests (4.14 degrees C) and snow cover (-21.36 degrees C), respectively. Our results revealed that barren land and residential areas, having the maximum LSA in summer, were able to reduce the heating effects to some extent. Forest areas, due to their low LSA and high LST, particularly in winter, had a greater effect on regional warming compared with other LULC classes. Our study suggests that forests might not always mitigate the effects of global warming as much as we expect.

TI  - Current status of mangrove vegetation in Batticaloa Lagoon, Sri Lanka, using high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sporadic patches of mangrove vegetation are unevenly distributed along the coast, particularly in the lagoons, of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has become the first nation in the world who decided to protect its all its mangroves in 2015. Mangrove vegetation is considered as a cost-effective ecosystem-based tool for protecting the country from coastal disasters, such as erosion and tsunamis. Batticaloa Lagoon is one of the major mangrove areas in Sri Lanka. This region underwent degradation of mangroves due to a number of natural and anthropogenic factors, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Mangrove reforestation was conducted after the 2004 tsunami event in this area. The present study investigated the outcome of such activities in this lagoon in eastern Sri Lanka. Spatiotemporal changes in mangroves in Batticaloa Lagoon was estimated using multi-temporal satellite (Landsat, Sentinel-2, RapidEye and PlanetScope) data. The latest mangrove vegetation coverage in Batticaloa Lagoon is estimated as 1567 ha (2022) which is 26% less than the estimated area in 1995. It is estimated that nearly 20% of the total mangrove loss occurred during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and, despite the reforestation initiatives undertaken by various agencies in Batticaloa, the depletion in mangrove coverage and urbanization continued in this region.

TI  - Forest expansion in abandoned agricultural lands has limited effect to offset carbon emissions from Central-North Spain
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the process of carbon (C) accumulation as a consequence of forest expansion in abandoned agricultural lands over the period 1977-2017 in a vast (9.4 million ha) area of Mediterranean continental environment in Central-North Spain. We achieved this objective, through obtaining AGC and BGC estimations based on direct field measurements taken in 30 plots (25 m x 25 m), and extrapolating to the landscape using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data from 2018. Using aerial photographs and forest maps, we found that 145,193 ha of agricultural land in 1957 (1.54% of the study regions' total area) has since then regenerated naturally to forests and woodlands. Although mean AGC and BGC densities were modest (i.e. 18.04 and 6.78 Mg C ha(-1)), they reached relatively large maximum values (i.e. 60 and 21 Mg C ha(-1)). The BGC stock was also very large, representing 37.3% of the total C stock (10 Tg) accumulated. However, we detected a mean annual C sink of 0.25 Tg C center dot year(-1) which barely offset 1.22% of the total regional CO2 emissions. Our findings point to a smaller sequestration potential under Mediterranean continental than under temperate-cold conditions. Nonetheless, the area affected by this process could be larger than detected and many of the recovering lands might have not still reached their C uptake peak. If such lands are to be used to store C, we strongly advocate for the application of active forest management measures to increase their CO2 sequestration potential.

TI  - Entropy Approximation by Machine Learning Regression: Application for Irregularity Evaluation of Images in Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximation of entropies of various types using machine learning (ML) regression methods are shown for the first time. The ML models presented in this study define the complexity of the short time series by approximating dissimilar entropy techniques such as Singular value decomposition entropy (SvdEn), Permutation entropy (PermEn), Sample entropy (SampEn) and Neural Network entropy (NNetEn) and their 2D analogies. A new method for calculating SvdEn(2D), PermEn(2D) and SampEn(2D) for 2D images was tested using the technique of circular kernels. Training and testing datasets on the basis of Sentinel-2 images are presented (two training images and one hundred and ninety-eight testing images). The results of entropy approximation are demonstrated using the example of calculating the 2D entropy of Sentinel-2 images and R-2 metric evaluation. The applicability of the method for the short time series with a length from N = 5 to N = 113 elements is shown. A tendency for the R-2 metric to decrease with an increase in the length of the time series was found. For SvdEn entropy, the regression accuracy is R-2 > 0.99 for N = 5 and R-2 > 0.82 for N = 113. The best metrics were observed for the ML_SvdEn(2D) and ML_NNetEn(2D) models. The results of the study can be used for fundamental research of entropy approximations of various types using ML regression, as well as for accelerating entropy calculations in remote sensing. The versatility of the model is shown on a synthetic chaotic time series using Planck map and logistic map.

TI  - EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE OF FILMS ON DISABILITY
T2  - REVISTA CONRADO
M3  - Article
AB  - Learning aimed at raising awareness about disability can be done through the use of films based on real events. The objective of the work is to implement audiovisual media as a didactic resource to achieve meaningful learning by modeling the awareness of disability in students of social careers. The methodology used was the qualitative one for the purpose of the research to transform the reality regarding the worldview of this type of students towards disability. The fundamental results in this work allow us to better understand the usefulness of the films within the teaching-learning process, it has been shown that it is of interest to analyze aspects in the films such as: the context, the interpersonal relationships of the characters, the condition of health of the person or persons with disabilities, problematic situations, positive and negative attitudes, the barriers they face, the school environment, and technical aids. It can be concluded that the guarantee of a quality and inclusive education is given by laws, where the correct treatment of stereotypes, prejudices, barriers and negative attitudes towards disability will allow us to have a more just and inclusive society. The films facilitate the dynamization of the chair, appropriation of positive values and other sociocultural aspects that must be modeled by human beings.

TI  - Malpractice Claims and Incident Reporting: Two Faces of the Same Coin?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Incident reporting is an important method to identify risks because learning from the reports is crucial in developing and implementing effective improvements. A medical malpractice claims analysis is an important tool in any case. Both incident reports and claims show cases of damage caused to patients, despite incident reporting comprising near misses, cases where no event occurred and no-harm events. We therefore compare the two worlds to assess whether they are similar or definitively different. From 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2021, the claims database of Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS collected 843 claims. From 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021, the incident-reporting database collected 1919 events. In order to compare the two, we used IBNR calculation, usually adopted by the insurance industry to determine loss to a company and to evaluate the real number of adverse events that occurred. Indeed, the number of reported adverse events almost overlapped with the total number of events, which is indicative that incurred-but-not-reported events are practically irrelevant. The distribution of damage events reported as claims in the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021 and related to incidents that occurred in the months of the same period, grouped by quarter, was then compared with the distribution of damage events reported as adverse events and sentinel events in the same period, grouped by quarter. The analysis of the claims database showed that the claims trend is slightly decreasing. However, the analysis of the reports database showed that, in the period 2020-2021, the reports trend was increasing. In our study, the comparison of the two, malpractice claims and incident reporting, documented many differences and weak areas of overlap. Nevertheless, this contribution represents the first attempt to compare the two and new studies focusing on single types of adverse events are, therefore, desirable.

TI  - The Use of Remote Sensing Data for Probabilistic Assessment of an Impact on a Linear Structure
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at developing a remote sensing technique for assessing the probability of an impact on linear engineering structures by the example of lateral river erosion. The suggested approach for assessing the probability of an impact on linear engineering structures takes into account the process of lateral erosion, while bending and straightening of bends is at the same time the main formatting factor for the landscape morphological pattern of alluvial plains. The basis of the technique is a mathematical model of the landscape morphological pattern for alluvial plains. It was essentially tested at key sites within river valleys in different nature environments. The exponential distribution of arrows of the packages and the time of bend development is a general law of the landscape morphological pattern of alluvial plains in different nature environments; numerous testing results confirm it. The model of the morphological pattern of the alluvial plain gives a solution of the quantitative assessment of the impact probability to a linear structure by river erosion under limited conditions; the necessary parameters can be estimated from the remote sensing data.

TI  - Subcapsular Sinus Macrophages Promote Melanoma Metastasis to the Sentinel Lymph Nodes via an IL1?-STAT3 Axis
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - During melanoma metastasis, tumor cells originating in the skin migrate via lymphatic vessels to the sentinel lymph node (sLN). This process facilitates tumor cell spread across the body. Here, we characterized the innate inflammatory response to melanoma in the metastatic microenvironment of the sLN. We found that macrophages located in the subcapsular sinus (SS) produced protumoral IL1a after recognition of tumoral antigens. Moreover, we confirmed that the elimination of LN macrophages or the administration of an IL1a-specific blocking antibody reduced metastatic spread. To understand the mechanism of action of IL1a in the context of the sLN microenvironment, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to microdissected metastases obtained from animals treated with the IL1a-specific blocking antibody. Among the different pathways affected, we identified STAT3 as one of the main targets of IL1a signaling in metastatic tumor cells. Moreover, we found that the antitumoral effect of the anti-IL1a was not mediated by lymphocytes because Il1r1 knock-out mice did not show significant differences in metastasis growth. Finally, we found a synergistic antimetastatic effect of the combination of IL1a blockade and STAT3 inhibition with stattic, highlighting a new immunotherapy approach to prevent-ing melanoma metastasis.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to a conceptual analysis of the basic values of Russian and Georgian linguistic cultures - the concept of "bread", which is included in the repertoire of the most recurrent axiologemes of national language pictures of the world. The authors of the work come to the conclusion that the value picture of the world serves as a teleological vector for the development of culture. At the level of a descriptive essay, the work establishes a correlation between the mentality and the value level of the picture of the world. The corpus of texts (dictionary, paremiological, artistic) of the Russian and Georgian languages, in which the concept of "bread" is represented, served as an illustrative material for the analysis. Typical convergences and divergences of concepts in cognizable cultures are established. The conclusion is made about the common perception of the value of "bread", which is based on the foundation of Christian culture.

M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of satellite monitoring data, the features of large natural fires and the volumes of CO, CO2, and PM2.5 emissions caused by them on the territory of Russian Federation and in its individual regions from April to October 2001-2021 have been studied. It has been found that, in July and August 2021, the average monthly values of the areas covered by fire throughout Russia exceeded by 25 000 and 24 500 km(2) similar values recorded in these months for the period from 2001 to 2020. Excess values of the areas covered by fire in the territory of large regions in 2021 compared to 2020 were revealed: in April in the European part of Russia (by 2100 km(2)), in May in the Ural Federal District (by 6700 km(2)), in the Siberian Federal District (by 8400 km(2)), and in July and August in the Far Eastern Federal District (by 18 400 and 27 000 km(2), respectively). It has been found that, in certain months of 2021, an increase in the contribution of emissions caused by natural fires in the territories of these regions to the total emissions in the country reached 44.9% when compared to 2020. Using satellite data, an analysis was carried out of changes in the gas composition of the atmosphere during the period of strong fires in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) in July 2021, which revealed areas of anomalously high CO and CH4 concentrations and an increase in the aerosol index (AI) from 1.4 to 3.7.

TI  - Assessment of Atmospheric Correction Processors and Spectral Bands for Satellite-Derived Bathymetry Using Sentinel-2 Data in the Middle Adriatic
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) based on multispectral satellite images (MSI) from the satellite's optical sensors is a recent technique for surveying shallow waters. Sentinel-2 satellite mission with an open access policy and high spatial, radiometric, and temporal resolution of MSI-s started a new era in the mapping of coastal bathymetry. More than 90 percent of the electromagnetic (EM) signal received by satellites is due to the atmospheric path of the EM signal. While Sentinel-2 MSI Level 1C provides top-of-atmosphere reflectance, Level 2A provides bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance. The European Space Agency applies the Sen2Cor algorithm for atmospheric correction (AC) to model the atmospheric path of the signal and reduce the MSI reflectance from L1C to L2A over the land area. This research evaluated the performance of different image-based AC processors, namely: Sen2Cor, Acolite, C2RCC, and iCOR for SDB modelling. The empirical log band ratio algorithm was applied to a time series of Sentinel-2 MSI in the middle Adriatic. All AC processors outperformed Sentinel-L2A MSI for SDB. Acolite and iCOR demonstrated accurate performance with a correlation coefficient higher than 90 percent and the RMSE under 2 m for depths up to 20 m. C2RCC produced more robust bathymetry models and was able to retrieve the depth information from more scenes than any other correction. Furthermore, a switch model combining different spectral bands improved mapping in shallow waters, demonstrating the potential of SDB technology for the effective mapping of shallow waters.

In these cohorts, we assessed LTBI testing, clinical management, and treat-ment duration. RESULTS: Among 113,338 patients who filled LTBI prescriptions, 80% (90,377) received isoniazid (INH) only, 19% (21,235) rifampin (RIF) only, and 2% (1,726) INH +rifapentine (RPT). By regimen, the proportion of patients with documented prior testing for TBI was 79%, 54%, and 91%, respectively. Median therapy duration was 84 days (IQR 35-84) for the 3-month once-weekly INH+RPT regimen, 60 days (IQR 30-100) for the 6-to 9-month INH regimen, and 30 days (IQR 2- 60) for the 4-month RIF regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Among the cohorts, INH-only was the most commonly prescribed LTBI treatment. Most persons who filled a prescription for LTBI treatment did not have evidence of completing recommended treatment duration. These data further support prefer-ential use of shorter-course regimens such as INH+RPT.

TI  - Quantifying the Spatio-Temporal Variations and Impacts of Factors on Vegetation Water Use Efficiency Using STL Decomposition and Geodetector Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency of vegetation (WUE), the ratio of carbon gain to water loss, is a valid indicator to describe the photosynthetic carbon-water coupling relationship. Understanding how and why WUE changes are essential for regional ecological conservation. However, the impacts of various factors and their interactions on the spatial variation of WUE remain uncertain in the arid land of Northwest China. Here, we selected the Qilian Mountains (QM) and Hexi Corridor (HC) as the study areas. Supported by the Google Earth Engine, we explored the spatio-temporal variations of WUE in QM and HC for 2002-2021 using STL decomposition (a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure), trend analysis, and the Hurst index. Then, the Geodetector method was applied to quantify impacts of geographical and eco-meteorological factors on the spatial variation of WUE. The WUE in HC was higher than that in QM. Interestingly, the opposite longitude zonality characteristics are shown in the QM and HC. In QM, the WUE showed an upward trend with longitude increasing, while a downward trend with longitude increasing in the oases of HC. The WUE of cropland was the highest (1.15 +/- 0.35 gC kg(-1) H2O), and that of alpine vegetation was the lowest (0.2 +/- 0.15 gC kg(-1) H2O). WUE showed a decreasing trend across the study area, almost certainly due to a drop from May to July during 2002-2021. The air temperature is the dominant factor influencing the spatial variation of WUE. In addition, the interaction of any two factors is greater than the independent influence of either factor alone. The Geodetector method proved to be effective for quantifying the impact of complex multi-factors on the spatial variation of WUE. This study provides a new technical scheme to analyze the spatio-temporal pattern and quantify the impact of multi-factors on the spatial variation of WUE. These findings aid in understanding underlying mechanisms of WUE variation and thereby will be beneficial for clarifying the response of vegetation to climate change.

TI  - How Has Climate Change Driven the Evolution of Rice Distribution in China?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the impact of climate change risks on rice distribution is one of the most important elements of climate risk management. This paper is based on the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform and multi-source remote sensing data; the authors quantitatively extracted rice production distribution data in China from 1990 to 2019, analysed the evolution pattern of rice distribution and clusters and explored the driving effects between climatic and environmental conditions on the evolution of rice production distribution using the non-parametric quantile regression model. The results show that: The spatial variation of rice distribution is significant, mainly concentrated in the northeast, south and southwest regions of China; the distribution of rice in the northeast is expanding, while the distribution of rice in the south is extending northward, showing a spatial evolution trend of "north rising and south retreating". The positive effect of precipitation on the spatial distribution of rice has a significant threshold. This shows that when precipitation is greater than 800 mm, there is a significant positive effect on the spatial distribution of rice production, and this effect will increase with precipitation increases. Climate change may lead to a continuous northward shift in the extent of rice production, especially extending to the northwest of China. This paper's results will help implement more spatially targeted climate change adaptation measures for rice to cope with the changes in food production distribution caused by climate change.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing Identification of Discolored Standing Trees for Pine Wilt Disease Based on Semi-Supervised Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD) is the most dangerous biohazard of pine species and poses a serious threat to forest resources. Coupling satellite remote sensing technology and deep learning technology for the accurate monitoring of PWD is an important tool for the efficient prevention and control of PWD. We used Gaofen-2 remote sensing images to construct a dataset of discolored standing tree samples of PWD and selected three semantic segmentation models-DeepLabv3+, HRNet, and DANet-for training and to compare their performance. To build a GAN-based semi-supervised semantic segmentation model for semi-supervised learning training, the best model was chosen as the generator of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The model was then optimized for structural adjustment and hyperparameter adjustment. Aimed at the characteristics of Gaofen-2 images and discolored standing trees with PWD, this paper adopts three strategies-swelling prediction, raster vectorization, and forest floor mask extraction-to optimize the image identification process and results and conducts an application demonstration study in Nanping city, Fujian Province. The results show that among the three semantic segmentation models, HRNet was the optimal conventional semantic segmentation model for identifying discolored standing trees of PWD based on Gaofen-2 images and that its MIoU value was 68.36%. Additionally, the GAN-based semi-supervised semantic segmentation model GAN_HRNet_Semi improved the MIoU value by 3.10%, and its recognition segmentation accuracy was better than the traditional semantic segmentation model. The recall rate of PWD discolored standing tree monitoring in the demonstration area reached 80.09%. The combination of semi-supervised semantic segmentation technology and high-resolution satellite remote sensing technology provides new technical methods for the accurate wide-scale monitoring, prevention, and control of PWD.

TI  - Coordinated Observations of Migrating Tides by Multiple Meteor Radars in the Equatorial Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the migrating tidal winds decomposed jointly from multiple meteor radars in four longitudinal sectors situated in the equatorial mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The radars are located in Cariri, Brazil (7.4 degrees S, 36.5 degrees W), Kototabang, Indonesia (0.2 degrees S, 100.3 degrees E), Ascension Island, United Kingdom (7.9 degrees S, 14.4 degrees W), and Darwin, Australia (12.3 degrees S, 130.8 degrees E). Harmonic analysis was used to obtain amplitudes and phases for diurnal and semidiurnal solar migrating tides between 82 and 98 km altitude during the period 2005-2008. To verify the reliability of the tidal components calculated by the four meteor radar wind measurements, we also present a similar analysis for the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model winds, which suggests that the migrating tides are well observed by the four different radars. The tides include the important tidal components of diurnal westward-propagating zonal wavenumber 1 and semidiurnal westward-propagating zonal wavenumber 2. In addition, the results based on observations were compared with the Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere (CTMT). In general, in terms of climatic features, our results for the major components of migrating tides are qualitatively consistent with the CTMT models derived from satellite data. In addition, the tidal amplitudes are unusually stronger in January-February 2006. This result is probably because tides were enhanced by the 2006 Northern Hemisphere stratospheric sudden warming event.

TI  - Absorption Pruning of Deep Neural Network for Object Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been widely used for object detection tasks in remote sensing images. However, the over-parametrization problem of DCNNs hinders their application in resource-constrained remote sensing devices. In order to solve this problem, we propose a network pruning method (named absorption pruning) to compress the remote sensing object detection network. Unlike the classical iterative three-stage pruning pipeline used in existing methods, absorption pruning is designed as a four-stage pruning pipeline that only needs to be executed once, which differentiates it from existing methods. Furthermore, the absorption pruning no longer identifies unimportant filters, as in existing pruning methods, but instead selects filters that are easy to learn. In addition, we design a method for pruning ratio adjustment based on the object characteristics in remote sensing images, which can help absorption pruning to better compress deep neural networks for remote sensing image processing. The experimental results on two typical remote sensing data sets-SSDD and RSOD-demonstrate that the absorption pruning method not only can remove 60% of the filter parameters from CenterNet101 harmlessly but also eliminate the over-fitting problem of the pre-trained network.

TI  - Detecting Photovoltaic Installations in Diverse Landscapes Using Open Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation is a vital renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality. Previous studies which explored mapping PV using open satellite data mainly focus in remote areas. However, the complexity of land cover types can bring much difficulty in PV identification. This study investigated detecting PV in diverse landscapes using freely accessible remote sensing data, aiming to evaluate the transferability of PV detection between rural and urbanized coastal area. We developed a random forest-based PV classifier on Google Earth Engine in two provinces of China. Various features including Sentinel-2 reflectance, Sentinel-1 polarization, spectral indices and their corresponding textures were constructed. Thereafter, features with high permutation importance were retained. Three classification schemes with different training and test samples were, respectively, conducted. Finally, the VIIRS nighttime light data were utilized to refine the initial results. Manually collected samples and existing PV database were used to evaluate the accuracy of our method. The results revealed that the top three important features in detecting PV were the sum average texture of three bands (NDBI, VV, and VH). We found the classifier trained in highly urbanized coastal landscape with multiple PV types was more transferable (OA = 97.24%, kappa = 0.94), whereas the classifier trained in rural landscape with simple PV types was erroneous when applied vice versa (OA = 68.84%, kappa = 0.44). The highest accuracy was achieved when using training samples from both regions as expected (OA = 98.90%, kappa = 0.98). Our method recalled more than 94% PV in most existing databases. In particular, our method has a stronger detection ability of PV installed above water surface, which is often missing in existing PV databases. From this study, we found two main types of errors in mapping PV, including the bare rocks and mountain shadows in natural landscapes and the roofing polyethylene materials in urban settlements. In conclusion, the PV classifier trained in highly urbanized coastal landscapes with multiple PV types is more accurate than the classifier trained in rural landscapes. The VIIRS nighttime light data contribute greatly to remove PV detection errors caused by bare rocks and mountain shadows. The finding in our study can provide reference values for future large area PV monitoring.

TI  - Regulation of Evapotranspiration in Different Precipitation Zones and Its Application in High-Temperature and Drought Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When drought occurs in different regions, evapotranspiration (ET) changes differently with the process of drought. To achieve an accurate monitoring of large-scale drought using remote sensing, it is particularly necessary to clarify the temporal and spatial characteristics of ET changes with soil water content (SWC). Firstly, based on the measured data, combined with the artificial intelligence particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, an empirical model of ET retrieval by FY-4A satellite data was established and the spatial-temporal characteristics of ET changes with SWC were further analyzed. Lastly, different ET regulation regions were distinguished to achieve the remote sensing monitoring of large-scale drought based on SWC. The main results are as follows: (1) The correlation coefficient between the ET estimated by the empirical model and the measured value was 0.48 and the root mean square error was 24 W center dot m(-2). (2) In the areas with extreme water shortage, water limits the conversion rate of net radiation (Rn) to ET (ECR) and surpasses Rn to become the determinative factor of ET. (3) In extreme arid areas, ET has a significant positive correlation with WVP and SWC. In other precipitation areas, ET has a significant linear correlation with WVP, but the slope of the linear fitting line is different for precipitation. The relationship between ET and SWC is more complex. In areas with precipitation exceeding 800 mm, the correlation between SWC and ET is not significant. In areas with precipitation between 200 mm and 800 mm or in alpine regions, SWC and ET have a quadratic relationship. (4) ECR has quadratic correlations with WVP and SWC, and ECR reaches the maximum when WVP = 0.182 kPa and SWC = 0.217 m(3)center dot m(-3). ET may be inhibited for water shortage or water supersaturation. (5) In areas where SWC determines ET, the ET stress index (ESI) is inversely proportional to SWC, and in areas where heat affects ET, the ESI is directly proportional to SWC. Therefore, for the accurate monitoring of large-scale drought, various drought monitoring criteria should be determined in different areas and periods, considering information on precipitation, the underlying surface type, and digital elevation.

TI  - Pre-Processing, Quality Assurance, and Use of Global Atmospheric Motion Vector Observations in CRA
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilation of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) is important in the initialization of the atmospheric state in numerical weather prediction models, especially over oceans and at high latitudes where conventional data are sparse. This paper presents a detailed description of the pre-processing, quality assurance, and use of global AMVs in China's first generation of the 40-yr (1979-2018) CRA global atmospheric reanalysis product. A new AMV archive is integrated from near real-time operational Global Telecommunication System data and reprocessed AMV datasets released or produced mainly during 2014-2016 according to a priority principle. To avoid the misuse of data with systematic quality problems, the observations of all 18 types of AMVs from 54 satellites are pre-evaluated over the whole time series. The pre-evaluation system developed by the CRA team is based on the NCEP Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational assimilation system and the ERA-Interim reanalysis product. The AMVs in the new AMV archive are denser than the AMVs prepared for the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis product, the bias and root-mean-square values are smaller, and the time series are steadier. The new AMV archive is assimilated in the CRA product based on the NCEP GSI assimilation procedure and quality control configuration with reference to the pre-evaluation results. This is the first time that the reprocessed AMVs from Fengyun-2 satellites from June 2005 to July 2017 are assimilated in a reanalysis product. The assimilation features inspire confidence in the accuracy and stability of these data. The mean root-mean-square values of the observation minus analysis infrared, water vapor, and visible AMV were 1.5-3.4, 2.7-3.6, and 1.3-2.1 m s-1, respectively. This experience of integrating, pre-evaluating, and assimilating AMV observations is valuable for the next generation of reanalysis products.

TI  - Ecological Environment Evaluation Based on Remote Sensing Ecological Index: A Case Study in East China over the Past 20 Years
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - East China is one of the most active regions in terms of economic and social development, and with the accelerated urbanization process, environmental problems are becoming increasingly prominent. The objective, quantitative, and timely evaluation of spatial and temporal changes in ecological quality is of great significance for environmental protection and decision making. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is an objective, fast, and easy ecological quality monitoring and evaluation technique which has been widely used in the field of ecological research, but it often involves problems of cloud occlusion and stitching difficulties when used to conduct large-scale and long-term monitoring. In this paper, based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, an RSEI was constructed using MODIS data products to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes in ecological quality in East China over the past 20 years. The study shows the following: (1) The mean RSEI values in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were 0.67, 0.55, 0.59, 0.58, and 0.63, respectively, with the mean values first decreasing and then showing a stable increasing trend. In Shanghai and Jiangsu, the mean RSEI values show a fluctuating characteristic of "falling and then rising", and large respective decreases of 32.4% and 25.8% throughout the monitoring period. The RSEI values in Fujian Province showed a relatively stable upward trend during the study period (19% increase). (2) The RSEI spatially correlated clustering maps of the local indicators showed that the regions with a high degree of clustering are mainly located in Quzhou City, Zhejiang Province, Ningde City, Fujian Province, and northern Anhui Province (Bozhou and Huabei). With the promotion of ecological civilization and the enhancement of environmental protection awareness, the vegetation cover has significantly increased, which has led to the rise in RSEI values. The low values are mainly distributed in densely populated areas with more human activity, such as the central-eastern part of Jiangsu Province, central Anhui Province, Shanghai, and northern Zhejiang Province. With the development of cities, impervious surfaces occupy more and more ecological land, which eventually affects the regional RSEI values. (3) This research provides a promising method for the evaluation of spatial and temporal changes in ecological environment quality based on an RSEI and GEE. The image processing, based on GEE cloud computing, can help overcome the problems of missing remote sensing data, chromatic aberrations, and spatial and temporal inconsistency, which could greatly improve the efficiency of image processing and extend the application of the remote sensing ecological index to large-scale, long-term ecological monitoring. The research results can provide a reference for improving the applicability and accuracy of remote sensing ecological indices and provide a theoretical basis for ecological conservation and land management in the context of rapid urbanization.

TI  - Seasonal Variations of Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency and Their Responses to Climate Factors in Inner Mongolia of China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE) is a useful metric to examine the interactions between water and carbon cycles in ecosystems. To reveal the response and adaptation characteristics of different vegetation types within the context of global warming on a regional scale, the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of the seasonal eWUE of various vegetation types in Inner Mongolia from 2001 to 2020 were explored. Based on MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) data and meteorological data, in this study, we estimated eWUE in different seasons in Inner Mongolia and used trend analysis and correlation analysis methods to analyze the relationship between eWUE in spring, summer and autumn and the temperature-precipitation. From 2001 to 2020, in this region, the GPP and ET in spring, summer and autumn showed increasing trends. In addition, the growth rates of GPP and ET in spring and summer were higher than those in autumn. Under the combined effect of GPP and ET, eWUE in different seasons showed a significant decreasing trend (p < 0.05)-this is ascribed to the extent of ET increasing more than GPP, especially in summer, with the most obvious decreasing rate. In terms of spatial trend, in spring and summer, there is a decreasing trend from northeast to southwest. The effects of precipitation and temperature on the eWUE in Inner Mongolia were mainly negatively correlated in the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia with higher altitudes during the spring and autumn seasons. In total, 95.096% of the total area had positive correlations between eWUE and temperature in spring. In summer, the region in which the WUE of the vegetation had an inverse relationship with both the temperature and the amount of precipitation was the largest compared to these regions in spring and autumn.

TI  - DiTBN: Detail Injection-Based Two-Branch Network for Pansharpening of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is one of the main research topics in the field of remote sensing image processing. In pansharpening, the spectral information from a low spatial resolution multispectral (LRMS) image and the spatial information from a high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) image are integrated to obtain a high spatial resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. As a prerequisite for the application of LRMS and PAN images, pansharpening has received extensive attention from researchers, and many pansharpening methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proposed. However, most CNN-based methods regard pansharpening as a super-resolution reconstruction problem, which may not make full use of the feature information in two types of source images. Inspired by the PanNet model, this paper proposes a detail injection-based two-branch network (DiTBN) for pansharpening. In order to obtain the most abundant spatial detail features, a two-branch network is designed to extract features from the high-frequency component of the PAN image and the multispectral image. Moreover, the feature information provided by source images is reused in the network to further improve information utilization. In order to avoid the training difficulty for a real dataset, a new loss function is introduced to enhance the spectral and spatial consistency between the fused HRMS image and the input images. Experiments on different datasets show that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations as compared with several advanced pansharpening methods.

Many of these morphology-based genera, such as Chaetomium, Thielavia and Humicola, have been redefined using multigene phylogenetic analysis combined with morphology; however, a comprehensive taxonomic overview of the family is lacking. In addition, the phylogenetic relationship of thermophilic Chaetomiaceae species with non-thermophilic taxa in the family is largely unclear due to limited taxon sampling in previous studies. In this study, we provide an up-to-date overview on the taxonomy and phylogeny of genera and species belonging to Chaetomiaceae, including an extensive taxon sampling of thermophiles. A multigene phylogenetic analysis based on the ITS (internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 including the 5.8S nrDNA), LSU (D1/D2 domains of the 28S nrDNA), rpb2 (partial RNA polymerase II second largest subunit gene) and tub2 (beta-tubulin gene) sequences was performed on 345 strains representing Chaetomiaceae and 58 strains of other families in Sordariales. Divergence times based on the multi-gene phylogeny were estimated as aid to determine the genera in the family. Genera were delimited following the criteria that a genus must be a statistically well-supported monophyletic Glade in both the multigene phylogeny and molecular dating analysis, fall within a divergence time of over 27 million years ago, and be supported by ecological preference or phenotypic traits. Based on the results of the phylogeny and molecular dating analyses, combined with morphological characters and temperature-growth characteristics, 50 genera and 275 species are accepted in Chaetomiaceae. Among them, six new genera, six new species, 45 new combinations and three new names are proposed. The results demonstrate that the thermophilic species fall into seven genera (Melanocarpus, Mycothermus, Remersonia, Thermocarpiscus gen. nov., Thermochaetoides gen. nov., Thermothelomyces and Thermothielavioides). These genera cluster in six separate lineages, suggesting that thermophiles independently evolved at least six times within the family. A list of accepted genera and species in Chaetomiaceae, together with information on their MycoBank numbers, living ex-type strains and GenBank accession numbers to ITS, LSU, rpb2 and tub2 sequences is provided. Furthermore, we provide suggestions how to describe and identify Chaetomiaceae species.

TI  - Grid-Based Essential Urban Land Use Classification: A Data and Model Driven Mapping Framework in Xiamen City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely mapping of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) is vital to understanding urban land use distribution, pattern, and composition. Recent advances in leveraging big open data and machine learning algorithms have demonstrated the possibility of large-scale mapping of EULUC in a new cost-effective way. However, they are still limited by the transferability of samples, models, and classification results across space, particularly across different cities. Given the heterogeneities of environmental and socioeconomic conditions among cities, in-depth studies of data and model adaptation towards city-specific EULUC mappings are highly required to support policy making, and urban renewal planning and management practices. In addition, the trending need for timely and detailed small land unit data processing with finer data granularity becomes increasingly important. We proposed a City Meta Unit (CMU) data model and classification framework driven by multisource data and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to address these challenges. The CMU Framework was innovatively applied to systematically set up a grid-based data model and classify urban land use with an improved AI algorithm by applying Moore neighborhood correlations. Specifically, we selected Xiamen, Fujian, in China, a coastal city, as the typical testbed to implement this proposed framework and apply an AI transfer learning technique for grid and parcel land-use study. Experimental results with our proposed CMU framework showed that the grid-based land use classification performance achieves overall accuracies of 81.17% and 76.55% for level I (major classes) and level II (minor classes), which is much higher than the parcel-based land use classification (overall accuracies of 72.37% for level I, and 68.99% for level II). We further investigated the relationship between training sample size and classification performance and quantified the contribution of different data sources to urban land use classifications. The CMU framework makes data collections and processing intelligent and efficient, with finer granularity, saving time and cost by using existing open social data. Incorporating the CMU framework with the proposed grid-based model is an effective and new approach for urban land use classification, which can be flexibly extended and applied to various cities.

TI  - Detecting Spatially Non-Stationary between Vegetation and Related Factors in the Yellow River Basin from 1986 to 2021 Using Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression Based on Landsat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important ecological barrier in northern China, the ecological environment of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) has been greatly improved in recent decades. However, due to spatially non-stationarity, the contribution of human activities and natural factors to vegetation restoration may exhibit different coupling effects in various areas. In this paper, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the YRB from 1986 to 2021 was used as the dependent variable, and terrain, meteorological, and socioeconomic factors were used as independent variables. With the help of Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR), which could handle the scale difference well, combined with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and traditional Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), the spatial non-stationary relationship between vegetation and related factors was discussed. The results showed that: (1) The vegetation was subject to fluctuating changes from 1986 to 2021, mainly improving, with a growth rate of 0.0018/year; the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation in the basin was high in the southeast and low in the northwest. (2) Compared with the OLS and GWR, the MGWR could better explain the relationship between vegetation and various factors. (3) The response scale of vegetation and related factors was significantly variant, and this scale changed with time. The effect scale of terrain factor is lower than climate and social factors. (4) There was obvious spatial heterogeneity in the effects of various influencing factors on vegetation. The vegetation of the upstream was mainly positively affected by mean annual temperature (coefficients is an element of [1.507, 1.784]); while potential evapotranspiration was the dominant factor of vegetation in the middle and lower reaches of the basin (coefficients is an element of [-1.724, -1.704]); it was worth noting that the influence of social factors on vegetation was relatively small. This study deeply explores the spatial non-stationarity of vegetation and various related factors, thereby revealing the evolution law of vegetation pattern and providing scientific support for monitoring and improving the ecological environment quality of the YRB.

TI  - Inversion of Wheat Leaf Area Index by Multivariate Red-Edge Spectral Vegetation Index
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter that determines the growth status of winter wheat and impacts the ecological and physical processes of plants in ecosystems. The problem of spectral saturation of winter wheat LAI at the booting stage was easily caused by the inversion of the univariate red-edge spectral vegetation index constructed by the red-edge band. In this paper, a new method that the univariate red-edge spectral vegetation index constructed in the red-edge band is used to invert the spectral saturation of the winter wheat LAI. The multivariable red-edge spectral vegetation index is used to invert the winter wheat LAI. This method can effectively delay the phenomenon of spectral saturation and improve the inversion precision. In this study, the Sentinel-2 data were used to invert the winter wheat LAI. An univariate and multivariate red-edge spectral vegetation index regression model was constructed based on the Red-edge Normalized Difference Spectral Indices 1 (NDSI1), Red-edge Normalized Difference Spectral Indices 2 (NDSI2), Red-edge Normalized Difference Spectral Indices 3 (NDSI3), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI), MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI), and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI). Based on the correlation coefficient, the coefficient of determination (R-2), the root mean square error (RMSE) and noise equivalent value (NE), the best model was selected and verified to generate an inverted map. The results showed that the multivariable red-edge spectral vegetation index of NDSI1 + NDSI2 + NDSI3 + TCARI/OSAVI + MCARI + MTCI + TCARI was the best model for inverting the winter wheat LAI. The R-2, the RMSE and the NE values were all satisfied the requirements of the inversion precision (R-2 = 0.8372/0.8818, RMSE = 0.2518/0.1985, NE = 5/5). In summary, this method can be used to judge the growth of winter wheat and provide an accurate basis for monitoring crop growth.

TI  - Improving the Interpretability and Reliability of Regional Land Cover Classification by U-Net Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and reliable interpretation of regional land cover data is very important for natural resource monitoring and environmental assessment. At present, refined land cover data are mainly obtained by manual visual interpretation, which has the problems of heavy workload and inconsistent interpretation scales. Deep learning has greatly improved the automatic processing and analysis of remote sensing data. However, the accurate interpretation of feature information from massive datasets remains a difficult problem in wide regional land cover classification. To improve the efficiency of deep learning-based remote sensing image interpretation, we selected multisource remote sensing data, assessed the interpretability of the U-Net model based on surface spatial scenes with different levels of complexity, and proposed a new method of stereoscopic accuracy verification (SAV) to evaluate the reliability of the classification result. The results show that classification accuracy is more highly correlated with terrain and landscape than with other factors related to image data, such as platform and spatial resolution. As the complexity of surface spatial scenes increases, the accuracy of the classification results mainly shows a fluctuating declining trend. We also find the distribution characteristics from the SAV evaluation results of different land cover types in each surface spatial scene. Based on the results observed in this study, we consider the distinction of interpretability and reliability in diverse ground object types and design targeted classification strategies for different surface scenes, which can greatly improve the classification efficiency. The key achievement of this study is to provide the theoretical basis for remote sensing information analysis and an accuracy evaluation method for regional land cover classification, and the proposed method can help improve the likelihood that intelligent interpretation can replace manual acquisition.

TI  - Rapid Estimation of Decameter FPAR from Sentinel-2 Imagery on the Google Earth Engine
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a direct indicator of vegetation photosynthesis, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) serves as a critical input in a series of land surface models. While existing satellite FPAR products are generally at coarse resolutions ranging from 250 m to 1 km, operational FPAR products at fine resolution are urgently needed in studying land surface processes at the plot scale. However, existing methods for estimating fine-resolution FPAR were mainly designed for Landsat data, and few studies have attempted to develop algorithms for Sentinel-2 data. In particular, the operational estimation of decameter FPAR has a higher requirement for the algorithms in terms of generalizability, efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability to Sentinel-2 data. In this paper, we developed a retrieval chain on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to estimate FPAR by learning the relationship between MODIS FPAR and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance. Scale-consistent multilinear models were used to model the relationship between MODIS FPAR and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance, and the model coefficients were regressed from the selected training samples. To account for the spectral and spatial characteristics of the Sentinel-2 data, we designed criteria for selecting training samples and compared different band combinations. Three strategies for band combination were used: (1) green, red, and near infrared (NIR) bands at 10 m resolution (i.e., three bands); (2) green, red, NIR, and red edge (RE) 1, RE2, and RE3 bands at 20 m resolution (i.e., five bands); and (3) green, red, NIR, RE1, RE2, RE3, shortwave infrared1 (SWIR1) and SWIR2 bands at 20 m resolution (i.e., eight bands). Meanwhile, the official Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) method has also been implemented to estimate the Sentinel FPAR at 10 m and 20 m resolutions for comparison. Both methods were applied to the western Guanzhong area, Shaanxi Province, China, for FPAR estimation of all cloud-free Sentinel-2 images in 2021. The results show that the scaling-based method using five bands at 20 m resolution was the most accurate compared to the in situ measurements (RMSE = 0.076 and R-2 = 0.626), which outperformed the SNAP method at 10 m and 20 m resolutions and the scaling-based method using other strategies. The results of the scaling-based method using all three strategies were highly consistent with the MODIS FPAR product, while the SNAP method systematically underestimated FPAR values compared to the MODIS FPAR products. The proposed method is more ready-to-use and more efficient than SNAP software. Considering that the service of the MODIS sensor is overdue, the proposed method can be extended to alternatives to MODIS products, such as VIIRS and Sentinel-3 data.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Characteristics of Different Oases and Effects of Human Activities on Evapotranspiration in Heihe River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration plays a decisive role in the whole oasis ecosystem and is an important factor to maintain the ecological stability of oases. To quantitatively analyze the evapotranspiration differences of oases at different scales and the expansion of urbanization, it is necessary to compare and discuss them at different time scales. In this study, the spatial and temporal characteristics of evapotranspiration of Zhangye Oasis, Jinta Oasis, and Ejina Oasis in the Heihe River basin were analyzed by using the remote sensing dataset of daily surface evapotranspiration of 100 m resolution from 2010 to 2016. The difference in evapotranspiration intensity in different oases was analyzed, and the influences of irrigation and urbanization expansion on evapotranspiration were discussed. The conclusion is as follows: Zhangye Oasis is the largest oasis in the area and, compared with other oases, due to the largest proportion of wetland and farmland in the underlying surface, the intensity of evapotranspiration is also the largest, reaching 650 mm/year on average. There is no obvious annual change; the range of evapotranspiration changes fluctuates between positive and negative 60 mm/year. Jinta Oasis began to decline after 2012; the evapotranspiration value dropped from 620 mm/tear to 560 mm/year, while Ejina Oasis showed a slight increase after 2014. In the irrigation stage, the evapotranspiration intensity increased significantly. Especially in the peak season of crop growth, the evapotranspiration after irrigation increased by 4 mm/day compared with that before irrigation. The evapotranspiration in urban and oasis areas is different in summer: compare that of 2010 with 2016-the evapotranspiration intensity of the expanding towns in the northeast direction decreased by about 50 mm/month, the northwest expanding towns decreased by about 110 mm/month. There was no obvious annual change in evapotranspiration in the urban area. With the expansion of urbanization, the evapotranspiration intensity in oases decreased. The results of this study provide some reference for the study of oasis irrigation activities and urbanization expansion.

TI  - A Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation Method for Landslide Scene Based on Transformer Architecture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation technology based on deep learning has developed rapidly. It is widely used in remote sensing image recognition, but is rarely used in natural disaster scenes, especially in landslide disasters. After a landslide disaster occurs, it is necessary to quickly carry out rescue and ecological restoration work, using satellite data or aerial photography data to quickly analyze the landslide area. However, the precise location and area estimation of the landslide area is still a difficult problem. Therefore, we propose a deep learning semantic segmentation method based on Encoder-Decoder architecture for landslide recognition, called the Separable Channel Attention Network (SCANet). The SCANet consists of a Poolformer encoder and a Separable Channel Attention Feature Pyramid Network (SCA-FPN) decoder. Firstly, the Poolformer can extract global semantic information at different levels with the help of transformer architecture, and it greatly reduces computational complexity of the network by using pooling operations instead of a self-attention mechanism. Secondly, the SCA-FPN we designed can fuse multi-scale semantic information and complete pixel-level prediction of remote sensing images. Without bells and whistles, our proposed SCANet outperformed the mainstream semantic segmentation networks with fewer model parameters on our self-built landslide dataset. The mIoU scores of SCANet are 1.95% higher than ResNet50-Unet, especially.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval by Integrating SAR and Optical Data over Winter Wheat Fields
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) retrieval over agricultural fields using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is often hindered by the vegetation layer and soil roughness. Most SM inversion algorithms require in situ SM data for a calibration to eliminate these two disturbing factors, while collecting in situ data is a project that consumes a lot of manpower and resources. This paper aims to tentatively develop an inversion algorithm for retrieving SM in the absence of in situ SM in areas covered by winter wheat vegetation. Based on the analysis of the data set simulated by the Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS) model, an improved ratio model is proposed to remove the effect of the vegetation layer. Through the parameterization of the advanced integral equation model (AIEM), the effect of the soil roughness on the inversion of soil moisture is eliminated. The spatial distribution of SM in winter wheat fields is obtained using the Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 images. The comparison results between the inverted SM and the in situ measured data reveal a good correlation (R = 0.85, RMSE = 0.032 cm(3)center dot cm(-3)), and the result confirms that the algorithm developed only based on theoretical models can also effectively monitor the spatial changes of SM over winter wheat fields.

TI  - Reconstruction of High-Resolution Sea Surface Salinity over 2003-2020 in the South China Sea Using the Machine Learning Algorithm LightGBM Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity, as one of the essential physical properties of seawater, is a common tracer differentiating water masses in the ocean, which often require relatively high-resolution datasets. Limited by the coverage of direct observations, however, high-resolution spatial and temporal salinity data are not always available, which hinders the fine application of salinity data in discerning ocean processes and improved modeling of ocean physics and biogeochemistry. To supplement the salinity database, we reconstructed sea surface salinity (SSS) with reasonably high spatial resolution (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees) over 2003-2020 in the South China Sea (SCS) with a machine learning algorithm based on a combination of MODIS-Aqua remote sensing data and a large cruise observation-based dataset. The reconstructed SSS has a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.2 when compared with our underway observations with a corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3. The MAE between station-based observations and our reconstruction was 0.5, and the RMSE was 0.7. These validations strongly suggest that our reconstruction is highly adequate, representing at most a quarter of the identified discrepancies compared to the remote sensing SSS or two other prevalent model-derived datasets. Based on our reconstruction, the SSS in the SCS is relatively low in coastal waters, but high in the ocean basin, with a seasonal pattern with a minimum in the summer and a maximum in the winter. This spatio-temporal distribution is well consistent with the observations and is affected by the Pearl River plume, sea surface circulation, and precipitation. Using our reconstructed SSS, we were able to successfully characterize the spreading of the Pearl River and Mekong River plumes and the intrusion of the Kuroshio Current from the Pacific Ocean into the SCS.

TI  - Applying OHSA to Detect Road Accident Blackspots
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing numbers of crashes and injuries, understanding traffic accident spatial patterns and identifying blackspots is critical to improve overall road safety. This study aims at detecting blackspots using optimized hot spot analysis (OHSA). Traffic accidents were classified by their participants and severity to explore the relationship between blackspots and different types of accidents. Based on the outputs of incremental spatial autocorrelation, OHSA was then implemented on different types of accidents. Finally, the performance of OHSA in evaluating the road safety level of the proposed RBT index are examined using a binary correlation analysis (i.e., R-2 = 0.89). The results show that: (1) The optimal scale distance varies from 0.6 km to 2.8 km and is influenced by the distance of the travel mode. (2) Central cities, with 54.6% of the total accidents, experiences more rigorous challenges regarding traffic safety than satellite cities. (3) There are many types of black spots in vulnerable communities, but in some specific areas, there are only black spots of non-motor vehicle accidents. Considering the practical significance of the above results, policy makers and traffic engineers are expected to give higher attention to central cities and vulnerable communities or prioritize the implementation of relevant optimization measures.

TI  - Sub optimal HIV status ascertainment at antenatal clinics and the impact on HIV prevalence estimates: A cross sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background While many countries including Kenya transitioned from sentinel surveillance to the use of routine antenatal care (ANC) data to estimate the burden of HIV, countries in Sub Saharan Africa reported several challenges of this transition, including low uptake of HIV testing and sub national / site-level differences in HIV prevalence estimates. In Kenya voluntary HIV testing is offered to all 1(st) ANC clients. However, some women may decline testing. We aim to predict the HIV positivity (as a proxy of prevalence) at ANC assuming 100% uptake of HIV testing and compare this to the observed positivity.Methods Using a cross sectional study design, we examine routine data on HIV testing among all women attending ANC in Kwale County, Kenya, for the period January 2015 to December 2019.We used a generalized estimating equation with binomial distribution to model the observed HIV prevalence as explained by HIV status ascertainment. We then used marginal standardization to predict the HIV prevalence at 100% HIV status ascertainment and make recommendations to improve the utility of ANC routine data for HIV surveillance.Results HIV testing at ANC was at 91.3%, slightly above the global target of 90%. If there was 100% HIV status ascertainment at ANC, the HIV prevalence would be 2.7% (95% CI 2.3-3.2). This was 0.3% lower than the observed prevalence. Across the yearly predictions, there was no difference between the observed and predicted values except for 2018 where the HIV prevalence was underestimated with an absolute bias of -0.2 percent. This implies missed opportunities for identifying new HIV infections in the year 2018.Conclusions Imperfect HIV status ascertainment at ANC overestimates HIV prevalence among women attending ANC in Kwale County. However, the use of ANC routine data may underestimate the true population prevalence. There is need to address both community level and health facility level barriers to the uptake of ANC services.

TI  - Water Quality Grade Identification for Lakes in Middle Reaches of Yangtze River Using Landsat-8 Data with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality grade is an intuitive element for people to understand the condition of water quality. However, in situ water quality grade measurements are often labor intensive, which makes measurement over large areas very costly and laborious. In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of remote sensing techniques in monitoring water quality. In order to automatically extract the water quality information, machine learning technologies have been widely applied in remote sensing data interoperation. In this study, Landsat-8 data and deep neural networks (DNN) were employed to identify the water quality grades of lakes in two cities, Wuhan and Huangshi, in the middle reach of the Yangtze River, central China. Additionally, linear support vector machine (L-SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) were selected as comparative methods. The experimental results showed that DNN achieved the most promising performance compared to the other approaches. For the lakes in Wuhan, DNN gave water quality results with overall accuracy (OA) of 93.37% and Kappa of 0.9028. For the lakes in Huangshi, OA and kappa given by DNN were 96.39% and 0.951, respectively. The results show that the use of remote sensing images for water quality grade monitoring is effective. In the future, our method can be used for water quality monitoring of lakes in large areas at a low cost.

TI  - Use of fluorescence imaging and indocyanine green during colorectal surgery: Results of an intercontinental Delphi survey
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green is increasingly being used in colorectal surgery to assess anastomotic perfusion, and to detect sentinel lymph nodes.Methods: In this 2-round, online, Delphi survey, 35 international experts were asked to vote on 69 statements pertaining to patient preparation and contraindications to fluorescence imaging during colorectal surgery, indications, technical aspects, potential advantages/disadvantages, and effectiveness versus limitations, and training and research. Methodological steps were adopted during survey design to minimize risk of bias.Results: More than 70% consensus was reached on 60 of 69 statements, including moderate-strong consensus regarding fluorescence imaging's value assessing anastomotic perfusion and leak risk, but not on its value mapping sentinel nodes. Similarly, although consensus was reached regarding most technical aspects of its use assessing anastomoses, little consensus was achieved for lymph-node assessments. Evaluating anastomoses, experts agreed that the optimum total indocyanine green dose and timing are 5 to 10 mg and 30 to 60 seconds pre-evaluation, indocyanine green should be dosed milligram/kilogram, lines should be flushed with saline, and indocyanine green can be readministered if bright perfusion is not achieved, although how long surgeons should wait remains unknown. The only consensus achieved for lymph-node assessments was that 2 to 4 injection points are needed. Ninety-six percent and 100% consensus were reached that fluorescence imaging will increase in practice and research over the next decade, respectively.Conclusion: Although further research remains necessary, fluorescence imaging appears to have value assessing anastomotic perfusion, but its value for lymph-node mapping remains questionable.

TI  - Potential for Microbial Cross Contamination of Laundry from Public Washing Machines
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although clothes washing machines remove dirt, microorganisms are not reliably removed by modern cold-water machine-washing practices. Microbial bioburden on clothing originates from the wearer's skin, the environment (indoor and outdoor), and the washing machine itself. While most clothing microbes are commensals, microbes causing odors and opportunistic pathogens may also be present. Understanding the extent of microbial transfer from washing machines to clothes may inform strategies for odor control and for mitigating the transmission of microbes through the laundering process. This study was designed to quantify and identify bacteria/fungi transferred from laundromat machines to sentinel cotton washcloths under standard cold-water conditions. Bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS sequencing enabled identification of microorganisms in the washcloths following laundering. Total plate-based enumeration of viable microorganisms also was performed, using growth media appropriate for bacteria and fungi. Opportunistic human bacterial pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., were recovered. The fungal bioburden was similar to two-fold lower than the bacterial bioburden. Most sequences recovered were assigned to non-pathogenic fungi, such as those from genera Malassezia and Ascomycota. These results suggest that public washing machines represent a source of non-pathogenic and pathogenic microbial contamination of laundered garments.

TI  - Glacial Outburst Floods Responsible for Major Environmental Shift in Arctic Coastal Catchment, Rekvedbukta, Albert I Land, Svalbard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Small Arctic coastal catchments and coastal lagoon systems are some of the most vulnerable to climate change. Glacial retreat and the development of glacial lakes and drainage systems provide opportunities for hazardous events such as GLOFs. We observe that the stability of lagoons and their associated barriers are controlled by the frequency and magnitude of storms approaching the coasts, access to sediment supplies and resilience to sea-level rise. Based on multidecadal remote sensing data, we were able to identify the rate of glacial recession, the development of glacial lakes, vegetation response to climate change and a GLOF event, and shoreline and lagoon responses to the environmental shifts within the small catchment. Here we present an example of lagoon system evolution where a glacial outburst flood exerted significant control over lagoon drainage and coastal barrier stability.

TI  - Slip Models of the 2016 and 2022 Menyuan, China, Earthquakes, Illustrating Regional Tectonic Structures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the large-scale block-bounding faults in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, the Qilian-Haiyuan fault system accommodates a large portion of north-eastward motion of the Tibetan Plateau. In 2016 and 2022, two strong earthquakes of Mw6.0 and Mw6.6 occurred in the Menyuan area near the Lenglongling fault (LLLF) at the western segment of the Qilian-Haiyuan fault. These two adjoining events, only 40 km apart, exhibited notable differences in focal mechanisms and rupture kinematics, indicating complex fault geometries and tectonic structures in the region, which are still poorly known. Here, we obtained an interseismic velocity map spanning 2014-2020 in the Menyuan region using Sentinel-1 InSAR data to probe strain accumulation across the LLLF. We obtained the coseismic deformation fields of the two Menyuan earthquakes using InSAR data and inverted out their slip distributions. We calculated the Coulomb stress changes to examine the interactions and triggering relationship between two ruptures and to access regional seismic potential. We found that the 2016 earthquake was a buried thrust event that occurred on the northern LLLF, whilst the 2022 earthquake was a left-lateral strike-slip event that occurred on the western end of the LLLF. We indicated there may be no direct triggering relationship between two spatiotemporally adjacent earthquakes. However, the 2022 earthquake caused a remarkable stress perturbation to the surrounding area. Particularly, a large area with notable stress increase stands out along the Tuolaishan fault and the LLLF, likely posing a high seismic hazard in the region.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity and Temporal Variation in Urban Surface Albedo Detected by High-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo is one of the key parameters in the surface energy balance and it has been altered due to urban expansion, which has significant impacts on local and regional climate. Many previous studies have demonstrated that changes in the urban surface albedo are strongly related to the city's heterogeneity and have significant spatial-temporal characteristics but fail to address the albedo of the urban surface as a unique variable in urban thermal environment research. This study selects Beijing as the experimental area for exploring the spatial-temporal characteristics of the urban surface albedo and the albedo's uniqueness in environmental research on urban spaces. Our results show that the urban surface albedo at high spatial resolution can better represent the urban spatial heterogeneity, seasonal variation, building canyon, and pixel adjacency effects. Urban surface albedo is associated with building density and height, land surface temperature (LST), and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). Furthermore, albedo can reflect livability and environmental rating due to the variances of building materials and architectural formats in the urban development. Hence, we argue that the albedo of the urban surface can be considered as a unique variable for improving the acknowledgment of the urban environment and human livability with wider application in urban environmental research.

TI  - MIX-RS: A Multi-Indexing System Based on HDFS for Remote Sensing Data Storage
T2  - TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A large volume of Remote Sensing (RS) data has been generated with the deployment of satellite technologies. The data facilitate research in ecological monitoring, land management and desertification, etc. The characteristics of RS data (e.g., enormous volume, large single-file size, and demanding requirement of fault tolerance) make the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) an ideal choice for RS data storage as it is efficient, scalable, and equipped with a data replication mechanism for failure resilience. To use RS data, one of the most important techniques is geospatial indexing. However, the large data volume makes it time-consuming to efficiently construct and leverage. Considering that most modern geospatial data centres are equipped with HDFS-based big data processing infrastructures, deploying multiple geospatial indices becomes natural to optimise the efficacy. Moreover, because of the reliability introduced by high-quality hardware and the infrequently modified property of the RS data, the use of multi-indexing will not cause large overhead. Therefore, we design a framework called Multi-IndeXing-RS (MIX-RS) that unifies the multi-indexing mechanism on top of the HDFS with data replication enabled for both fault tolerance and geospatial indexing efficiency. Given the fault tolerance provided by the HDFS, RS data are structurally stored inside for faster geospatial indexing. Additionally, multi-indexing enhances efficiency. The proposed technique naturally sits on top of the HDFS to form a holistic framework without incurring severe overhead or sophisticated system implementation efforts. The MIX-RS framework is implemented and evaluated using real remote sensing data provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, demonstrating excellent geospatial indexing performance.

TI  - Assessment of Effective Roughness Parameters for Simulating Sentinel-1A Observation and Retrieving Soil Moisture over Sparsely Vegetated Field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of surface roughness may lead to relatively large dynamic of backscatter coefficient observed by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which complicates the soil moisture (SM) retrieval process based on active remote sensing. The effective roughness parameters are commonly used for parameterizing the soil scattering models, the values of which are often assumed to be constant during different study periods for the same site. This paper investigates the reasonableness of this hypothesis from the perspective of backscatter coefficient simulation and SM retrieval using high resolution SAR data. Three years of Sentinel-1A data from 2016 to 2018 were collected over a sparsely vegetated field within the REMEDHUS SM monitoring network. The advanced integral equation model (AIEM) and Dobson dielectric mixing model were combined for optimizing the effective roughness parameters, as well as simulating the backscatter coefficient and retrieving the SM. The effective roughness parameters were optimized at different temporal periods, such as 2016, 2017, 2018, 2016 + 2017, 2017 + 2018, and 2016 + 2017 + 2018, to analyze their temporal dynamics. It was found that: (1) the effective roughness parameters optimized at different temporal periods are very close to each other; (2) the simulated backscatter from AIEM is consistent with Sentinel-1A observation with root mean square errors (RMSEs) between 1.133 and 1.163 dB and correlation coefficient (R) value equals to 0.616; (3) the seasonal dynamics ofin situ SM is well-captured by the retrieved SM with R values floating at 0.685 and RMSEs ranging from 0.049 to 0.052 m(3)/m(3); and (4) inverse of the AIEM with the implementation of effective roughness parameters achieves better performance for SM retrieval than the change detection method. These findings demonstrate that the assumption on the constant effective roughness parameters during the study period of at least three years is reasonable.

TI  - Generating Salt-Affected Irrigated Cropland Map in an Arid and Semi-Arid Region Using Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a widespread environmental hazard and a major abiotic constraint affecting global food production and threatening food security. Salt-affected cropland is widely distributed in China, and the problem of salinization in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is particularly prominent. The salt-affected soil in Inner Mongolia is 1.75 million hectares, accounting for 14.8% of the total land. Therefore, mapping saline cropland in the irrigation district of Inner Mongolia could evaluate the impacts of cropland soil salinization on the environment and food security. This study hypothesized that a reasonably accurate regional map of salt-affected cropland would result from a ground sampling approach based on PlanetScope images and the methodology developed by Sentinel multi-sensor images employing the machine learning algorithm in the cloud computing platform. Thus, a model was developed to create the salt-affected cropland map of HID in 2021 based on the modified cropland base map, valid saline and non-saline samples through consistency testing, and various spectral parameters, such as reflectance bands, published salinity indices, vegetation indices, and texture information. Additionally, multi-sensor data of Sentinel from dry and wet seasons were used to determine the best solution for mapping saline cropland. The results imply that combining the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data could map the soil salinity in HID during the dry season with reasonable accuracy and close to real time. Then, the indicators derived from the confusion matrix were used to validate the established model. As a result, the combined dataset, which included reflectance bands, spectral indices, vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit-horizontal receive (VH) polarization, and texture information, outperformed the highest overall accuracy at 0.8938, while the F1 scores for saline cropland and non-saline cropland are 0.8687 and 0.9109, respectively. According to the analyses conducted for this study, salt-affected cropland can be detected more accurately during the dry season by using just Sentinel images from March to April. The findings of this study provide a clear explanation of the efficiency and standardization of salt-affected cropland mapping in arid and semi-arid regions, with significant potential for applicability outside the current study area.

TI  - Assessing Vegetation Phenology across Different Biomes in Temperate China-Comparing GIMMS and MODIS NDVI Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing vegetation phenology is very important for better understanding the impact of climate change on the ecosystem, and many vegetation index datasets from different remote sensors have been used to quantify vegetation phenology from a regional to global perspective. This study mainly analyzes the similarities and differences in phenology derived from GIMMS NDVI3g and MODIS NDVI datasets across different biomes throughout temperate China. We applied three commonly used methods to extract the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS) from two datasets between 2000 and 2015, and analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics and trends of key phenological parameters between these two datasets in temperate China. Results showed that the multi-year mean GIMMS NDVI was higher than MODIS NDVI throughout most of temperate China, and the consistencies between GIMMS NDVI and MODIS NDVI for all biomes in the senescence phase were better than those in the green-up phase. NDVI differences between GIMMS and MODIS resulted in some distinctions between phenology derived from the two datasets. The results of SOS and EOS for three methods also showed wide discrepancies in spatial patterns, especially in SOS. For different biomes, differences of SOS in forests were obviously less than that in shrublands, grasslands-IM, grasslands-QT and meadows, whereas the differences of EOS in forests were relatively greater than that in SOS. Moreover, large differences of phenological trends were found between GIMMS and MODIS datasets from 2000 to 2015 in entire region and different biomes, and it is particularly noteworthy that both SOS and EOS showed a low proportion of the identical significant trends. The results suggested NDVI datasets obtained from GIMMS and MODIS sensors could induce the differences of the inversion of vegetation phenology in some degree due to the differences of instrumental characteristics between these two sensors. These findings highlighted that inter-calibrate datasets derived from different satellite sensors for some biomes (e.g., grasslands) should be needed when analyzing land surface phenology and their trends, and also provided baseline information for choosing different NDVI datasets in subsequent studies on vegetation patterns and dynamics.

TI  - Using POI and time series Landsat data to identify and rebuilt surface mining, vegetation disturbance and land reclamation process based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of coal resources is necessary, but it has a huge negative impact on land, ecology, and the environment. With the increasing awareness of environmental protection and the requirements of related reg-ulations, the design and practice of reclamation projects run through the mining life cycle and continue for a long time after the coal production. High-precision monitoring of mining disturbance and reclamation, quantifying the degree and time of vegetation disturbance and restoration, is of great significance to minimize the envi-ronmental effect of mining. Remote sensing, widely used as efficient monitoring tool, but there is not enough research on disturbance and reclamation monitoring taking into account large-scale areas and high temporal and spatial accuracy. Especially when mining sites remain unknown, how to distinguish the disturbance of coal mining and other human activities affecting the surface land cover has become a challenge. Therefore, this paper proposed a method to reconstruct the time series of mining disturbance and reclamation in a large area by using the POI (point of interest) and Landsat time series images using multiple buffer analysis methods. The process includes: (1) Retrieval of POI in the study area based on the public mining list using Python crawler, and buffering 100 km for preliminary extraction of potential mining areas; (2) Using spectral index mask and random forest algorithm to accurately extract the exposed coal on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform; (3) Buffering 10 km to identify the occurrence of disturbance and reclamation, using pixel-based temporal trajectory identi-fication of LandTrendr algorithm under GEE. The method successful detect the change points of surface coal mining disturbance and reclamation in eastern Inner Mongolia of China. The results show that: (1) The method can effectively identify the extent of surface coal mining disturbance and reclamation, and the overall extraction accuracy is 81%. (2) Surface coal mining disturbance in eastern Inner Mongolia was concentrated in 2006-2011. By 2020, the total disturbed area is 627.8 km2, with an average annual disturbance of 18.5 km2, and the annual maximum disturbance to the ground reached 64.6 km2 in 2008. With the total reclaimed area being 236.3 km2, the reclamation rate is about 37.6%. This study provides a systematic solution and process for monitoring the disturbance and reclamation of surface coal mining in a large range with little known about the mines' location. It can effectively identify the mining disturbance and reclamation process which can also be extended to other areas, providing a quantitative assessment of mining disturbance and reclamation, which can support further ecological restoration decision-making.

TI  - Aircraft Detection in SAR Images Based on Peak Feature Fusion and Adaptive Deformable Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the unique imaging mechanism of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), targets in SAR images often shows complex scattering characteristics, including unclear contours, incomplete scattering spots, attitude sensitivity, etc. Automatic aircraft detection is still a great challenge in SAR images. To cope with these problems, a novel approach called adaptive deformable network (ADN) combined with peak feature fusion (PFF) is proposed for aircraft detection. The PFF is designed for taking full advantage of the strong scattering features of aircraft, which consists of peak feature extraction and fusion. To fully exploit the strong scattering features of the aircraft in SAR images, peak features are extracted via the Harris detector and the eight-domain pixel detection of local maxima. Then, the saliency of aircraft under multiple imaging conditions is enhanced by multi-channel blending. All the PFF-preprocessed images are fed into the ADN for training and testing. The core components of ADN contain an adaptive spatial feature fusion (ASFF) module and a deformable convolution module (DCM). ASFF is utilized to reconcile the inconsistency across different feature scales, raising the characterization capabilities of the feature pyramid and improving the detection performance of multi-scale aircraft further. DCM is introduced to determine the 2-D offsets of feature maps adaptively, improving the geometric modeling abilities of aircraft in various shapes. The well-designed ADN is established by combining the two modules to alleviate the problems of the multi-scale targets and attitude sensitivity. Extensive experiments are conducted on the GaoFen-3 (GF3) dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PFF-ADN with an average precision of 89.34%, as well as an F1-score of 91.11%. Compared with other mainstream algorithms, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - Simulating the Impacts of Drought and Warming in Summer and Autumn on the Productivity of Subtropical Coniferous Forests
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of drought and/or warming on forests have received great attention in recent decades. Although the extreme drought and/or warming events significantly changed the forest demography and regional carbon cycle, the seasonality quantifying the impacts of these climate extremes with different severities on the productivity of subtropical coniferous forests remains poorly understood. This study evaluated the effects of seasonal drought and/or warming on the net primary productivity (NPP) of subtropical coniferous forests (i.e., Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana forests) from Hengyang-Shaoyang Basin in southern China using the Ecosystem Demography model, Version 2.2 (ED-2.2) and based on the datasets from forest inventory, meteorological reanalysis, and remotely sensed products. The results showed that the goodness of fit of the DBH-height allometric equations was better than that of the default in ED-2.2 after model calibration; the ED-2.2 model qualitatively captured the seasonality of NPP in the subtropical coniferous forests; and the mismatch between simulated annual NPP and MODIS-NPP (MOD17A3HGF) became smaller over time. The effect of seasonal drought on NPP was greater than that of warming; the decline rate of NPP gradually increased and decreased with time (from July to October) under the seasonal drought and warming scenarios, respectively; NPP decreased more seriously under the combined drought-warming scenario in October, with an average decrease of 31.72%, than the drought-only and warming-only scenarios; seasonal drought had an obvious legacy impact on productivity recovery of subtropical coniferous forests, but it was not the case for warming. With the increase in drought severity, the average values of soil available water and NPP together showed a downward trend. With the increase in warming severity, the average values of canopy air space temperature increased, but NPP decreased. Seasonal drought and/or warming limit forest production through decreasing soil moisture and/or increasing canopy air space temperature, which impact on plant photosynthesis and productivity, respectively. Our results highlight the significance of taking into account the impacts of seasonal warming and drought when evaluating the productivity of subtropical coniferous forests, as well as the significance of enhancing the resistance and resilience of forests to future, more severe global climate change.

TI  - GEE-Based Spatial-Temporal Dynamics in a Ramsar Wetland, Honghe National Nature Reserve, Northeast China from 1985 to 2021
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are vital to the human living environment, and with the degradation of wetland ecosystems, it is crucial to protect and restore them. Therefore, based on the long time-series Landsat images provided by Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study obtained the landscape spatial distribution maps of the Honghe National Nature Reserve (HNNR) from 1985 to 2021, analysed the spatial and temporal dynamics of the landscape patterns of the HNNR in the past 40 years, and explored the driving factors of the evolution of the HNNR wetland. The results show that from 1985 to 2008, the HNNR wetlands continued to degrade. The area of the wetland landscape declines and converts mainly into the meadow landscape, and the meadow landscape trends upwards and then downwards and converts mainly into woodland and arable land, with increased fragmentation of wetland and meadow. From 2008 to 2021, with the recovery in hydrological conditions, the area of the wetland landscape increased and fragmentation decreased. However, the meadow landscape continued to decline and fragmentation increased, with meadow converting mainly into wetland; changes in hydrological conditions were the main drivers of the evolution of the HNNR wetlands. The results of this study enable us to better understand the dynamics of the HNNR wetland landscape over the last 40 years and provide assistance for the management of the HNNR wetland ecosystems and the ecological restoration of degraded wetlands.

TI  - A New Objective Typhoon Location Algorithm Considering a Perturbation Factor Based on <i>FY-4A</i> Brightness Temperature Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a new objective typhoon positioning algorithm was proposed. The algorithm uses L1 12-channel far-infrared data of the FY-4A geostationary meteorological satellite for objective positioning, verified against best path data provided by the Tropical Cyclone Data Center of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). By calculating the tangential and radial perturbation values of infrared brightness temperature images, the perturbation factor can be obtained. By adopting the position of the maximum perturbation factor as the center of a circle and considering a radius of no more than 20 km, the position of the minimum perturbation factor was determined; this value represents the central position of the typhoon. Tropical cyclones in 2019 and 2020 were selected for objective positioning, and the objective positioning results were verified against the corresponding time in the best path dataset. The results included centralized verification results for 29 typhoons and optimal path data in 2019. The maximum average error reached 54.67 km, with an annual average typhoon positioning error of 16.15 km. The centralization verification results for 23 typhoons and optimal path data in 2020 indicated a minimum average error of 12.71 km, a maximum average error of 18.56 km, and an annual average typhoon positioning error of 14.82 km. The positioning results for these two years suggest that the longitude obtained with the perturbation factor positioning method is satisfactory, exhibiting an error of less than 20 km.Significance StatementThe purpose of this study is to help researchers make scientific discoveries and help the development of typhoon center location technology in the future. This is important because accurate positioning of typhoon center can provide effective help for typhoon path prediction and typhoon intensity determination.

TI  - A Sub-Seasonal Crop Information Identification Framework for Crop Rotation Mapping in Smallholder Farming Areas with Time Series Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop rotation information is essential for understanding food supply, cropland management, and resource allocation, especially in the context of China's basic situation of "small farmers in a big country". However, crop rotation mapping for smallholder agriculture systems remains challenging due to the diversity of crop types, complex cropping practices, and fragmented cropland. This research established a sub-seasonal crop information identification framework for crop rotation mapping based on time series Sentinel-2 imagery. The framework designed separate identification models based on the different growth seasons of crops to reduce interclass similarity caused by the same crops in a certain growing season. Features were selected separately according to crops characteristics, and finally explored rotations between them to generate the crop rotation map. This framework was evaluated in the study area of Shandong Province, China, a mix of single-cropping and double-cropping smallholder area. The accuracy assessment showed that the two crop maps achieved an overall accuracy of 0.93 and 0.85 with a Kappa coefficient of 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. The results showed that crop rotation practice mainly occurred in the plains of Shandong, and the predominant crop rotation pattern was wheat and maize. In addition, Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI), red-edge, and other spectral bands during the peak growing season enabled better performance in crop mapping. This research demonstrated the capability of the framework to identify crop rotation patterns and the potential of the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 for crop rotation mapping under smallholder agriculture system.

TI  - Seismogenic structure of the 2022 Menyuan <i>M<sub>w</sub></i> 6. 6 earthquake, Qinghai Province, constrained by InSAR and Gaofen-7 observation
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - On 8 January 2022, an M(w)6. 6 earthquake struck the Menyuan County, Qinghai Province. The epicenter of this earthquake is located in the western segment of the Lenglongling fault and east end of Tuolaishan fault, which belong to Haiyuan fault zone. Obvious surface rupture zone caused by this earthquake is developed. In this study, we use Sentinel-1 radar imagery to investigate coseismic deformation of this earthquake. Ascending and descending interferograms show opposite deformation across the fault zone that the relative motion is horizontal and related to strike-slip fault motion, with the magnitude of line-of-sight displacement of similar to 60 cm. The main deformation feature is asymmetric. Surface deformation near fault is interpreted with Gaofen-7 satellite image acquired after earthquake. We then used Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data to invert the fault parameters and detailed slip distribution of seismogenic fault, and calculated the coseismic Coulomb stress change. The complexity of seismogenic structure and future seismic risk of epicentre area are discussed. The inversion results suggest that at least two faults were involved in this earthquake. The main fault corresponds to the western segment of the Lenglongling fault. The optimal fault model determined by InSAR shows that the eastern section of the main fault changes along strike, while the western section extends westward along Lenglongling fault; the secondary fault corresponds to eastern end of Tuolaishan fault, and two faults form a lying Y-shaped layout. The majority of slip occurred between 0 similar to 9 km depth on the main fault, and 0 similar to 4 km depth on the secondary fault. The moment magnitude determined by InSAR is M(w)6. 6. The main features of slip on the main fault are : (1) maximum slip of similar to 3. 7 m; (2) slip reaches surface and ranges about 19 km. The results of coseismic Coulomb stress change show that the future seismic risk of Minle-Damaying fault, Tuolaishan fault and central section of Lenglongling fault (i. e. , the unbroken section of Gulang earthquake in 1927) should not be ignored.

TI  - Geological Hazards Susceptibility Evaluation Based on GA-BPNN: A Case Study of Xingye County
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geohazards are one of the most critical disasters that cause serious damage to engineering construction activities and peoples' lives and property; therefore, susceptibility evaluation of the geohazards is vital for planning future sustainable development and construction activities. This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to divide the susceptibility grades of geohazards in Xingye County, using back-propagation neural networks (BPNN), Geographical Information Systems, and grid analysis technology on remote sensing data. Twelve geohazards related causal factors were selected to reflect the physical geography, basic geology, ecological environment, human activities, and other characteristics of Xingye; the factors are: slope, aspect, topographic curvature, precipitation, normalized differential vegetation index, stratum lithology, linear faults, tectonic complexity, normalized differential water index, residential density, road network density, and land use/land cover. Two hidden layers of BPNN optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) were trained to evaluate the susceptibility grade of geohazards for Xingye. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, mean square error (MSE), mean of absolute percentage error (MAPE), and field investigation were used to test the validity of the models. Analysis and comparison of the results of different models as indicated by the values of area under curve (AUC) of ROC curves, MSE, and MAPE for five models clearly indicated that the GA-BPNN model developed in the present study has the highest accuracy (0.9344) and the least errors (0.1925% and 7.3833%) for the susceptibility evaluation and prediction of geohazards in Xingye, followed by the BPNN, support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression. Moreover, the results also show that the GA has a positive effect on the BPNN model. Furthermore, the GA-BPNN model developed in the present study can be used for the assessment of geohazards susceptibility in similar regions.

TI  - Ozone Pollution of Megacity Shanghai during City-Wide Lockdown Assessed Using TROPOMI Observations of NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An unprecedented city-wide lockdown took place in Shanghai from April to May 2022 to curb the spread of COVID-19, which caused socio-economic disruption but a significant reduction of anthropogenic emissions in this metropolis. However, the ground-based monitoring data showed that the concentration of ozone (O-3) remained at a high level. This study applied Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations to examine changes in tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO), which are precursors of O-3. Compared with the same period in 2019-2021, VCDs of NO2 and HCHO decreased respectively by similar to 50% and similar to 20%. Multiple regression analysis showed that the lockdown effect played a dominant role in this dramatic decline rather than meteorological impacts. Using the exponentially-modified Gaussian method, this study quantified nitrogen oxides (NOX) emission in Shanghai as 32.60 mol/s with a decrease of 50-80%, which was mainly contributed by the transportation and industrial sectors. The significant reduction of NOX emission in Shanghai is much higher than that of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which led to dramatic changes in formaldehyde-to-nitrogen dioxide ratio (HCHO/NO2, FNR). Thus, when enforcing regulation on NOx emission control in the future, coordinately reducing VOCs emission should be implemented to mitigate urban O-3 pollution.

TI  - An Object- and Shapelet-Based Method for Mapping Planted Forest Dynamics from Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale afforestation in arid and semi-arid areas with fragile ecosystems for the purpose of restoring degradation and mitigating climate change has raised issues of decreased groundwater recharge and ambiguous climatic benefits. An accurate planted forest mapping method is necessary to explore the impacts of afforestation expansion on fragile ecosystems. However, distinguishing planted forests from natural forests using remote sensing technology is not a trivial task due to their strong spectral similarities, even when assisted by phenological variables. In this study, we developed an object- and shapelet-based (OASB) method for mapping the planted forests of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), China in 2020 and for tracing the planting years between 1991 and 2020. The novel method consists of two components: (1) a simple non-iterative clustering to yield homogenous objects for building an improved time series; (2) a shapelet-based classification to distinguish the planted forests from the natural forests and to estimate the planting year, by detecting the temporal characteristics representing the planting activities. The created map accurately depicted the planted forests of the NHAR in 2020, with an overall accuracy of 87.3% (Kappa = 0.82). The area of the planted forest was counted as 0.56 million ha, accounting for 67% of the total forest area. Additionally, the planting year calendar (RMSE = 2.46 years) illustrated that the establishment of the planted forests matched the implemented ecological restoration initiatives over the past decades. Overall, the OASB has great potential for mapping the planted forests in the NHAR or other arid and semi-arid regions, and the map products derived from this method are conducive to evaluating forestry eco-engineering projects and facilitating the sustainable development of forest ecosystems.

TI  - Automated extraction of aquaculture ponds from Sentinel-2 seasonal imagery-A validated case study in central Thailand
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The incidence and size of aquaculture ponds are related to a variety of economic, social, environmental, and policy factors, but there is scarce publicly available information. Satellite based aquaculture pond mapping has typically been undertaken by segmentation of single-date images or of temporal composites derived from image time series. In Asia, both aquaculture and rice farming can be undertaken in the same locality and, combined with frequent cloud cover, meaning that segmentations should be derived throughout the year to be able to differentiate aquaculture ponds from rice paddies and to provide spatially-complete pond mapping results. In this paper, a new approach is presented to extract individual aquaculture ponds from seasonal Sentinel-2 10 m images and to combine different sets of pond objects extracted from different images into a single set of pond objects. The approach is demonstrated for the province of Nakhon Pathom (216,800 ha) in central Thailand that is a major shrimp farming area. Aquaculture ponds were extracted from near-cloud-free Sentinel-2 images acquired in January and June 2019 to reduce confusion with rice paddies that are typically vegetation covered in these months. The ponds extracted at different times were then combined using a multi-temporal object combination strategy. Surveys undertaken in 2019 to elucidate farmers' attitudes and land use practices were used to contextualize the extraction results. Across the province, 22,833 aquaculture ponds were extracted with a total area of 18,066 ha. The mean and median pond sizes were 0.79 ha and 0.60 ha, respectively, which is close to the 0.65 ha mean shrimp pond size in Thailand reported by other researchers via independent surveys. Current methods to map aquaculture ponds have not typically reported object-based validation results and so it is unknown whether object-level information (e.g., number of ponds and pond sizes) are reliable. Therefore, the extraction results were evaluated quantitatively using object-based accuracy metrics. A total of 1733 aquaculture ponds at three validation sites were manually digitized using multi-date GoogleEarth high-resolution images, and compared with the extracted ponds. The evaluation results indicated a robust pond extraction performance, with 87.7% object-based overall accuracy considering all the reference data and the extracted ponds at the three sites. 0.9% of the extracted ponds were over-extracted (commission error), 0.9% were under-split, 2.6% were over-split, and 6.9% of the of the reference ponds were not extracted (omission error). In addition, the mean over-segmentation error of 0.154, mean under-segmentation error of 0.111, and mean F-score (dice coefficient) of 0.858 were obtained. The causes of these errors were examined and discussed with recommended potential research using other sensor data.

TI  - The Relationship between Landscape Patterns and Populations of Asian Longhorned Beetles
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), is one of the most harmful invasive alien species attacking hardwood trees. Increasing human activities have caused changes in the landscape patterns of ALB habitats, disrupting the habitat balance and weakening landscape-driven pest suppression. However, the relationship between landscape patterns (compositional and structural heterogeneity) and ALB populations has not been defined. In this study, we used remote sensing data to calculate landscape metrics and combined them with ground survey data. Using a multivariable linear regression model and a linear mixed model, we analyzed the relationship between landscape metrics and ALB populations and between forest stands attributes and ALB populations. The study results indicated that largest patch index (LPI), mean radius of gyration (GYRATE_MN), mean shape index (SHAPE_MN), and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) strongly influenced ALB populations at the landscape level. In addition, at the class level, only the forest class metrics LPI and aggregation index (AI) significantly impacted ALBs. The study also indicated that tree height (TH) and tree abundance (TREEAB) were good predictors of ALB populations.

TI  - The Coupling of Glacier Melt Module in SWAT plus Model Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in the Upper Yarkant River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers have proven to be a particularly sensitive indicator of climate change, and the impacts of glacier melting on downstream water supplies are becoming increasingly important as the world's population expands and global warming continues. Data scarcity in mountainous catchments, on the other hand, has been a substantial impediment to hydrological simulation. Therefore, an enhanced glacier hydrological model combined with multi-source remote sensing data was introduced in this study and was performed in the Upper Yarkant River (UYR) Basin. A simple yet efficient degree-day glacier melt algorithm considering solar radiation effects has been introduced for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool Plus model (SWAT+), sensitivity analysis and auto calibration/validation processes were integrated into this enhanced model as well. The results indicate that (i) including glacio-hydrological processes and multi-source remote sensing data considerably improved the simulation precision, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) promotion of 1.9 times and correlated coefficient (R-2) of 1.6 times greater than the original model; (ii) it is an efficient and feasible way to simulate glacio-hydrological processes with SWAT+Glacier and calibrate it using observed discharge data in data-scarce and glacier-melt-dominated catchments; and (iii) glacier runoff is intensively distributed throughout the summer season, accounting for about 78.5% of the annual glacier runoff, and glacier meltwater provides approximately 52.5% (4.4 x 10(9) m(3)) of total runoff in the study area. This research can serve the runoff simulation in glacierized regions and help in understanding the interactions between streamflow components and climate change on basin scale.

TI  - Effect of Using Land Use Data with Building Characteristics on Urban Weather Simulations: A High Temperature Event in Shanghai
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use data with building characteristics are important for modeling the impacts of urban morphology on local climate. In this study, an extreme heat event in Shanghai, China, was simulated by using a WRF/BEP + BEM (Weather Research and Forecasting/Building Effect Parameterization + Building Energy Model) model. We incorporated local climate zone (LCZ) land use data that resolved urban morphology using 10 classes of building parameters. The simulation was compared to a control case based on MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land use data. The findings are as follows: (1) the LCZ data performed better than the MODIS data for simulating 10-m wind speed. An increase in building height led to the wind speed to decrease by 0.6-1.4 m s(-1) in the daytime and by 0.2-0.7 m s(-1) at nighttime. (2) High-rise buildings warmed the air by trapping radiation in the urban canyon. This warming effect was partially offset by the cooling effect of building shadows in the day. As a result, the 2-m temperature increased by 0.8? at night but only by 0.4? during the day. (3) Heterogeneous urban surfaces increased the 50-m turbulent kinetic energy by 0.4 m(2) s(-2), decreased the 10-m wind speed by 1.8 m s(-1) in the daytime, increased the surface net radiation by 45.1 W m(-2), and increased the 2-m temperature by 1.5? at nighttime. (4) The LCZ data modified the atmospheric circulation between land and ocean. The shadowing effect reduced the air temperature differences between land and ocean and weakened the sea breeze. Moreover, high-rise buildings obstructed sea breezes, restricting their impact to a smaller portion (10 km along the wind direction) of inland areas compared to that with MODIS.

TI  - Multisource remote sensing data facilitate ecohydrological simulations without runoff calibration
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Observed runoff is typically the only variable applied to calibrate ecohydrological models, which can simulate runoff well but cannot guarantee reliable reproduction of other hydrological components (e.g., evapotranspiration (ET) and total terrestrial water storage change (TWSC)). This study explores the potential of estimating hydrological components (runoff, ET, TWSC, groundwater, and root-zone water storage.) using a conceptual model driven and calibrated by multisource remote sensing data only. The performances of the model were evaluated in 13 catchments with different geological, climatic and vegetation conditions. Results show that the model was encouraging in simulating monthly runoff (median KGE, 0.71; RMSE, 19.4 mm/mon), ET (median KGE, 0.86; RMSE, 9.0 mm/mon), and TWSC (median KGE, 0.58; RMSE, 26.6 mm/mon). The good positive correlation between root-zone water storage and gross primary productivity also indicates the effectiveness of the model in simulating root-zone water storage. This study offers new prospects for estimating key ecohydrological components precisely, especially in catchments that are difficult to monitor (e.g., karst regions) and catchments with limited observation data (e.g., ungauged regions).

TI  - Evaluation and Improvement of No-Ground-Truth Dual Band Algorithm for Shallow Water Depth Retrieval: A Case Study of a Coastal Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional bathymetric inversion approaches require bathymetric data as ground truth to obtain shallow water depth from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. Thus, bathymetric mapping methods that do not require inputs from in situ measurements are highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a dual-band model improvement method and evaluate the performance of this novel dual-band model approach to obtain the underwater terrain around a coastal island by using four WorldView-2/3 imageries. Then, we validate the results through changing water column properties with the Kd multiple linear regression model simulated by Hydrolight. We multiply the best coefficient and blue-green band value with different substrates on the pixels, which sample along the coastal line and isobath. The results show that the mean bias of inversed depth ranges from 1.73 to 2.96 m in the four imageries. The overall accuracy of root mean square errors (RMSEs) is better for depths shallower than 10 m, and the average relative error is 11.89%. The inversion accuracy of this new model is higher than Lee's classical Kd model and has a wider range of applications than Chen's dual-band model. The no-ground-truth dual-band algorithm has higher accuracy than the other log-ratio methods mentioned in this paper.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Vitality in Nanjing Based on a Plot Boundary-Based Neural Network Weighted Regression Model
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As a representative indicator for the level and sustainability of urban development, urban vitality has been widely used to assess the quality of urban development. However, urban vitality is too blurry to be accurately quantified and is often limited to a particular type of expression of vitality. Current regression models often fail to accurately express the spatial heterogeneity of vibrancy and drivers. Therefore, this paper took Nanjing as the study area and quantified the social, cultural, and economic vitality indicators based on mobile phone data, POI data, and night-light remote sensing data. We also mapped the spatial distribution of comprehensive urban vitality using an improved entropy method and analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of urban vitality and its influencing factors using a plot boundary-based neural network weighted regression (PBNNWR). The results show: (1) The comprehensive vitality in Nanjing is distributed in a "three-center" pattern with one large and two small centers; (2) PBNNWR can be used to investigate the local regression relationships among the driving factors and urban vitality, and the fitting accuracy (95.6%) of comprehensive vitality in weekdays is higher than that of ordinary least squares regression (OLS) (65.9%), geographically weighted regression (GWR) (89.9%), and geographic neural network weighted regression (GNNWR) (89.5%) models; (3) House price, functional diversity, building density, metro station accessibility, and residential facility density are factors that significantly affect urban vitality. The study's findings can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing the urban spatial layout, resource allocation, and targeted planning strategies for areas with different vitality values.

TI  - Light and Period Variations in Two K-type Contact Binaries: HI Leo and V523 Cas
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We presented a low-precision spectrum for HI Leo, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data for V523 Cas, and new photometry for both K-type contact binaries. Comparing their light curves on different observing dates, we found small intrinsic variabilities, such as variable amplitudes for HI Leo and the varying heights around the second maxima for V523 Cas. By the Wilson-Devinney Code, we deduced six photometric solutions. The dark spot of V523 Cas may appear on the surface of the more massive component on BJD 2458768, while it disappears on BJD 2458779. Our results indicate that the two binaries are W-type shallow-contact binaries (f <= 10%). From the eclipse timing residuals, we found that the orbital periods may continuously increase, accompanied by one to two light-time effects due to additional bodies. The modulated periods and semi-amplitudes are P-3 = 25.8(+/- 1.0) yr and A(3) = 0(d).0066(6) for HI Leo, P-3 = 114.8(+/- 2.0) yr and A(3) = 0(d).0448(12), P-4 = 18.89(+/- 0.14) yr and A(4) = 0(d).0025(2) for V523 Cas, respectively. The orbital period secularly increases at a rate of dP/dt = 2.86 (+/- 0.11) x 10(-7) day yr(-1) for HI Leo and dP/dt = 3.45(+/- 0.07) x 10(-8) day yr(-1) for V523 Cas, which may be attributed to mass transfer from the secondary to the primary. With mass transferring, the shallow-contact binaries, HI Leo and V523 Cas, will evolve into the broken-contact configurations.

TI  - Groundwater Management in an Uncommon and Artificial Aquifer Based on K<sub>c</sub> Approach and MODIS ET Products for Irrigation Assessment in a Subtropical Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a critical resource in remote and isolated islands where rainfall hardly provides a continuous and even water supply. In this paper, in a very rare and uncommonly found artificial aquifer on Miyako Island, far away from the main continent of Japan, with limited experimental results of evaluations of crop water requirement, MODIS ET together with crop ETc estimated from K-c coefficient from the nearest island were compared to determine the reliability of the MODIS ET and FAO-56-based ETc value. The testified K-c approach for sugarcane ET was used to assess the risk of irrigation water shortages using historical metrological data and to predict the future risk of irrigation agriculture under different scenarios of GCM models. It was shown that FAO-56-based ETc and MOD16A2 were both applicable for crop evapotranspiration on the island. Then, the response of groundwater storage to gross irrigation water requirement was analyzed to clarify the effect of irrigation on groundwater storage and the risk of groundwater depletion under current and future climatic conditions. Results showed that the construction of the dam efficiently secured the irrigation of sugarcane. Using historical climatic data (1951-2021), the influence of estimated irrigation water requirements on groundwater showed that in 296 out of 852 months, irrigation was heavily required. Over a 71 year period, there was absolutely no water for irrigation four times, or nearly once every 18 years. Under the future projected climate from four bias-corrected GCM models with two emission scenarios (2022-2100), the risk of groundwater depletion both in terms of frequency and duration will increase. Therefore, there is a need for either improvement of irrigation water management or additional construction of artificial aquifers on the island. The study proved the value of ET derived from remote sensing in areas lacking the support of experimental results. The methodology developed in the study can be potentially used to evaluate long-term irrigation demand and groundwater management over dry periods for engineering design or dam construction globally.

TI  - Integrated kinematic precise orbit determination and clock estimation for low Earth orbit satellites with onboard and regional ground observations
T2  - MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have been designed in recent years to provide global broadband Internet services. These constellations provide opportunities for LEO satellites to serve as navigation satellites by launching navigation signals while also being equipped with an onboard global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. We propose a kinematic precise orbit determination (KPOD) and precise clock estimation (PCE) approach for LEO satellites by integrating regional ground observations and onboard observations of LEO satellites. By taking into account the LEO satellite clock bias, this approach can demonstrate the contributions of the ground and onboard observations of LEO satellites to the orbit and clock results, respectively. A composite LEO satellite constellation consisting of 168 satellites and observations from regional ground stations and LEO satellite onboard receivers are simulated considering the LEO satellite clock bias to verify the proposed approach. The results indicate that the convergence time of LEO satellite orbit determination can reach 9.38 min with the integrated KPOD (IKPOD) method, which is a reduction of 24.0% compared with the traditional KPOD method. However, the additional improvement in the LEO satellite orbit accuracy after convergence is very limited. The average root mean square (RMS) and standard deviation (STD) values of all LEO satellite clocks using the integrated PCE (IPCE) method with the participation of LEO satellite onboard observations can reach 0.27 ns and 0.15 ns, respectively. The improvements in the average RMS and STD are 42.6% and 60.5%, respectively, compared with the ground LEO PCE method. The convergence time and accuracy of LEO/GNSS precise point positioning can be improved by 44.6%, 48.3%, 26.7%, and 20.4% in the east, north, and up directions, respectively, using LEO satellite orbits and clocks from the IKPOD and IPCE methods compared with KPOD and PCE.

A significant annual reduction of their area due to changes in the water regime and trophicity of the river is shown. It is found that the accuracy of radiometric normalization by correcting the offset of pixel values relative to zero for the atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 images of the floodplain peatland can be estimated from the difference between the base and normalized images of the river runoff values for the months of vegetation.

TI  - Effects of Atmospheric Correction and Image Enhancement on Effective Plastic Greenhouse Segments Based on a Semi-Automatic Extraction Method
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) quality of plastic greenhouses (PGs) in GaoFen-2 (GF-2) images, the effects of atmospheric correction and image enhancement on effective PG segments (EPGSs) were evaluated. A new semi-automatic method was also proposed to extract EPGSs in an accurate and efficient way. Firstly, GF-2 images were preprocessed via atmospheric correction, orthographical correction, registration, fusion, linear compression, or spatial filtering, and, then, boundary-removed point samples with adjustable density were made based on reference polygons by taking advantage of the characteristics of chessboard segmentation. Subsequently, the point samples were used to quickly and accurately extract segments containing 70% or greater of PG pixels in each MRS result. Finally, the extracted EPGSs were compared and analyzed via intersection over union (IoU), over-segmentation index (OSI), under-segmentation index (USI), error index of total area (ETA), and composite error index (CEI). The experimental results show that, along with the change in control variables, the optimal scale parameter, time of segmentation, IoU, OSI, USI, and CEI all showed strong changing trends, with the values of ETA all close to 0. Furthermore, compared with the control group, all the CEIs of the EPGSs extracted from those corrected and enhanced images resulted in lower values, and an optimal CEI involved linearly compressing the DN value of the atmospheric-corrected fusion image to 0-255, and then using Fast Fourier Transform and a circular low-pass filter with a radius of 800 pixels to filter from the spatial frequency domain; in this case, the CEI had a minimum value of 0.159. The results of this study indicate that the 70% design in the experiment is a reasonable pixel ratio to determine the EPGSs, and the OSI-USI-ETA-CEI pattern can be more effective than IoU when it is needed to evaluate the quality of EPGSs. Moreover, taking into consideration heterogeneity and target characteristics, atmospheric correction and image enhancement prior to MRS can improve the quality of EPGSs.

TI  - Analysis of spatial and temporal variation of precipitable water vapor using COSMIC radio occultation observations over Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a meteorological variable that impacts the major atmospheric processes. It is a non-homogeneous variable that differs spatially and temporally. The spatial and temporal variability of the PWV in Egypt is investigated in this study using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) from 2006 to 2021. The GNSS RO technique was used to obtain PWV values; the validation results agree with the radiosonde technique. From the statistical results, the mean bias is 0.1846 mm. The PWV has a latitudinal style in which it is inversely proportional to latitude. So, it is evident that higher PWV occurs at low latitudes. However, some PWV values are higher over sites near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. No clear and direct relationship is found between PWV and longitude. So, PWV is mainly dependent on latitude. The annual mean PWV values over Egypt range from 9.23 mm to 13.51 mm. The higher values of PWV are in the summer season between 10.74 mm and 21.55 mm. While the PWV values are in the winter season range from 6.84 mm to 9.94 mm. The highest values of PWV occur in August between 12.35 mm and 23.35 mm and the lowest values of PWV are in January and February ranging from 5.62 mm to 11.05 mm. PWV values are higher during the day and lower at night.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessment of Satellite AOD during the 2020 Wildfire Season in the Western US
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is essential for detection, characterization, and forecasting of wildfire smoke. In this work, we evaluate the AOD (550 nm) retrievals during the extreme wildfire events over the western U.S. in September 2020. Three products are analyzed, including the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) product collections C6.0 and C6.1, and the NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) AOD from the NOAA Enterprise Processing System (EPS) algorithm. Compared with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data, all three products show strong linear correlations with MAIAC C6.1 and VIIRS presenting overall low bias (<0.06). The accuracy of MAIAC C6.1 is found to be substantially improved with respect to MAIAC C6.0 that drastically underestimated AOD over thick smoke, which validates the effectiveness of updates made in MAIAC C6.1 in terms of an improved representation of smoke aerosol optical properties. VIIRS AOD exhibits comparable uncertainty with MAIAC C6.1 with a slight tendency of increased positive bias over the AERONET AOD range of 0.5-3.0. Averaging coincident retrievals from MAIAC C6.1 and VIIRS provides a lower root mean square error and higher correlation than for the individual products, motivating the benefit of blending these datasets. MAIAC C6.1 and VIIRS are further compared to provide insights on their retrieval strategy. When gridded at 0.1 degrees resolution, MAIAC C6.1 and VIIRS provide similar monthly AOD distribution patterns and the latter exhibits a slightly higher domain average. On daily scale, over thick plumes near fire sources, MAIAC C6.1 reports more valid retrievals where VIIRS tends to have retrievals designated as low or medium quality, which tends to be due to internal quality checks. Over transported smoke near scattered clouds, VIIRS provides better retrieval coverage than MAIAC C6.1 owing to its higher spatial resolution, pixel-level processing, and less strict cloud masking. These results can be used as a guide for applications of satellite AOD retrievals during wildfire events and provide insights on future improvement of retrieval algorithms under heavy smoke conditions.

T2  - Biodiversity Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Gulf of Annaba has observed an increase in the pollution level, in particular by heavy metals. The present experiment aimed to assess pollution by measuring the rate of metallothioneins (MTs), a biomarker of metallic contamination, measured in the digestive gland of Donax trunculus Linnaeus, 1758 (Mollusca Bivalvia) an edible mollusk widely used in biomonitoring of water quality. This sentinel species was sampled during two seasons (win-ter and summer 2019) at two sites in the Gulf of Annaba (Northeast Algeria): El Battah site far from any source of pollution and Sidi Salem site exposed to various sources of pollution. The biochemical analyzes reveal spatio-temporal changes. The levels of proteins recorded in the two studied sites were higher in summer and values from El Battah individuals were sig-nificantly higher compared to those from Sidi Salem. In addition, they show an induction in MT rates in individuals from the two sites (Sidi Salem and El Battah) in summer with higher values recorded in individuals from Sidi Salem. This difference is related to the proximity of sources of contamination at Sidi Salem compared to El Battah. The rates of MTs vary also according to abiotic factors such as hydrodynamics or temperature which can explain the sig-nificant seasonal difference with a more marked induction in summer. Conclusively, our study shows the sensitivity ofD. trunculus to chemical stress induced by heavy metal contamination as evidenced by an induction of MTs with significant effects of both sites and seasons.

TI  - Tropical Forest Disturbance Monitoring Based on Multi-Source Time Series Satellite Images and the LandTrendr Algorithm
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring disturbances in tropical forests is important for assessing disturbance-related greenhouse gas emissions and the ability of forests to sequester carbon, and for formulating strategies for sustainable forest management. Thanks to a long-term observation history, large spatial coverage, and support from powerful cloud platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), remote sensing is increasingly used to detect forest disturbances. In this study, three types of forest disturbances (abrupt, gradual, and multiple) were identified since the late 1980s on Hainan Island, the largest tropical island in China, using an improved LandTrendr algorithm and a dense time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images on the GEE cloud platform. Results show that: (1) the algorithm identified forest disturbances with high accuracy, with the R-2 for abrupt and gradual disturbance detection reaching 0.92 and 0.83, respectively; (2) the total area in which forest disturbances occurred on Hainan Island over the past 30 years accounted for 10.84% (2.33 x 10(5) hm(2) in total area, at 0.35% per year) of the total forest area in 2020 and peaked around 2005; (3) the areas of abrupt, gradual, and multiple disturbances were 1.21 x 10(5) hm(2), 9.96 x 10(4) hm(2), and 1.25 x 10(4) hm(2), accounting for 51.93%, 42.75%, and 5.32% of the total disturbed area, respectively; and (4) most forest disturbance occurred in low-lying (<600 m elevation accounts for 97.42%) and gentle (<25 degrees slope accounts for 94.42%) regions, and were mainly caused by the rapid expansion of rubber, eucalyptus, and tropical fruit plantations and natural disasters such as typhoons and droughts. The resulting algorithm and data products provide effective support for assessments of such things as tropical forest productivity and carbon storage on Hainan Island.

A study area in Korea was selected and processed based on the muti-temporal time series InSAR analysis, namely SBAS (Small Baseline Subset)-InSAR and PS (Persistent Scatterers)-InSAR using Sentinel-1A SAR images acquired from the year 2014 onward available from European Space Agency Copernicus Program. The ground settlement of the study area for the temporal window of 2014-2022 was evaluated from the viewpoint of the applicability of the InSAR technique for urban infrastructure settlement monitoring. The results indicated that the InSAR technique can reasonably monitor long-term settlement of the study area in millimetric scale, and that the time series InSAR technique can effectively measure ground settlement that occurs over a long period of time as the SAR satellite provides images of the Korean Peninsula at regular time intervals while orbiting the earth. It is expected that the InSAR technique based on higher resolution SAR images with small temporal baseline can be a viable alternative to the traditional ground borne monitoring method for ground deformation monitoring in the 4th industrial era.

TI  - Surface Albedo and Snowline Altitude Estimation Using Optical Satellite Imagery and In Situ Measurements in Muz Taw Glacier, Sawir Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surface albedo strongly affects glacier mass balance by controlling the glacier surface energy budget. As an indicator of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), the glacier snowline altitude (SLA) at the end of the melt season can reflect variations in the glacier mass balance. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to investigate the changes of glacier surface albedo and glacier SLA for calculating and evaluating glacier mass loss. In this study, from 2011 to 2021, the surface albedo of the Muz Taw Glacier was derived from Landsat images with a spatial resolution of 30 m and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer albedo products (MOD10A1) with a temporal resolution of 1 day, which was verified through the albedo measured by the Automatic Weather Station (AWS) installed in the glacier. Moreover, the glacier SLA was determined based on the variation in the surface albedo, with the altitude change along the glacier main flowline derived from the Landsat image at the end of the melt season. The correlation coefficient of >0.7, with a risk of error lower than 5%, between the surface albedo retrieved from remote sensing images and the in situ measurement data indicated that the method of deriving the glacier surface albedo by the remote sensing method was reliable. The annual average albedo showed a slight upward trend (0.24%) from 2011 to 2021. A unimodal seasonal variation in albedo was demonstrated, with the downward trend from January to August and the upward trend from August to December. The spatial distribution of the albedo was not entirely dependent on altitude due to the dramatic effects of the topography and glacier surface conditions. The average SLA was 3446 m a.s.l., with a variation of 160 m from 2011 to 2021. The correlation analysis between the glacier SLA and annual mean temperature/annual precipitation demonstrated that the variations of the average SLA on the Muz Taw Glacier was primarily affected by the air temperature. This study improved our understanding of the ablation process and mechanism of the Muz Taw Glacier.

TI  - Evaluating the Hydrus-1D Model Optimized by Remote Sensing Data for Soil Moisture Simulations in the Maize Root Zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hydrus-1D model is widely used for soil water content (SWC) simulations, wherein the exact configuration of soil hydraulic parameters is key to accuracy. To assess the feasibility of using "low-cost" multi-source remote sensing data to optimize the parameters of the Hydrus-1D model, five types of soil hydrodynamic parameter acquisition methods were designed for comparative evaluation, including the use of default parameters for soil texture types (DSHP), predictions from three and five soil mechanical composition parameters (NNP3/NNP5), inverse solutions from measured historical data (ISHD), and innovative introduction of historical remote sensing data (ERA-5 land reanalysis information and MODIS LAI products) instead of ground measured data for the inverse solution (ISRS). Two spring maize crops were planted in Beijing, China, in 2021 and 2022. Meteorological, soil, and crop data were collected as real measurements of the true values during the growth period. The boundary flux characteristics of the model simulation results were analyzed. The accuracy differences in the five approaches were compared from three perspectives: overall root zone, growth stage, and soil depth. The results showed that (1) evapotranspiration was the main pathway for soil water depletion in the root zone of maize; the actual total evapotranspiration accounted for 68.26 and 69.43% of the total precipitation in 2012 and 2022, respectively. (2) The accuracy of the SWC simulations in the root zone was acceptable for different approaches in the following order: NNP5 (root mean squared error (RMSE) = 5.47%) > ISRS (RMSE = 5.48%) > NNP3 (RMSE = 5.66%) > ISHD (RMSE = 5.68%) > DSHP (RMSE = 6.57%). The ISRS approach based on remote sensing data almost achieved the best performance while effectively reducing the workload and cost. (3) The accuracy of the SWC simulation at different growth stages was ranked as follows: seedling stage (mean absolute error (MAE) = 3.29%) > tassel stage (MAE = 4.68%) > anthesis maturity stage (MAE = 5.52%). (4) All approaches' simulation errors exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing soil depth. The ISHD approach, based on the measured data, achieved the best performance at a depth of 60 cm (MAE = 2.8%). The Hydrus-1D model optimized using multi-source remote sensing data can effectively simulate SWC in the maize root zone with low working cost, which is significant for applications in areas where it is difficult to obtain field soil hydrodynamic property parameters to simulate SWC at a global scale.

TI  - Wintertime Emissivities of the Arctic Sea Ice Types at the AMSR2 Frequencies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface effective emissivities of Arctic sea ice are calculated using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) measurements. These emissivities are analyzed for stable winter conditions during the months of January-May and November and December of 2020 for several main sea ice types defined with the sea ice maps of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI). The sea ice emissivities are derived from the AMSR2 data using the radiation transfer model for a non-scattering atmosphere and ERA5 reanalysis data. The emissivities are analyzed only for areas of totally consolidated sea ice of definite types. Probability distribution functions are built for the emissivities and their functions for such sea ice types as nilas, young ice, thin first-year (FY) ice, medium FY ice, thick FY ice and multi-year ice. The emissivity variations with frequency are estimated for each of the considered sea ice type for all seven months. The variations are calculated both for the emissivities and for their gradients at the AMSR2 channel frequencies. Obtained emissivities turned out to be generally lower than reported previously in scientific studies, whereas the emissivity variability values proved to be much larger than was known before. For all FY ice types, at all the frequencies, an increase in the emissivity at the beginning of winter and its decrease by the end of May are observed. The emissivity gradients demonstrate noticeable decreases with sea ice age, and their values may be used in sea ice classification algorithms based on the AMSR2 data.

TI  - On The Long-Term Stability of the Norilsk TPP-3 Fuel Tanks Dynamics According to Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of the interferometric processing and analysis of European spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 acquired over the territory of Norilsk thermal power plant TPP-3 between July 2017 and August 2020 are presented. Twelve-day differential interferograms allow the estimation of the stability of the position of all TPP-3 oil reservoirs with respect to reference known stable targets. The strong distorting influence of meteorological precipitation, as well as of the freeze-thaw processes of snow cover on the TPP-3 territory, on the quality of interferometric phase measurements is noted. It is found that on all of the twelve-day interferometric observation intervals from July 2019 to August 2020 made in warm seasons, the relative position of all four reservoirs and the adjacent territory is stable within the accuracy of about 1.3 mm. According to observations of the reservoirs between July 2017 and August 2020 using summer interferograms with a one-year interval between image acquisitions, the long-term stability of the position is about 4 mm. We can conclude that the reservoir damage was not caused by areal displacements of the scattering surfaces in the study area, supposedly due to the melting of permafrost in the area of the reservoirs.

TI  - Parasites as Emerging Biomonitoring Tools-Promises and Pitfalls
T2  - Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy Part B Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing debate over the application of parasites as ecological indicators for environmental assessment is quite interesting. In recent decades, parasitologists have evaluated parasites under different environmental conditions for their potential role as ecological indicators, particularly in aquatic systems. The present paper critically highlights the importance of parasites in environmental assessment, envisages emerging trends in integrated host-parasite sentinel systems and examines current modelling approaches. Our analysis shows that parasites have been used effectively as an effect indicator, nevertheless, studies on host-parasite system as an accumulation indicator in the majority of environmental studies has increased in recent decade. The results show that parasites in combination with other assemblages provide a better model system than parasites alone. We review different modelling approaches that have been used to assess the feasibility of applying parasites as indicators of environmental deterioration. Recent research update on host-parasite interaction in response to various pollutants is also presented. There is an urgent need to focus on the molecular aspects of both parasite and host in relation to environmental degradation. In addition, advanced modelling approaches, especially remote sensing and mathematical modelling, can help us to demonstrate the potential of parasites, if any, under various environmental conditions.

TI  - Gaussian Process Modeling of In-Season Physiological Parameters of Spring Wheat Based on Airborne Imagery from Two Hyperspectral Cameras and Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing of the biophysical and biochemical parameters of crops facilitates the preparation of application maps for variable-rate nitrogen fertilization. According to comparative studies of machine learning algorithms, Gaussian process regression (GPR) can outperform more popular methods in the prediction of crop status from hyperspectral data. The present study evaluates GPR model accuracy in the context of spring wheat dry matter, nitrogen content, and nitrogen uptake estimation. Models with the squared exponential covariance function were trained on images from two hyperspectral cameras (a frenchFabry-Perot interferometer camera and a push-broom scanner). The most accurate predictions were obtained for nitrogen uptake (R-2=0.75-0.85, RPDP=2.0-2.6). Modifications of the basic workflow were then evaluated: the removal of soil pixels from the images prior to the training, data fusion with apparent soil electrical conductivity measurements, and replacing the Euclidean distance in the GPR covariance function with the spectral angle distance. Of these, the data fusion improved the performance while predicting nitrogen uptake and nitrogen content. The estimation accuracy of the latter parameter varied considerably across the two hyperspectral cameras. Satisfactory nitrogen content predictions (R2 > 0.8, RPDP > 2.4) were obtained only in the data-fusion scenario, and only with a high spectral resolution push-broom device capable of capturing longer wavelengths, up to 1000 nm, while the full-frame camera spectral limit was 790 nm. The prediction performance and uncertainty metrics indicated the suitability of the models for precision agriculture applications. Moreover, the spatial patterns that emerged in the generated crop parameter maps accurately reflected the fertilization levels applied across the experimental area as well as the background variation of the abiotic growth conditions, further corroborating this conclusion.

TI  - Analysis of the Green Development Effects of High-Speed Railways Based on Eco-Efficiency: Evidence from Multisource Remote Sensing and Statistical Data of Urban Agglomerations in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the modern transport infrastructure, high-speed railways (HSRs) have been considered an important factor affecting eco-efficiency (EE). This study used multisource remote sensing and statistical data from 185 counties representing urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (UAMRYR) in China from 2009 to 2018. The study integrated ArcGIS analysis, the Super-SBM (super slack-based measure) model, and the DSPDM (dynamic spatial panel Durbin model) to explore the spatial effects of HSRs on EE. The results showed that the coordinates of the interannual centers of gravity for EE and HSRs both fell in the same county, possessing similar parameter values for the standard deviation elliptical, a negative spatial mismatch index, and obvious spatial mismatch characteristics. In different spatially dislocated areas, the spatial effects of HSRs on EE are variable. Overall, the short-term effects are more intense than the long-term effects, and both the long-term and short-term effects are dominated by the effects of spatial spillover. A new perspective is proposed to explore the green development effects of HSRs, with a view to providing policy implications for the enhancement of EE and the planning of HSRs.

TI  - The Price of Becoming a City: Decentralization and Air Pollution-The Evidence from the Policy of County-to-City Upgrade in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to reassess the pollution effects of decentralization reforms to improve the future policy design for better economic and social development in the postepidemic era. This study examines the relationship between decentralization and air pollution by exploiting the policy of County-to-City Upgrade in China from 2005 to 2018. Upgrading empowered new cities in fiscal, administrative, and economic matters without changing the political hierarchy. Under the cadre evaluation system, the new county-level city government preferred to increase construction land area and attract more polluting firms to promote economic development, and air pollution became more severe. Heterogeneity tests found that when the new city was located in eastern China or was away from the provincial boundary, decentralization would induce more severe air pollution. Overall, decentralization without a supplementary incentive rule has a negative effect on air pollution.

TI  - Analysis of Changes in Vegetation Index during the Rapid Urban Spatial Development Period (1990-2020) in Tehran Metropolis, Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation, economic growth, and urban spatial development in developing countries, such as Iran, have resulted in tremendous loss of green cover and associated ecological problems. Any effort to achieve sustainable urban development should be supported by recognising and evaluating the ecological health of vegetation cover. This study investigates vegetation cover reduction and changes in the Tehran Metropolis, Iran and identifies the most important factors influencing the observed changes. The aim of this study is two-fold: first, to assess the spatio-temporal changes in vegetation cover in Tehran between 1990 and 2020, and second, to identify the factors contributing to the changes. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used as an indicator of green cover. The spatial and statistical data used in this study were extracted from Landsat satellite imagery and the last approved Master Plan of Tehran (2006). Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and geographical modelling methods were employed to analyse vegetation cover in all municipal districts of the Tehran metropolis. The results show that the vegetation density in the Tehran metropolis decreased significantly (from 38,936.80 hectares to 4663.23 hectares) between 1990 and 2020. The expansion of construction lands and the increase of population density were the most significant factors affecting the reduction in vegetation cover in Tehran. In contrast, the growth of industrial units in the urban areas of Tehran had no significant relationship with vegetation cover. The results of this study can help urban planners understand the significant drivers of vegetation loss and identify appropriate interventions to prevent it.

AB  - This study explores conceptualisations of mean ([jan] soul) in the Kazakh language from the perspective of cultural linguistics and its literary a prominent Kazakh philosopher and writer. The concept of mean (jan) was analysed from the viewpoint of philosophical and image features and their roles in the formation of the national worldview. A comparative study showed discrepancies in its realisation by Abai Kunanbaev and the English translation even though some variations in the translation cannot be complete equivalents. There is a lack of semantic and cultural identity, and the results indicate that the literal English translation of mean (jan) does not transmit its whole cultural implications. The article also focuses on determining how different methods of translation reproduce the semantics of the analysed concept. The analysis concludes with the necessity of using structural and semantic shifts to better represent the target concept and culture.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of upwelling along the Koryak coast in the northwestern Bering Sea is studied using wind data from the QuikSCAT/SeaWinds (2000-2009) and MetOp-A/ASCAT (2010-2020) scatterometers. The strength of upwelling is estimated based on the wind speed and wind-induced offshore Ekman mass transport (upwelling index). The results indicate that the upwelling that occurred along the Koryak coast was primarily driven by the southerly summer winds over the Bering Sea. The Koryak coastal upwelling occurs mainly during June-August, with significant interannual variability. The variability of the upwelling is primarily driven by regional wind forcing. The seasonal variability of southerly winds favorable for the development of upwelling largely depends on the state of the summer Far Eastern depression (a regional atmospheric center of low pressure). The variations in the pressure field correlate well with the successive alternation of upwelling and downwelling processes near the Koryak coast. Intense upwelling is associated with the well-developed Far Eastern depression. Upwelling can be replaced by downwelling when this regional center of atmospheric action is weakened.

TI  - Ship Recognition for SAR Scene Images under Imbalance Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship recognition can obtain location and class information from SAR scene images, which is important in military and civilian fields, and has turned into a very important research focus recently. Limited by data conditions, the current research mainly includes two aspects: ship detection in SAR scene images and ship classification in SAR slice images. These two parts are not yet integrated, but it is necessary to integrate detection and classification in practical applications, although it will cause an imbalance of training samples for different classes. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a ship recognition method on the basis of a deep network to detect and classify ship targets in SAR scene images under imbalance data. First, RetinaNet is used as the backbone network of the method in this paper for the integration of ship detection and classification in SAR scene images. Then, taking into account the issue that there are high similarities among various SAR ship classes, the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) module is introduced for amplifying the difference features as well as reducing the similarity features. Finally, considering the problem of class imbalance in ship target recognition in SAR scene images, a loss function, the central focal loss (CEFL), based on depth feature aggregation is constructed to reduce the differences within classes. Based on the dataset from OpenSARShip and Sentinel-1, the results of the experiment suggest that the the proposed method is feasible and the accuracy of the proposed method is improved by 3.9 percentage points compared with the traditional RetinaNet.

TI  - Statistical Study of Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly after Midnight Based on FY-3(D) Ionospheric Photometer
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The OI135.6 nm radiation intensity and the associated change with solar activity are very complex, and this is particularly the case during November 2020. In this paper, we investigated the OI135.6 nm radiation intensity in the low-latitude ionosphere during a quiet geomagnetic period. The Ionospheric Photometer (IPM) instrument onboard the FY-3(D) meteorological satellite was employed to measure the OI135.6 nm night airglow at 02:00 LT (local time) and its response to the solar activity. The results showed there is a statistically significant correlation between the intensity of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA) and solar activity after midnight. The EIA at 02:00 LT and before midnight shared the same climatological characteristics-strong in equinoxes and weak in solstices. In November 2020, when the F10.7 flux significantly increased, the OI135.6 nm radiation intensity in the EIA region recorded a 100-200% increase compared to the previous month, which was much higher than in the same period in the preceding two years. A similar phenomenon was observed at the same time by the Global-scale Observations of Limb and Disk (GOLD), which makes continuous observations of ionospheric structure variation in global patterns. Data analysis suggests that the EIA at 02:00 LT was due to the attenuation of the EIA before midnight after the disappearance of the eastward electric field. The magnetic latitude of the EIA crest (hereafter denoted by theta mlF2) indicates a range-and-seasonal rule of hemispherical asymmetry: closer to the geomagnetic equator in equinoxes and farther away from the geomagnetic equator in solstices. Further studies are needed.

TI  - Inferring Changes in Arctic Sea Ice through a Spatio-Temporal Logistic Autoregression Fitted to Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) has drawn increasing attention from scientists in recent years because of its fast decline in the Boreal summer and early fall. The measurement of SIE is derived from remote sensing data and is both a lagged and leading indicator of climate change. To characterize at a local level the decline in SIE, we use remote-sensing data at 25 km resolution to fit a spatio-temporal logistic autoregressive model of the sea-ice evolution in the Arctic region. The model incorporates last year's ice/water binary observations at nearby grid cells in an autoregressive manner with autoregressive coefficients that vary both in space and time. Using the model-based estimates of ice/water probabilities in the Arctic region, we propose several graphical summaries to visualize the spatio-temporal changes in Arctic sea ice beyond what can be visualized with the single time series of SIE. In ever-higher latitude bands, we observe a consistently declining temporal trend of sea ice in the early fall. We also observe a clear decline in and contraction of the sea ice's distribution between 70 & LCIRC;N-75 & LCIRC;N, and of most concern is that this may reflect the future behavior of sea ice at ever-higher latitudes under climate change.

TI  - Near-infrared upconversion multimodal nanoparticles for targeted radionuclide therapy of breast cancer lymphatic metastases
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The theranostics of lymph node metastasis has always been one of the major obstacles to defeating breast cancer and an important decisive factor in the prognosis of patients. Herein, we design NaGdF4:Yb,Tm@NaLuF4 upconversion nanoparticles with PEG and anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab, Herceptin) (NP-mAb), the delivery of NP-mAb through the lymphatic system allows for effective targeting and accumulation in lymphatic metastasis. Combination of radionuclides Ga-68 and Lu-177 could be chelated by the bisphosphate groups of NP-mAb. The obtained nanoprobe (NP-mAb) and nanonuclear drug (Ga-68-NP-mAb or Lu-177-NP-mAb) exhibited excellent stability and show high accumulation and prolong retention in the lymph node metastasis after intratumoral injection into the foot pad by near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Utilizing the beta-rays released by Lu-177, Lu-177-NP-mAb could not only decrease the incidence of lymph node metastasis, but also significantly decrease the volumes of lymph node metastasis. Additionally, Lu-177-NP-mAb induce no obvious toxicity to treated mice through blood routine, liver and kidney function assay. Therefore, nanoprobe and nanonuclear drug we designed could be acted as excellent theranostics agents for lymph node metastasis, providing potential alternatives diagnose and treatment option for lymph node metastasis.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variation of Land Use and Vegetation in the Three-North Shelter Forest Program Area from 2000 to 2020
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-North Shelter Forest Program Area (TNSFPA), covering the three subregions of Northwest, North and Northeast China, is an important green ecological barrier in northern China. Research on spatiotemporal variation of land use and vegetation in this area can help us understand the evolution of vegetation recovery. Based on MODIS image data, we built a dataset including land use/cover, annual and seasonal vegetation coverage and vegetation productivity in the TNSFPA from 2000 to 2020, then analyzed their spatiotemporal dynamics' characteristics and further explored the driving factors. The results demonstrate that 90.05% of land area in the TNSFPA remained unchanged from 2001 to 2020. The area of barren decreased, whereas the area of all other land use types increased. From 2000 to 2020, the vegetation coverage generally presented a spatial pattern of high in the east and low in the west, and the interannual fluctuation of high coverage area was small. More than 90% of the TNSFPA had an increasing vegetation coverage (0.41%center dot a(-1)), with the change rates of 0.51%center dot a(-1), 0.54%center dot a(-1) and 0.37%center dot a(-1) in Northeast, North and Northwest China, respectively. The spatial distribution of vegetation productivity was generally consistent with the vegetation coverage, and the interannual fluctuation in areas with low productivity was small. The area with an increasing vegetation productivity (3.41 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1)) occupied 51.66% of the TNSFPA, mainly in the basic stable state and significantly increased state. The change rates in Northeast, North and Northwest China were 7.34 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1), 6.72 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1) and 2.10 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1), respectively. The vegetation coverage and productivity were positively correlated with climate factors, and the correlation with precipitation is significantly higher than that with temperature. The ecological protection and restoration activities in the TNSFPA have accelerated the recovery of the vegetation ecosystem. Meanwhile, the rapid growth of population has led to the acceleration of urbanization. The intensification of the interaction between humans and land has led to the reclamation and development of barren, which has a great impact on the small-scale vegetation ecosystem.

TI  - A Lightweight Privacy-Preserving System for the Security of Remote Sensing Images on IoT
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The acquisition of massive remote sensing data makes it possible to deeply fuse remote sensing and artificial intelligence (AI). The mobility and cost advantages of new sensing platforms in the Internet of Things (IoT) make them ideal for continuous deployment rather than traditional airborne platforms. However, remote sensing devices are vulnerable to malicious attacks and privacy leaks when sharing data due to the complex architecture and heterogeneity of IoT and the lack of a unified security protection mechanism. Traditional protection methods based on public-key encryption require not only complex operations but also energy consumption, which poses new challenges for resources-limited IoT. The objective of this paper was to propose a lightweight privacy-preserving system for the security of remote-sensing images based on visual cryptography. This stacking-to-see feature of visual cryptography enables the efficient encryption of big data such as high-resolution and multi-scale remote sensing images in resource-constrained IoT. To alleviate image quality degradation in visual cryptography, we combined denoising neural networks to extract high-quality images from encrypted datasets, thus improving the recognition accuracy of loss datasets. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of privacy protection and classification accuracy.

TI  - Nowcasting Applications of Geostationary Satellite Hourly Surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> Data
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mass concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5; diameters less than 2.5 mu m) estimated from geostationary satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data can supplement the network of ground monitors with high temporal (hourly) resolution. Estimates of PM2.5 over the United States were derived from NOAA's operational geostationary satellites' Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) AOD data using a geographically weighted regression with hourly and daily temporal resolution. Validation versus ground observations shows a mean bias of -21.4% and -15.3% for hourly and daily PM2.5 estimates, respectively, for concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 mu g m(-3). Because satellites only observe AOD in the daytime, the relation between observed daytime PM2.5 and daily mean PM2.5 was evaluated using ground measurements; PM2.5 estimated from ABI AODs were also examined to study this relationship. The ground measurements show that daytime mean PM2.5 has good correlation (r > 0.8) with daily mean PM2.5 in most areas of the United States, but with pronounced differences in the western United States due to temporal variations caused by wildfire smoke; the relation between the daytime and daily PM2.5 estimated from the ABI AODs has a similar pattern. While daily or daytime estimated PM2.5 provides exposure information in the context of the PM2.5 standard (>35 mu g m(-3)), the hourly estimates of PM2.5 used in nowcasting show promise for alerts and warnings of harmful air quality. The geostationary satellite based PM2.5 estimates inform the public of harmful air quality 10 times more than standard ground observations (1.8 versus 0.17 million people per hour). Significance StatementFine particulate matter (PM2.5; diameters less than 2.5 mu m) are generated from smoke, dust, and emissions from industrial, transportation, and other sectors. They are harmful to human health and even lead to premature mortality. Data from geostationary satellites can help estimate surface PM2.5 exposure by filling in gaps that are not covered by ground monitors. With this information, people can plan their outdoor activities accordingly. This study shows that availability of hourly PM2.5 observations covering the entire continental United States is more informative to the public about harmful exposure to pollution. On average, 1.8 million people per hour can be informed using satellite data compared to 0.17 million people per hour based on ground observations alone.

TI  - Resource-Based Port Material Yard Detection with SPPA-Net
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the material yard is a crucial place for storing coal, ore, and other raw materials, accurate access to its location is of great significance to the construction of resource-based ports, environmental supervision, and investment and operating costs. Its extraction is difficult owing to its small size, variable shape, and dense distribution. In this paper, the SPPA-Net target detection network was proposed to extract the material yard. Firstly, a Dual-Channel-Spatial-Mix Block (DCSM-Block) was designed based on the Faster R-CNN framework to enhance the feature extraction ability of the location and spatial information of the material yard. Secondly, the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) was introduced to improve the detection of material yards with different scales. Thirdly, a spatial pyramid pooling self-attention module (SPP-SA) was established to increase the global semantic information between material yards and curtail false detection and missed detection. Finally, the domestic GF-2 satellite data was adopted to conduct extraction experiments on the material yard of the port. The results demonstrated that the detection accuracy of the material yard reached 88.7% when the recall rate was 90.1%. Therefore, this study provided a new method for the supervision and environmental supervision of resource-based port material yards.

T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - As the research on space-borne LiDAR in China is insufficient, we explore the hybrid source photogrammetry of optical remote sensing images and space-borne LiDAR. The surface-element trajectory matching of digital elevation model (DEM) is performed on photon data of space-borne LiDAR to establish the correspondence between the trajectory of laser altimetry points and the digital surface model (DSM) generated by remote sensing images. Then, the selected ground photons and high-resolution optical remote sensing images are combined with the joint block adjustment method. By the iterative solution method considering coordinate errors of laser altimetry points, the stereo positioning accuracy of satellite remote sensing images can he promoted. The data ATL03 of space-borne LiDAR, as well as satellite remote sensing images from Gaofen-7 (GF-7) and Tianhui-3 (TH-3), are used to verify the performance of the method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively improve the stereo positioning accuracy of satellite remote sensing images without ground control points, and the elevation accuracy can reach 1. 258 m.

TI  - Tree Species Classification Using Plant Functional Traits and Leaf Spectral Properties along the Vertical Canopy Position
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant functional traits are rarely used in tree species classification, and the impact of vertical canopy positions on collecting samples for classification also remains unclear. We aim to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of leaf traits in classification, as well as to detect the effect of vertical position on classification accuracy. This work will deepen our understanding of the ecological mechanism of natural forest structure and succession from new perspectives. In this study, we collected foliar samples from three canopy layers (upper, middle and lower) and measured their spectra, as well as eight well-known leaf traits. We used a leaf hyperspectral reflectance (LHR) dataset, leaf functional traits (LFT) dataset and LFT + LHR dataset to classify six dominant tree species in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. Our results showed that the LFT + LHR dataset achieved the highest classification results (overall accuracy (OA) = 77.65% and Kappa = 0.73), followed by the LFT dataset (OA = 74.26% and Kappa = 0.69) and the LHR dataset (OA = 69.06% and Kappa = 0.63). Along the vertical canopy, the OA and Kappa increased from the lower to the upper layers, and the combination data of the three canopy layers achieved the highest accuracy. For the individual tree species, the shade-tolerant species (including Machilus chinensis, Cryptocarya chinensis and Cryptocarya concinna) produced higher accuracies than the light-demanding species (including Schima superba and Castanopsis chinensis). Our results provide an approach for enhancing tree species recognition from the plant physiology and biochemistry perspective and emphasize the importance of vertical direction in forest community research.

TI  - Spatial Pattern Impact of Impervious Surface Density on Urban Heat Island Effect: A Case Study in Xuzhou, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces (IPS) are the major source of urban heat island effect (UHI), and the relationships between IPS and land surface temperature (LST) have been widely studied. However, the spatial impact of landscape patterns of patches with different IPS density (IPSD) on the thermal environment remains largely unexplored. Based on three Landsat 8 images of the Xuzhou built-up area obtained in May and the corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020, the IPSD and LST maps were inversed through a linear spectral mixture analysis and mono-window algorithm, respectively. The landscape patterns of the five IPSD levels were characterized by four landscape-level and five class-level metrics. Finally, the spatial correlation between all landscape metrics and LST were analyzed using bivariate Moran's I. The results were as follows: (1) The findings revealed that for the landscape-level metrics, LST had significant positive spatial correlations with Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), Shannon's evenness index (SHEI), and patch density (PD), while showing a significant negative correlation with contagion index (CONTAG), indicating that increasing the types, even distribution degree, and density of patches, or decreasing the aggregation degree of the five IPSD levels will lead to the enhancement of the thermal environment. (2) Furthermore, the class-level metrics of each IPSD level, percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), aggregation index (AI), and patch cohesion index (COHESION) showed significant correlations and LST, which signified that the spatial characteristics of patch proportion, predominance degree, shape complexity, aggregation degree, and natural connectivity degree of each IPSD level are important factors affecting UHI. In addition, the spatial correlations between LST and class-level metrics were significantly positive for IPSD levels 4 and 5 with an evidently higher Moran's I value, indicating that landscape patterns of IPSD levels 4 and 5 were the key factors in UHI enhancement. Furthermore, the impact weights of each class-level metric of IPSD levels 4 and 5 on LST were also analyzed by applying the principal component analysis and the multivariate regression standardization coefficient. These results reveal the importance and impact mechanism of the IPSD spatial patterns on UHI evolution, which may provide a valuable reference for future urban planning and climate management. This study also suggests that regional UHI can be mitigated by reducing the area proportion, natural connectivity, and shape complexity of high-density impervious surfaces.

TI  - Agricultural Drought Assessment in a Typical Plain Region Based on Coupled Hydrology-Crop Growth Model and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An agricultural drought assessment is the basis for formulating agricultural drought mitigation strategies. Traditional agricultural drought assessment methods reflect agricultural drought degree by using the soil water deficit, e.g., Soil Moisture Anomaly Percentage Index (SMAPI). However, due to varying water demands for different crops, a given soil water deficit results in varying crop water deficits and agricultural droughts. This variation often leads to a misinterpretation of agricultural drought classification when one only considers the soil water deficit. To consider the influence of crop growth, this study proposes an agricultural drought assessment method by coupling hydrological and crop models (variable infiltration capacity-environmental policy integrated climate, VIC-EPIC). Agricultural drought in Jiangsu Province, China was evaluated using the VIC-EPIC model and crop water anomaly percentage index (CWAPI). The validation results based on the actual drought records showed that the correlation coefficients (0.79 and 0.82, respectively) of the statistical values and CWAPI simulated values of light and moderate drought area rates were greater than those for SMAPI (0.72 and 0.81, respectively), indicating that the simulation results of the VIC-EPIC model in Jiangsu Province were highly reasonable. The temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the drought grade in typical large-scale drought events in Jiangsu Province were also analyzed.

TI  - Remote Sensing Extraction Method of <i>Illicium verum</i> Based on Functional Characteristics of Vegetation Canopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, researchers have attempted to improve the accuracy of tree species classifications from both data sources and methods. Although previous studies on tree species recognition have utilized the spectral and textural features of remote sensing images, they are unable to effectively extract tree species due to the problems of "same object with different spectrum" and "foreign object with the same spectrum". Therefore, this study introduces vegetation functional datasets to further improve tree species classification. Using vegetation functional datasets, Sentinel-2 (S2) spectral datasets, and environmental datasets, combined with a Random Forest (RF) model, the classification of six types of land cover in Leye, Guangxi was completed and the planting distribution of Illicium verum in Leye County was extracted. Our results showed that the combination of vegetation functional datasets, S2 spectral datasets, and environmental datasets provided the highest overall accuracy (OA) (0.8671), Kappa coefficient (0.8382), and F1-Score (0.79). We believe that the vegetation functional datasets can enhance the accuracy of Illicium verum classification and provide new directions for tree species identification research. If vegetation functional datasets from more tree species are obtained in the future, we can extend them to the level of multiple tree species, and this approach may help to extract more information about forest species from remote sensing data in future studies.

TI  - Optimal Channel Selection of Spaceborne Microwave Radiometer for Surface Pressure Retrieval over Oceans
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The O-2-band channel configuration of existing microwave radiometers is not optimal for surface pressure retrieval, which limits the surface pressure retrieval accuracy. In this study, we present the results of theoretically what might be the optimal microwave channels for surface pressure retrieval. An improved iterative selection method is used to select the channels that contain the highest cumulative content of surface pressure information. The selected optimal channel set comprises 16 channels, among which 10 channels are centered at the 50-60 GHz oxygen absorption band and 6 channels are centered around the 118.75 GHz oxygen absorption line. Two representative spaceborne microwave radiometers are used for comparisons, the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) on board the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite and the Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) on board the Chinese Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite. The results of information content analysis show that the optimal channel set contains more surface pressure information than that of the combination of SNPP/ATMS and FY-3C/MWHTS (SNPP/ATMS+FY-3C/MWHTS) channels. A representative dataset from the ERA5 data is input into the plane-parallel Microwave Radiative Transfer model to obtain the simulated brightness temperature observations of the selected optimal channels and the SNPP/ATMS+FY-3C/MWHTS channels. Using the simulated observations, retrieval experiments are performed. Experimental results show that retrieval accuracies of the optimal channel set are 1.09 and 1.64 hPa for clear-sky and cloudy conditions, respectively. The retrieval accuracies are 0.60 and 0.65 hPa better than that of the SNPP/ATMS+FY-3C/MWHTS channels for clear-sky and cloudy conditions, respectively.

TI  - Estimation and Dynamic Analysis of Soil Salinity Based on UAV and Sentinel-2A Multispectral Imagery in the Coastal Area, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient, convenient, and accurate method for monitoring the distribution characteristics of soil salinity is required to effectively control the damage of saline soil to the land environment and maintain a virtuous cycle of the ecological environment. There are still problems with single-monitoring data that cannot meet the requirements of different regional scales and accuracy, including inconsistent band reflectance between multi-source sensor data. This article proposes a monitoring method based on the multi-source data fusion of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral remote sensing, Sentinel-2A satellite remote sensing, and ground-measured salinity data. The research area and two experimental fields were located in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results show that the back-propagation neural network model (BPNN) in the comprehensive estimation model is the best prediction model for soil salinity (modeling accuracy R-2 reaches 0.769, verification accuracy R-2 reaches 0.774). There is a strong correlation between the satellite and UAV imagery, while the Sentinel-2A imagery after reflectivity correction has a superior estimation effect. In addition, the results of dynamic analysis show that the area of non-saline soil and mild-saline soil decreased, while the area of moderately and heavily saline soils and solonchak increased. Additionally, the average area share of different classes of saline soils distributed over the land use types varied in order, from unused land > grassland > forest land > arable land, where the area share of severe-saline soil distributed on unused land changed the most (89.142%). In this study, the results of estimation are close to the true values, which supports the feasibility of the multi-source data fusion method of UAV remote sensing satellite ground measurements. It not only achieves the estimation of soil salinity and monitoring of change patterns at different scales, but also achieve high accuracy of soil salinity prediction in ascending scale regions. It provides a theoretical scientific basis for the remediation of soil salinization, land use, and environmental protection policies in coastal areas.

TI  - A Possibility-Based Method for Urban Land Cover Classification Using Airborne Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been recognized as a reliable and accurate measurement tool in forest volume estimation, urban scene reconstruction and land cover classification, where LiDAR data provide crucial and efficient features such as intensity, elevation and coordinates. Due to the complex urban environment, it is difficult to classify land cover accurately and quickly from remotely sensed data. Methods based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DS theory) offer a possible solution to this problem. However, the inconsistency in the correspondence between classification features and land cover attributes constrains the improvement of classification accuracy. Under the original DS evidence theory classification framework, we propose a novel method for constructing a basic probability assignment (BPA) function based on possibility distributions and apply it to airborne LiDAR land cover classification. The proposed approach begins with a feature classification subset selected by single-feature classification results. Secondly, the possibility distribution of the four features was established, and the uncertainty relationship between feature values and land cover attributes was obtained. Then, we selected suitable interval cut-off points and constructed a BPA function. Finally, DS evidence theory was used for land cover classification. LiDAR and its co-registration data acquired by Toposys Falcon II were used in the performance tests of the proposed method. The experimental results revealed that it can significantly improve the classification accuracy compared to the basic DS method.

TI  - Validating the Crop Identification Capability of the Spectral Variance at Key Stages (SVKS) Computed via an Object Self-Reference Combined Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-distribution information constitutes the premise of precise management for crop cultivation. Euclidean distance and spectral angle mapper algorithms (ED and SAM) mostly use the spectral similarity and difference metric (SSDM) to determine the spectral variance associated with the spatial location for crop distribution acquisition. These methods are relatively insensitive to spectral shape or amplitude variation and must reconstruct a reference curve representing the entire class, possibly resulting in notable indeterminacy in the ultimate results. Few studies utilize these methods to compute the spectral variance associated with time and to define a new index for crop identification-namely, the spectral variance at key stages (SVKS)-even though this temporal spectral characteristic could be helpful for crop identification. To integrate the advantages of sensibility and avoid reconstructing the reference curve, an object self-reference combined algorithm comprising ED and SAM (CES) was proposed to compute SVKS. To objectively validate the crop-identification capability of SVKS-CES (SVKS computed via CES), SVKS-ED (SVKS computed via ED), SVKS-SAM (SVKS computed via SAM), and five spectral index (SI) types were selected for comparison in an example of maize identification. The results indicated that SVKS-CES ranges can characterize greater interclass spectral separability and attained better identification accuracy compared to other identification indexes. In particular, SVKS-CES2 provided the greatest interclass spectral separability and the best PA (92.73%), UA (100.00%), and OA (98.30%) in maize identification. Compared to the performance of the SI, SVKS attained greater interclass spectral separability, but more non-maize fields were incorrectly identified as maize fields via SVKS usage. Owning to the accuracy-improvement capability of SVKS-CES, the omission and commission errors were obviously reduced via the combined utilization of SVKS-CES and SI. The findings suggest that SVKS-CES application is expected to further spread in crop identification.

TI  - Extraction of Winter-Wheat Planting Areas Using a Combination of U-Net and CBAM
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is one of the most important food crops in China, and it is of great significance to ensure national food security. The accurate extraction of wheat-growing areas is a prerequisite for growth assessments, stress monitoring, and yield assessments. In this study, GF-6 (8 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) remote sensing images were used to create datasets for the accurate extraction of winter-wheat growing areas by improving the U-Net model. First, U-Net was used as the base network to extract features, and then the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was embedded in the basic convolutional units in the coding and decoding layers of the network to enhance or suppress the features to improve the feature-expression capability of the model, and to finally complete the end-to-end winter-wheat planting-area extraction. SegNet, DeepLabV3+, and U-Net-CBAM were selected as the comparison models, and they were tested using the test set in the Sentinel-2 dataset. The precision of the U-Net-CBAM model trained on the GF-6 dataset was 84.92%, the MIoU was 77.1%, the recall was 88.28%, the overall precision (OA) was 91.64%, and the F-1 was 86.45%. For training on Sentinel-2 dataset, those values were: 90.06% for precision, 83.18% for MIoU, 90.78% for recall, 93.93% for OA, and 90.52% for F-1, which showed significantly better results than those of the comparison models, indicating that U-Net-CBAM improved the accuracy of winter-wheat area extraction. It also showed that the segmentation performance of the training and test sets from different datasets was much lower than the segmentation performance from the same dataset.

TI  - Detection of Sea Surface Temperature Fronts from SAR Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) fronts are important for fisheries and marine ecology, as well as upper-ocean dynamics, weather forecasting, and climate monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect SST fronts from RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR images, based on the correlation of SAR-derived wind speeds using the gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) approach. Due to the large differences between the correlation of wind speeds for SST fronts compared to other areas, SST fronts can be detected by the threshold method. To eliminate small-scale features (or noise), the 30 km scale is used as the length threshold for the detection of the SST fronts. The proposed method is effective when wind speeds are between 3 and 13 m s(-1). The overall accuracy of our method is about 93.6%, which is sufficient for operational applications.

TI  - Exploring the Best-Matching Plant Traits and Environmental Factors for Vegetation Indices in Estimates of Global Gross Primary Productivity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest source of uncertainty in carbon cycle studies, accurate quantification of gross primary productivity (GPP) is critical for the global carbon budget in the context of global climate change. Numerous vegetation indices (VIs) based on satellite data have participated in the construction of GPP models. However, the relative performance of various VIs in predicting GPP and what additional factors should be combined with them to reveal the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation mechanistically better are still poorly understood. We constructed two types of models (universal and plant functional type [PFT]-specific) for solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) based on two widely used machine learning algorithms, i.e., the random forest (RF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. A total of thirty plant traits and environmental factors with legacy effects are considered in the model. We then systematically investigated the ancillary variables that best match each vegetation index in estimating global GPP. Four types of models (universal and PFT-specific, RF and BPNN) consistently show that SIF performs best when modeled using a single vegetation index (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.24 g C center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)); however, NIRv combined with CO2, plant traits, and climatic factors can achieve the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 1.40 g C center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)). Plant traits effectively enhance all prediction models' accuracy, and climatic variables are essential factors in improving the accuracy of NIRv- or LAI-based GPP models, but not the accuracy of SIF-based models. Our findings provide valuable information for the configuration of the data-driven models to improve the accuracy of predicting GPP and provide insights into the physiological and ecological mechanisms underpinning GPP prediction.

TI  - Drought Monitoring and Performance Evaluation Based on Machine Learning Fusion of Multi-Source Remote Sensing Drought Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is an extremely dangerous natural hazard that causes water crises, crop yield reduction, and ecosystem fires. Researchers have developed many drought indices based on ground-based climate data and various remote sensing data. Ground-based drought indices are more accurate but limited in coverage; while the remote sensing drought indices cover larger areas but have poor accuracy. Applying data-driven models to fuse multi-source remote sensing data for reproducing composite drought index may help fill this gap and better monitor drought in terms of spatial resolution. Machine learning methods can effectively analyze the hierarchical and non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables, resulting in better performance compared with traditional linear regression models. In this study, seven drought impact factors from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor, Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were used to reproduce the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) for Shandong province, China, from 2002 to 2020. Three machine learning methods, namely bias-corrected random forest (BRF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machines (SVM) were applied as regression models. Then, the best model was used to construct the spatial distribution of SPEI. The results show that the BRF outperforms XGBoost and SVM in SPEI estimation. The BRF model can effectively monitor drought conditions in areas without ground observation data. The BRF model provides comprehensive drought information by producing a spatial distribution of SPEI, which provides reliability for the BRF model to be applied in drought monitoring.

TI  - Effects of Shifting Spring Phenology on Growing Season Carbon Uptake in High Latitudes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenological shifts not only alter the growing season length, but also modify land-atmosphere exchanges of water and energy, which in turn affects ecosystem carbon uptake. However, how changes in the start of the growing season (SOS) affect carbon uptake throughout growing season has not been fully explored for high-latitude ecosystems. Here, we investigated the impacts of SOS shifts on carbon uptake and the mechanisms over 2000-2020 in the northern high latitudes (>50 degrees N) using multiple satellite and climate data sets. We found a contrasting response of gross primary productivity (GPP) in the early (April-June) and late (July-September) growing season to SOS shifts. Advanced SOS resulted in increased early-season GPP, whereas slightly decreased late-season GPP. The earlier SOS resulted from a warmer early season, which induced a decline of snow to precipitation ratio, therefore drier soil and atmosphere. In the early season, when water requirement of vegetation was low, the warm and dry conditions ensured favorable solar radiation and improved vegetation water use efficiency (WUE), thus enhancing photosynthesis. The dry soil and atmosphere conditions extended to the late season due to less snow and excessive water utilization by vegetation in the early season, which therefore slightly suppressed photosynthesis by weakening WUE. Conversely, the delayed SOS resulted in reduced early-season GPP and slightly enhanced late-season GPP due to the opposite thermal and moisture conditions to that of advanced SOS. The SOS is likely to be further advanced as warming continues in the high latitudes, intensifying seasonal contrasts in vegetation photosynthesis capacity.Plain Language Summary Spring phenology shifts not only change the length of growing season, but modify local and regional climate that in turn affects the magnitude of ecosystem carbon uptake, which is not well understood, particularly in the high-latitude ecosystems. Here, we investigated the effects of a shifting spring phenology on subsequent seasonal carbon uptake and explored the underlying mechanisms in the northern high latitudes (>50 degrees N) using satellite data and climate data sets. We found that warming-induced earlier spring resulted in an enhanced carbon uptake in the early season (April-June), but slightly weakened carbon uptake in the late season (July-September). Early season warming caused advanced spring greenup dates and drier conditions with improved vegetation water use efficiency (WUE). The warm and dry conditions improved vegetation WUE because of the low water requirement, thus enhancing vegetation productivity. The dry conditions extended to the late season due to less snow. With the higher temperature in the late season, water stress reduced the WUE of vegetation and therefore resulted in a slight decrease in vegetation productivity.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 induces "cytokine storm" hyperinflammatory responses in RA patients through pyroptosis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that threatens worldwide public health, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune disease. COVID-19 and RA are each strong risk factors for the other, but their molecular mechanisms are unclear. This study aims to investigate the biomarkers between COVID-19 and RA from the mechanism of pyroptosis and find effective disease-targeting drugs. MethodsWe obtained the common gene shared by COVID-19, RA (GSE55235), and pyroptosis using bioinformatics analysis and then did the principal component analysis(PCA). The Co-genes were evaluated by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and ClueGO for functional enrichment, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built by STRING, and the k-means machine learning algorithm was employed for cluster analysis. Modular analysis utilizing Cytoscape to identify hub genes, functional enrichment analysis with Metascape and GeneMANIA, and NetworkAnalyst for gene-drug prediction. Network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify target drug-related genes intersecting with COVID-19, RA, and pyroptosis to acquire Co-hub genes and construct transcription factor (TF)-hub genes and miRNA-hub genes networks by NetworkAnalyst. The Co-hub genes were validated using GSE55457 and GSE93272 to acquire the Key gene, and their efficacy was assessed using receiver operating curves (ROC); SPEED2 was then used to determine the upstream pathway. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using CIBERSORT and validated by the HPA database. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) were used to explore and validate drug-gene relationships through computer-aided drug design. ResultsCOVID-19, RA, and pyroptosis-related genes were enriched in pyroptosis and pro-inflammatory pathways(the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complex, death-inducing signaling complex, regulation of interleukin production), natural immune pathways (Network map of SARS-CoV-2 signaling pathway, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19-and RA-related cytokine storm pathways (IL, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), TNF signaling pathway and regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling). Of these, CASP1 is the most involved pathway and is closely related to minocycline. YY1, hsa-mir-429, and hsa-mir-34a-5p play an important role in the expression of CASP1. Monocytes are high-caspase-1-expressing sentinel cells. Minocycline can generate a highly stable state for biochemical activity by docking closely with the active region of caspase-1. ConclusionsCaspase-1 is a common biomarker for COVID-19, RA, and pyroptosis, and it may be an important mediator of the excessive inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 in RA patients through pyroptosis. Minocycline may counteract cytokine storm inflammation in patients with COVID-19 combined with RA by inhibiting caspase-1 expression.

TI  - Seriality as a principle of narration in contemporary prose (Nosov, Sal'nikov, Pelevin)
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the narrative aspects of the category of seriality based on the novels of contemporary Russian writers. It is stated that, in contemporary literary criticism, the concept of seriality is used to characterize two different trends. The first is a designation of the desire for a repetition of intrigue and characters in works of popular literature. The second is a fundamental feature of the poetics of the avant-garde and postmodernist texts manifested in several ways (fragmentation, stringing of the same type of episodes, or deconstruction of a linear sequence of events). The analysis has proved that this serial structure of narration actualizes the neo-cumulative intrigue, aiming not to depict a static "imaginary" world or a catastrophic resolution of the initial situation (which is typical for the traditional cumulative plot model) but to multiply a paradigmatic event. This type of repetition indicates a provocation strategy that activates the consciousness of the addressee. Nosov's novel "The Curly Brackets" uses the potential of the cumulative stringing of episodes corresponding to the occasionalistic artistic worldview and the occupation of the characters (who are magicians). Salnikov's novels feature the interaction of series of diegetic events with events conditioned by the imagination of the focalizers ("Petrovs' Flu") or by the poetic intention of inserted texts ("Indirectly"). In Pelevin's serial universe, the "self-closure" of the narrated events is never complete: their depiction involves a polyphonic system of interpretations with which to discover the semantic lacunae.

TI  - The associative poetics of the neo-avant-garde text: "Sebastian in Dream" by Vyktor Ivaniv
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examines the associative structure of a modern neo-avant-garde text by analyzing the poem "Sebastian in Dream" written by Novosibirsk poet Vyktor Ivaniv. This poem's structure is a palimpsest of intermedial and intertextual allusions allowing the poetry of the Russian and German literary avant-garde to be correlated. The starting point, however, is not a literary impression but a pictorial one - a childhood reproduction of Hans Baldung Grien's painting "Martyrdom of St. Sebastian", around which the poet's kenotic myth is constructed. The Sebastian's image seems synthetic: it is the poet's image as a sacred sacrifice that is to restore the existence integrity. Ivaniv correlates the texts of G. Trakl ("To the dead in his youth") and E. Guro ("The poor knight", "Autumnal dream"), noting their common "dreamlike" worldview, the motif of a dying talented youth, and the reversibility of "sleep" and "trauma". Young poet's death grows into a symbol reflecting the tragic structure of the world. When expanding the range of meanings associated with the image of Sebastian-Wilhelm, Ivaniv also broadens the range of literary contexts, recalling the historiosophic concepts of V. Khlebnikov and the visionary compositions of G. Heym. The context correlation aims to remove the boundaries between the word and reality: the protagonist in E. Guro's books dies not in the text but in the village of Uusikirkko, where the poetess lived with M. Matyushin. Ivaniv combines the "life texts" and "art texts", with the metaphor of the cut throat illustrating the practices of self-destruction in reality.

TI  - Linear and Nonlinear Characteristics of Long-Term NDVI Using Trend Analysis: A Case Study of Lancang-Mekong River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is the main body of the terrestrial ecosystem and is a significant indicator of environmental changes in the regional ecosystem. As an essential link connecting South Asia and Southeast Asia, the Lancang-Mekong River Basin(LMRB) can provide essential data support and a decision-making basis for the assessment of terrestrial ecosystem environmental changes and the research and management of hydrology and water resources in the basin by monitoring changes in its vegetation cover. This study takes the Lancang-Mekong River Basin as the study area, and employs the Sen slope estimation, Mann-Kendall test, and Hurst exponent based on the MODIS NDVI data from 2000 to 2021 to study the spatial and temporal evolution trend and future sustainability of its NDVI. Besides, the nonlinear characteristics such as mutation type and mutation year are detected and analyzed using the BFAST01 method. Results demonstrated that: (1) In the past 22 years, the NDVI of the Lancang-Mekong River Basin generally exhibited a fluctuating upward trend, and the NDVI value in 2021 was the largest, which was 0.825, showing an increase of 4.29% compared with 2000. However, the increase rate was different: China has the most considerable NDVI growth rate of 7.25%, followed by Thailand with an increase of 7.21%, Myanmar and Laos as the third, while Cambodia and Vietnam have relatively stable vegetation changes. The overall performance of NDVI is high in the south and low in the north, and is dominated by high and relatively high vegetation coverage, of which the area with vegetation coverage exceeding 0.8 accounts for 62%. (2) The Sen-MK trend showed that from 2000 to 2021, the area where the vegetation coverage in the basin showed a trend of increase and decrease accounted for 66.59% and 18.88%, respectively. The Hurst exponent indicated that the areas where NDVI will continue to increase, decrease, and remain unchanged in the future account for 60.14%, 25.29%, and 14.53%, respectively, and the future development trend of NDVI is uncertain, accounting for 0.04%. Thus, more attention should be paid to areas with a descending future development trend. (3) BFAST01 detected eight NDVI mutation types in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin over the past 22 years. The mutations mainly occurred in 2002-2018, while 2002-2004 and 2014-2018 were the most frequent periods of breakpoints. The mutation type of "interruption: increase with negative break" was changed the most during this period, which accounts for 36.54%, and the smallest was "monotonic decrease (with negative break)", which only accounts for 0.65%. This research demonstrates that combining the conventional trend analysis method with the BFAST mutation test can more accurately analyze the spatiotemporal variation and nonlinear mutation of NDVI, thus providing a scientific reference to develop ecological environment-related work.

The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to simulate the air mass transport trajectory during this haze period to classify the formation process. The spatial distribution of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) was obtained by processing Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using the dark target (DT) method. Three factors were used to analyze the AOD spatial distribution characteristics based on the perceptual hashing algorithm (PHA): GDP, population density, and topography. Correlations between aerosols and the wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation were analyzed using weather station data. The research results showed that the haze period in Guanzhong was mainly due to locally generated haze (94.7%). The spatial distribution factors are GDP, population density, and topography. The statistical results showed that wind direction mainly affected aerosol diffusion in Guanzhong, while wind speed (r = -0.63) and precipitation (r = -0.66) had a significant influence on aerosol accumulation and diffusion.

TI  - Regional Spatiotemporal Patterns of Fire in the Eurasian Subarctic Based on Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fire risks in the vast Eurasian Subarctic are increasing, raising concerns for both local and global climate systems. Although some studies have addressed this problem, their conclusions only draw from relatively lower resolution data, and the sub-regional analysis of fire patterns in this area is lacking. In this paper, using a huge amount of multi-temporal and multi-resolution remotely sensed data, derived products, and weather data between the period 2001 and 2021, we reveal several novel and recent findings concerning regional and overall fire patterns in the Eurasian Subarctic. First, we discovered that fire occurrence over the period 2001 and 2021 varied by sub-region within the Eurasian Subarctic, with perennial low fire incidence in the East European and West Siberian Plain, increasing fire incidence in the Central Siberian Plateau, and marked periodicity of fire in the East Siberian Highlands. Second, we reveal the larger scale of individual fires in the Eurasian Subarctic compared to the adjacent region to the south, with fires of longer duration (13 vs. 8 days), larger daily expansion area (7.5 vs. 3.0 km(2)/d), and faster propagation (442 vs. 280 m/d). Third, the northern limit of fire has extended poleward approximately 1.5 degrees during the study period. Fourth, the start dates of fire seasons in Eurasian Subarctic, dominated by the Central Siberian Plateau, has advanced at a rate of 1.4 days per year. We also analyzed the factors resulting in the regional patterns of fire incidence including weather, human activity, land cover, and landscape structure. Our findings not only increase the knowledge of regional fire patterns and trends in Eurasian Subarctic but also will benefit the design of special fire management policies.

TI  - The 8 January 2022, Menyuan Earthquake in Qinghai, China: A Representative Event in the Qilian-Haiyuan Fault Zone Observed Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 8 January 2022, a Ms 6.9 earthquake occurred in Menyuan, Qinghai, China. This event provided important geodetic data before and after the earthquake, facilitating the investigation of the slip balance along the seismogenic faults to understand seismogenic behavior and assess seismic risk. In this study, we obtained the interseismic (2016-2021) and coseismic deformation fields of the 2022 earthquake using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and estimated the slip rate, fault locking, and coseismic slip of the seismogenic faults. The results indicated that the seismogenic fault of the 2022 Menyuan earthquake, i.e., the Tuolaishan-Lenglongling Fault, had shallow locked areas before the earthquake; its long-term slip rate could reach 6 +/- 1.2 mm/yr. The earthquake ruptured a sinistral strike-slip fault with a high dip angle; the maximum slip magnitude reached 3.47 m, with a moment magnitude of 6.6. The area of coseismic slip > 1.5 m was equivalent to the range of the isoline, with a locking value of 0.6. The interseismic locking region can limit the approximate scope of the coseismic slip distribution. The 2022 Menyuan earthquake released energy that had accumulated over 482 years in the stepover region between the Lenglongling and Tuolaishan faults. The accumulated elastic strain power of the Tuolaishan Fault was equivalent to an Mw 6.79 earthquake. These circumstances in terms of the strain energy balance demonstrate that interseismic locking, as constrained from the geodetic data, and the elapsed time from the previous paleoseismic event are useful for earthquake location and energy predictions.

TI  - Finding point method and re-optimized method for the brightness temperature simulation from Fengyun 4A AGRI in infrared channels
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The correlated k-distribution (CKD) is a fast radiative transfer model and is often used in atmospheric absorption simulation. In the paper, we apply two automatic CKD methods to satellite brightness temperature simulations from the Fengyun 4A Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) in infrared channels, namely, the finding point method (FPM) and the re-optimized method (ROM). In the calculation, we used Radiative Transfer for the TelevisionObservation SatelliteOperationalVertical Sounder (RTTOV) as the comparison, andwe use line-by-line (LBL) integration as the reference. Compared with LBL in the brightness temperature simulation of real profiles, the errors of FPM in 7.1 mu mand 13.5 mu mchannels are 0.22 K, -0.13 Kfor mean error and 0.3128 K, 0.2184Kfor root mean square error (RMSE), respectively, which are larger than that of RTTOV, with 0.16 K, 0.02 K, 0.2144 K, and 0.1226 K, respectively. In the other channels, the results show that of ROM has the highest accuracy and RTTOV has the lowest accuracy. In general, FPM and ROM can achieve very good accuracy in satellite infrared remote sensing. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI  - Surface Subsidence Monitoring in Kunming City with Time-Series InSAR and GNSS
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Kunming city is located in the middle of Yunnan Province. Due to large-scale groundwater exploitation and urban development in recent years, this area has been affected by surface subsidence. In this paper, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data are used to monitor the surface subsidence in Kunming city area for better analysis and understanding. The study used data of Sentinel-1A from 2018 to 2020 with atmospheric correction based on GACOS to calculate the average annual subsidence rate in Kunming city area, and the results show that the maximum subsidence rate is 48 mm/year. The subsidence obtained by InSAR is compared with the vertical deformation information obtained by eight GNSS stations in continuous operation in the study area. The subsidence rate trend show by the two methods is consistent, which further verifies the validity of InSAR data to reflect the local deformation. Experimental results shown that the eastern and northeastern Dianchi lake areas were affected by underground resources mining, and the induced surface subsidence characteristics were obvious, with the surface subsidence rate reachde 48 mm/year and 37 mm/year respectively. The Kunyang Phosphate Mine also had different degrees of mining subsidence disaster, with the maximum subsidence rate reached 36 mm/year. The subsidence rate of InSAR and GNSS has the same trend on the whole. However, GNSS sites are generally located in stable areas, the settlement amount obtained in the same time period is somewhat different from that of InSAR.

TI  - SPATIOTEMPORAL SATELLITE DATA IMPUTATION USING SPARSE FUNCTIONAL DATA ANALYSIS
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many scientific applications and signal processing algorithms require complete satellite images. However, missing data in satellite images is very common due to various reasons such as cloud cover and sensor-specific prob-lems. This paper introduces a general spatiotemporal satellite image impu-tation method based on sparse functional data analytic techniques. To han-dle observations consisting of a few longitudinally repeated satellite images that are themselves partially observed and noise-contaminated, we propose a multistep imputation method by following the best linear unbiased predic-tion principle and pooling information across all available locations and time points. Theoretical properties are established for the proposed approach under a new observation model for functional data that covers the dataset in ques-tion as a special case. Practical analysis on the Landsat data are conducted to illustrate and validate our algorithm which also shows that the proposed method considerably outperforms existing algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. An efficient implementation using R and Rcpp is made available in the R package stfit.

TI  - Spatial downscaling of satellite soil moisture products based on apparent thermal inertia: Considering the effect of vegetation condition
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions require soil moisture (SM) estimates at fine-resolutions. Soil moisture estimates of current satellite missions are normally at coarse spatial resolutions, such as 25-36 km for Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) SM data. Many spatial downscaling approaches have been developed to get finer resolution SM. Apparent thermal inertia (ATI), as a reliable approximation of thermal inertia (TI) that could be derived from daily fine-resolution optical/thermal remote sensing (RS) data, has been testified to be highly related to SM. However, the empirical relationship between ATI and SM varies with vegetation cover density. The main purpose of this study is to develop an ATI-based SM downscaling method that is free of vegetation cover effects. The study was conducted in Naqu areas in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP) in southwest China, where spatially intensive in-situ SM measurements were routinely obtained. European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture combined product (version 4.2) was used for this study. The fine-resolution (1 km) ATI data were derived from the Collection 6 MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. A modified quantile-quantile (Q-Q) adjustment method was applied to correct the bias of the CCI SM data before downscaling. A non-linear regression model between bias -corrected CCI SM and fine resolution ATI was built to disaggregate the bias-corrected SM to spatial resolution of 1 km. In this model, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was introduced to globally and quantitatively adjust the vegetation effect in the relationship between SM and ATI. The bias-corrected CCI SM and the downscaled 1 km resolution SM were evaluated using the in-situ SM measurements obtained from the Multi-scale Soil Moisture and Temperature Monitoring Network on the central TP (CTP-SMTMN) in the study area. The results indicate that the proposed modified Q-Q adjustment method effectively reduced the bias of the original CCI SM data (bias = 0 m(3)/m(3)). The downscaled 1 km resolution SM shows fine scale spatial variability of soil moisture and preserves the accuracy (R = 0.552) and temporal variability of the bias-corrected CCI SM. The accuracies of the downscaled SM over areas with different vegetation cover show quite good consistency. The uncertainties of the proposed SM spatial downscaling method were comprehensively analyzed. The proposed ATI-based SM downscaling algo-rithm is applicable to generating representative and consistent high spatial resolution SM over areas with different vegetation cover density.

TI  - Potential of Two SAR-Based Flood Mapping Approaches in Supporting an Integrated 1D/2D HEC-RAS Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential of Sentinel-1 data in assisting flood modeling procedures. Two different synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing methodologies, one simplified based on single-flood image thresholding and one automatic based on SAR statistical temporal analysis, were exploited to delineate the flooding caused by a storm event that took place in Spercheios River, Central Greece. The storm event was simulated by coupling a HEC-HMS hydrologic model and an integrated 1D/2D HEC-RAS hydraulic model. Both SAR methodologies were compared to each other and also used as a reference to test the sensitivity of the hydraulic model in the variation of upstream discharge and roughness coefficient. Model sensitivity was investigated with respect to the change in the derived inundation extent and three additional metrics: the Critical Success Index (CSI), the Hit Rate (HR), and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR). The model response was found to be affected in the following order: by the upstream inflow, and by the variation of the roughness coefficient in the main channel and in the land use "cultivated crops". The discrepancies observed between model- and SAR-derived inundation products are associated with the uncertainty accompanying the SAR processing and the utilized satellite data itself, the underlying topography, and the structural uncertainty inherent in the modeling procedure. Regarding the SAR methodologies tested, the second one (FLOMPY approach) proved to be more suitable, yielding a more coherent and realistic flooded area. According to the applied metrics and considering as reference the FLOMPY result, model performance ranged between 22-27.5% (CSI), 36.9-60.4% (HR), and 62.1-68.2% (FAR).

TI  - "Sharing a Husband": The Representation of Polygamy in Buchi Emecheta's <i>The Joys of Motherhood</i> (1979)
T2  - RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES
M3  - Article
AB  - In approaching the topic of polygamy and how it is discussed in Buchi Emecheta's The Joys of Motherhood (1979), this article uses two central concepts: firstly, Maria Lugones's idea of "world travelling," which emphasizes the need to understand the plurality of women's perspectives, enabling the decentering of feminist debates; and secondly, Marilyn Frye's idea of the "loving eye," closely connected to Lugones's concept, which calls for us to see other worlds and see other women from within their worlds-that is, from within their specific sociocultural contexts. Using these two concepts to analyze Emecheta's novel and its representation of polygamy, I argue that polygamy is as valid as monogamy and posit that no useful discussion of polygamy can take place from within a Eurocentric worldview. I also highlight the role of empire more generally in denigrating unfamiliar customs and traditions in various parts of Africa by framing them as illegitimate. This illegitimacy still affects representations and perceptions of polygamy today, as a form of marriage that (it is implied) has no place in a "civilized" world.

TI  - Positioning and Calibration Accuracy Evaluation of HIRAS-II by FY-3E Imager on Same Platform
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Infrared Hyperspectral Atmospheric Sounder II (HIRAS-II) is mounted on China's Fengyun-3E satellite (FY-3E), a meteorological satellite in dawn-dusk orbit. The high geolocation accuracy and radiometric calibration accuracy of the instrument are the keys to the quantitative application of its observational data. The relative deviations of geolocation and radiometric calibration of HIRAS-II are evaluated via cross-comparison by the Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager-Low Light (MERSI-LL) mounted on the same satellite platform. After the observational data samples of the two instruments are spatially matched, the MERSI-LL data is used to evaluate the observation background uniformity of the matched samples. The geolocation accuracy of HIRAS-II is evaluated with non-uniform background observation samples of sea-land or cloud boundary, and its radiometric calibration accuracy is evaluated with homogeneous background observation samples of clear-sky ocean and other scenes. Before cross-comparison, the hyperspectral simulated observational data of each infrared channel in MERSI-LL is obtained by integrating the HIRAS-II observed radiation spectrum with the spectral response function of each infrared channel in MERSI-LL. The results show that the geolocation of HIRAS-II at nadir deviates by 3. 53 km in the along-orbit direction and 2. 01 km in the cross-orbit direction. In terms of radiometric calibration accuracy, the mean radiation brightness temperature (BT) deviations of most channels in HIRAS-II and MERSI-LL are lower than 0. 50 K, and the standard deviation of the deviations is lower than 0. 40 K. Only the deviation of the 4. 05 mu m channel is large to the low-temperature target, and the temperature dependence of this channel is obvious. The BT deviation of the 4. 05 mu m channel fluctuates while that of the 8. 55 mu m channel does not change significantly with the scanning angle. The variations in the BT deviations of the other channels with the scanning angle are related to the target temperature. The long time series analysis of the BT deviation shows that it remains stable as a whole.

AB  - Snow is one of the most important climatic-hydrological variables that plays a vital role in watersheds. This importance is multiplied in Iran, as Iran is a warm country which is dependent on melting snow for the warm seasons. The purpose of this study is to monitor and project snowfall changes in Iran. To this end, we used two sources of data; the daily snow cover data of MODIS Terra satellite with horizontal resolution of 0.01 arc degree during the period of 2000-2019 for snow monitoring, and bias-corrected output of CMIP6 models under SSP scenarios for the period 2021-2100 with horizontal resolution of 0.5 arc degree for projection of snow cover. According to satellite data, spatial snow cover often occurs in the Alborz and Zagros altitudes with a snow boundary of 4000 m above sea level (MASL), and most snow cover occurs in January. The snowfall projection for the future period showed a significant downward trend at level of 0.05, the slope of which is steeper in the cold months of the year (December to February). Caspian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Oman Sea basins show a more decreasing trend of snowfall than other basins. Under a pessimistic scenario of SSP 5-8.5 in the period 2061-2100, snowfall will decrease by 6.8-7.4 cm in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea basins for the high Zagros highlands in January. Due to the reduction of snowfall in the main basins of Iran, integrated watershed management is crucial in the field of water resources.

TI  - Aerosol effects on clouds are concealed by natural cloud heterogeneity and satellite retrieval errors
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors showed that previous analyses which have estimated that the cloud water content decreases with increasing number of cloud droplets may have a negative bias due to variability in satellite data, thus underestimating aerosol-cloud-climate cooling.One major source of uncertainty in the cloud-mediated aerosol forcing arises from the magnitude of the cloud liquid water path (LWP) adjustment to aerosol-cloud interactions, which is poorly constrained by observations. Many of the recent satellite-based studies have observed a decreasing LWP as a function of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) as the dominating behavior. Estimating the LWP response to the CDNC changes is a complex task since various confounding factors need to be isolated. However, an important aspect has not been sufficiently considered: the propagation of natural spatial variability and errors in satellite retrievals of cloud optical depth and cloud effective radius to estimates of CDNC and LWP. Here we use satellite and simulated measurements to demonstrate that, because of this propagation, even a positive LWP adjustment is likely to be misinterpreted as negative. This biasing effect therefore leads to an underestimate of the aerosol-cloud-climate cooling and must be properly considered in future studies.

TI  - Perceptions of racism in a children's psychiatric inpatient unit: A qualitative study of entrenching and uprooting factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accessible Summary What is known on the subject? The impacts of racism on health are well documented and are greater for mental than for general health. Mental health professionals are well positioned to help dismantle racism and structural barriers compromising optimal patient care. What the paper adds to existing knowledge We describe a systematic and orderly way to identify factors that contribute to entrenching racism as the status quo or that help to uproot it. By incorporating a racial equity lens, we can better understand daily racism and inform the optimal antiracist actions most relevant to an inpatient psychiatric setting. What are the implications for practice? Our two-domain/six-theme model may serve as a rubric for individuals to engage in structured self-reflection, for organizations in auditing or programmatic evaluation, or as scaffolding for difficult but frequently elided conversations. The unique strengths of a mental health environment can be harnessed toward the elimination of racism and racist practices in clinical care and in the workplace IntroductionIt is well documented that racism plays a role in health care access and outcomes. However, discussions about racism in the inpatient psychiatric workplace are generally avoided. To address this gap, we incorporated a racial equity perspective into a qualitative study to better understand daily racism, its impact on patients and staff, and to inform optimal antiracist actions most relevant to inpatient psychiatric settings. Aim/QuestionWe sought to identify factors that may contribute to or deter from racism to inform interventions to sustain a psychologically supportive environment for patients and staff. MethodsWe conducted semistructured interviews using a purposive sample of 22 individuals in an acute child psychiatric inpatient service. We analysed transcripts using thematic analysis guided by a constructivist grounded theory conceptual framework. ResultsWe identified two countervailing processes: (1) Entrenching-factors that sustain or increase racism: Predisposing, Precipitating, and Perpetuating and (2) Uprooting-factors that rectify or reduce racism: Preventing, Punctuating, and Prohibiting. We organized each of the elements into a '6P' model along a temporal sequence around sentinel racist events. For each of the six components we describe: Contributing Factors, Emotional Reactions, and Behavioural Responses as reported by participants. Implications for PracticeIdentifying factors that entrench or uproot racism can inform specific steps to improve the care of all children and families on an inpatient child psychiatry unit. The two-domain/six-theme model we developed can serve as a rubric for individuals or milieu-based inpatient settings serving patients of any age to engage in structured self-reflection, auditing, program evaluation, or as scaffolding for difficult but frequently elided conversations.

T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - Diver assessments can reveal much about coral reef condition, but fieldwork is expensive and challenging. To address this limitation to effective reef assessment, we identified predictive relationships between diver measurements of reef condition collected at 650 stations across the South Pacific and a broad portfolio of socio-environmental drivers assembled from public-domain remote sensing data. Our models of coral cover, coral diversity, fish biomass, and fleshy macroalgae cover performed with relatively high accuracy (mean-squared prediction error, MSPE = 0.35-0.48), implying that the state of the art for public-domain remote sensing is already well poised to extrapolate diver measurements to unsurveyed reefs. Whereas sea surface temperature, protected status, market gravity, and geomorphological zones retained high importance across all models, their ability to predict each diver measurement varied, highlighting the complex determinants of the different aspects of reef health. To quantify the performance of our approach for a variety of sampling scenarios, we constructed separate models for lagoonal reefs versus forereef stations, and for 'archipelago,' 'region,' and 'basin' spatial scales. Despite maintaining high accuracy (MSPE < 0.38), the socio-environmental drivers that delivered the best models varied between reef zones and spatial scale. While we demonstrated high accuracy in predicting metrics coral reef health, our findings caution against one-size-fits-all interpretation of the drivers, so we suggest testing remote sensing models across geomorphological zones and scale to understand systematic changes in the variables that drive reef condition. Our study paves the way for an amplified role of remote sensing to inform reef conservation at multiple scales.

TI  - The Bornholm intermediate waters: Origination, pathway, and detection within the cold intermediate layer of the Baltic Sea
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - The Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL) is a distinctive feature of the Baltic Sea thermohaline structure: it is evident annually from March to December between the upper freshened layer and the deep layer with saline waters of oceanic origin. Water parameters are vertically inhomogeneous within the CIL, reflecting a complicated process of its formation that hasn't been exhaustively described yet. On the base of field measurements and remote sensing data, a detailed study of the CIL formation in spring 2006 was performed. It showed that the core of the CIL (the coldest water) has a specific T,S-index that indicates the source of these waters in the southwestern part of the sea. The data of CTD measurements, satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), and meteorological information were used to distinguish and trace the CIL core waters. The abrupt transformation of the SST field was observed in March 2006 when the coldest waters (0.9-2.1 degrees C) of moderate salinity (7.6-8.1) plunged from the upper mixed layer in the vicinity of Bornholm Island into intermediate layers. These waters were later identified as the sublayer of the CIL in the Baltic Proper in April and May 2006. The drivers of the penetration of winter-cold surface waters into the intermediate layers are suggested to be the negative surface buoyancy flux due to warming of cold surface waters with temperature below that of the density maximum and the intensification of easterly winds. Considering the importance of the CIL formation process for the entire Baltic Sea conveyor belt, these CIL core waters were termed the Bornholm Intermediate Waters (BIW). The T,S-index of the BIW shall vary from year to year, reflecting the severity of the past winter and the conditions of the particular spring. However, the BIW location right above the pycno/halocline, the lowest (specific for the current year) water temperature and its characteristic salinity of 7.6-8.1 are repeatedly confirmed by field observations in the Baltic Proper in spring. Joint application of satellite observations, field measurements, and meteorological data provides a coherent view on the process of the BIW waters origination. The results are particularly important it the context of growing hypoxia of deep Baltic waters, providing evidence of the mechanism of seasonal ventilation of intermediate water layers.

TI  - Global hotspots of salt marsh change and carbon emissions
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration(1), coastal protection(2), sea-level-rise (SLR) adaptation(3) and recreation(4). SLR5, storm events(6), drainage(7) and mangrove encroachment(8) are known drivers of salt marsh loss. However, the global magnitude and location of changes in salt marsh extent remains uncertain. Here we conduct a global and systematic change analysis of Landsat satellite imagery from the years 2000-2019 to quantify the loss, gain and recovery of salt marsh ecosystems and then estimate the impact of these changes on blue carbon stocks. We show a net salt marsh loss globally, equivalent to an area double the size of Singapore (719km(2)), with a loss rate of 0.28%year(-1) from 2000 to 2019. Net global losses resulted in 16.3(0.4-33.2, 90% confidence interval)TgCO(2)eyear(-1) emissions from 2000 to 2019 and a 0.045(-0.14-0.115)TgCO(2)eyear(-1) reduction of carbon burial. Russia and the USA accounted for 64% of salt marsh losses, driven by hurricanes and coastal erosion. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of salt marsh systems to climatic changes such as SLR and intensification of storms and cyclones.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Federated Satellite Systems/(3)Cat-5 (FSSCat) mission was the winner of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel Small Satellite (S-3) Challenge and overall winner of the 2017 Copernicus Masters competition. It consisted of two six-unit CubeSats. The Earth observation payloads were 1) the Flexible Microwave Payload 2 (FMPL-2) onboard (3)Cat-5/A, an L-band microwave radiometer and GNSS reflectometer (GNSS-R) implemented using a softwaredefined radio (SDR), and 2) the HyperScout-2 onboard (3)Cat-5/B, a hyperspectral camera, with the first experiment using artificial intelligence to discard cloudy images. FSSCat was launched on 3 September 2020 and injected into a 535-km synchronous orbit. (3)Cat-5/A was operated for three months until the payload was probably damaged by a solar flare and coronal mass ejection. During this time, all scientific requirements were met, including the generation of coarse-resolution and downscaled soil moisture (SM) maps, sea ice extent (SIE) maps, concentration and thickness maps, and even wind speed (WS) and sea surface salinity (SSS) maps, which were not originally foreseen. (3)Cat-5/B was operated a few more months until the number of images acquired met the requirements. This article briefly describes the FSSCat mission and the FMPL-2 payload and summarizes the main scientific results.

TI  - Historical trend of China?s CH4 concentrations and emissions during 2003-2020 based on satellite observations, and their implications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - China's anthropogenic CH4 emissions have been increasing before 2010, while no clear trends have been reported by previous studies regarding China's CH4 emissions post-2010. After analyzing the column-averaged dryair concentration data of CH4 from a Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY) and Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), this study found that the average concentration of CH4 in China increased from 1780 ppb in 2003 to 1873 ppb in 2020. The average growth rate of China's CH4 concentration was 2.8 +/- 1.7 ppb/yr (parts per billion per year) during 2003-2009, and 8.5 +/- 0.7 ppb/yr during 2010-2020, which is similar to the global concentration growth. The enhancement of the CH4 concentration in China relative to background concentrations increased by 0.94 +/- 0.20 ppb/yr (4.4 +/- 0.95%) during 2003-2009 and 0.09 +/- 0.07 ppb/yr (0.49 +/- 0.41%) during 2010-2020. This study implies that China's CH4 emissions increased rapidly during 2003-2009 but increased very slightly during 2010-2020.

TI  - Full-coverage 250 m monthly aerosol optical depth dataset (2000-2019) amended with environmental covariates by an ensemble machine learning model over arid and semi-arid areas, NW China
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Aerosols are complex compounds that greatly affect the global radiation balance and climate system and even human health; in addition, aerosols are currently a large source of uncertainty in the numerical simulation process. The arid and semi-arid areas have fragile ecosystems with abundant dust but lack related high-accuracy aerosol data. To solve these problems, we use the bagging trees ensemble model, based on 1 km aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and multiple environmental covariates, to produce a monthly advanced-performance, full-coverage, and high-resolution (250 m) AOD product (named FEC AOD, fusing environmental covariates AOD) covering the arid and semi-arid areas. Then, based on the FEC AOD products, we analyzed the spatiotemporal AOD pattern and further discussed the interpretation of environmental covariates to AOD. The results show that the bagging trees ensemble model has a good performance, with its verification R2 values always remaining at 0.90 and the R2 being 0.79 for FEC AOD compared with AERONET AOD product. The high-AOD areas are located in the Taklimakan Desert and on the Loess Plateau, and the low-AOD areas are concentrated in southern Qinghai province. The higher the AOD, the stronger the interannual variability. Interestingly, the AOD reflected a dramatic decrease on the Loess Plateau and an evident increase in the south-eastern Taklimakan Desert, while the southern Qinghai province AODs showed almost no significant change between 2000 and 2019. The annual variation characteristics show that the AOD was largest in spring (0.267 & PLUSMN;0.200) and smallest in autumn (0.147 & PLUSMN;0.089); the annual AOD variation pattern showed different features, with two peaks in March and August over Gansu province but only one peak in April in other provinces/autonomous regions. Farmlands and construction lands have high AOD levels compared to other land cover types. Meteorological factors demonstrate the maximum interpretation ability of the AODs on all set temporal scales, followed by the terrain factors, while surface properties have the smallest explanatory abilities; the corresponding average contributions are 77.1 %, 59.1 %, and 50.4 %, respectively. The capability of the environmental covariates to explain the AOD varies seasonally in the following sequence: winter (86.6 %) > autumn (80.8 %) > spring (79.9 %) > summer (72.5 %). In this research, we provide a pathbreaking high spatial resolution (250 m) and long time series (2000-2019) FEC AOD dataset covering arid and semi-arid regions to support atmospheric and related studies in northwest China; the full dataset is available at (Chen et al., 2021b).

TI  - Enhancing the Australian Gridded Climate Dataset rainfall analysis using satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall estimation over large areas is important for a thorough understanding of water availability, influencing societal decision-making, as well as being an input for scientific models. Traditionally, Australia utilizes a gauge-based analysis for rainfall estimation, but its performance can be severely limited over regions with low gauge density such as central parts of the continent. At the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the current operational monthly rainfall component of the Australian Gridded Climate Dataset (AGCD) makes use of statistical interpolation (SI), also known as optimal interpolation (OI) to form an analysis from a background field of station climatology. In this study, satellite observations of rainfall were used as the background field instead of station climatology to produce improved monthly rainfall analyses. The performance of these monthly datasets was evaluated over the Australian domain from 2001 to 2020. Evaluated over the entire national domain, the satellite-based SI datasets had similar to slightly better performance than the station climatology-based SI datasets with some individual months being more realistically represented by the satellite-SI datasets. However, over gauge-sparse regions, there was a clear increase in performance. For a representative sub-domain, the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) value increased by + 8% (+ 12%) during the dry (wet) season. This study is an important step in enhancing operational rainfall analysis over Australia.

TI  - HS-FRAG: An open source hybrid segmentation tool to delineate agricultural fields in fragmented landscapes
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fragmented croplands with small and irregular fields pose formidable challenges to represent agricultural field boundaries. Existing freeware do not consider novel segmentation algorithms, thus restrict their application to relatively homogeneous, large landholdings. We developed an open source QGIS plug-in 'HS-FRAG' to delineate agricultural fields of a fragmented landscape from a multi-spectral imagery using an object-based, hybrid seg-mentation algorithm. 'HS-FRAG' uses Sobel operator to extract the edges from individual spectral bands, fol-lowed by watershed algorithm to close the polygons. Three metrics, namely geometric evaluation (GE), quantitative completeness (QC), and spatial correctness (SC) were considered to evaluate segmentation perfor-mance. Robustness of the tool was demonstrated on a highly fragmented, heterogeneous cropland in south India using Sentinel-2 (10 m spatial) and Cartosat-2 (1.6 m spatial) imagery. Both Sentinel-2 and Cartosat-2 have resulted in over-segmentation (OS) with a generalization of 1.30, 1.37 and an overall accuracy (OA) of 38.06 %, 75.61 % respectively. Segmentation with Cartosat-2 has outperformed in representing the geometry, number, and extent of the reference polygons. A user guide with working examples is provided for quick acquaintance of 'HS-FRAG' tool and its application to other fragmented regions.

AB  - The coastal influence in the Gulf of Mannar is determined by an Organic Suspended Particulate Matter (OSPM) and an Inorganic Suspended Particulate Matter (ISPM). The OSPM and ISPM concentrations were used to extract scattering properties of the water. In this research work, OSPM and ISPM have been obtained from remotely sensed particle scatter. Based on the in-water measurements, sediments are measured from Sentinel-A (S2A) using Linear Least-Square (LLS) Regression analysis and Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) neural network. Depth map is estimated by cluster-based regression (CBR) bathymetry. The experimental result analysis shows that the proposed method has produced substantial correlation between the observed values and the remotely sensed data based on the different statistical performance measures. The performance measures of MNB, RMSE and MAPD for the retrieval of OSPM based on the OLCI are 0.041, 0.026 and 2.442 whereas for ISPM measures are 0.064, 0.048 and 1.865 respectively.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing interest in effective renewable alternative energy sources resulting from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015, photovoltaic (PV) power generation is attracting attention as a practical measure. In this study, we develop procedures for efficiently monitoring PV panels in a large area and increasing their classification accuracy to enable efficient management of PV panels, an important component of renewable energy generation. To accomplish this, first, the persistent scatterer characteristics (e.g., polarization, imaging module, and topography) of PV panels in SAR images were utilized. Then, we developed a technique for classifying panels over a certain size using the polarization and pulse-scattering characteristics of Sentinel-1. Next, by stacking Sentinel-1 ground range Doppler (GRD) images and comparing them with the surroundings of the same area, the morphological features of PV panels were derived and built as learning data for machine learning. Then, a more precise classification of PV panels was performed by applying these learning data in AI algorithms. When SAR-based AI training data for the same PV panels were used in the YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 algorithms, both algorithms showed high accuracy of over 90%, but there were differences in precision and recall. These findings will enable more efficient monitoring of PV panels, the use of which is expected to increase in the future. In addition, they can serve as a proactive response tool to address environmental problems such as PV panel waste and panels washed away during natural disasters.

TI  - Evolution of spatiotemporal ground deformation over 30 years in Xi?an, China, with multi-sensor SAR interferometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1960s, Xi'an, China, has suffered from severe ground subsidence due to groundwater extraction and continuous urban construction. During the urbanization process, ground subsidence has threatened and will continue to threaten the stability of the city's infrastructure. Additionally, parts of Xi'an have recently experi-enced a period of rebound. In this context, we must monitor the spatial and long-term evolution of deformation in Xi'an city. First, archived SAR datasets from 1992 to the present, including ERS1/2, Envisat/ASAR, TerraSAR-X(TSX), ALSO/PALSAR-2(ALOS-2), and Sentinel-1(S1), provided independent historical deformation data in Xi'an city; different SAR interferometry methods can obtain the deformation rates and deformation time-series of the region. Second, to fuse the deformation time-series acquired by different sensors, the Quantile-Quantile Adjustment (QQA) algorithm was used to generate the long-term deformation time-series from October 2003 to May 2021, which has a higher precision than when using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method. Quantitatively, the standard deviation (STD) of the QQA method was only 22 mm at maximum, considerably smaller than the 54 mm obtained with the SVD method. Third, ERS1/2 was linked by the segmental interpolation method to obtain the 30-year deformation time-series of Xi'an, which showed that ground deformation in Xi'an from 1992 to 2021 has experienced a "deceleration-acceleration-deceleration-rebound" process, with maximum cumulative subsidence of over 2 m. Finally, land use type data and hydraulic head change data were also collected to analyze the deformation information. At the same time, the elastic and inelastic water storage coefficients of the aquifer were calculated by combining the long-term deformation time-series and groundwater head data; the deformation mechanism of the aquifer was analyzed accordingly.

TI  - A 1 km daily soil moisture dataset over China using in situ measurement and machine learning
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality gridded soil moisture products are essential for many Earth system science applications, while the recent reanalysis and remote sensing soil moisture data are often available at coarse resolution and remote sensing data are only for the surface soil. Here, we present a 1 km resolution long-term dataset of soil moisture derived through machine learning trained by the in situ measurements of 1789 stations over China, named SMCI1.0 (Soil Moisture of China by in situ data, version 1.0). Random forest is used as a robust machine learning approach to predict soil moisture using ERA5-Land time series, leaf area index, land cover type, topography and soil properties as predictors. SMCI1.0 provides 10-layer soil moisture with 10 cm intervals up to 100 cm deep at daily resolution over the period 2000-2020. Using in situ soil moisture as the benchmark, two independent experiments were conducted to evaluate the estimation accuracy of SMCI1.0: year-to-year (ubRMSE ranges from 0.041 to 0.052 and R ranges from 0.883 to 0.919) and station-to-station experiments (ubRMSE ranges from 0.045 to 0.051 and R ranges from 0.866 to 0.893). SMCI1.0 generally has advantages over other gridded soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4, and SoMo.ml. However, the high errors of soil moisture are often located in the North China Monsoon Region. Overall, the highly accurate estimations of both the year-to-year and station-to-station experiments ensure the applicability of SMCI1.0 to study the spatial-temporal patterns. As SMCI1.0 is based on in situ data, it can be a useful complement to existing model-based and satellite-based soil moisture datasets for various hydrological, meteorological, and ecological analyses and models. The DOI link for the dataset is http://dx.doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.272415 (Shangguan et al., 2022).

TI  - Prediction of drought-driven land use/land cover changes in the Bakhtegan Lake watershed of Iran using Markov chain cellular automata model and remote sensing data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern region of Iran is a dry land zone where the drought is a driving force of land-use changes controlling water resources and aquatic ecosystems, such as lakes and wetlands. This study aimed to predict the 2040 drought condition in the Bakhtegan Lake watershed (Iran) and its correlation with land use changes. Extracting from Landsat and MODIS imagery, we classify land-use classes in 2000-2020 and investigate its relationship with multiple drought indicators through principal components analysis (PCA) analysis. In addition, using the Markov and cellular automata (CA)-Markov chain, the 2040 prediction maps of land-use and drought indices were made. Then, the regression analysis was used to reveal the influence trend of desertification on land-use activities in the future. Finally, the ecosystem services value and changes in agricultural lands between 2000 and 2020 were studied in the study area. The observed results of drought indices and land-use maps in 2000-2020 indicated that the expansion of the drought susceptibility zone causes the increasing areas of salt and bare land in parts of the northwestern and southern region. Based on PCA analysis, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, and Vegetation Condition Index were chosen to be input data in the CA-Markov model for drought-indices prediction in 2040. The value of these indices would decrease in 2040, indicating more drought in the region. The land-use prediction results in 2040 found that it will increase the percentage of bare land to 0.91, salt land to 0.89, and decrease 0.93 and 0.9 percentages of agricultural land and water lakes. Regression results showed that land use changes were related to drought indices with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.93). In addition, the unprincipled use of agricultural lands and their conversion into saline and barren lands has led to a decrease of more than one million and nine hundred thousand dollars annually in the ecosystem services value.

TI  - Development of the spectral forest index in the Khangai region, Mongolia using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mongolian forests have low productivity and growth and are vulnerable to disturbances. Additionally, it is difficult to control and evaluate the forested areas. Therefore, satellite data and surveillance methods are needed to study mountain forests. This study aimed to determine the changes in the main forest cover classes of Khangal soum using remote sensing and geographical information system datasets. A spectral forest index (SFI) using Sentinel-2 imagery was developed for forest cover estimations and applied to the study area during 2015-2020. The SFI was based on the forest index (FI) and the concept of Dark Objects. Each SFI was compared to existing vegetation indices (ratio vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, and forest index) for forest data analysis. The highest correlation was with SFI2. The SFI2 data agreed with the national forest inventory (NFI) 2018 data. The SFI2 of the forest area was set at 1.2, which was confirmed with 90.4% confidence. Overall, SFI2 is suitable for land cover/land use changes and forest classification, monitoring, and management in Mongolia and could be crucial for estimating the boundary of forested areas depending on the forest cover and species in the region.

TI  - Flood modeling through remote sensing datasets such as LPRM soil moisture and GPM-IMERG precipitation: A case study of ungauged basins across Morocco
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - North Africa is characterized by several ungauged basins, especially in Morrocco, where satellite products could be an alternative of the lack ground-based measurements. In this study, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture and the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM-IMERG) were used in flood modeling in Moroccan ungauged basins (Bourrous, Al Wiza, El Hallouf and Jamala). We started with comparing GPM-IMERG Early with ground measurements from five rain gauges. Next, the Soil Conservation Service - Curve Number (SCS-CN) was applied with ground precipitation measurements, LPRM and GPM-IMERG Early datasets to simulated flood events in a gauged basin, the Ghdat. Finally, this SCS-CN model was transposed with these satellite data sets validated to those ungauged basins in order to reproduce flood events. The results show that the GPM-IMERG Early is best with in situ measurements (correlation coefficient = 0.50; relative bias = 27.51%; probability of detection = 0.77; false alarm rate = 0.23), on a daily scale. The observed precipitation, LPRM and GPM-IMERG Early were performed well in validation to simulate floods in the Ghdat, where Nash-Sutcliffe criterion range from 0.43 and 0.98 using the SCS-CN model. For Bourrous, Al Wiza, El Hallouf and Jamala all flood events and hydrographs were reproduced by GPM-IMERG Early and LPRM products. Furthermore, LPRM products were validated against soil moisture measurements with a coefficient of determine R-2 between 0.72 and 0.84. The results of this work provided interesting insights for flood modeling using GPM-IMERG and LPRM satellite products in ungauged basins.

TI  - Using the innovative method of Cellar Weight Base Association to identify potential areas for gold exploration in Mahallat, Iran
T2  - BULLETIN OF GEOPHYSICS AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral potential modelling and identifying promising areas are among the most important stages of preliminary exploration. Cell-Based Associations (CBA) is one of the recent and innovative mining processes in this regard. Designing the new method of Cellular Weight Based Association (CWBA) was initially based on the weight-cell weighting of maps. In this study, implementing CWBA on the 1:100,000 geological maps of Mahallat resulted in identifying and introducing promising points for gold mineralisation. For this purpose, we integrated three information layers of tectonic, geological data and remote sensing related to the pre-exploration of the Akhtarchi gold mine and considering Akhtarchi mine as the control. According to the results of the CWBA method, although all data in the present study are related to 2002-2005 when no mines were discovered as an anomaly, the anomalies overlap with the existing mines.

TI  - Characterization of Timau National Observatory using limited <i>in situ</i> measurements
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new astronomical observatory in south-eastern Indonesia is currently under construction. This Timau National Observatory will host a 3.8-m telescope for optical and near-infrared observations. To support the operation and planning, the characterization of the site needs to be appropriately performed. However, limited resources and access to the site hindered the deployment of instruments for comprehensive site testing. Fortunately, in situ sky brightness data from the Sky Quality Meter (SQM) have been available for almost 2yr. Based on the data acquired in 470 nights, we obtain a background sky brightness of mu(0) = 21.86 +/- 0.38 magarcsec(-2). Additionally, we evaluate the moonlit sky brightness to estimate the atmospheric extinction coefficient (k) and level of scattering on site. We find an elevated value of k = 0.48 +/- 0.04, associated with a high atmospheric aerosol content. It is considered regular for an equatorial area situated at a low altitude (similar to 1300 masl). By analysing the fluctuation of the sky brightness and infrared images from Himawari-8 satellite, we estimate the available observing time (AOT) of at least 5.3h/night and the yearly average percentage of usable nights of . The monthly average AOT from SQM and satellite data analysis correlate with R = 0.82. In terms of the monthly percentage of usable nights, the correlation coefficient is R = 0.78. During the wet season (November-April), the results from SQM and satellite data analysis deviate more significantly, mainly due to the limited capability of Himawari-8 in detecting fragmented low-altitude clouds. According to these results, we expect Timau to complement other observatories greatly.

TI  - Aphid suppression by natural enemies in hedgerows surrounding greenhouses in southern Spain
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern Spain is home to the most intensively grown protected crop area in the EU. The area is currently characterized by greenhouse monocultures and a homogenous landscape. The establishment of hedgerows among greenhouses can enhance the diversity of natural enemies of pests around the greenhouses and help them thrive. However, the effect of hedgerows on pest control has not been addressed. Thus, we used aphid banker plants, i.e. wheat infested with Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), as sentinel plants in the surroundings of three paired greenhouses with and without hedgerows. We assessed the effect of hedgerows on the abundance of aphids and arthropod community populations. In addition, we assessed the importance of the surrounding environment on aphid survival. There were 4.1-fold more aphids on sentinel plants excluded from the action of natural enemies than ones exposed to them, showing that biological control occurs naturally even in a simplified greenhouse agrosystem. Aphid populations were slightly higher (albeit not significantly) in replicates without hedgerows than in those with hedgerows. The percentage of greenhouses, rather than hedgerows, was an essential factor in suppressing aphids, highlighting the importance of using commercial biological control in greenhouses. The presence of hedgerows resulted in changes in arthropod composition populations, i.e. in a lower occurrence of pests and a higher occurrence of natural enemies, especially in the most simplified replicate. We propose increasing the amount of hedgerows for reducing pressure from pests on simplified greenhouse agrosystems.

TI  - Domain-specific knowledge-driven pan-sharpening algorithm
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening can provide multispectral images with high spatial resolutions, which are useful for many remote sensing image applications. Currently, deep learning technology has been widely used in pan-sharpening. Most of these deep learning-based methods ignore domain-specific knowledge that can improve spatial and spectral performance. Some improved methods adopt an injection structure which injects initial details obtained from panchromatic images into multispectral images through detail mapping. However, the initial details lack frequency-domain information. Moreover, the detail mapping is completed by convolutional neural networks, which lack sufficient nonlinearity to generate rich and diverse details. To solve the above problems, a domain-specific knowledge-driven pan-sharpening frame-work based on a detail injection structure is proposed, which includes two stages of knowledge-driven initial detail acquisition and data-driven detail mapping. In the first stage, in order to perform better fea-ture reconstruction in the frequency domain, the PAN-MS method is introduced to provide initial details containing frequency-domain information. In the second stage, a newly designed detail-mapping gener-ative adversarial network (GAN) maps initial details to more various output details. Experiments con-ducted on three public datasets has proven that the proposed algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of spatial and spectral performance.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Nationwide native forest structure maps for Argentina based on forest inventory data, SAR Sentinel-1 and vegetation metrics from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed maps of forest structure attributes are crucial for sustainable forest management, conservation, and forest ecosystem science at the landscape level. Mapping the structure of broad heterogeneous forests is chal-lenging, but the integration of extensive field inventory plots with wall-to-wall metrics derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing offers a potential solution. Our goal was to map forest structure attributes (diameter at breast height, basal area, mean height, dominant height, wood volume and canopy cover) at 30-m resolution across the diverse 463,000 km2 of native forests of Argentina based on SAR Sentinel-1, vegetation metrics from Sentinel-2 and geographic coordinates. We modelled the forest structure attributes based on the latest national forest inventory, generated uncertainty maps, quantified the contribution of the predictors, and compared our height predictions with those from GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investiga-tion) and GFCH (Global Forest Canopy Height). We analyzed 3788 forest inventory plots (1000 m2 each) from Argentina's Second Native Forest Inventory (2015-2020) to develop predictive random forest regression models. From Sentinel-1, we included both VV (vertical transmitted and received) and VH (vertical transmitted and horizontal received) polarizations and calculated 1st and 2nd order textures within 3 x 3 pixels to match the size of the inventory plots. For Sentinel-2, we derived EVI (enhanced vegetation index), calculated DHIs (dynamic habitat indices (annual cumulative, minimum and variation) and the EVI median, then generated 1st and 2nd order textures within 3 x 3 pixels of these variables. Our models including metrics from Sentinel-1 and 2, plus latitude and longitude predicted forest structure attributes well with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 23.8% to 70.3%. Mean and dominant height models had notably good performance presenting relatively low RMSE (24.5% and 23.8%, respectively). Metrics from VH polarization and longitude were overall the most important predictors, but optimal predictors differed among the different forest structure attributes. Height predictions (r = 0.89 and 0.85) outperformed those from GEDI (r = 0.81) and the GFCH (r = 0.66), suggesting that SAR Sentinel-1, DHIs from Sentinel-2 plus geographic coordinates provide great opportunities to map multiple forest structure attributes for large areas. Based on our models, we generated spatially-explicit maps of multiple forest structure attributes as well as uncertainty maps at 30-m spatial resolution for all Argentina's native forest areas in support of forest management and conservation planning across the country.

TI  - Estimating forest aboveground biomass using temporal features extracted from multiple satellite data products and ensemble machine learning algorithm
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have attempted to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) from satellite data accurately. Temporal information may be beneficial to AGB estimation but remains underexplored. Thus, this paper aims to investigate whether and how temporal features extracted from multiple satellite-derived data products can improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we develop four methods to exploit the temporal features of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data products: the method that uses all annual features (AAF), the method that selects essential features based on the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) criterion, the method that employs the seasonal average and principal component analysis (PCA) components (SAP), and the method that includes phenological characteristic parameters (PCP) as the predictors of forest AGB. Lidar-derived forest AGB in California serves as the reference AGB data, and the XGBoost ensemble algorithm is utilized to model forest AGB with temporal features of MODIS data products. The results demonstrate that the AAF-based features lead to the most accurate AGB prediction, whereas using information extracted by SAP and PCP gives rise to less accurate results. Annual MODIS surface reflectance data combined with forest canopy height can provide the AGB estimates, with an average R-squared (R-2) of 0.58 and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 147.58 Mg/ha. The results of this study highlight the necessity of utilizing annual time-series data, particularly the annual surface reflectance data, for AGB prediction.

TI  - Segment-based bag of visual words model for urban land cover mapping using polarimetric SAR data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Producing high-resolution urban land cover maps is essential for decision-making and urban management. In this regard, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), especially Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR), has served as a valuable data source to fulfill this task. Direct conversion of low-level features into high-level Land Cover (LC) concept may reduce the final classification accuracy. Therefore, mid-level repre-sentation models, such as Bag of Visual Words (BOVW), were employed to resolve the existing semantic gap challenge. In this paper, a Segment-based BOVW (Seg-BOVW) model was developed for urban land cover classification using PolSAR data. To this end, two PolSAR data over San Francisco Bay (SFB) and Flevoland (FL) acquired by RADARSAT-2 were employed to comprehensively eval-uate the Seg-BOVW model's performance. First, to exploit the full potential of PolSAR data, 169 low-level features in four categories: (1) original, (2) polarimetric, (3) texture, and (4) decomposition features were extracted. Afterward, a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) was implemented to investigate the importance of low-level features for urban land cover mapping. This step resulted in select-ing 14 and 6 low-level features, as the high contributing features, for SFB and FL datasets, respectively. The Seg-BOVW model achieved significant overall accuracies of 96.02% and 98.82% for SFB and FL, respectively, indicating the high potential of the proposed method for urban land cover classification. Furthermore, a comparison with other well-known algorithms of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) was made, suggesting the capability of the Seg-BOVW model to improve the urban land cover classification results. Finally, the Seg-BOVW model was tested with two other PolSAR datasets acquired with different sensors over SFB to examine its applicability with different datasets.(c) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Field-scale soil moisture estimation using sentinel-1 GRD SAR data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a critical land variable that controls the energy and mass balance in land-atmosphere interactions. Spaceborne Syn-thetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors offer an efficient way to map and monitor soil moisture because of their sensitivity towards the dielectric and geometric properties of the target. In addition, SAR acquisitions are weather-independent, providing a significant advan-tage over optical imaging during periods of cloud cover. However, vegetation cover makes these processes more complex and influences the interaction of SAR backscatter resulting from combined soil matrix and vegetation cover. Therefore, using SAR data, it is necessary to compensate for vegetation contribution in total backscatter while estimating soil moisture over the vegetated soil surface. This study presents a technique that utilizes a vegetation index derived from SAR data to generate high-resolution soil moisture maps. It is note-worthy that this proposed soil moisture retrieval method uses only the dual-polarimetric Ground Range Detected (GRD) SAR product, i.e., only backscatter intensities. Hence, the proposed method has a high potential for operational soil moisture monitoring globally. We validated over 34 soil moisture stations of the Texas Soil Observation Network (TxSON) using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for estimated volumetric soil moisture are within the range of 0.048 m3 m-3 to 0.055 m3 m-3 with the Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0:79.

TI  - Monitoring the dynamics of Bara Shigri glacier using Synthetic Aperture Radar data of Sentinel-1 satellite and effect of climate on mass balances
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A decision rule based classification algorithm is developed to classify the transient glacial zones of Bara Shigri glacier during the end of the ablation periods. The method helps to identify the highest snowlines and mean altitudes which further used to estimate mass bal-ances of the glacier. The mass balance values of the Bara Shigri glacier are -1.37, -1.7, -0.77 and -1.07 m w.e.a-1 for the years 2017- 2020 respectively. These values are compared with past mass balance values available for last four decades. A steady rise of mass loss is prominent and the current derived values are falling in that trend. The data of precipitation and land surface temperature during the study period are also studied to understand the controlling force of mass balance and it shows that a heavy precipitation during end of the ablation season has an indirect relation with mass loss amount. Deriving mass balance of the glacier is not a complete analysis until it can be relate with prevailing weather conditions and climatic variability in long term.(c) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Improving the capability of D-InSAR combined with offset-tracking for monitoring glacier velocity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Offset-tracking is more commonly used in monitoring glacier velocity at Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) than the D-InSAR technique because of its robustness in handling low coherence and unnecessary of phase unwrapping. Large deformation rates of polar glaciers can cause a deformation gradient which exceeds the theoretical limi-tation of phase unwrapping. There is acceptable coherence for Sentinel-1 interferograms with very short tem-poral baselines, however, traditional D-InSAR still fails at the phase unwrapping step. Here, we propose a method to reduce the phase gradient of the D-InSAR interferogram via subtracting the estimated deformation phase to obtain a residual phase. Such rough deformation can be acquired by performing offset-tracking to the current pair of SAR images or can be calculated by any other glacier velocity products, which are usually obtained by the offset-tracking technique. Phase unwrapping is then performed on the residual phase and then the rough deformation phase is added to yield the final deformation fields. Four study sites located in northern Greenland are selected to test our proposed method, which improved the mean coherence of the residual phase by 0.037, 0.032, 0.037, and 0.039 in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as compared to traditional D-InSAR interfer-ometry. The modulus of the phase gradient is also reduced, by 0.054, 0.044, 0.056, and 0.064 rad in each season. The coherence improvement is more sensitive to the temporal baseline in summer than other seasons, and our method is less effective. Seven unwrapped phase profiles of the glaciers find that our method performs better in spatial and temporal phase continuity than traditional D-InSAR. The maximum deformation detected during 6 -day baseline increases from-1.4 m by D-InSAR to-3.6 m by the proposed method. Our approach extends the area that can be unwrapped correctly, especially for the downstream zone of glaciers, where there are higher flow rates, in turn, this increases the robustness of the phase unwrapping and the possibility of applying the InSAR method for monitoring fast-moving glaciers in the GrIS.

TI  - Cotton aphid infestation monitoring using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery coupled with derivative of ratio spectroscopy and random forest algorithm
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aphids are one of the main pests of cotton and have been an important disaster limiting cotton yield. It is important to use satellite multispectral data to monitor the severity of cotton aphids in a timely and accurate manner on regional scale. Based on the combination of derivative of ratio spectra (DRS) and random forest (RF) algorithm, this study researched the quantitative monitoring model of cotton aphid severity based on Sentinel-2 data. First, the cotton area was extracted by using a supervised classification algorithm and the vegetation index threshold method. Then, the DRS algorithm was used to analyze the spectral characteristics of cotton aphids from three scales, and the Pearson correlation analysis algorithm was used to extract the bands significantly related to aphid infestation. Finally, the RF model was trained by ground sampling points and its accuracy was evaluated. The optimal model results were selected by the cross-validation method, and the accuracy was compared with the four classical classification algorithms. The results showed that (1) the canopy spectral reflectance curves at different grades of cotton aphid infestation were significantly different, with a significant positive correlation between cotton aphid grade and spectral reflectance in the visible band range and a negative correlation in the near-infrared band range; (2) The DRS algorithm could effectively remove the interference of the background endmember of satellite multispectral image pixels and enhance the aphid spectral features. The analysis results from three different scales and the evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in processing satellite multispectral data; (3) After the DRS processing, Sentinel-2 multispectral images could effectively classify the severity of cotton aphid infestation by the RF model with an overall classification accuracy of 80% and a kappa coefficient of 0.73. Compared with the results of four classical classification algorithms, the proposed algorithm has the best accuracy, which proves the superiority of RF. Based on satellite multispectral data, the DRS and RF can be combined to monitor the severity of cotton aphids on a regional scale, and the accuracy can meet the actual need.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Currently, all patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pT2b-pT4b melanomas and a positive sentinel node biopsy are now considered for adjuvant systemic therapy without consideration of the burden of disease in the metastatic nodes. Methods This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 1377 pT1-pT4b melanoma patients treated at an academic cancer center. Standard variables regarding patient, primary tumor, and sentinel node characteristics, in addition to sentinel node metastasis maximum tumor deposit size (MTDS) in millimeters and extracapsular spread (ECS) status, were analyzed for predicting disease-specific survival (DSS). Results The incidence of SN+ was 17.3% (238/1377) and ECS was 10.5% (25/238). Increasing AJCC N stage was associated with worse DSS. There was no difference in DSS between the IIIB and IIIC groups. Subgroup analyses showed that the optimal MTDS cut-point was 0.7 mm for the pT1b-pT4a SN+ subgroups, but there was no cut-point for the pT4b SN+ subgroup. Patients with MTDS <0.7 mm and no ECS had similar survival outcomes as the N0 patients with the same T stage. Nodal risk categories were developed using the 0.7 mm MTDS cut-point and ECS status. The incidence of low-risk disease, according to the new nodal risk model, was 22.3% (53/238) in the stage III cohort, with 49% (26/53) in the pT2b-pT3a and pT3b-pT4a subgroups and none in the pT4b subgroup. Similar outcomes were observed for overall and distant metastasis-free survival. Conclusion We propose a more granular classification system, based on tumor burden and ECS status in the sentinel node, that identifies low-risk patients in the AJCC IIIB and IIIC subgroups who may otherwise be observed.

TI  - Development of a generalized model to classify various land covers for ALOS-2 L-Band images using semantic segmentation
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For a long time, Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data was not available free of cost, so the applications were limited. With the recent increase in availability of PolSAR data due to missions like ALOS-2, UAVSAR and Sentinel, the data can be acquired through these sensors periodically. Since the volume of data is large, applying traditional classifiers and conventional machine learning algorithms becomes confounding, as in that case, manual feature extraction must be done by the researcher for training the model. To automate this feature extraction step and accelerate the process, many researchers have used various deep learning algorithms. However, most studies fail to tap into the potential of PolSAR data by not utilizing the complete range of complex data of float-32 bit-depth. The work in this paper suggests the development of a generalized deep learning model for nine elements of coherency matrix [T3] in the float32 data-space from ALOS/PALSAR-2 L-Band sensor. Semantic segmentation is used to classify land-covers into various classes like water, settlement, forest, open land, wetlands etc. This is done through modification on the UNet backbone. The deep learning model is trained using data on San Francisco and New Delhi regions and tested on data from Mumbai region. It is observed that the classification accuracy for Mumbai region is "93:82%". This kind of system can assist the decision makers like urban planners to take informed decisions.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Analyzing urban damage and surface deformation based hazard-risk in Kathmandu city occurred during Nepal earthquake (2015) using SAR interferometry
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study focuses on urban damage and surface deformation in the Kathmandu city region that occurred due to the massive earth-quake in Nepal in 2015. The deformation was estimated from pre-and post-earthquake C-band Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images employing the Interferometric SAR (InSAR) technique. The study highlighted a latitudinal pattern in deforma-tion from the north to south directions, most likely directed by the structural alignments (ridges and valleys) in the Himalayan region. The city-scale study exhibited an increase in the intensity of displacement from the north (<-5cm) to the south (>-20 cm) direction in Kathmandu city. Major parts of the city observed moderate subsidence (-10 cm to -15 cm), while the south-eastern and central parts observed severe subsidence (>15 cm) due to structural damage and collapse of buildings. The incidences of land subsidence and damage to buildings were recorded in the entire Kathmandu Municipal Corporation (KMC) area -a large part (86%; 43.84 km2) of which was built-up land and inhabited population (49% of 1,744,240 people) in 2015 -affecting built structures, transport networks, and world her-itage monuments. The earthquake hazard-risk analysis demonstrated that the built-up land in the south-eastern and north-western parts were the severely affected areas due to high population and high built-up density. The study elucidates the potential application of InSAR technology using freely available concurrent Sentinel-1A SAR data in the estimation of earthquake induced damage study at urban scale and hazard-risk assessment that aid in the formulation of an effective disaster risk reduction policy framework for the region.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Snow cover characterization using C-band polarimetric SAR in parts of the Himalaya
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of the snow cover state in the initiation zone of an avalanche is essential for the snow avalanche hazard mapping in the mountainous region. Seasonal snow cover is very dynamic in the Himalaya and changes its state from dry to moist or wet according to temperature during the progression of winter. In this study, a methodology based on decomposition techniques using polarimetric syn-thetic aperture radar (SAR) data in conjunction with field snow wetness profiles is adapted for characterization of snow cover into dry and moist or wet snow in the Himalayan region. C-band Radarsat-2 full-polarization SAR data is utilized for polarimetric descriptors generation by applying various in-coherent target decomposition techniques, viz., Yamaguchi 4-component, Freeman Durden 3 -component and Wishart Unsupervised (H -a). The generated polarimetric descriptors, viz., surface, volume, double-bounce and helix scattering are utilized in the supervised classification and Entropy (H) and mean scattering angle (a) for understanding the underlying scattering process happening within the snowpack. These decomposition models although describes various physical scattering mecha-nisms but are inadequate to provide quantitative estimates of underlying physical properties (as in our case changes in snowpack wet-ness). A supervised classification based on support vector machine (SVM) is used to characterize snow cover with changing conditions of snow wetness from dry to moist or wet. Three data sets of snow-accumulation and snow-melt period of winter 2015 are processed and analyzed along with field snow wetness (% by volume) profiles. A total 47 Nos. of snow wetness profiles of the snowpack are collected using snow fork instrument in synchronous with satellite passes at well distributed, identifiable field locations and are used in the training (34 Nos.) and testing (13 Nos.) of the SVM model. Snow being heterogeneous material varies metamorphically within snowpack. Based on changing weather conditions and sun exposure duration, it results into different scattering behavior in microwave region of the elec-tromagnetic spectrum. It has been qualitatively observed from target decomposition results that polarimetric descriptors generated using Yamaguchi 4-component scattering decomposition have better captured the increase in the surface scattering (during February and March imagery, due to wet snow conditions of snow cover) from volume scattering (during January imagery, due to dry or moist snow conditions) from seasonal snowpack over the acquisition period from January to March 2015. Further to understand and comprehend the scattering process in the snowpack metamorphism with time, Wishart unsupervised (H -a) classification has been applied on all Radarsat-2 datasets. It was observed in the Himalayan region that during 29 Jan 2015 under dry snow conditions, anisotropic and mul-tiple scattering processes dominates and during period between 22 Feb 2015 and 18 Mar 2015 under moist or wet snow conditions the dipole and Bragg type scattering are dominating. A confusion matrix has been generated for the accuracy assessment of the SVM based classification results, which shows overall accuracy -79.6 % (for 29 Jan 2015), 72.4 % (for 22 Feb 2015) and 74.5 % (for 18 Mar 2015), respectively with the testing samples. The C-band polarimetric SAR data shown its capability for snow cover type characterization and can be applied for operational applications in the avalanche zones of the snow bound terrain.

TI  - Polarimetric analysis of L-band DFSAR data of Chandrayaan-2 mission for ice detection in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) of lunar South polar craters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To confirm the presence of water on the moon, many scientists of the world are making continuous efforts through remote sensing data of different missions. In this direction, the Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DFSAR) sensor of the Chandrayaan-2 mis-sion adds a very important chapter which is the world's first Planetary SAR mission of fully polarimetric capability with L-and S-band. This study utilizes the L-band fully polarimetric DFSAR data of Chandrayaan-2 mission for the PolSAR parameters-based analysis and ice detection in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) of the lunar South Polar craters. The PSR IDs SP_875930_3125710, SP_837670_3387710, and SP_874930_3578760 of the lunar South Pole were selected for the polarimetric analysis using DFSAR L -band. Based on previous studies ((Li et al., 2018), two out of three PSR Ids (SP_875930_3125710 and SP_874930_3578760) were easy to identify for surface ice. That is why only two PSR IDs were used for polarimetric SAR analysis of DFSAR data for surface ice char-acterization and detection. The hybrid polarimetric simulation was also performed to the fully polarimetric L-band data to study stokes vectors and associated child parameters for the selected study area. The analysis of polarimetric distortions confirms the persistence of the polarimetric quality of the SAR data and for this, the polarimetric distortion analysis was performed with co-pol and cross-pol chan-nels. Wave dichotomy-based Huynen decomposition and Barnes decomposition models were implemented to the fully polarimetric quad-pol DFSAR data. The eigenvalue-eigenvector-based decomposition model was also implemented to characterize the scattering behavior of the PSRs. A high correlation was obtained between Circular Polarization Ratio (CPR), entropy, and alpha for the 200 hundred points randomly collected from the image. Diversity index also showed a high positive correlation with CPR. The polarimetric quality of the data was evaluated with the scatterplot between the cross-polarimetric channels and it was observed that the L-band quad-pol data of DFSAR satisfies the criteria for PolSAR data of a monostatic SAR system. Analysis of the results obtained from the polarimetric SAR data indicated that the high volumetric scattering and CPR for the PSR ID SP_875930_3125710 may be due to ice clusters within the permanently shadowed region. Polarimetric analysis of the PSR (SP_874930_3578760) at Howarth Crater using L-band DFSAR data shows a low amount of volumetric scattering and a low CPR for most locations in the PSR. The different ranges of CPR and volume scattering for both craters indicate that polarimetric parameters and indices should be studied in conjunction with geomorphological parameters of the lunar surface, for unambiguous identification of surface ice clusters in the PSR.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity for urban built-up footprint and its characterization using microwave remote sensing
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study focuses on the spatial heterogeneity and footprint analysis of Greater Hyderabad Metropolitan Corporation (GHMC), India using local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based on Sentinel 1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite observations. The study demonstrated the dominance of homogeneous patches (>30% of GHMC; 21.9% growth) in central parts, while high growth of heterogeneous patches (75.3% growth) was observed in peri-urban regions during 2015- 2020 elucidating the implications of zoning regulations inside the municipal corporation. The Getis-Ord index-based hotspot analysis accentuated the hotspots of urban structures and observed its moderately high growth (19.6%) over the 5 years (2015-2020). A latitudinal spatial pattern of the built-up density was observed with the dominance of very high density in the southern parts, while low density in the northern parts. The coupling of LISA and GLCM based built-up footprint analysis represents the increasing influence of built-up areas primarily in GHMC (287.9 km2 to 343.7 km2) compared to peri-urban regions (103.7 km2 to 193.9 km2) and characterized by cor-ner reflection and double bounce scattering of microwave signals. The study highlights the structural components of an urban environ-ment with the type and growth of homogeneous and heterogeneous urban surfaces over the years. The finding of the study underlines the potential of LISA and GLCM for the evaluation of urban heterogeneity and built-up extraction using SAR and thus effectively supports in regulating the landscape management of urban and peri-urban regions.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of crop growth parameters is crucial to understand the crop phenology and its relation with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scattering mechanism. The study explores the potential of dual polarization Sentinel-1 backscatter parameters to investigate its sensitivity with various biophysical parameters of paddy crop. Temporal profile of crop growth parameters such as fresh biomass, dry biomass, vegetation water content (VWC) and plant height of paddy crop are assessed with respect to SAR parameters such as VV, VH, VH/VV and Radar Vegetation Index (RVI). Temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data during June to November 2018 was considered for this study. Regression analysis using linear and logarithmic models reveal that the sensitivity of Sentinel-1A backscatter parameters with crop biophysical parameters is best when the crop is at early vegetation stage i.e. between tillering to booting stages with maximum R2 value of 0.68 for liner regression with VH and 0.69 for multiple regression for crop height followed by other biophysical parameters. At later vegetation stage i.e. ripening stage maximum R2 value of 0.52 for liner regression with VH and multiple regression for crop biomass is observed. There is no significant correlation for peak vegetation stage. The results are indicative for the potential use of dual-polarimetric SAR parameters as input parameters for multiple regression models to improve the prediction of biophysical parameters at different phenolgical stages.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Correction of spatially varying stratified atmospheric delays in multitemporal InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric delay is a major limiting factor in ground displacement retrieval using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Such delays are caused by the variations of pressure, temperature, and humidity of the troposphere, potentially leading to elevation-dependent phases in interferograms. The atmospheric heterogeneity makes the phase-elevation dependence vary in both space and time, posing challenges on empirical models that estimated the elevation-topography relationship in empirically predefined windows interferogram by interferogram. Moreover, the portion of the deformation that is correlated with topography can be mistaken as tropospheric delays and therefore degrade the performance of linear regression between the tropospheric phase and the elevation. The effectiveness of these methods is further limited by the requisite knowledge presumed of the user, particularly with regard to how to divide the scene and which observation model is suitable. These limitations make reliable isolation of tropospheric delay challenging. We present here a novel approach that combines tropospheric delay, deformation and possible topographic error to a joint model, enabling a precise separation of tropospheric delay. The rationale is rooted in the distinct temporal dependencies of these parameters. To avoid empirical setting of segmentation windows, we employ quadtree to adaptively control the spatial variability of tropospheric properties. We validate the proposed method at two volcanic areas, Bali and Hawaii, where tropospheric delay presents notable variability coupled with elevation-correlated deformation signals. Both ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data over the island of Bali show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional ones. The misfit standard deviation (STD) is reduced by similar to 50% at the island of Bali, where elevation-correlated deformation is simulated according to a predefined model. More impressively, at the island of Hawaii, the misfit STD between InSAR and ground truth (i.e., GPS displacements) decreases from 25.1 to 4.5 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in reducing the spatially variable tropospheric delay while preserving the elevation-correlated deformation signal.

AB  - Surface deformation monitoring plays a vital role in understanding landslide kinematics and slope failure analysis. In the past, applications of precise geodetic techniques have been successfully demonstrated for surface deformation analysis in natural hazard monitoring. This study presents, first of its kind in India, site-scale deformation analysis of a half-century old active landslide (Jaggi Bagwan) in Rudraprayag district, Uttarakhand state (India). We present an approach to investigate the spatial variability of surface deformation (i.e. sectors with different kinematics within a landslide) using multi-temporal interferometric Synthetic Aperture radar (MT-InSAR) derived strain map. The maximum negative mean displacement rates obtained by MT-InSAR processing of 30 Ascending and 32 descending Sentinel-1A scenes are 27.56 mm/yr and 1.11 mm/yr, respectively. It indicates the presence of instability at the study site which is further supported by a line of sight (LOS) projected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) displacement rates. Subsequently, a modified least square method is applied to generate strain map using 3D velocity components obtained by multi-geometry LOS decomposition. The interpretation of strain map is further assisted by the instabilities observed at the crown of Jaggi Bagwan using Google Earth imageries from 1996 to 2018 to better correlate the strain pattern. Strain rate map clearly identified the sectors with dominating extension and compression within landslide. The presented approach can be further extended to landslide risk reduction along national highways and valley blockages. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of early warning systems in the detection of infectious diseases outbreaks: a systematic review
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Global pandemics have occurred with increasing frequency over the past decade reflecting the sub-optimum operationalization of surveillance systems handling human health data. Despite the wide array of current surveillance methods, their effectiveness varies with multiple factors. Here, we perform a systematic review of the effectiveness of alternative infectious diseases Early Warning Systems (EWSs) with a focus on the surveillance data collection methods, and taking into consideration feasibility in different settings. Methods We searched PubMed and Scopus databases on 21 October 2022. Articles were included if they covered the implementation of an early warning system and evaluated infectious diseases outbreaks that had potential to become pandemics. Of 1669 studies screened, 68 were included in the final sample. We performed quality assessment using an adapted CASP Checklist. Results Of the 68 articles included, 42 articles found EWSs successfully functioned independently as surveillance systems for pandemic-wide infectious diseases outbreaks, and 16 studies reported EWSs to have contributing surveillance features through complementary roles. Chief complaints from emergency departments' data is an effective EWS but it requires standardized formats across hospitals. Centralized Public Health records-based EWSs facilitate information sharing; however, they rely on clinicians' reporting of cases. Facilitated reporting by remote health settings and rapid alarm transmission are key advantages of Web-based EWSs. Pharmaceutical sales and laboratory results did not prove solo effectiveness. The EWS design combining surveillance data from both health records and staff was very successful. Also, daily surveillance data notification was the most successful and accepted enhancement strategy especially during mass gathering events. Eventually, in Low Middle Income Countries, working to improve and enhance existing systems was more critical than implementing new Syndromic Surveillance approaches. Conclusions Our study was able to evaluate the effectiveness of Early Warning Systems in different contexts and resource settings based on the EWSs' method of data collection. There is consistent evidence that EWSs compiling pre-diagnosis data are more proactive to detect outbreaks. However, the fact that Syndromic Surveillance Systems (SSS) are more proactive than diagnostic disease surveillance should not be taken as an effective clue for outbreaks detection.

TI  - Contribution of L band SAR data for identification of buried/paleochannels in Jaisalmer region of Rajasthan, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging of the subsurface in the arid area is one of the well-known application of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology due to the deeply penetration of the longer wavelengths in the sand. In this study, we have investigated the buried/paleochannels signatures in the Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, India using the penetration capabilities of the Microwave data particularly at L band. High resolution Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) data has been used for the subsurface understanding in the desert area of the Jaisalmer, India. Here, around 20 km northeast direction from the main city, we traced the channels concealed in the Aeolian sediments around Jaisalmer. The paleochannel system drains in the southwest while the main channel approach northward. After the identification of the paleochannel though SAR technology, a ground base technique called Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used for the verification of the subsurface penetration results. Authentication has been done by using the systematic ground investigation to collect scientific evi-dence in the Jaisalmer area. Moreover, these results offer new insight about the identification of buried channels in the paleoenvironment context in the Thar desert area.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Deformation monitoring of Surakachhar underground coal mines of Korba, India using SAR interferometry
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground mines around the globe experience the deformation/subsidence due to the wornd practiced of the mining activity or by the geological failure. In this study deformation monitoring of Korba underground coal mines in Chhattisgarh, India was performed using the Synthetic aperture radar remote sensing. In this study, the Surakachhar 5/6 underground coal mining region of Korba area and its surrounding are considered for deformation/displacement monitoring. The displacement estimation was generated using Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (ADInSAR) technique: Persistent Scatterer SAR interferometry (PSIn-SAR) and Ground-based investigation for validation and impact assessment have also been performed. PSInSAR results, obtained by processing of 17 Sentinel-1A images (Feb-2015 to Feb-2017) showed that multiple areas above the underground mining have been deformed around 3 mm/year to -21 mm/year along the radar line of prospect. Deformed regions are mainly on the surface of active mining areas and settlements. Deformation mapping using PSInSAR with ground-based investigation provides an account learning of Surakachhar underground mining activities, consequences such as sag, pit and cracks in the area. This technique helps to predict the hazard-prone deformation/subsidence zone and to prevent serious damage due to roof failure in the near future. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessment of agricultural drought using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral data - A case study on part of Odisha State, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is primarily considered as a natural hazard which is a resultant phenomenon of less rainfall. When an agricultural area constantly received low rainfall during the sowing and growing season of crop, the soil moisture of the cropland goes down and the crop began to wilt, the situation is known as agricultural drought. Present study, used the multi-temporal Sentinel 1 SAR and Landsat optical data to assess the agricultural drought in the part of Odisha state. Initially, to establish the methodology, correlation between NDVI and SAR backscattering has been carried out for the demarcated agricultural landscape of MODIS images derived landcover map of 2019. The drought assessment has been carried out for the month of Jun-July of 2020 and 2021 which is the kharif crop growing season. Thereafter, the backscattering vale range has been identified as a threshold value to delineate the agricultural drought affected areas from other SAR images of various vintages. The study area was more affected by the drought in 2020 compared to 2021. In this study, it is observed that although the area is drought affected, received less rainfall, but due to location in coastal region this area is mostly under cloud cover, therefore, it is very difficult assess the agricultural drought using optical remote sensing data. SAR data is also sensitive to soil moisture condition; therefore, it can be potentially to be used for drought assessment for the coastal agricultural area. (c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Kotrupi landslide deformation study in non-urban area using DInSAR and MTInSAR techniques on Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The DInSAR (Differential Interferometric SAR) and MTInSAR (Multi-Temporal Interferometric SAR) techniques are used to examine a surface displacement in the Kotrupi Region in this paper. DInSAR and MTInSAR are capable of determining the surface deformation of a rapidly moving landslide. The Vertical Line of Sight (LOS) displacements were estimated with millimeter accuracy using a DInSAR technique followed by phase unwrapping. MTInSAR approaches using APS (Atmospheric Phase Screen) and sparse point processing, on the other hand, measure earth surface displacements and track their trends over time. DInSAR is limited by several difficulties, including phase decorrelation errors, phase unwrapping errors, and atmospheric phase disturbances, all of which reduce the quality of deformation effects. MTInSAR approaches, on the other hand, use data from several different periods within the same temporal baseline. As a result, the effect atmospheric phase disturbances and unwrapping error is greatly decreased when compared to classic DInSAR approaches. After the Kotrupi landslide of August 13, 2017, conventional DInSAR with a single pair of SLC (Single Look Complex) Sentinel-1 SAR images showed a maximum displacement value of about -60 mm to 60 mm in the Kotrupi landslide runoff region. While the advanced MTInSAR results indicate a maximum rate of velocity of about -45 mm/year for the continuous deformation happening in the Kotrupi landslide area. The coherence values along Pathankot National Highway (NH) -154 before and after the landslide were 0.857 and 0.019, respectively. Deformation studies before and after the landslide occurrence are also conducted using a DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Based on the DEM obtained, erosional and depositional deformations of -3.5 m and +3.0 m have been recorded in the Kotrupi landslide runoff area, resulting in 6-7 m change and material loss. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for MTInSAR DEM 0.787 m and DInSAR DEM 1.026 m was estimated after the DEMs produced from DInSAR and MTInSAR processing were compared with TanDEM-X. MTInSAR produces much better results than DInSAR in non-urban areas. (c) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-label sub-pixel classification of red and black soil over sparse vegetative areas using AVIRIS-NG airborne hyperspectral image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The limited spatial resolution of the hyperspectral (Hx) images corrupts the spectral information of pure materials and their distribution in an image. The accuracy of characterising or classifying the soil using Hx or Mx images decreases when surfaces are covered by vegetation. In the presence of vegetation, a single pixel can be labelled as either vegetation or a specific soil type. In this context, we have studied the usefulness of the multi-label classification (MLC) approach to classify the soil colour in the presence of vegetation cover. We have evaluated its performance on airborne Hx (Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer -Next Generation, AVIRIS-NG) images acquired over Berambadi catchment, Karnataka, India. The potential of MLC to classify soil types using simulated Sentinel-2 images (Sen-S) was also explored in this study. The surface soil colour in the Berambadi catchment was classified into two soil types ("black"and "red"soils). The proposed MLC approach consists of (1) simulating the mixed spectra of vegetation, red soil, black soil and non-photosynthesis-vegetation (NPV) using linear-mixture-model (LMM) and bi-linear-mixture-model (BLM) to generate a well-balanced calibration data set, and (2) labelling of each pixel into multiple classes using MLC approaches. Performances of classical and deep-neural-network (DNN) based MLC models were compared to identify the best performing model. Our results showed significant performance for the cost-sensitive-multi-label-embedding (CLEMS) model when applied to both AVIRIS-NG (OA=97%) and Sen-S (OA=93%) images. The proposed method requires a limited number of ground-truth samples, and it is operationally practical for large Hx and Mx images.

TI  - Assessment of LULC change dynamics and its relationship with LST and spectral indices in a rural area of Bengaluru district, Karnataka India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, rural areas in the surroundings of metropolitan cities have undergone substan-tial development in India. This has resulted in changes in land use and land cover (LULC) patterns having a significant impact on hydrological processes and climate change. Therefore, compre-hending such modifications is critical for the decision-making process, and the development of a sustainable environment. The current study focused on comprehending the spatio-temporal dy-namics of LULC changes and their repercussions on variations in Land Surface Temperature (LST) profiles over a two-decade period in the Dodballapur Taluk, Bengaluru Rural District of Kar-nataka State in India. The study also investigates the relationship between LULC changes, Land Surface Temperature (LST), and spectral indicators such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Landsat 7 ETM + satellite images acquired in the years, 2001, 2010, and 2019 were used in the study. The Supervised Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) technique was adopted to classify images and assess spatio-temporal LULC changes and analyse transformations of several LULC classes viz. barren land (BL), built-up land (BUL), crop land (CL), pasture (P), un-cultivated land (UCL), shrub land (SL), and water bodies (WB). The accuracy assessment ensured the veracity of the image classification. The results showed that a) built-up, crop, and shrub land have been increased by 75.54%, 38.18%, and 52.57% respectively, b) barren, pasture, and uncul-tivated land have been increased by 22.94%, 4.89%, and 50.62% respectively; and c) the area covered with surface water bodies has been significantly reduced by 635.58%. The analysis of LST changes revealed a 2.09 degrees C increase in mean LST with a variance of 2.75 degrees C, showing consid-erable fluctuations in cold and hot weather conditions. The regression study of scatterplots for LST-NDVI revealed triangular space (R2 = -0.234), LST-NDBI revealed right-angled triangle space (R2 = 0.567), and LST-NDWI also exhibited right-angled triangular space (R2 = -0.533). Intriguingly, the relationship between NDVI and NDBI exhibited a crescent shaped scatterplot with R2 value of -0.448. The findings of the study can assist policymakers and decision-makers in developing and implementing policies for sustainable rural development and water resource management.

TI  - Landslide deformation and temporal prediction of slope failure in Himalayan terrain using PSInSAR and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides in hilly terrains are frequent phenomenon due to various triggering factors such as heavy rainfall, flash flood, slope insta-bility, tectonic disturbances etc., and result in loss of human lives and damage of infrastructure and property. The continuous monitoring of slope instability and temporal prediction of slope failure is of paramount importance for assessing landslide-triggering factors and mitigating landslide hazards. This research presented a comprehensive methodology for time-series displacement measurement of a landslide-affected area prior to its actual failure and temporal prediction of slope failure in a hilly terrain using persistent scatterer SAR interferometry (PSInSAR) technique and Sentinel-1 data in an open source computational environment. On 30 July 2021, a massive landslide witnessed in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh, India near Barwas and brought down around 180 m stretch of national highway (NH) 707 connecting Paonta Sahib with Shillai-Hatkoti. We used 52 single look complex (SLC) images in ascending and 41 SLC images in descending orbit with VV polarization, acquired for a period of almost two years (2019-2021) for time-series displacement measurement along radar line of sight (LOS), horizontal and vertical directions. The pre-failure displacement-time series derived from ascending and descending data stacks was critically analyzed to identify the reliable and accelerating persistent scatterer (PS) locations for predicting temporal failure of slope material and to understand kinematics of the study area. We used inverse velocity (INV) and modified inverse velocity (T-INV) methods at three different accelerating and reliable PS locations for temporal prediction of slope fail-ure. The results show that the mean LOS velocity ranges from-25.49 to + 31.35 mm/y in ascending data and from-20.97 to + 24. 16 mm/y in descending data, and horizontal and vertical components of motion vector vary from-30.23 to + 18.99 mm/y and - 23.16 to 25.79 mm/y respectively in the study area. Displacement time-series at selected measurement points (PSs) depict the initiation of slope instability from 31 July 2020 and 3 July 2020 using ascending and descending stacks respectively, which are almost one year before the actual failure. INV method predicted temporal windows of slope failure between 27 July 2021 to 1 August 2021 for ascending stack and 24 July 2021 to 29 July 2021 using descending stack, while those of T-INV method lye between 28 July 2021 to 1 August 2021 for ascending data and between 22 July 2021 to 30 July 2021 for descending data. The deformation-time series and predicted days of slope failure are in good agreement at different reliable PS locations. Results in this study show that the approach used for time failure may evolve as an effective tool for landslide early warning systems. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dielectric characterization and polarimetric analysis of lunar north polar crater Hermite-A using Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR , Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mini-RF, and Chandrayaan-2 DFSAR data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of the lunar surface from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have played a prominent role in the exploration of the lunar surface in recent times. This study uses data from SAR sensors from three Moon missions: Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR, Lunar Recon-naissance Orbiter (LRO) Mini-RF and Chandrayaan-2 Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DFSAR). DFSAR sensor is the first of its kind to operate at L-band and S-band in fully and hybrid polarimetric modes. Due to the availability of only L-band data out of the two bands (L-and S-band) for the study site, this study only used DFSAR's L-band data. The dielectric characterization and polarimetric analysis of the lunar north polar crater Hermite-A was performed in this study using Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR, LRO Mini-RF and Chandrayaan-2 DFSAR data. Hermite-A lies in the Permanently Shadowed Region (PSR) of the lunar north pole and whose PSR ID is NP_879520_3076780. Because of its location within the PSR of the lunar north pole, the Hermite-A makes an ideal candidate for a probable location of water-ice deposits. This work utilizes S-band hybrid polarimetric data of Mini-SAR and Mini-RF and L -band fully polarimetric data of DFSAR for the lunar north polar crater Hermite-A. This study characterizes the scattering mechanisms from three decomposition techniques of Hybrid Polarimetry namely m-delta, m-chi, and m-alpha decompositions, and for fully polari-metric data Barnes decomposition technique was applied which is based on wave dichotomy. Eigenvector and Eigenvalue-based decom-position model (H-A-Alpha decomposition) was also applied to characterize the scattering behavior of the crater. This study utilizes the hybrid-pol and fully polarimetric data-based Integral Equation Model (IEM) to retrieve the values of dielectric constant for Hermite-A crater. The dielectric constant values for the Hermite-A crater from Chandrayaan-1 Mini-SAR and LRO Mini-RF are similar, which goes further in establishing the presence of water-ice in the region. The values of the dielectric constant for Chandrayaan-2 in some regions of the crater especially on the left side of the crater is also around 3 but overall the range is relatively higher than the com-pact/hybrid polarimetric data. The dielectric characterization and polarimetric analysis of the Hermite-A indicatively illustrate that the crater may have surface ice clusters in its walls and on some areas of the crater floor, which can be explored in the future from the synergistic use of remote sensing data and in-situ experiments to confirm the presence of the surface ice clusters.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - "Forest fire emissions: A contribution to global climate change"
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest fires are emitting substantial amounts of greenhouse gases and particulate matter into the atmosphere than assumed in state climate targets. It can play an important role in combustible environments, such as shrublands, grasslands, and forests, and contribute to climate change. Thus, forest fire, and climate change is intertwined concepts. As vegetation burns, release the carbon stored within them. This is the main reason why large-scale forest fires release atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and hence, are responsible for increasing the rate of climate change to a great extent. It is extremely significant to measure the contribution of global forest fire and emissions trends of greenhouse gases. In this context, continental-scale carbon emissions assessments were primarily attempted using ground-based datasets for forest ecosystem fires. Considerable research has been published employing remote sensing data from coast to coast. While ground-based data are valuable, they have some restrictions that can be overcome by remote sensing. Ground-based fire data are primarily limited to the total burned area, with their completeness changing yearly with the location. Remote sensing can provide additional spatio-temporal fire information to improve fire emission estimates. In this paper, the factors driving forest fire, with a brief discussion on the triangular relationship between fire, land degradation, and climate change, the role of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), machine learning (ML), and a critical overview of state-of-the-art global climate change are presented.

TI  - Mapping Samudra Tapu glacier: A holistic approach utilizing radar and optical remote sensing data for glacier radar facies mapping and velocity estimation
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glaciers have shown more sensitivity and visible changes to the climate change and global warming in the last 150 years. The highly rugged topography and inaccessible remote areas makes satellite images as the most appropriate source of information retrie-val. We performed remote sensing based glacier change study for Samudra Tapu glacier, located in the Chandra basin of North-West Himalaya. In the present study, the capabilities of both optical and microwave remote sensing data was analysed in glacier change study in terms of its coverage, shift in equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and surface velocity over a period from 2000 to 2021. Multi Sensor (RISAT-1, Sentinel-1) time series of C-band SAR data along with a object oriented classification technique were used to identify different glacier facies such as percolation facies, icefalls, bare ice facies, refreeze snow and supraglacial debris. These classified maps were also used to detect the snow line and firn line along with ELA, aided with elevation information from digital elevation model (DEM). It was identified that more than 50 % of the total glacier area still lies into accumulation region. Further, we estimated the glacier surface velocity using Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique using European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1/2) tandem data of 1996. High value of coherence was observed from the SAR return signal for one-day temporal difference. A mean velocity of 17-24 cm/day was found for the months of March and May 1996, highest flow rates were seen in the high accumu-lation area located in the Eastern and Southern Aspect of glacier. Spatial analysis of velocity patterns with respect to slope and aspect show that high rates of flow was found in southern slopes and movement rates generally increase with increase in slope. Feature tracking approach was used to estimate the glacier flow for long term and seasonal basis using optical and SAR datasets (IRS-1C, 1D PAN, Landsat-7, 8 PAN, and TANDEM-x) during 1999-2020 period. The results suggest that glacier flow varies with season, i.e., high velocity during spring-summer season, as compared to late summer or winter and, the rate of ice flow changes over the years. The mean glacier velocity reduced to 49.5 m/year during 2013-2020 time, as compared to 67.67 m/year during 1999-2003 time. These results of reducing glacier velocity and changing snow line altitude indicates enhanced glacier's melt rate and overall negative mass balance for Smudra tapu glacier.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Impact of G4U and 7-component target decomposition on PolSAR image semantic segmentation
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images is an incredibly challenging task. In early days researchers have applied parametric classifiers like maximum likelihood and Wishart classifiers. Later it is found that each class may or may not follow the Gaussian distribution hence researchers have used nonparametric classifiers like ANN, Decision Tree and SVM etc. It is observed from their work that these classifiers give good classification accuracy, but a lot of time is consumed in extracting the features and training the model. To avoid this, in this paper, Semantic Segmentation with the U-net architecture is used. Compared to covariance or coherency matrix, target decomposition techniques provide more information about scattering mechanisms. Hence, the effect of Touzi and Gulab Singh's 4-(G4U), 7-component (7SD) target decomposition techniques is studied on Semantic Segmentation. Comparative results show that G4U and 7SD decomposition gives almost similar classification accuracy. It is also observed that out of many of Touzi parameters, the first and second components of a, U, k and s can effectively classify various features and the classification accuracy is comparable with G4U and 7 SD decomposition. Moreover, the classification accuracy using nine elements of the coherency matrix is less than all the above-mentioned decomposition techniques.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Retrieval performances of different crop growth descriptors from full- and compact-polarimetric SAR decompositions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the different performances between Compact-Polarimetric (CP) and Full-Polarimetric (FP) SAR to retrieve multiple crop growth parameters including Vegetation Water Content (VWC), Leaf Area Index (LAI), height, and dry biomass. The objective is to study at which conditions the CP SAR can obtain comparable retrieval accuracy as FP SAR for specific crop types and growth descriptors. Polarimetric decompositions were used to extract CP and FP explanatory variables to quantify crop growth status. Then, the sensitivities of CP and FP variables to different crop descriptors were analyzed, revealing higher sensitivity to height than LAI, VWC, and dry biomass. In order to reduce the information redundancy of sets of CP and FP SAR variables, Partial Least Square (PLS) approach was used to develop new orthogonal SAR parameters, while Step-Wise Regression (SWR) was used to determine the optimal SAR parameters, followed by retrievals of multiple crop growth descriptors using the developed estimators. Validated by the ground measurements, the retrieval performances are found to be highly dependent on polarimetry dimension (CP or FP), crop types, and targeted crop descriptors. With crop growth and enhanced depolarization effects, the CP SAR can capture the increasing volume power and decreasing surface power but at a lower rate than FP SAR. The m-delta and m-chi decompositions provide similar scattering components which differ from the Random Volume Over Ground (RVOG) decomposition. The third Stokes parameter g3 of the CP SAR data that indicates the strength of the circular polarization component is a common important parameter to infer the multiple crop parameters of interest. In agreement with the sensitivity analysis, better retrieval accuracies were obtained for height and dry biomass than VWC and LAI. For short vegetation such as soybean, full polarimetry is required to obtain the estimates of all four crop growth de -scriptors. On the contrary, for tall crop growth parameters, such as canola (height and dry biomass), corn (height, VWC, dry biomass), and wheat (LAI, VWC, dry biomass), the CP SAR features can provide comparable robust retrieval accuracy as the FP SAR features. This study deepens our insights into the CP SAR of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) to timely monitor crop growth and health status.

TI  - Morphophysiological, proteomic and metabolomic analyses reveal cadmium tolerance mechanism in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil cadmium (Cd) contamination can reduce wheat yield and quality, thus threatening food security and human health. Herein, morphological physiology, Cd accumulation and distribution, proteomic and metabolomic analyses were performed (using wheat cultivars ???Luomai23??? (LM, Cd-sensitive) and ???Zhongyu10??? (ZY, Cd-tolerant) at the seedling stage with sand culture) to reveal Cd tolerance mechanism. Cd inhibited wheat growth, caused oxidative stress, hindered carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and altered the quantity and composition of root exudates. The root Cd concentration was lower in ZY than in LM by about 35% under 15 ??M Cd treatments. ZY reduced Cd uptake through root exudation of amino acids and alkaloids. ZY also reduced Cd accumulation through specific up-regulation (twice) of major facilitator superfamily (MFS) proteins. Furthermore, ZY enhanced Cd cell wall fixation and vacuolar compartmentalization by increasing pectin contents, hemicellulose1 contents, and adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1) transporter expression, thus reducing the Cd organelle fraction of ZY by about 12% and 44% in root and shoot, respectively, compared with LM. Additionally, ZY had enhanced resilience to Cd due to increased antioxidant capacity, plasma membrane stability, nitrogen metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, indicating that the increased Cd tolerance could be because of multi-level coordination. These findings provide a reference for exploring the

TI  - Solar angle matters: Diurnal pattern of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence from OCO-3 and TROPOMI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar induced fluorescence efficiency (SIF) provides a unique chance to capture the dynamics of photosynthesis or gross primary production (GPP). However, the relationship between GPP and SIF observed by sensors (SIFobs) is affected by the solar-target-viewing geometry. Although the effects of viewing geometry on SIFobs and its relationship with GPP have been recognized, solar geometry effects on SIFobs have been ignored and less studied in recent decades. This study used SIFobs from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) and the TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to investigate solar geometry effects on GPP-SIFobs relationships at the diurnal scale. Furthermore, we derived total canopy SIF emission (SIFtotal) that should be insensitive to solar-target-viewing geometry in theory. Our results indicated that SIFtotal can effectively mitigate solar geometry effects on SIFobs (including SIF observed at nadir, SIFnadir) and its relationship with GPP from six flux towers. After mitigating the solar angle effects in OCO-3 SIFnadir, the correlation (R2) with GPP increased from 0.73 to 0.87 for SIFnadir to 0.84-0.95 for SIFtotal. The correlations between TROPOMI SIFobs and GPP at three high-latitude sites were also clearly improved by TROPOMI SIFtotal. In addition, the diurnal pattern of SIFtotal was more consistent with that of GPP compared to SIFnadir or SIFobs. This study aims to reveal solar geometry effects on SIF measurements, which should be considered when studying the SIF-GPP relationship especially at the diurnal scale with large variations in solar geometry.

TI  - Evolution of supraglacial lakes on Sermeq Avannarleq glacier, Greenland using Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: This study investigates the Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) of Sermeq Avannarleq glacier. This glacier is in southwest Greenland, which has active glacial meltwater.Study focus: Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) are an essential part of the hydrological systems of ice sheets, and their development is vital for determining the stability of ice sheets. This paper use 188 scenes of Landsat images during the melting season from 2000 to 2020 with Google Earth Engine to analyze the seasonal changes of the SGLs. New hydrological insights: 1) The area, volume, and depth of the SGLs, increased, indicating the increasing melt in this area from 2000 to 2020. 2) the SGLs development peaked at 190-200 days of the year. The melting area significantly expanded at the initial stage, while the melting depth change was more significant than the area at the later stage. 3) The elevation reached by the SGLs advanced approximately 300 m inland from 1400 m to 1700 m elevation. The convergence of small lakes (<0.25 km2), the reappearance of buried lakes, and the distribution of SGLs zone shift inland occurred during the SGLs development. 4) High recurrence lake area was mostly below 2 km2, and the recurrence rate of water were related to geographical factors. This study can provide technical support and a point of reference for monitoring the surface hydrological sys-tems in Greenland ice sheet.

TI  - A remote sensing-based method for daily evapotranspiration mapping and partitioning in a poorly gauged basin with arid ecosystems in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation and partitioning of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for understanding the hydrological cycle and water use efficiency at different scales. Such knowledge is particularly important for sustainable water resources management in arid ecosystems. A daily scale framework for continuous ET mapping and partitioning was proposed in this study based on a universal solution of the traditional Ts-VI models. Its essence is to transform the Ts-VI feature space from regional to pixel scale on the basis of surface energy balance principle. Consequently, the ET estimation and partitioning was only related to the boundary conditions at pixel scale, regardless of the Ts-VI configuration over the spatial domain. We demonstrated the framework with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products in Qaidam Basin, a poorly gauged basin with arid ecosystems in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The scheme was performed pixel by pixel using as much of the remote sensing observations as possible, aiming at that it could be applied to other poorly gauged regions. The comparative analysis indicates that our ET estimates agreed well with three readily available ET products and those retrieved from water balance analysis. The advantages of our universal Ts-VI model mainly lie in its high spatial resolution and daily continuity, which enables it to capture the spatial details and temporal varia-tions more accurately. The results show that our annual average ET estimation from 2001 to 2020 was around 179.20 mm/year, which was very close to its annual average precipitation. The annual average soil evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T) was 168.77 and 10.43 mm/year, accounting for 94 % and 6 % of the total ET, respectively. ET in Qaidam Basin decreased generally from southeast to northwest and from surrounding mountains to the interior with significant vertical zonality. Consequently, ET of different landscapes followed the order: woodland > shrubland > alpine vegetation > alpine meadow > bare rock > alpine grassland > salt crust > desert grassland > bare soil > gobi > sandy land. As an arid basin, the spatial distribution of ET in Qaidam Basin was mainly controlled by precipitation. However, with the further decrease of temperature in high mountains, ET started to be controlled by energy availability rather than water availability. Accordingly, the variations of our ET estimates with altitude increased first and then decreased, with a peak value of 287.67 mm observed at altitudes of 4600-4800 m.

TI  - Sanitary municipal landfill site selection by integration of GIS and multi-criteria techniques for environmental sustainability in Safita area, Tartous governorate, Syria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban waste disposal is a problem that poses a major challenge to city planners as a result of rapid population growth and urbanization. Finding suitable sites for solid waste is one of the most important solutions developed globally to manage this problem. In this regard, a set of physical, socio-economic and technological criteria must be considered to tackle the problem. Safita area ( Tartous governorate) witnessed a rapid population growth during the decade of the war in Syria due to the onrush of internal refugees, which resulted in several environmental problems, including random waste dumps. After perusing the previous literature and considering expert opinions, a map of the spatial suitability of sustainable waste sites in the Safita area was developed by integrating the multi-criteria decision- making methodology (analytic hierarchy process) with the geographic information system. Thirteen criteria, including elevation, slope, permeability, distance to faults, distance to settlement, land use/land cover, distance to drainage, distance to water supplies, distance to lakes, distance to road, distance from tourist centers, distance from archaeological centers, and distance from religious centers, were used to achieve the goal of this study. The layer maps for these criteria were developed based on various data sources, including conventional and remote sensing data. Potential landfill sites were identified and divided into five categories: unsuitable (83.28%), less suitable (8.49%), moderately suitable (4.49%), highly suitable (2.57%), and very highly suitable (0.72%). The results of this study provide reliable spatial outputs that will help in suggesting new landfill sites that maintain environmental and socioeconomic sustainability in the post-war phase. Moreover, the application of the methodology of this study can be generalized to the rest of the regions in Syria within the framework of the integrated management of the problem of random landfills.

TI  - Remote sensing analysis on primary productivity and forest cover dynamics: A Western Ghats India case study
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest ecosystems are among the most essential habitats on Earth for conserving biological diversity and short-term climate regulation. For this reason, they are key areas of conservation policies in the world. In this paper, we aim to investigate the dynamics of forest cover and their changes in primary productivity by empowering information on historical forest management and fieldwork research with remote sensing vegetation monitoring methods. The study area falls within the central portion of the Indian Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot. In particular, part of the analysis was performed on the Kadamakal Reserve Forest and Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary, which harbours an endemic low elevation dipterocarp evergreen forest. This area was managed by selective logging and became fully protected in 1984. We performed multiple time series macroscale analyses between 1999 and 2020 on the Indian Central Western Ghats region, using satellite products at 1 km spatial resolution from the VITO Copernicus Global Land Service on Dry Matter Productivity, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. We also performed a very-high spatial resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index differential analysis between 2021 and 2016 with Sentinel 2-L2A products to investigate forest dynamics within the reserve. At the 1 km spatial reso-lution has been found an increase in all three vegetation indices, by employing the LOESS statistical method for the smoothed transition autoregressive model of raster data medians of our datasets. The boxplot raster distri-bution analysis also highlighted a significant imbalance in dry matter productivity in the last decade (2010-2020) comparing the previous one (1999-2009). The second part of the analysis, at 10 m spatial reso-lution within the reserve forest, revealed a growth in the vegetation cover on the top of the Pushpagiri Mountain ridge and in a previously landslide area. The study found new erosion channels down to the upper plateau on the South-West side of the reserve due to an increment of the run-off processes during the monsoon period. This satellite analysis highlighted generalised positive vegetation trends in the Central Western Ghats, India, over the last twenty-two years, enhancing an improvement in the ecosystem functioning and carbon storage ecosystem service. Notably, through this work, we also developed a standardised and open-access framework to monitor the vegetation remotely (SVIT) during periods of forest inaccessibility for fieldwork sampling.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability in soil and water salinity in the south-central coast of Bangladesh
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity in soils and water of coastal tracts in Bangladesh, one of the major challenges for agriculture, varies significantly due to multiple stressors, including the consequences of rapid changes in the climate pattern. However, their dynamics has not been studied in detail accentuating its importance for the management of agriculture. Here, we examined such changes along zones - defined by spatial proximity from the seafront towards inland in the south-central coast of Bangladesh. Samples of soil and water were collected at single-month intervals between November 2020 and June 2021. In April, a comprehensive soil sampling was conducted to examine spatial variability in relation to soil type and land use. Moreover, Landsat imagery-based salinity index was calculated. Our results showed that soil and water salinity gradually increased from January onwards and peaked during May. It decreased gradually from the seafront to inland, suggesting direct and indirect intrusion of salinity from the sea. A significant non-linear relationship was found between Landsat imagery-based salinity index and measures values (r2 = 0.79, p < 0.01), indicating the Landsat imagery- based estimate could potentially be used for agriculture. Our observation also showed that salinity to soil and water was significantly low in highlands, croplands, and interior of polders as compared respectively to that of low land, fallow land, and exterior of polders. Our estimation of salinity in soil and water of the south-central coast of Bangladesh was significantly higher than that of historical records. This study, thus, would contribute to contemporary policy issues on cropland management along coastal Bangladesh.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study focuses on Meghalaya, the North Eastern State of India, for forest fire occurrence, dis-tribution, and risk mapping using the different geospatial techniques is validated using different decision-making techniques such as MCDM, Space Time Cube Analysis (STC), and Emerging Hot Spot (EHS) Analysis. The archive data of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near real time (NRT) fire data has been considered for this study. Fire points were ob-tained from Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), a web service provided by NASA. Using two decadal data, a NetCDF file was created which can store four-dimensional data. Based on this NetCFD file, forest fire trend and future prospect has been foreseen. After ana-lyzing these points, a relationship with other fire triggering factors such as Human settlement, Roads, Climate, Elevation, Slope, Aspect, Forest Type, Forest Canopy density, Soil Moisture, Wind Speed, and Forest Health has been established. Forest risk map with four classes (extreme, severe, moderate, and mild) is also generated. These results are very effective for the managers, planners, and other stakeholders for disaster management. The suggested methodology can be implemented for the preparedness of forest fire management. The policy makers must act quickly to protect the Himalayan region with the highest biodiversity by adopting focused interventions and the strategic allocation of scarce resources in effective areas.

TI  - Building patterns and fuel features drive wildfire severity in wildland-urban interfaces in Southern Europe
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire danger analysis is crucial for landscape planning, which is particularly relevant in vulnerable areas such as the wildland-urban interface (WUI). The aim of our work is to investigate the capacity of fuel characteristics to predict burn severity in different WUI typologies classified according to nearby building density criteria. To achieve this goal, we selected 23 wildfires across Southern Europe, in which we differentiated non WUI areas, isolated, scattered, dense and very dense WUIs. Moreover, we spatialized burn severity and different fuel metrics using multispectral and radar satellite imagery. This information was used to analyze burn severity, and to identify its drivers in the different WUI typologies through analysis of variance, correlation analysis and machine learning models. Our results indicate that burn severity is lower in WUIs of clustered buildings than in non-WUI areas, which were also the most homogeneous in terms of vegetation cover. Moreover, we found that vegetation biophysical properties related to the amount of living fuel (fraction of vegetation cover and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) showed the highest influence on burn severity in all WUI typologies. We also found that burn severity is less predictable in dense and very dense WUIs than in the rest, which can be attributed to their greater landscape complexity, presence of artificial structures and efficiency of extinction efforts. Our results serve to guide landscape management strategies, and impulse next-generation fire danger models, which should be based not only on synoptic fire weather indices but also on landscape-scale susceptibility to severe fires.

AB  - Background With the reduction in access to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and changes in testing guidelines in Australia, a reduced number of people are seeking testing for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), limiting the opportunity to monitor disease transmission. Knowledge of community transmission of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses is essential to better predict subsequent surges in cases during the pandemic to alert health services, protect vulnerable populations and enhance public health measures. We describe a methodology for a testing-based sentinel surveillance program to monitor disease in the community for early signal detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.Methods/design A longitudinal active testing-based sentinel surveillance program for respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) will be implemented in some regions of Queensland. Adults will be eligible for enrolment if they are part of specific community groups at increased risk of exposure and have not had a COVID-19 infection in the last 13 weeks. Recruitment via workplaces will occur in-person, via email and through online advertisement. Asymptomatic participants will be tested via PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection by weekly self-collected nasal swabs. In addition, symptomatic participants will be asked to seek SARS-CoV-2 and additional respiratory virus PCR testing at nominated COVID-19 testing sites. SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory virus prevalence data will be analysed weekly and at the end of the study period.Discussion Once implemented, this surveillance program will determine the weekly prevalence of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses in the broader community by testing a representative sample of adults, with an aim to detect early changes in the baseline positivity rate. This information is essential to define the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the community in near-real time to inform public health control measures and prepare health services and other stakeholders for a rise in service demand.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of radiomics in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of radiomics in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) and sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) in breast cancer.Materials and methodsMultiple electronic databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies published before April 29, 2022: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. The overall diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of radiomic features for lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with breast cancer. Spearman's correlation coefficient was determined to assess the threshold effect, and meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to explore the possible causes of heterogeneity.ResultsA total of 30 studies with 5611 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimates suggesting overall diagnostic accuracy of radiomics in detecting LNM were determined: DOR, 23 (95% CI, 16-33); sensitivity, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.88); specificity, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84); and AUC, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.92). The meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity between sensitivity and specificity across the included studies, with no evidence for a threshold effect. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses showed that combined clinical factors, modeling method, region, and imaging modality (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], and X-ray mammography [MMG]) contributed to the heterogeneity in the sensitivity analysis (P < 0.05). Furthermore, modeling methods, MRI, and MMG contributed to the heterogeneity in the specificity analysis (P < 0.05).ConclusionOur results show that radiomics has good diagnostic performance in predicting ALNM and SLNM in breast cancer. Thus, we propose this approach as a clinical method for the preoperative identification of LNM.

TI  - Groundwater potential zone demarcation in the Khadir Island of Kachchh, Western India
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), field investigation, and mapping methods/techniques were incorporated to demarcate the groundwater potential zones in the Khadir Island of the Kachchh region. Preliminary work consists of reconnaissance surveys and the preparation of various thematic maps of the region. The lithology (Khadir formation of Mesozoic period), slope, soil, land use and land cover (LULC), lineament density (Faults, fractures and linear valleys), drainage density, and geomorphology thematic maps were prepared using Advanced Land Observation Satellite -Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) data with 12.5 m spatial resolution, Sentinel-2 data (bands 8, 4, and 3), and ICAR- Na-tional Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning and Geological Survey of India (GSI) published maps. The Groundwater Potential Index (GWPI) was determined by integrating and computing the groundwater thematic maps. The groundwater potential map was further validated using the Cohen's Kappa statistic method. The GWPI determines a high groundwater potential zone in the study area, of which about 12.24% and 19.41% of the area are excellent and very good potential zones for groundwater extraction, respectively. The study shows that the Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.767, which falls under the "Good Strength of Agreement" validates the result and determines that the Western and Eastern parts of the study area have greater groundwater potential zones.

TI  - Historical reconstruction of aquatic vegetation of typical lakes in Northeast China based on an improved CA-Markov model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic vegetation is an important marker of the change in the lake ecosystem. It plays an important supporting role in the lake ecosystem, and its abundance and cover changes affect the ecosystem balance. Collecting accurate long-term distribution data on aquatic vegetation can help monitor the change in the lake ecosystem, thereby providing scientific support for efforts to maintain the balance of the ecosystem. This work aimed to establish an improved CA-Markov model to reconstruct historical potential distribution of aquatic vegetation in the two typical lakes (Xingkai Lake and Hulun Lake) in Northeast China during 1950s to 1960s. We firstly analyzed remote sensing data on the spatial distribution of aquatic vegetation data in two lakes in six periods from the 1970 to 2015. Then, we built a transfer probability matrix for changes in hydrothermal conditions (temperature and precipitation) based on similar periods, and we designed suitability images using the spatial frequency and temporal continuity of the constraints. Finally, we established an improved CA-Markov model based on the transfer probability matrix and suitability images to reconstruct the potential distributions of aquatic vegetation in the two northeastern lakes during the 1950s and 1960s. The results showed the areas of aquatic vegetation in the 1950s and 1960s were 102.37 km(2) and 100.7 km(2) for Xingkai Lake and 90.81 km(2) and 88.15 km(2) for Hulun Lake, respectively. Compared with the traditional CA-Markov model, the overall accuracy of the improved model increased by more than 50%, which proved the improved CA-Markov model can be used to effectively reconstruct the historical potential distribution of aquatic vegetation. This study provides an accurate methodology for simulating the potential historical distributions of aquatic vegetation to enrich the study of the historical evolution of lake ecosystem.

TI  - Associations between greenspace surrounding schools and lipid levels in Chinese children and teenagers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Little evidence exists concerning the associations of greenspace with childhood lipid profiles and dyslipidemias, especially in developing countries and regions. We aimed to investigate the associations of greenspace surrounding schools with lipid levels and dyslipidemia prevalence among Chinese children and teenagers. We obtained baseline information and health data of 10,408 children and teenagers (aged 6-18 years) who studied from 94 schools in China. We measured levels of four blood lipids: triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Dyslipidemias were defined using standard recommendations. Greenness surrounding schools were assessed using two satellite-based greenness indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) at 300-, 500-, and 1000-m circular buffers based on each school's latitude and longitude. We used random forest model combined with meteorological and remote sensing data to estimate air pollution levels surrounding each school. We used generalized linear mixed models to estimate the associations of greenness with lipid levels and dyslipidemias prevalence. We also performed sub-group and mediation analyses. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in NDVI500m was significantly associated with a 0.064 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.083, -0.045) and 0.049 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.065, -0.033) decreased TC and LDL-C levels, respectively, as well as a 0.13-fold (95% CI: 0.01, 0.23) and 0.17-fold (95% CI: 0.01, 0.30) decreased odds of hypercholesterolemia and hyperbetalipoproteinemia, respectively. Associations were stronger in students aged <= 12 years and born to parents having lower education levels compared to their counterparts. Particle with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) mediated 61.5% and 16.7% of the association of greenness with TG and LDL-C levels, respectively. In summary, higher school-based greenness exposure was beneficially associated with lipid levels among Chinese children and adolescents, and part of the association can be explained by lowed PM2.5 levels.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planet satellite data to map field-level tillage practices in smallholder systems
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can be used to map tillage practices at large spatial and temporal scales. However, detecting such management practices in smallholder systems is challenging given that the size of fields is smaller than historical readily-available satellite imagery. In this study we used newer, higher-resolution satellite data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planet to map tillage practices in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains in India. We specifically tested the classification performance of single sensor and multiple sensor random forest models, and the impact of spatial, temporal, or spectral resolution on classification accuracy. We found that when considering a single sensor, the model that used Planet imagery (3 m) had the highest classification accuracy (86.55%) while the model that used Sentinel-1 data (10 m) had the lowest classification accuracy (62.28%). When considering sensor combinations, the model that used data from all three sensors achieved the highest classification accuracy (87.71%), though this model was not statistically different from the Planet only model when considering 95% confidence intervals from bootstrap analyses. We also found that high levels of accuracy could be achieved by only using imagery from the sowing period. Considering the impact of spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution on classification accuracy, we found that improved spatial resolution from Planet contributed the most to improved classification accuracy. Overall, it is possible to use readily-available, high spatial resolution satellite data to map tillage practices of smallholder farms, even in heterogeneous systems with small field sizes.

TI  - Scalable Semiparametric Spatio-temporal Regression for Large Data Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid advances of data acquisition techniques, spatio-temporal data are becoming increasingly abundant in a diverse array of disciplines. Here, we develop spatio-temporal regression methodology for analyzing large amounts of spatially referenced data collected over time, motivated by environmental studies utilizing remotely sensed satellite data. In particular, we specify a semiparametric autoregressive model without the usual Gaussian assumption and devise a computationally scalable procedure that enables the regression analysis of large datasets. We estimate the model parameters by maximum pseudolikelihood and show that the computational complexity can be reduced from cubic to linear of the sample size. Asymptotic properties under suitable regularity conditions are further established that inform the computational procedure to be efficient and scalable. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite-sample properties of the parameter estimation and statistical inference. We illustrate our methodology by a dataset with over 2.96 million observations of annual land surface temperature, and comparison with an existing state-of-the-art approach to spatio-temporal regression highlights the advantages of our method. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

TI  - Estimating water quality through neural networks using Terra ASTER data, water depth, and temperature of Lake Hachiroko, Japan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the need to reduce water pollution and improve environmental water quality has increased. In this study, we estimated the spatial distribution of suspended solids (SS) and the nitrogen-to-phosphorus (NP) ratio as water quality parameters by combining three types of information: satellite remote sensing data, water depth, and water temperature. A water quality estimation method using a neural network was also developed. The proposed method is effective and easy to apply as it does not use many parameters. The results showed that the maximum improvements in the SS and NP ratio estimates compared to the results of the fuzzy regression analysis and the conventional method were 6 mg/L and 2.25, respectively. In the SS estimation, the learning dataset based on texture dissimilarity helped improve the accuracy. The proposed method will contribute to a more detailed understanding of water quality conditions.

TI  - Assessment of the impact of the different settlement patterns on the summer land surface temperature: Elazig
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, cities are at the center of the debate on global warming since land use and land cover change (LULC) in cities are considered to be major contributors to global climate change. In this study, Carsi and Dogukent Neighborhood areas in the city center of Elazig province, Turkey, were examined in terms of land use and land cover (LULC). Both areas were chosen because they have different patterns and features, such as different residential densities, street aspect ratios and orientations, impervious surfaces, vegetation, and elevations. The aim is to assess the effect of the different patterns of these settlements on the land surface temperature (LST) using Landsat 8 satellite images in the summertime, July 19, 2021. The results showed that the maximum, minimum, and average LST of the Dogukent Neighborhood, which is characterized by uniform streets with dense vegetation and streets oriented to the NE-SW or NW-SE, were recorded as 44.4, 38.4, and 41.0 degrees C, respectively, while 45.4, 40.4, and 43.8 degrees C were recorded in the Carsi Neighborhood characterized by excessive residential areas and deep streets with lack of vegetation oriented to the E-W direction. However, the average difference is around 2.8 degrees C, implying that residential areas with mid-building heights and vegetated streets oriented to NE-SW or NW-SE are thermally better than those with high aspect ratio streets and lacking vegetation and oriented to E-W. It was found that small variations in land elevation of these areas do not significantly affect the LST. The results of this study will set an example not only for the city of Elazig, but also for the determination of urban transformation areas, new housing areas, and climate change in most cities of Turkey and other countries, and will provide support for sustainable and more livable urbanization in most cities. Transferring the data obtained by local governments to the physical plan decisions could also contribute to preventing climate change.

TI  - Contributions from climate variation and human activities to flow regime change of Tonle Sap Lake from 2001 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The flow regime of the largest lake in Southeast Asia, Tonle Sap Lake, is driven by the reverse flow phenomenon caused by its link with the Mekong River. This reverse flow makes the lake one of the most productive aquatic ecosystems globally and thus provides important economic opportunities for local communities. The recent human activities in the upstream, as well as climate variations, have resulted in unforeseen alterations in the reverse flow. However, little is known about the explicit attribution of different parts of the upstream basin to these variations, which would be essential for transboundary water management. To unveil these attributions, we developed a novel modeling setup consisting of hydrodynamic, hydrological, and machine learning models. This modeling setup allowed us to separate the impacts of a) climate variation, b) human activities in the Chinese part of the basin, and b) the lower part of the basin (i.e., Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam). During the 2001-2009 baseline, when human modifications to the flow were still minimal, we found that Tonle Sap Lake received, on average, 42.4 km(3)/yr water from the Mekong, 48.2 % of the total inflow to the lake. During the period of increased human activities, 2010-2020, this decreased due to climate variation to 40.1 km(3)/yr (a 5.7 % drop), which was further exacerbated by the increased human activities in the upstream parts of the basin (China similar to 7.3 %, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam similar to 9 %). Additionally, during the flow period when water flows from the lake towards the Mekong, on average, 31 % of the total inflow into the Mekong Delta originated from the lake during the baseline period. Climate variation decreased this by 4 percentage points (pp), i.e., to 27 %, while the human activities in China and lower parts of the basin decreased this by 1.6 pp (25.4 %) and 1.9 pp (25.1 %), respectively. Our findings unveiled the attributions of different drivers on Tonle Sap Lake's hydrology and will facilitate transboundary water management in the basin. The impacts of future plans on different parts of the basin should be carefully evaluated together with existing anthropogenic impacts, as well as climate change, to minimize the further impacts on the lake.

TI  - Short-term characterisation of climatic-environmental variables and microbial community diversity in a high-altitude Andean wetland (Salar de Huasco, Chile)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial community structures are shaped by geochemical factors and their interactions with the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere through the processes of chemical mobilisation and mineralisation. High-altitude wetlands and salt flats in the central Andes are characterised by pronounced physicochemical gradients and extreme climatic conditions, representing hotspots of microbial diversity. We here hypothesise about the existence of direct relationships between the local microbiology and the climate cyclicity variables based on meteorological and biogeochemical patterns that develop over a short time scale (five years). We have here analysed the interactions between hydrometeorological and biogeochemical variables and the microbial communities of the Salar de Huasco. These results were obtained by correlating 16S cDNA and DNA gene Illumina sequences with meteorological/satellite data collected both at monitoring stations and by remote sensing between the years 2015 and 2020. The precipitation levels and flooded areas (i.e., areas covered and/or saturated with permanent water) detected in the Salar de Huasco revealed a marked hydric cyclicity that correlated seasonally with intra-annual wet and dry seasons. Overall, at this site, wet periods occurred from December to April, and dry periods from May to November. Meteorological variables such as solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and wind direction were well-defined, showing a potential association with the hydrogeology of the area, which is directly related to the wetlands' flooded areas. Finally, the microbial presence and potentially active microbial communities were determined through the sequencing of the 16S gene (DNA and cDNA, respectively), this were associated with climatic seasonality and spa-tially distributed physical and chemical heterogeneity. Other non-local inter-annual scale processes, such as El Nino- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, modify the physical and chemical context of the wetland, thus forming unique ecological niches in the Andean Mountains.

TI  - Widespread exposure of marine parks, whales, and whale sharks to shipping
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Shipping impacts are a major environmental concern that can affect the behaviour and health of marine mammals and fishes. The potential impacts of shipping within marine parks is rarely considered during the planning process. Aims. We assessed the areal disturbance footprint of shipping around Australia, its overlap with marine parks, and known locations of megafauna, so as to identify areas of concern that warrant further investigation. Methods. Automatic Identification System (AIS) shipping data from 2018 to 2021 were interpreted through a kernel-density distribution and compared with satellite data from & SIM;200 individuals of megafauna amalgamated from 2003 to 2018, and the locations of marine parks. Key results. Over 18% of marine parks had shipping exposure in excess of 365 vessels per year. Around all of Australia, 39% of satellite-tag reports from whale shark and 36.7% of pygmy blue and humpback whale satellite-tag reports were in moderate shipping-exposure areas (> 90 ships per year). Shipping exposure significantly increased from 2018 despite the pandemic, including within marine parks. Conclusions. These results highlight the wide-scale footprint of commercial shipping on marine ecosystems that may be increasing in intensity over time.

AB  - Achieving the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an intercommunicated mission worldwide. It is primarily known that increasing urban areas and populations can considerably influence numerous SDGs. However, the interaction mechanism between urban expansion (UE), urban population dynamics (UPD), land-use efficiency, and SDGs, until now, has not been fully understood. The present study employed remotely sensed data of population and land covers to analyze spatiotemporal variations in land consumption rate (LCR), population growth rate (PGR) and the ratio of LCR to PGR (LCRPGR) of 31 provinces in China from 1995 to 2015. Moreover, we investigated the relations between land-use efficiency and SDG practice using the Spearman coefficient and explored how economic zones alter the consequence of LCR, PGR, and LCRPGR on SDG implementations. The results show that nine SDGs had synergies with LCRPGR, exceeding the total number of synergy relationships yielded by LCR and PGR, indicating that LCRPGR that considers both LCR and PGR exerts more impacts on SDG implementations compared with the single perspective concerning LCR or PGR. The synergies and trade-offs of LCRPGR were more evident in undeveloped economic zones, while few influences of LCRPGR on SDGs were observed in developing economic zones. It suggests that improving land-use efficiencies to facilitate SDG implementation is essential in undeveloped economic settings. The study provides a better understanding of SDG practice in land-use efficiency for developing countries, i.e., China, and guides the regulations of urban expansion and population growth.

TI  - Megacities' environmental assessment for Iraq region using satellite image and geo-spatial tools
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are quickly established, and the overwhelming population pressure is triggering heat stress in the metropolitan cities. Climate change impact is the key aspect for maintaining the urban areas and building proper urban planning because spreading of the urban area destroyed the vegetated land and increased heat variation. Remote sensing-based on Landsat images are used for investigating the vegetation circumstances, thermal variation, urban expansion, and surface urban heat island or SUHI in the three megacities of Iraq like Baghdad, Erbil, and Basrah. Four satellite imageries are used aimed at land use and land cover (LULC) study from 1990 to 2020, which indicate the land transformation of those three major cities in Iraq. The average annually temperature is increased during 30 years like Baghdad (0.16 degrees C), Basrah (0.44 degrees C), and Erbil (0.32 degrees C). The built-up area is increased 147.1 km(2) (Erbil), 217.86 km(2) (Baghdad), and 294.43 km(2) (Erbil), which indicated the SUHI affects the entire area of the three cities. The bare land is increased in Baghdad city, which indicated the local climatic condition and affected the livelihood. Basrah City is affected by anthropogenic activities and most areas of Basrah were converted into built-up land in the last 30 years. In Erbil, agricultural land (295.81 km(2)) is increased. The SUHI study results indicated the climate change effect in those three cities in Iraq. This study's results are more useful for planning, management, and sustainable development of urban areas.

TI  - Cost evaluation of the Merlin assay for predicting melanoma sentinel lymph node biopsy metastasis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Merlin assay for melanoma-risk assessment has become commercially available to reduce the rate of unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) in SLNB-eligible patients with cutaneous melanoma. Merlin low-risk patients are recommended to undergo wide local excision (WLE) of the primary tumor, whereas Merlin high-risk patients are recommended to undergo both SLNB and WLE. Here, we compared the cost of a Merlin testing strategy to that of a no-testing strategy (usual care) before prescribing SLNB. Methods We identified T1 and T2 patients who underwent WLE and SLNB but not completion lymph node dissection between 2007 and 2018. Controls were T1 patients who only underwent WLE. Costs for WLE and SLNB were calculated by converting institutional cost data to standardized Medicare reimbursement rates. We then developed a decision tree to compare the cost of Merlin testing to that of a no-testing strategy (usual care). Results The average standardized cost of WLE was $2066, whereas the cost of WLE and SLNB was $11,976 based on Medicare rates. At a cost below $7350 for T1b melanoma and $4600 for T1b to T2 melanoma, Merlin testing was cost-saving compared to a no-testing strategy (usual care), assuming Medicare reimbursement rates. Conclusion Merlin testing for T1b and T2 melanoma is potentially cost saving depending on the cost of the molecular assay and SLNB reimbursement rates. In addition to being cost saving, Merlin is expected to improve health-related quality of life.

TI  - Mines to forests? Analyzing long-term recovery trends for surface coal mines in Central Appalachia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountaintop removal mining, and other surface mining operations have severe, large-scale impacts on the communities and ecosystems of Appalachia. The impact of this disturbance surpasses that of other land clearing events, such as fire or timber harvesting; mines remove both established vegetation and soil, but also alter landscape topography. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act legally mandates restoration of former mines after the end of mining activity, yet the long-term outcomes of restoration efforts across Central Appalachia are unknown. We conducted the first regionwide analysis of the lands mined between 1985 and 2015 in Central Appalachia, and explore post-mining ecological trajectories. Pairing mine-footprint and remote sensing data, we characterize the vegetation trends and site health at 71,140 mine sites across Central Appalachia. We use first order autoregressive models to describe the rates of recovery, expected long-term ecological state, and probability of recovery to reference state for former mines. We found that only 7.9% of sites recover to 95% of the forest reference condition in all remote sensing indices. Overall only 0.10% of sites have a 95% probability of reaching or exceeding reference forests in all remote sensing indices. While much of these mined lands are intentionally not being reforested, 19% of mines in Kentucky, 81% of mines in Virginia, and 46.5% of mines in West Virginia have declared forestry as the primary land use for post-mining operations. Our results indicate that post-mining forests are not recovering to a level that is consistent with average forest conditions in similar unmined sites.

TI  - A disease-specific spectral index tracks<i> Magnaporthe</i><i> oryzae</i> infection in paddy rice from ground to space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice blast (RB, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae) is the most devastating disease in global rice pro-duction, and can cause significant yield losses and increasingly threaten global food security. Accurate detection of RB occurrence with a universal metric is crucial to facilitate early disease prevention and curtailing the disease expansion but has not been addressed to date. This study aimed to design a rice blast index (RIBI) for quantifying the disease index (DI) and tracking the smallholder rice blast dispersal over multiple spatial scales. To achieve this goal, a large dataset including leaf-and canopy-scale reflectance spectra and satellite imagery was acquired within the framework of seven independent campaigns over four years (2018-2021). Specifically, an extensive collection of Magnaporthe oryzae infected samples were analyzed to examine the specific spectral response to pathogen infection in paddy rice from leaf to near-ground canopy scales. Two variants of the RIBI were devel-oped, which were RIBInir = (R753-R1102)/(R665 + R1102) and RIBIred= (R753-R1102)/(R665 + R1102) based on the single-band separability and exhaustive search of band combinations. They were subsequently evaluated for quantifying the RB occurrence from ground to space. Spatial cluster analysis was then integrated with the su-perior RIBI adjusted for Sentinel-2 imagery to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogen infection, and to reveal the within-field hotspots of potential rice blast dispersal in smallholder farms.The results demonstrated that both RIBInir and RIBIredexhibited high overall accuracies for the classification of infected and healthy samples at the leaf scale under greenhouse in 2018 (RIBInir: 81.41%; RIBIred: 84.62%) and 2019 (RIBInir: 81.30%; RIBIred: 90.37%) and field conditions in 2020 (RIBInir: 86.36%; RIBIred: 89.39%). Compared with traditional VIs (Near-ground: R2 < 0.47, satellite: R2 < 0.54), the RIBInir yielded improved R2 in quantifying the DI from in situ spectra to satellite imagery (Near-ground: R2 = 0.73, satellite: R2 = 0.78). The strongest DI-RIBInir relationship was attributed to the use of two near-infrared (NIR) bands that helped enhance the unique spectral responses in the NIR region induced by pathogen infection, in contrast to the extensively studied visible region. Multi-temporal analysis of Sentinel-2A derived RIBInir successfully captured the temporal dynamics of RB infection and recovery and yielded compelling maps showing the spatial propagation and attenuation of disease over time. This research opens new opportunities towards quantifying field disease occurrence and detecting the within-field hotspots of potential disease dispersal in a timely manner from publicly available satellite imagery.

TI  - CFD analysis of flow control in compressor cascade using MVGs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TURBO & JET-ENGINES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present study reports the numerical investigation of the compressor cascade. To minimize the separation phenomenon in the compressor cascade, a passive flow control device i.e. Micro Vortex Generator (MVG) is utilized. MVG is a very simple and lightweight attachment mounted infront of the leading edge of the cascade blade. Due to being passive in nature, it neither consumes power nor requires any external device to actuate. The numerical simulations were carried out on a highly loaded compressor cascade at an angle of incidence of -1 degrees under subsonic conditions at Mach number 0.2. The profile of the compressor cascade blade was double circular arc (DCA), unsymmetrical and cambered at 40 degrees. Two different types of micro vortex generators were mounted infront of the leading edge in the compressor cascade to control the secondary flows since secondary flows were responsible for various losses in cascade. To analyze the flow under incompressoible state of air (M = 0.2), Star CCM + software has been used. To simulate the flow under turbulent condition, k-omega SST turbulence model was used. A velocity profile of 25 mm boundary layer thickness was extracted and used as an input in the compressor cascade. Mounting of MVG on compressor cascade enhanced drag but also increased lift. Total pressure loss coefficient (TPLC) was calculated to compare the losses. The aerodynamic efficiency in terms of coefficient of lift and coefficient of drag has been used to study the effect of MVG over cascade. It is found that there is reduction in total pressure loss coefficient (TPLC) for trapezoidal and curved trapezoidal types of MVGs and the decrease in percentage are 2.17 and 8.86%, respectively. Alos, aerodynamic efficiency is increased by mounting trapezoidal and curved trapezoidal types of MVG and the increase in percentages are 2.03 and 3.10%, respectively.

TI  - Non-linear effects of industrial structure on urban haze pollution: A test and extension of the environmental Kuznets curve
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether the Environmental Kuznets curve is established in haze pollution has an important policy. Based on the PM2.5 concentration raster data of 283 cities in MODIS and MISR, this paper empirically examines the non-linear effects of industrial structure upgrading on haze pollution using a spatial econometric model, and further tests and extends the environmental Kuznets curve using a threshold model. The study finds that there is a significant spatial spillover effect on haze pollution between cities, an inverted ''U'' shaped relationship between industrial upgrading and haze pollution, confirming the environmental Kuznets curve, and that the effect of industrial upgrading on haze pollution is mainly a direct effect, while the indirect effect is not significant. Further discussion in this paper reveals that there is a threshold effect of industrial upgrading on haze pollution; the traditional environmental Kuznets curve can be refined and extended: on both sides of the inflection point, there may be both positive and negative effects of economic development on environmental pollution, and the environmental Kuznets curve is the result of the combined effect of the two different effects.

TI  - Seasonal variability of Total Suspended Sediment off the Banjir Kanal Barat River, Semarang, Indonesia estimated from Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) is one of the important variables determining water quality since it controls the biological process in the coastal waters. TSS distribution off the Banjir Kanal Barat (BKB) River, Semarang, Indonesia previously has been investigated using remote sensing method. However, they did not use the TSS algorithm which is designated for coastal area of Semarang or they did not do proper validation process. In the present study, we generated TSS algorithm using Sentinel-2 images for the coastal waters off the BKB River based on 164 match-up data, which consists of the in-situ TSS as the truth TSS and collocated satellite measurements. With the Root Mean Square Error of 6.27 mg/L and bias of-0.29 mg/L, TSS off the BKB River can be estimated by the linear regression of red band. The seasonal variation of TSS off the BKB River is obtained by applying the linear regression equation on the cloud free Sentinel-2 images which represent each month in 2020. The maximum (minimum) TSS occur in February (May) i.e., > 150 mg/L (< 96 mg/L). High TSS plume is clearly seen off the BKB River which indicates the dominant role of BKB River as a suspended sediment source. Based on the TSS distribution criteria by Ministerial decree of environment of the Republic of Indonesia no. 54 of 2004, the coastal waters off the BKB River is categorized as polluted water. The seasonal variation of TSS follows the variation of precipitation. The high (low) precipitation causes the high (low) TSS off the BKB River. The precipitation over land may bring eroded soil that increase TSS. Thus, the management uphill land use may play an important role to control the TSS off the BKB River.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Derived Depths in Opaque Waters Using ICESat-2 Photon-Counting Lidar
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since turbid waters make it extremely difficult for light to penetrate the water column due to attenuation, performing satellite-derived bathymetry using spectral images and/or photon-counting lidars is a very challenging problem in turbid waters. The photon-counting lidar borne on Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) can obtain high-resolution and accurate height estimations of sea surfaces, that do not depend on the water clarity. Using the ocean surface waves calculated from ICESat-2 and classical wave theory that models the relationship between the water depth and wavelength, we propose a method to estimate the depths in opaque waters. The performance is validated in different water qualities with a mean absolute percent error of 9%similar to 22%. The basic theory of estimating water depths in this study is entirely different from that of conventional laser bathymetry, and this method has the potential to fill the gap of space-based bathymetric data sets in turbid waters.

TI  - Full-genome characterisation of a putative novel serotype of Yonaguni <i>orbivirus</i> isolated from cattle in Yunnan province, China
T2  - VIRUS GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - In July 2019, a novel viral strain (JH2019C603) was isolated from sentinel cattle in Jinghong City, in the subtropical region of Yunnan Province, China. The virus replicated and caused cytopathological effects in both Aedes albopictus (C6/36) and Baby Hamster Syrian Kidney (BHK-21) cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a viral genome comprised of 10 segments of double-stranded RNA, with a 1-2-2-1-1-1-1-1 migration pattern. Complete genome sequences of the JH2019C603 virus were determined through full-length cDNA amplification. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid (aa) sequences of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (Pol), Major subcore (T2) and Major core-surface (T13) showed that JH2019C603 clustered with Yonaguni orbivirus (YONOV) from Japan, with aa identities relative to YONOV of 97.7% (Pol), 99.0% (T2) and 98.5% (T13). However, phylogenetic analysis based on the aa sequences of the outer capsid protein one and two (OC1 and OC2) showed that JH2019C603 formed an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree, and its aa identity with YONOV was only 55.4% (OC1) and 80.8% (OC2), respectively. Compared with the prototype of YONOV, a notable sequence deletion was observed in the 3 ' non-coding region of NS1, with the NS1 of JH2019C603 encoded within segment 7 (Seg-7), in contrast to YONOV, which contains NS1 in Seg-6. These results indicate that JH2019C603 belongs to the YONOV lineage and might be a novel serotype or a highly variant strain of YONOV. These findings will facilitate the identification of new isolates and clarify their geographical distribution, epidemiology, genetic diversity and possible disease associations.

TI  - Recent Rapid Increase of Cover Crop Adoption Across the US Midwest Detected by Fusing Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops have critical significance for agroecosystem sustainability and have long been promoted in the U.S. Midwest. Knowledge of cover cropping variations and impacts of government policies remains very limited. We developed an accurate and cost-effective approach utilizing satellite fusion data, environmental variables, and machine learning to quantify cover cropping in corn and soybean fields from 2000 to 2021 in the U.S. Midwest. We found that cover crop adoption in most counties was stagnant from 2000 to 2011, but has significantly increased from 2011 to 2021. The adoption of 2021 is four times that of 2011, which was highly correlated to the funding for conservation programs. However, the percentage of cover crop adoption in the U.S. Midwest is still low (7.2%). Our work fills a critical gap in quantifying long-term field-level cover crop adoption at large regions and highlights the potential importance of incentive programs to promote sustainable agricultural practices.

T2  - SYSTEMATIC PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The extreme sparsity of collection efforts in many parts of the word, including southern Africa, leaves a vast hidden diversity of marine cestode species, such as species of Phoreiobothrium. The examination of a common South African coastal-pelagic shark species, Carcharhinus brevipinna (Valenciennes), resulted in the discovery of a new species of Phoreiobothrium Linton, 1889. Phoreiobothrium martinisp. n. is undoubtedly different from all other congeners in several morphological characteristics, however, it is most easily distinguished from other species by its total length, the size of its hooks, and the number of post vaginal testes. The addition of P. martinisp. n. increases the total number of valid species of Phoreiobothrium to 20 worldwide. Furthermore, P. martinisp. n. marks the description of representatives of only the second onchoproteocephalidean genus from southern Africa, therefore expanding the generic biogeographical representation and introducing new host associations. Apart from the description of this new species of cestode, the discovery of additional species of Phoreiobothrium will be beneficial regarding future ecological investigations. With the high degree of host-specificity found amongst species of Phoreiobothrium, species such as P. martinisp. n. could be used as sentinel species for the accurate identification, separation and diagnosis of commonly misidentified shark species.

TI  - Characteristics of Strong Storms at the Pre-Convection Stage From Satellite Microwave Sounder Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-temporal-resolution geostationary satellite infrared measurements are always used to capture and predict typical characteristics at the cloud top of rapidly developing strong storms at the pre-convection or convection initiation (CI) stage. However, the large false alarm rate of CI nowcasting is difficult to avoid due to the complex and unpredictable trigger factors. Although the microwave measurement technique can observe thick clouds and even the precipitation within clouds due to the weaker atmospheric extinction effect on microwave, microwave data from polar-orbiting satellites are rarely used to observe the CI due to their relatively low temporal resolution. In this study, we analyze several previously unknown CI characteristics over the East Asia region from 2016 to 2019 based on spatially and temporally matched Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder data. These typical CI samples are initially identified by using continuous infrared images from the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite. The results show that there is a distinct cloud optical depth at the pre-convection stage in the western (deep cloud clusters) and eastern (shallow cloud clusters) Tibetan Plateau (TP). The shallow precipitating cloud clusters of the CI over the eastern TP are possibly attributed to the favorable local dynamic and thermal conditions stem from the Asian monsoon. Another notable finding shows that the fast-developing CI over the ocean has thick clouds compared with the samples over the land. Overall, the unique CI characteristics found from microwave observations in this study indicate that the future geostationary microwave sounder technologies will almost certainly provide some new findings and enhance early warning capabilities about convection.

TI  - Review of vegetation phenology trends in China in a changing climate
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetation phenology is sensitive to climate change and has been defined as the footprint of ongoing climate change. Previous studies have shown that the spatial difference in China's vegetation phenology varies substantially in both spring and autumn. Here, we reviewed phenological dynamics at the national and the regional scale of China over the period 1982-2020 using a remote sensing-based dataset and meta-analysis from phenological studies in China. We also explored the underlying mechanisms of both spring and autumn phenology and discussed potential phenological studies under future climate conditions. We found that, over the past four decades, the spring phenology advanced at a rate of 0.23 +/- 0.47 days/year, while the autumn phenology was delayed at a rate of 0.17 +/- 0.46 days/year. This led to an extended vegetation growth season of approximately 5 days per decade. The trends in the spring and autumn phenology were spatially specific in the Northern region, Northwest region, Qinghai-Tibet region, and Southern region: the change in spring phenology was -0.16, -0.46, -0.18, and -0.13 days/year, respectively, while the change in autumn phenology was 0.02, 0.32, 0.09, and 0.28 days/year, respectively. We also explored the dominant climatic drivers of regional phenological changes. We found that temperature was the dominant factor for spring phenology in cold regions, while precipitation, radiation, and temperature co-determined spring phenology in warm regions. The autumn phenology was affected by all three environmental cues but the effect of temperature was larger than that of radiation and precipitation across all regions. In future climate warming conditions, we recommend that studies focus on the phenological feedback mechanisms, such as the climatic and hydrological effects of vegetation changes, and agricultural phenology to investigate its fundamental role in crop productivity, especially under extreme climate events, to ensure national food security and ecological security.

TI  - Vegetation responses to variations in climate: A combined ordinary differential equation and sequential Monte Carlo estimation approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation responses to variation in climate are a current research priority in the context of accelerated shifts generated by climate change. However, the interactions between environmental and biological factors still represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future scenarios, since the relationship between drivers and ecosystem responses has a complex and nonlinear nature. We aimed to develop a model to study the veg-etation's primary productivity dynamic response to temporal variations in climatic conditions as measured by rainfall, temperature and radiation. Thus, we propose a new way to estimate the vegetation response to climate via a non-autonomous version of a classical growth curve, with a time-varying growth rate and carrying capacity parameters according to climate variables. With a Sequential Monte Carlo Estimation to account for complexities in the climate-vegetation relationship to minimize the number of parameters. The model was applied to six key sites identified in a previous study, consisting of different arid and semiarid rangelands from North Patagonia, Argentina. For each site, we selected the time series of MODIS NDVI, and climate data from ERA5 Copernicus hourly reanalysis from 2000 to 2021. After calculating the time series of the a posteriori distribution of pa-rameters, we analyzed the explained capacity of the model in terms of the linear coefficient of determination and the parameters distribution variation. Results showed that most rangelands recorded changes in their sensitivity over time to climatic factors, but vegetation responses were heterogeneous and influenced by different drivers. Differences in this climate-vegetation relationship were recorded among different cases: (1) a marginal and decreasing sensitivity to temperature and radiation, respectively, but a high sensitivity to water availability; (2) high and increasing sensitivity to temperature and water availability, respectively; and (3) a case with an abrupt shift in vegetation dynamics driven by a progressively decreasing sensitivity to water availability, without any changes in the sensitivity either to temperature or radiation. Finally, we also found that the time scale, in which the ecosystem integrated the rainfall phenomenon in terms of the width of the window function used to convolve the rainfall series into a water availability variable, was also variable in time. This approach allows us to estimate the connection degree between ecosystem productivity and climatic variables. The capacity of the model to identify changes over time in the vegetation-climate relationship might inform decision-makers about ecological transitions and the differential impact of climatic drivers on ecosystems.

TI  - Spectro-temporal analysis of anthropic interference in water production in the Guarani Aquifer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Guarani Aquifer System is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in the world and has been widely exploited due to the quantity and quality of the stored water. The outcropping areas are considered highly vulnerable, and anthropic interference can influence the recharge potential and cause changes in water quality. The purpose of this research was to spectrally and temporally analyze the anthropic interference in water production in the Guarani Aquifer in four distinct areas located in the outcrop and recharge areas located in the State of Sa similar to o Paulo, Brazil, from 2012 to 2018. Rainfall data were obtained using the CHIRPS dataset, and the actual evapotrans-piration rate was obtained using the MODIS product. The lithology and piezometric level data were obtained through RIMAS of the Geological Service of Brazil. The piezometric level monitoring wells were used as a reference to delimit the study areas and the distance to eliminate overlapping spatial resolutions of the remote sensing products. The area bounded by the buffer is equivalent to 31,412 ha. The recharge was estimated with the ESPERE using the water table fluctuation method. The end classifications of land use were obtained using the normalized difference vegetation index through remote sensing data. The study area located in the municipality of Boa Esperanca do Sul -SP had the largest area of exposed soil with a median of 2936 (ha) and the lowest recharge potential with a median of 338 mm/year. The study area located in the municipality of Bofete -SP had the smallest area of exposed soil with a median of 516 (ha) and the highest recharge potential with a median of 502 mm/year. The study area located in the municipality of Brotas -SP showed the lowest evapotranspiration rate, with a median of 639 mm/year. The municipality of Sa similar to o Sima similar to o -SP had the largest forest area, with a median of 18,009 ha. Although water resource policies have significantly influenced the valuation of ground-water, studies that assess changes in land use variables using time series analysis and evaluate how these changes influence water dynamics in the hydrological cycle are still lacking. The study aims to contribute technical support to the decision-making process of the National System of Water Resources Management (SINGREH) and State Law 9866/1997 to contribute to the sustainability of the Guarani Aquifer System.

TI  - The attempt to estimate annual variability of NO<sub>x</sub> emission in Poland using Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the annual variability of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions is needed in air quality modeling. Emission inventories like EMEP or E-PRTR provide only the total amounts of NOx emission per year. Satellite data on atmospheric composition allows for the quantification of air pollutants emissions and the monitoring of their changes in time. In this study the Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column (TVC) data from the area of Poland and its border areas from the period of May 2018-November 2021 were used to estimate the NOx lifetime, as well as total NOx emission from Poland area, and NOx emissions from 28 large point sources (LPSs), with their annual variability. The box model (BM) was used to estimate NOx emissions. A novelty is the use of NO2 TVC data in a circular area around each LPS with a radius depending on the wind speed. Furthermore, a new search streak method (SSM) for LPS emission estimation was proposed, and the results were compared with these obtained by the BM method assuming the 5th percentile of NO2 TVC as the emission background (BM5). The estimated monthly and hourly NOx emissions were compared with the stack measurement data for 4 power plants and with the E-PRTR data for all analyzed LPSs. The annual variability of NOx lifetime estimates, higher in winter and lower in summer, is roughly consistent with earlier estimates based on SCIAMACHY and OMI data for mid-latitude sites. The results showed difficulties in estimating NOx emissions for the winter months, whereas for the other seasons the inaccuracies and errors of estimation were much lower. When estimating NOx emission from the LPS using TROPOMI data, the BM5 method gives better results when the LPS is the dominant emission source, while the SSM method works better in an area with many significant emission sources. Comparison of the annual average NOx emission estimates obtained by the BM5 and SSM methods for 28 LPSs with the E-PRTR data showed that the average normalized BIAS is strongly correlated with the emission background around the LPS. The introduction of an additional TROPOMI data selection criterion related to the wind direction sector significantly improves the quality of the results.

TI  - Time-series remote sensing of rice paddy expansion in the Yellow River Delta: Towards sustainable ecological conservation in the context of water scarcity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Large river deltas are usually ecologically important wetland habitats, but also fertile agricultural exploitation areas, creating a conflict of long-running substantial interest between agricultural expansion and wetland conservation. Over the past several years, large-scale cultivation of water-consuming rice has been growing rapidly in the semi-arid climate of the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Timely monitoring of rice cultivation dynamics is of great significance for sustainable ecological conservation of the delta, which has insufficient freshwater resources. This study proposed a stratified metrics-based method that integrates statistical spectral indices and phenological metrics at different growing stages to improve the accuracy of rice paddy classification in areas where rice and wetlands coexist. We applied the method to time-series Sentinel-1/2 images to produce annual rice paddy maps of the YRD from 2016 to 2021. Together with rice paddy data from 2011 to 2015 from Statistical Yearbooks of Dongying Bureau of Statistics, we investigated the expansion dynamics over the past decade and in this paper discuss the advantages and disadvantages of rice cultivation expansion over wetland ecosystem conservation. Rapid expansion of rice cultivation intensifies water conflicts, and adversely affects wetland restoration in the YRD. Considering the important ecological services of rice paddies as alternative habitats, we argue for maintaining a reasonable scale of rice paddies and optimizing their distribution as a potential solution to achieving the overall sustainable conservation of the YRD in the context of water scarcity.

TI  - Vegetation vulnerability to hydrometeorological stresses in water-scarce areas using machine learning and remote sensing techniques
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative understanding of vegetation vulnerability as a major example of terrestrial ecosystems under hydrometeorological stress is essential for environmental risk preparedness and mitigation strategies. The aim of this study was to develop a new quantitative vegetation vulnerability map using benchmark and standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms (e.g., RF, SVM and Maxent), as well as influencing variables (evaporation, rainfall, maximum temperature, slope degree, elevation, topographic wetness index, distance from river, aspect, land use), in the South Baluchistan basin, Iran. An ensemble model was developed based on selected standalone ML algorithms. A vegetation vulnerability index (VVI), based on remote sensing indices (NDVI, VCI, LST, and TCI), was used to monitor vegetation conditions and changes. Five evaluation metrics for the confusion matrix (accuracy, precision, bias, Probability of Detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR)) and ROC-AUC were used to measure the predictive performance of the ensemble model and VVI. The optimum values for accuracy, precision, bias, POD, FAR, and ROC-AUC were obtained as 0.89, 0.88, 1.02, 0.91, 0.11, and 0.946, respectively for the ensemble model. Based on remote sensing data, VVI achieved a 0.923 prediction rate in vegetation vulnerability mapping (the efficiency of the ensembled model was somewhat better than VVI). Based on the results obtained from the ensemble model, precipitation (PRD = 20.61), maximum temperature (PRD = 12.31), evaporation (PRD = 5.53), and distance from the river (PRD = 2.62) were found to be the most important variables. The methodology as presented in this study provides valuable information in a large area and can be easily modified for other case studies by adding different influencing variables.

TI  - Assessing the capabilities of high-resolution spectral, altimetric, and textural descriptors for mapping the status of citrus parcels
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment is an increasing phenomenon around the world with relevant environmental and socio-economic implications. In the European Union about 11 % of agricultural land is at high risk of aban-donment. The Comunitat Valenciana region (Spain) is the most important citrus producer in Europe suffering from this problem. Identifying the status of citrus crops at the parcel level is essential for policymakers in agriculture. This work assessed the use of WorldView-3 data, Very High-Resolution Airborne Images, and Structure from Motion point clouds to identify the status of citrus parcels using two machine learning algorithms: Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. Different analyses involving combinations of the three data sources were carried out to assess the impact on classification accuracy. The results showed the high potential of airborne imagery (OA approximate to 0.967) and WorldView-3 (OA approximate to 0.936) to detect parcel status using a single image. The SfM data showed a lower potential (OA approximate to 0.825). Adding SfM point cloud to the multispectral information produced small improvements (0.4-2.0 %) in classification accuracy. The class separability analysis showed the importance of WV-3 SWIR bands to detect abandoned parcels as they produce more spectral separability over the productive parcels in the 1570 nm - 2330 nm spectrum. The results also show the importance of GLCM texture features extracted from sub-metric images due to their ability to model spatial planting patterns typical of fruit crops.

TI  - Estimation of groundwater storage change in the Helmand River Basin (Afghanistan) using GRACE satellite data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Understanding groundwater storage dynamic changes and quantifying the trends of groundwater fluctuations in the Helmand River Basin (HRB) aquifers, where the groundwater is the main source for drinking and irrigation applications, is significantly important in order to effectively manage groundwater resources. This case study quantifies the changes in groundwater storage over 18 years (i.e., from 2003 to 2021) in the HRB by employing the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data due to sparse groundwater monitoring networks and lack of ground-based information. The data of observation wells was applied to validate the results of the GRACE and GLDAS outputs. The results indicate that changes in groundwater storage on average from 2003 to 2021 are equal to (-98.6 +/- 226.84 mm or -1.9 +/- 4.38 km(3)/year). On average, during 2003 to 2021 groundwater table decline was -2.6 m in the HRB. The study indicates relatively strong correlation (0.75) between the GRACE derived data and direct in-situ measurements. This study highlights the effectiveness of the GRACE-derived data for the reliable estimation of groundwater storage changes in the HRB and may contribute to sustainable groundwater resources management in the region.

AB  - This work provides the mean ground deformation rates and ground displacement time series of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy) retrieved by satellite remote sensing data analysis from 1992 to 2021. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by ERS 1-2 (1992-2002), Envisat (2003-2011) and Cosmo-SkyMed (2011-2021) are processed by multi-temporal SAR Interferometry (InSAR) approach using the same technique, parameters and reference system, to obtain for the first time a homogeneous and time-continuous dataset. The validation of the InSAR products is carried out by comparison with the measurements provided by precise levelling lines and cGNSS stations. The produced outcomes offer an overview on the temporal behaviour of ground deformation at Campi Flegrei along an unprecedented time window of about 30 years and can be exploited by the scientific community for supporting and improving the knowledge of the dynamics of the caldera.Measurement(s) ground deformation process Technology Type(s) satellite imaging of a planet Factor Type(s) Satellite Line-of-Sight Displacement Sample Characteristic - Environment ground deformation process Sample Characteristic - Location Campi Flegrei

TI  - EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND TOPSIS OPTIMIZATION OF CUTTING FORCE, SURFACE ROUGHNESS, AND SOUND INTENSITY IN HARD TURNING OF AISI 52100 STEEL
T2  - SURFACE REVIEW AND LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, initially, the raw AISI 52100 bearing steel was heat-treated to obtain 40 HRC and 45 HRC workpiece hardness. Further, dry hard turning tests were carried out to study the impact of workpiece hardness (H), cutting speed (v), feed (f), and depth of cut (a) on cutting force (Fy), surface roughness (Ra), and sound intensity (SI). An economically viable PVD-coated carbide turning tool was implemented for the experiments. The Taguchi L-18 (2-3 mixed level) design of experiments was employed to establish the experimental plan in order to save the experimental time, energy, and cost of manufacturing. The results disclosed that the feed has the prevailing consequence on surface roughness with a 96.3% contribution, while it also significantly affects the cutting force with a contribution of 13.8%. The contribution of cutting speed and workpiece hardness on the cutting force was reported as 48.3% and 35.1%, respectively. Higher workpiece hardness required more energy for plastic deformation as a result the cutting force increases with leading hardness. The sound intensity was dominantly influenced by depth of cut (53.3%) and cutting speed (40%). Finally, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was performed to determine the optimum machining parameters. According to the TOPSIS, the optimum level of cutting parameters was predicted as 40 HRC hardness (H), 150 m/min cutting speed (V), 0.15 mm/rev feed (f), and 0.1 mm depth of cut (a) while the optimal result of Fy, SI, and Ra were noted as 27.66 N, 70.7dB, and 0.86 mu m individually.

TI  - Is There a Dark Side to Humility? Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Evidence for Existential Costs of Humility
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has highlighted the benefits of holding one's views with humility. However, might intellectual humility surrounding existential beliefs also incur some psychological costs? To advance research on intellectual humility about existential concerns (IH-E), we conducted four studies (N = 1,700) to examine potential costs of humility. Study 1 (N = 203) revealed that IH-E was associated with greater death-related anxiety. Study 2 (N = 1,151) replicated this association in a larger sample. In Study 3 (N = 77), a longitudinal study of first-year college students revealed that IH-E predicted negative changes in religious well-being three and six weeks later. In Study 4 (N = 269), a year-long longitudinal study of religious "ex-vangelicals" revealed that IH-E predicted religious disbelief and lower well-being one year later. We discuss implications for the nature and structure of security-providing worldviews. Despite the benefits of humility, holding existential beliefs humbly might come with intrapsychic costs.

TI  - Blocking Cx43 alleviates neuropathic pain in rats with chronic constriction injury via the P2X4 and P38/ERK-P65 pathways
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Neuropathic pain is a growing concern in the medical community, and studies on new analgesic targets for neuropathic pain have become a new hot spot. Whether Connexin43 (Cx43) has a key role in neuropathic pain mediated by the purinergic 2X4 (P2X4) receptor in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) was explored in this study. Our experimental results show that blockade of Cx43 could attenuate neuropathic pain in rats suffering from CCI via the P2X4, p38, ERK, and NF-kB signalling pathways. These results suggest that Cx43 may be a promising therapeutic target for the development of novel pharmacological agents in the management of neuropathic pain.

TI  - Development of China's spaceborne SAR satellite, processing strategy, and application: take Gaofen-3 series as an example
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - After mastering the key technologies of manufacturing spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), China's SAR satellites have been successfully launched into space. As the only civil microwave satellite listed in the "National High-resolution Earth Observation System Major Project," the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) 01 satellite is the first C-band multi-polarization SAR satellite with a resolution of 1 m. GF-3 series satellites stand out among civil SAR satellites worldwide because of their high resolution, wide swath, high geometric radiation quality, multiple imaging modes, and long operation time. Taking GF-3 series satellites as an example, this study introduces the development of China's civil SAR satellites, as well as their processing strategies and applications. The success of the GF-3 series satellites shows that China's SAR remote sensing technology has stepped into a new era of high-quality and high-precision Earth observations.

TI  - Deep learning U-Net classification of Sentinel-1 and 2 fusions effectively demarcates tropical montane forest's deforestation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical montane forests (TMF) play a vital role in providing numerous ecosystem services. This ecosystem is characterized by towering mountains, cold weather, tall trees such as pine, and dwarfed plants. Although the combination of optical and radar imagery has shown promise in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, only a handful of studies have attempted to study the dynamics of land changes in tropical montane forests by combining the two. In this study, we examined the usage of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) and their fusion as input for LULC mapping with three modeling classifiers: traditional (maximum likelihood classification - MLC), machine learning techniques (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and kd-tree nearest neighbor), and a deep learning approach (U-Net) in a TMF in the Philippines. Also, the deforestation was characterized in terms of proximity and topographic factors. The findings revealed that the combination of S-1 and S-2 provides LULC with high accuracy of image classification. In binary classification, traditional MLC supersedes other classifiers in correctly classifying the pixels of the input imagery (average overall accuracy (OA) = 95.22; Kappa index (KI) = 90.39). Random Forest (RF) stands out in machine learning classifiers (average OA = 94.49; KI = 88.8). However, U-Net deep learning loses in binary classification but proven more robust when LULC were classified into six complex classes with an OA of 86.77 and KI of 78.89. In addition, using deep learning modeling for LULC mapping of the research site, it was determined that from 2015 to early 2022, 417.93 km2 of the study area had been deforested. Further, this research reveals that the greater the proximity of a forest to a human settlement or agricultural zone, the greater the likelihood that it will be cleared for human habitation or agriculture. Deforestation also occurred in rural locations, far from roads and bodies of water. This analysis also supports the hypothesis that deforestation can occur even in high-elevation areas. The results of this study can be utilized by policy and law makers in order to better communicate the critical nature of implementing evidence- and science-based policies to strengthen protections, as well as developing conservation and management plan for tropical montane forests.

TI  - Increased tropospheric ozone levels as a public health issue during COVID-19 lockdown and estimation the related pulmonary diseases
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study were to i) investigate the variation of tropospheric ozone (O3) levels during the COVID-19 lockdown; ii) determine the relationships between O3 concentrations with the number of COVID-19 cases; and iii) estimate the O3-related health effects in Southwestern Iran (Khorramabad) over the time period 2019-2021. The hourly O3 data were collected from ground monitoring stations, as well as retrieved from Sentinel-5 satellite data for showing the changes in O3 levels pre, during, and after lockdown period. The concentration-response function model was applied using relative risk (RR) values and baseline incidence (BI) to assess the O3-related health effects. Compared to 2019, the annual O3 mean concentrations increased by 12.2% in 2020 and declined by 3.9% in 2021. The spatiotemporal changes showed a significant O3 increase during COVID-19 lockdown, and a negative correlation between O3 levels and the number of COVID-19 cases was found (r = -0.59, p < 0.05). In 2020, the number of hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases increased by 4.0 per 105 cases, the mortality for respiratory diseases increased by 0.7 per 105 cases, and the long-term mortality for respiratory diseases increased by 0.9 per 105 cases. Policy decisions are now required to reduce the surface O3 concentrations and O3- related health effects in Iran.

TI  - Geological mapping and structural interpretation of the Dschang-Santchou-escarpment (West, Cameroon), using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensors/SRTM and field observations
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological mapping of the Dschang-Santchou-escarpment rocks in the Western Cameroon region was done using a combination of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, SRTM images acquired by satellites on January 21, 2021, and field observations. Lineaments were pre-processing and processing, performed with Envi 5.1. The different methods of digital processing applied, such as the principal component analysis, the coloured compositions and the combination of bands, show a lithological differentiation of the geological formations of the study area. Lineament maps were obtained by applying Sobel directional filters where 496 lineaments were manually extracted. These lineaments display two main trending directions: the NW-SE trend corresponding to the S-2 metamorphic foliation direction and the NE-SW trend corresponding to the S-3 magmatic foliation direction. The set of these lineaments represents the fracture network in the area. The field observations as well as the lineaments mapping obtained, allowed us to confirm with the help of the fracture network that we are indeed in an escarped environment. Remote sensing data constitute thus a useful tool for geological mapping and structural reconstitutions in the escarped environment.

TI  - Visual interpretation of satellite imagery for hotspot dust sources identification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying dust sources using remotely sensed satellite imagery is one of the most effective ways of studying dust emission and dynamics. Even though complex algorithms and sophisticated models that take advantages of different data sources have been developed, human knowledge and experiences are key factors in the accurate dust sources identification. Visual interpretation of satellite imagery (VISI) is essentially influenced by interpreters' subjective judgment. Meanwhile, the capabilities of VISI are not comprehensively explained in the literature. Therefore, this study performed an experimental VISI to identify hotspot dust sources (HDS) in the Tigris and Euphrates basin (TEB) involves a variety of active sources of global dust emission. In this regard, the characteristics of various satellite sensors including spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions, swath width, free availability, and length of archive time were explored. Accordingly, the MODIS-Terra/Aqua was qualified as the best sensor for HDS identification. By visual interpretation of 27,239 MODIS images, a total of 10,422 HDSs was identified in TEB in the 2000-2021 period. The research findings revealed that the interpreter's proficiency in using specific VISI keys, knowledgeability about the geoenvironment, and familiarity with the study area can significantly reduce subjectivity and increase the accuracy of HDS identification.

TI  - [Application of robot-assisted laparoscopic sentinel lymph node tracing in treating endometrial carcinoma].
T2  - Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the value of robot-assisted laparoscopic indocyanine green sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracing in treating endometrial carcinoma. Methods: Thirty-two patients with early-staging endometrial carcinoma were operated with laparoscopic comprehensive staging laparotomy from January 2019 to December 2021. At the same time, the SLN detection was performed by near-infrared fluorescence imaging tracer technology, in which the tracer was indocyanine green. Sixteen cases were injected with indocyanine green before laparoscopic surgery, and 16 cases were injected with indocyanine green before robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. The operation index, postoperative complications, prognosis, and lymph node dissection were compared between the two groups. Results: (1) The mean age of patients in the robot group was (54.7±8.1) years old, and was (54.9±8.8) years old in the laparoscopic group. There were no significant difference between the two groups (t=0.06, P=0.951). (2) Intraoperative blood loss [(131±40) vs (169±57) ml], hemoglobin difference before and after surgery [(11.2±5.4) vs (15.5±5.7) g/L], the length of stay after operation [(6.2±1.3) vs (8.6±1.4) days] between the robot group and the laparoscopic group were compared, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). (3) SLNs were detected in all 16 patients in the robotic group, and a total of 41 SLNs were detected. SLNs were detected in 15 of the 16 patients in the laparoscopy group, and a total of 40 SLNs were detected. Compared with the laparoscopic group (15/16), the total detection rate of SLN in the robotic group (16/16), there were no statistical significance (chi2=1.03, P=0.310). Compared with the laparoscopic group (7/15), the SLN bilateral detection rate in the robotic group (10/16), there were also no significant difference (chi2=0.78, P=0.376). The number of lymph nodes detected in surgery group (16.6±4.1) were lower than those in the laparoscopy surgery group (21.0±7.1), while there were no statistically difference between the two groups (chi2=2.01, P=0.054). There was no tumor metastasis in the resected lymph nodes and SLN between the two groups. The false negative rate of SLN in diagnosing endometrial cancer postoperative lymph node metastasis was 0, and the negative predictive value was 100%. (4) The pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were divided into five regions, which were the left pelvis, the right pelvis, the presacral region, the deep inguinal region, and the abdominal aorta. The numbers of SLN of unilateral detection and bilateral pelvic detection between two groups showed no significant differences (all P>0.05). The left pelvis had the most SLN imaging in both groups, followed by the right pelvis, para-aortic, and deep groin. (5) There was one patient in both robotic group and laparoscopic group with postoperative complications, which were urinary retention and pelvic lymph node cyst respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of complications between the two groups (chi2=0.97, P=1.000). The median follow-up time after operation was 14 months (range 6-24 months). During the follow-up period, no local recurrence or distant metastasis was found between the two groups of endometrial cancer patients. Conclusions: Compared with the laparoscopic group, the robot group has less intraoperative blood loss and shorter postoperative hospital stay. The bilateral detection rate of SLN in the group was better than that of laparoscopy.

TI  - Stratification of lymph node metastases as macrometastases, micrometastases, or isolated tumor cells has no clinical implication in patients with cervical cancer: Subgroup analysis of the SCCAN project
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In cervical cancer, presence of lymph-node macrometastases (MAC) is a major prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment. However, since clinical impact of micrometastases (MIC) and isolated tumor-cells (ITC) remains controversial, we sought to identify a cut-off value for the metastasis size not associ-ated with negative prognosis.Methods. We analyzed data from 967 cervical cancer patients (T1a1L1-T2b) registered in the SCCAN (Surveil-lance in Cervical CANcer) database, who underwent primary surgical treatment, including sentinel lymph-node (SLN) biopsy with pathological ultrastaging. The size of SLN metastasis was considered a continuous variable and multiple testing was performed for cut-off values of 0.01-1.0 mm. Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared be-tween N0 and subgroups of N1 patients defined by cut-off ranges.Results. LN metastases were found in 172 (18%) patients, classified as MAC, MIC, and ITC in 79, 54, and 39 pa-tients, respectively. DFS was shorter in patients with MAC (HR 2.20, P = 0.003) and MIC (HR 2.87, P < 0.001), while not differing between MAC/MIC (P = 0.484). DFS in the ITC subgroup was neither different from N0 (P = 0.127) nor from MIC/MAC subgroups (P = 0.449). Cut-off analysis revealed significantly shorter DFS com-pared to N0 in all subgroups with metastases >= 0.4 mm (HR 2.311, P = 0.04). The significance of metastases <0.4 mm could not be assessed due to limited statistical power (<80%). We did not identify any cut-off for the size of metastasis with significantly better prognosis than the rest of N1 group.Conclusions. In cervical cancer patients, the presence of LN metastases >= 0.4 mm was associated with a signif-icant negative impact on DFS and no cut-off value for the size of metastasis with better prognosis than N1 was found. Traditional metastasis stratification based on size has no clinical implication.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Temperature as a likely driver shaping global patterns in mineralogical composition in bryozoans: implications for marine calcifiers under global change
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean is showing one of the most rapid responses to human-induced global change, thus acting as a sentinel of the effects on marine species and ecosystems. Ocean warming and acidification are already impacting benthic species with carbonate skeletons, but the magnitude of these changes to species and ecosystems remains largely unknown. Here we provide the largest carbonate mineralogical dataset to date for Southern Ocean bryozoans, which are diverse, abundant and important as carbonate producers, thus making them excellent for monitoring the effects of ocean warming and acidification. To improve our understanding of how bryozoans might respond to ocean warming and acidification, we assess latitudinal and seafloor temperature patterns of skeletal mineralogy using bryozoan species occurrences together with temperature data for the first time. Our findings, combining new mineralogical data with published data from warmer regions, show that the proportions of high-Mg calcite and bimineralic species increase significantly towards lower latitudes and with increasing seawater temperature. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that seawater temperature is likely a significant driver of variations in bryozoan mineralogy at a global scale.

TI  - Soil quality estimation using environmental covariates and predictive models: an example from tropical soils of Nigeria
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Information addressing soil quality in developing countries often depends on results from small experimental plots, which are later extrapolated to vast areas of agricultural land. This approach often results in misinformation to end-users of land for sustainable soil nutrient management. The objective of this study was to estimate the spatial variability of soil quality index (SQI) at regional scale with predictive models using soil-environmental covariates.Methods: A total of 110 composite soil samples (0-30 cm depth) were collected by stratified random sampling schemes at 2-5 km intervals across the Cross River State, Nigeria, and selected soil physical and chemical properties were determined. We employed environmental covariates derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) and Sentinel-2 imageries for our modelling regime. We measured soil quality using two approaches [total data set (TDS) and minimum data set (MDS)]. Two scoring functions were also applied, linear (L) and non-linear (NL), yielding four indices (MDS_L, MDS_NL,TDS_L, and TDS_NL). Eleven soil quality indicators were used as TDS and were further screened for MDS using principal component analysis (PCA). Random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), regression kriging (RK), Cubist regression, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were applied to predict SQI in unsampled locations.Results: The computed SQI via MDS_L was classified into five classes: <= 0.38, 0.38-0.48, 0.48-0.58, 0.58-0.68, and >= 0.68, representing very low (class V), low (class IV), moderate (class III), high (class II) and very high (class I) soil quality, respectively. GWR model was robust in predicting soil quality (R-2 =0.21, CCC= 0.39, RMSE =0.15), while RF was a model with inferior performance (R-2 =0.02, CCC= 0.32, RMSE = 0.15). Soil quality was high in the southern region and low in the northern region. High soil quality class (>49%) and moderate soil quality class (>14%) dominate the study area in all predicted models used.Conclusions: Structural stability index, sand content, soil oganic carbon content, and mean weight diameter of aggregates were the parameters used in establishing regional soil quality indices, while land surface water index, Sentinel-2 near-infrared band, plane curvature, and clay index were the most important variables affecting soil quality variability. The MDS_L and GWR are effective and useful models to identify the key soil properties for assessing soil quality, which can provide guidance for site-specific management of soils developed on diverse parent materials.

TI  - The role of protected areas co-management in enhancing resistance and resilience of deciduous forest ecosystem to extreme climatic events in Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to ongoing and projected climate change as well as increasing anthropogenic disturbances, the tropical deciduous forest has been experiencing a decline in its biomass and productivity. To mitigate this adverse effect, many tropical countries have adopted forest co-management engaging local communities. However, the effects of co-management on the resistance and resilience of forest ecosystems to extreme climatic events have rarely been tested. The present study investigates the effects of co-management on resistance and resilience to extreme climatic events in two major tropical deciduous forest protected areas of Bangladesh, namely Madhupur National Park (MNP) and Bhawal National Park (BNP), through remotely sensed satellite data. We used the Google Earth Engine platform to access the Landsat images from 1990 to 2020 for a comprehensive assessment of the forest cover condition under two major management regimes (i.e., traditional and co-management). We find that co-management slows down the rate of forest destruction, where the rate of forest destruction was 108 ha year(-1) in MNP and 121 ha year(-1) in BNP during the year 1990-2008 under traditional forest management system. Under the co-management regime, forest cover increased by 19 ha year(-1) and 41 ha year(-1) from 2009 to 2020 respectively in MNP and BNP. Our study finds a highly significant correlation between rainfall (p < 0.001) and forest health, although co-management had poor impacts on forest resistance and resilience in case of extreme climatic events, such as drought and heavy rainfall. We find, no significant impacts of co-management on resistance and resilience to drought in MNP, and on resistance and resilience to heavy rainfall in MNP and BNP. In BNP, the impacts of co-management on resistance (p < 0.05) and resilience (p < 0.01) of forest to drought were highly significant. Forest co-management although have the potentials to reduce the deforestation rate by mitigating anthropogenic disturbances, its capacity to tackle the adverse impact of climate change was limited in our study. An adaptive co-management model, therefore, is crucial for mainstreaming the adverse effect of climate change on the tropical deciduous forest to harness the maximum potential of community participation in forest resources management.

TI  - Interannual variability of ice cover in the Caspian Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data (SAR and Ocean Color), MERRA-2 reanalysis and records at Astrakhan meteorological station were used to investigate interannual variability of ice cover characteristics in the North Caspian Sea for 23 winter seasons (November 1 - April 15) from 1999/2000 to 2021/2022. The maximum annual ice cover area, ice freeze onset and melt dates and ice cover duration were determined from satellite remote sensing data, mostly SAR instruments on board the European Space Agency's satellites, ranging from ERS-2 to the Sentinel-1A, -1B tandem. We propose a new band combination for Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI that allows better distinguishing ice cover from clouds or land than the standard RGB composites. In the absence of SAR data, this method was used to estimate the above mentioned parameters with high spatial and temporal resolution. To assess the severity of winters, the criterion on the basis of the sum of freezing degree-days (SFDD) was applied. For this purpose, we used values of daily minimum air temperature over the North Caspian (44.46 degrees-47.14 degrees N, 46.70-52.90 degrees E), daily mean and daily minimum ones over its coldest eastern part (with the western border at 50 degrees E), obtained from the MERRA-2 reanalysis, as well as data from the meteorological station in Astrakhan (46.35 degrees N, 48.07 degrees E). The resulting SFDD sequences show that until the winter of 2011/2012, there was a cooling trend on average (with noticeable interannual variability), whereas after that winter it changed to warming for Astrakhan and virtually disappeared for the North Caspian and its eastern part. A noticeable interannual variability is also shown by the maximum ice area and the duration of the ice period, both parameters with maximums in the winter of 2011/2012. We discuss in detail the correspondence between the SFDD and ice cover characteristics variations, as well as previously published results. In agreement with the other authors, we find that in the 21st century, compared to the 20th century, the number of very severe and severe winters has decreased, while the number of mild winters has increased.

TI  - The Influence of Noise Intensity in the Nonlinear Spectral Unmixing of Hyperspectral Data
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Noise effect as an unwanted and troubler component was investigated in this study. It generally exists more or less in the remote sensing data because of the device errors and natural effects. Therefore, its correct estimation will lead to better analysis. This paper aims to examine the noise effect on selecting the spectral mixing model. A set of synthetic data was first designed based on one linear and five nonlinear models. Then, the noise was added to the data at different signal-to-noise (SNR) levels. After designing the models, to evaluate the noise intensity, it was determined using the noise estimation methods (multiple linear regression (MLR) based method and L1HyMixDe), assuming that each synthetic dataset stayed on the linear model. A comparison was made between the obtained noise values from the linear and each of the nonlinear models using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Wilcoxon statistical tests. According to the significant difference between the noise values of linear and nonlinear data in different SNR levels, an SNR limit was determined for each model and below this value, the noise overcomes the nonlinear portion of the data. As a result, Polynomial Post Nonlinear Mixing Model (PPNMM) shows the best performance in the nonlinear unmixing of data in the presence of noise. This study was tested on real Hyperion data and the obtained results agreed with our assessments.

TI  - Evaluating the accuracy of gridded water resources reanalysis and evapotranspiration products for assessing water security in poorly gauged basins
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving water security in poorly gauged basins is critically hindered by a lack of in situ river discharge data to assess past, current, and future evolution of water resources. To overcome this challenge, there has been a shift toward the use of freely available satellite and reanalysis data products. However, due to inherent bias and uncertainty, these secondary sources require careful evaluation to ascertain their performance before being applied in poorly gauged basins. The objectives of this study were to evaluate river discharge and evapotranspiration estimates from eight gridded water resources reanalysis (WRR), six satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET) products, and ET estimates derived from complimentary relationship (CR-ET) across eight river basins located in Central-West Africa. Results highlight strengths and weaknesses of the different WRR in simulating discharge dynamics and ET across the basins. Likewise, satellite-based products also show some strength and weaknesses in simulating monthly ET. Our results further revealed that the performance of the different models in simulating river discharge and evapotranspiration is strongly influenced by model structure, input data, and spatial resolution. Considering all hydrological model evaluation criteria, FLDAS-Noah, Lisflood, AWRAL, and Terra were among the best performing WRR products while for ET estimates, FLDAS-Noah, Terra, GLEAM3.5a and 3.5b, and PMLV2 outperformed the rest of the products. Given the plethora of WRR and ET products available, it is imperative to evaluate their performance in representative gauged basins to identify products that can be applied in each region. However, the choice of a particular product will depend on the application and user requirements. Taking this together, results from this study suggest that gridded WRR and ET products are a useful source of data for assessing water security in poorly gauged basins.

TI  - Egalitarian! - but for whom? Racist images of man and their construction in French lexicography of the 19th century
T2  - LEXICOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - By analyzing three widely used French dictionaries in the second half of the 19th century, whose authors (Bescherelle, Lachatre, and Littre) in the broadest sense belonged to the liberal spectrum of their time, the present article investigates the spread of racist images of humanity. The questions addressed to selected lemmas (such as homme, race or noir, semite or juif) are: 1. Which human races were constructed and categorized? 2. Were unchangeable characteristics ascribed to these races? 3. Was a hierarchy of human races asserted? 4. How were these differences explained? And 5. Were there any racial political claims? The aim is to show that the thinking not only of conservative liberals, but also of early socialist democrats and conservative republicans was contaminated by racist ideas, but that there was no explicit racist or anti-Semitic worldview in the case of any of the three dictionaries.

TI  - Exploring Potential Bellwethers for Drug-Related Mortality in the General Population: A Case for Sentinel Surveillance of Trends in Drug Use among Nightclub/Festival Attendees
T2  - SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Drug-related deaths in the US continue to increase. Sentinel surveillance of high-risk populations can provide early warning for shifts in trends. Nightclub/festival attendees have high levels of drug use, so we explored whether use among this population can serve as a potential bellwether or indicator for use-related mortality in the general population.Methods: Trends in past-year cocaine and methamphetamine use were estimated from nightclub/festival attendees in New York City (NYC) and among NY residents, and trends were estimated for related death rates in NYC (2014/15-2019/20). Using national data from England and Wales (2010-2019), trends in past-year cocaine and ecstasy use (among the full population and among nightclub attendees) and related deaths were also estimated.Results: In NY/NYC, cocaine use remained stable in the general population, but use among nightclub/festival attendees and cocaine-related deaths doubled. Methamphetamine use among nightclub/festival attendees and death rates also more than doubled while use among the general population remained stable. In UK countries, increases in cocaine and ecstasy use were larger for infrequent/frequent nightclub attendees than in the general population, with 3.6- and 8-fold increases in related deaths, respectively. In UK countries, the association between nightclub attendance and death rates increased in a dose-response-like manner with larger associations detected when death rates were lagged by one year.Conclusions: Patterns of use among nightclub/festival attendees, more so than patterns in the general population, were similar to patterns of drug-related deaths. Use among this subpopulation could possibly serve as a bellwether for use-related outcomes. Continued surveillance is recommended.

T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In clinically node-negative breast cancer patients, the INSEMA trial (NCT02466737) assessed the non-inferiority of avoiding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Here we present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as a secondary endpoint.Methods PROs were assessed for patients with no axillary surgery, SLNB alone, and ALND. Quality of life (QoL) questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 and its breast cancer module (BR23) were used at baseline (pre-surgery) and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery. The QoL scores were compared using repeated measures mixed models based on the safety set.Findings Between 2015 and 2019, 5502 patients were recruited for the first randomization, and 5154 were included in the intent-to-treat set (4124 SLNB versus 1030 no SLNB). In the case of one to three macrometastases after SLNB, 485 patients underwent second randomization (242 SLNB alone versus 243 ALND). Questionnaire completion response remained high throughout the trial: over 70% at all time points for the first randomization. There were significant differences for the BRBS (breast symptoms) and BRAS (arm symptoms) scores favoring the no SLNB group in all post-baseline assessments. Patients in the SLNB group showed significantly and clinically relevant higher scores for BRAS (differences in mean values >= 5.0 points at all times), including pain, arm swelling, and impaired mobility in all postoperative visits, with the highest difference at one month after surgery. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 questionnaire revealed no relevant differences between the treatment groups, although some comparisons were statistically significant.Interpretation This is one of the first randomized trials investigating the omission of SLNB in clinically node-negative patients and the first to report comprehensive QoL data. Patients with no SLNB benefitted regarding arm symptoms / functioning, while no relevant differences in other scales were seen. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Cherry Tomato Crop Management Under Irrigation Levels: Morphometric Characteristics and Their Relationship with Fruit Production and Quality
T2  - GESUNDE PFLANZEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Cherry tomato is one of the most cultivated crops in greenhouse, due to its morphological and organoleptic characteristics. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the morphometric and productive characteristics and the total soluble solids content of the cherry tomato crop, submitted to irrigation depths. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in a completely randomized design, with 4 irrigation depths, 50, 75, 100, and 125% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with 10 replications, totaling 40 experimental plots. Applications of irrigation depths were performed using a drip system. The following characteristics of cherry tomatoes were determined: plant height (HP), stem diameter (SD), number of fruits (NF), fruit diameter (FD), fruit length (FL), fruit weight (FW), total soluble solids (degrees Brix) of the juice, yield (FY) and water use efficiency (WUE). Data were subjected to descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), principal component correlation (PCC, using Pearson's correlation), and multivariate regression models were established. The coefficient of variation (CV) was high for all treatments for the variables NF, FW, FY, and WUE. The treatment of 50% of ETc presented the highest averages for degrees Brix, because the water deficit increases fruit quality (> degrees Brix), on the other hand, the lowest FY was observed. In PCA, there was the formation of 3 distinct groups, group 1 (NF, FW, FY, and WUE); group 2 (HP and SD); group 3 composed only of degrees Brix. The best results obtained in the production of cherry tomatoes were for an irrigation depth of 100% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with the best range of water use efficiency for 50 and 100% of ETc. The model established to determine cherry tomato production and water use efficiency proved to be effective and with satisfactory adjustments and validations.

TI  - Assessment of H SAF satellite snow products in hydrological applications over the Upper Euphrates Basin
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite technology offers alternative products for hydrological applications; however, products should be validated with benchmark models and/or data sets for operational purposes. This study assesses the performance of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H SAF) snow products of snow detection, SE-E-SEVIRI(H10), and snow water equivalent, SWE-E(H13), data sets over a mountainous catchment in the Upper Euphrates, Turkey. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow extent is used as a benchmark. Two different conceptual hydrological models are employed to obtain reliable results over the period 2008-2020. First, the spatio-temporal assessment of satellite-derived snow cover area (SCA) data is evaluated, followed by the calibration/validation of hydrological models, SRM and HBV, for impact analysis and hydro-validation of satellite snow products, respectively. SRM, demanding SCA as one of the primary forcings, reveals high Kling Gupta Efficiency, KGE, (0.75-0.89) in the impact analysis of satellite data. In hydro-validation analysis, noteworthy Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE (0.89-0.92), values are obtained for SCA derived by SE-E-SEVIRI(H10) and MODIS as compared to simulated HBV model results. SWE-E(H13) product is also valuable since snow water equivalent (SWE) values are rarely available for mountainous areas. However, this product seems to need further attention. Overall results show the degree of applicability and usefulness of H SAF snow data in hydrological applications; thus, the strong need to disseminate the products is highlighted.

TI  - [Clinical application of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node mapping in early staged cervical cancer].
T2  - Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early-staged cervical cancer by laparoscopy. Methods: It was a prospective, single-arm, single-center clinical study. Seventy-eight cases of cervical cancer patients were collected from July 2015 to December 2018 at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University. All the patients were injected with tracer into the disease-free block of cervical tissue after anesthesia by the same surgeon who learned sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping technique in Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and underwent SLN mapping followed by complete pelvic lymphadenectomy. Moreover, all the dissected lymph nodes were stained with hematoxylin eosin staining (HE) pathological examination. Besides, the negative SLN on hematoxylin-eosin staining were detected by immunohistochemistry cytokeratin staining micro-metastasis. To analyze the distribution, detection rate, false negative rate the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the SLN in early-staged cervical cancer by laparoscopy, and explore the value of SLN mapping in predicting the lymph nodes metastasis in early-staged cervical cancer. Results: The overall detection rate of SLN in cervical cancer was 99% (77/78), bilateral detection rate was 87% (68/78). The average of 12.4 lymph node (LN) and 3.6 SLN were dissected for each patients each side. SLN of cervical cancer were mainly distributed in the obturator space (61.5%, 343/558), followed by external iliac (23.5%, 131/558), common iliac (7.3%, 41/558), para-uterine (3.8%, 21/558), internal iliac (2.2%, 12/558), para abdominal aorta (1.1%, 6/558), and anterior sacral lymphatic drainage area (0.7%, 4/558). Fourteen cases of LN metastasis were found among all 78 cases. There were a total of 38 positive LN, including 26 SLN metastasis and 12 none sentinel LN metastasis. Through immunohistochemical staining and pathological ultra-staging, 1 SLN was found to be isolated tumor cells (ITC), and 5 SLNs were found to be micro-metastases (MIC), accounting for 23% (6/26) of positive SLN. SLN mapping with pathological ultra-staging improved the prediction of LN metastasis in cervical cancer (2/14). Metastatic SLN mainly distributed in the obturator space (65%, 17/26), peri-uterine region (12%, 3/26), common iliac region (15%, 4/26), and external iliac region (8%, 2/26). The consistency of the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis by SLN biopsy and postoperative retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis showed that the Kappa value was 1.000 (P<0.001), indicated that the metastasis status of SLN and retroperitoneal lymph node were completely consistent. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false-negative rate, and negative predictive value of SLN biopsy in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis were 100%, 100%, 100%, 0, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: SLN in early-staged cervical cancer patients were mainly distributed in the obturator and external iliac space, pathalogical ultra-staging of SLN could improve the prediction of LN metastasis. Intraoperative SLN mapping is safe, feasible and could predict the state of retroperitoneal LN metastasis in early-staged cervical cancer. SLNB may replace systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy.
AB  - 目的： 探讨前哨淋巴结（SLN）活检技术在早期子宫颈癌腹腔镜手术中的应用。 方法： 本研究是一项前瞻性、单臂、单中心的临床研究，入组时间为2015年7月，截止时间为2018年12月，共入组了在河北医科大学第四医院诊治的78例初治的早期子宫颈癌患者，其年龄为（50.2±9.3）岁。所有患者均于麻醉后在无瘤块的子宫颈组织处采用浅注射（2~3 mm）、深注射（1~2 cm）法注射示踪剂（亚甲蓝或纳米炭），随后在腹腔镜下先行蓝染或黑染的SLN切除，再行子宫广泛性切除+系统性盆腔淋巴结切除±腹主动脉旁淋巴结切除术，术后对常规病理检查（HE染色）阴性的SLN行连续切片联合免疫组化法细胞角蛋白检测进行病理超分期检查。分析SLN的检出率、SLN的分布、SLN与非SLN的病理检查结果，评价SLN活检诊断淋巴结转移的效能。 结果： （1）SLN的检出率：78例子宫颈癌患者中，77例检出SLN，SLN总检出率为99%（77/78），其中SLN双侧检出率为87%（68/78）、单侧检出率为12%（9/78）。（2）SLN的分布：78例子宫颈癌患者共切除盆腔淋巴结1 930枚，平均每例患者每侧切除盆腔淋巴结12.4枚；其中77例检出SLN的患者共切除SLN 558枚，平均每例患者每侧切除SLN 3.6枚。子宫颈癌SLN主要分布于闭孔区（61.5%，343/558），其后依次为髂外（23.5%，131/558）、髂总（7.3%，41/558）、宫旁（3.8%，21/558）、髂内（2.2%，12/558）、腹主动脉旁（1.1%，6/558）和骶前区（0.7%，4/558）。（3）SLN与非SLN的病理检查结果：78例子宫颈癌患者中，术后淋巴结转移患者14例（18%，14/78），共38枚转移淋巴结，其中SLN转移26枚、非SLN转移12枚。26枚转移SLN中，6枚为SLN低体积转移，包括1枚孤立肿瘤细胞转移（ITC）、5枚微小转移（MIC），占转移SLN的23%（6/26）；其余20枚为宏转移。14例术后淋巴结转移患者中，12例术后通过HE染色检测到淋巴结转移，2例通过病理超分期检测到淋巴结MIC，病理超分期检查后淋巴结转移检出率提高了2/14。转移SLN主要分布在闭孔（65%，17/26）、髂总（15%，4/26）、宫旁（12%，3/26）、髂外区（8%，2/26）。（4）SLN活检技术诊断淋巴结转移与术后腹膜后淋巴结转移状态的一致性Kappa检验显示，Kappa值为1.000（P<0.001），表示SLN活检结果与腹膜后淋巴结的转移状态完全一致。SLN活检技术诊断淋巴结转移的敏感度为100%，特异度为100%，准确率为100%，假阴性率为0，阳性预测值为100%，阴性预测值为100%。 结论： 早期子宫颈癌SLN主要分布在闭孔及髂外区域，SLN的病理超分期检查可提高淋巴结低体积转移的检出率。早期子宫颈癌腹腔镜手术中行SLN活检是安全、可行的，SLN活检可代替系统性淋巴结切除术。.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the feasibility and clinical value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy through cervix-uterine combined two-step injection with two tracers in patients with early stage endometrial cancer. Methods: From July 2019 to April 2021, a total of 73 patients, aged (54.2±3.3) year, who were preoperatively diagnosed as stage Ⅰ-Ⅱ endometrial cancer (including 56 low-risk patients and 17 medium-high risk patients) in Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University were selected. According to the different sites of tracer injection, the patients were randomly divided into three groups: cervical injection group (25 cases): 1 ml of nano-carbon was used to inject at 3 and 9 o'clock in the cervix; uterine injection group (21 cases): the magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed to determine the location of the lesion, and 4 ml of methylene blue was injected into the uterine body at 2 sites where the lesion was located; combined injection group (27 cases): cervical injection of nano-carbon (1 ml) combined with uterine injection of methylene blue (4 ml). The SLN in all patients were identified under laparoscopy, removed, and followed by frozen pathological examination. Pathological ultra-staging was performed if the postoperative pathological outcome of SLN was negative. The total detection rate of SLN, bilateral pelvic SLN detection rate, sensitivity, negative predictive value, and location of SLN in each group were calculated and compared. Results: (1) In 73 patients with endometrial cancer, the overall detection rate of SLN was 88% (64/73), the detection rate of bilateral pelvic SLN was 67% (49/73), and the detection rate of para-aortic SLN was 49% (36/73). The overall detection rate of SLN (71%, 15/21) and bilateral pelvic SLN (43%, 9/21) in the intrauterine injection group were significantly lower than those in the cervical injection group [92% (23/25), 76% (19/25), respectively] and the combined injection group [96% (26/27), 78% (21/27), respectively; all P<0.05]; the detection rate of para-aortic SLN in the cervical injection group (28%, 7/25) was significantly lower than those in the intrauterine injection group and combined injection group [52% (11/21) and 67% (18/27), respectively; both P<0.05]. Among 73 cases with endometrial cancer, 9 had lymph node metastasis confirmed by postoperative pathological examination, 8 of them had lymph node metastasis detected by SLN and 1 had no lymph node metastasis detected by SLN, with a total sensitivity of 89% and a negative predictive value of 98%. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of cervical injection group and combined injection group were 100%, while the sensitivity and negative predictive value of intrauterine injection group were 67% and 95%. Among 56 low-risk patients, only one patient with lymph node metastasis was confirmed by postoperative pathology by SLN detection, and the metastasis rate was 2% (1/56), and the sensitivity and negative predictive value were 100%. Lymph node metastasis was confirmed in 8 of 17 patients (8/17) with a sensitivity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 90%. (2) A total of 459 SLN were detected in 73 endometrial cancer patients, with the highest proportion of external iliac (33.3%, 153/459).The obturator foramen was 25.3% (116/459), para-aortic 19.6% (90/459), iliac 12.0% (55/459), and presacral 9.8% (45/459). The proportion of para-aortic SLN in the cervical injection group was 12.4% (21/169), which were significantly lower than that in the intrauterine injection group and the combined injection group [27.4% (26/95) and 22.1% (43/195), respectively; both P<0.05]. (3) Pathological super-staging results: among 64 patients with negative SLN routine paraffin pathology, 4 cases of lymph node micro-metastases and 1 case of isolated tumor cell metastasis were detected, and the SLN micro-metastases rate was 8% (5/64), including 2 cases of low-risk patients and 3 cases of medium-high risk patients. Conclusions: SLN biopsy has high sensitivity and negative predictive value in patients with early endometrial cancer and could be used as an alternative to systematic lymph node dissection in low-risk patients. The SLN mapping through cervical-uterine combined injection could further improve the detection rate effectively and avoid the missed detection of positive para-aortic lymph node, especially for high-risk patients or patients with fundal tumor involvement.
AB  - 目的： 探讨在早期子宫内膜癌患者中应用两种示踪剂通过子宫颈、子宫体联合注射（即两步法双示踪）进行前哨淋巴结（SLN）活检的可行性及临床价值。 方法： 选择2019年7月至2021年4月在青岛大学附属医院因术前诊断为早期（Ⅰ~Ⅱ期）子宫内膜癌行手术治疗的患者共73例，其年龄为（54.2±3.3）岁；其中低危型56例，中高危型17例。按示踪剂注射部位不同随机（直接抽样法）分为3组：宫颈注射组（25例）：纳米炭1 ml于子宫颈3点和9点注射；宫体注射组（21例）：盆腔磁共振成像（MRI）检查确定病灶部位，亚甲蓝4 ml于病灶所在的子宫体部位分2点注射；联合注射组（27例）：子宫颈注射纳米炭（1 ml）联合子宫体注射亚甲蓝（4 ml）。所有患者均在腹腔镜下完成子宫内膜癌分期手术，若术后病理检查SLN为阴性则进一步行病理超分期检查。比较3组子宫内膜癌患者的SLN检出率、SLN分布部位及SLN病理超分期检查结果，并计算3组SLN诊断淋巴结转移的敏感度、阴性预测值。 结果： （1）SLN检出率：73例子宫内膜癌患者中，SLN总检出率为88%（64/73），双侧盆腔SLN检出率为67%（49/73），腹主动脉旁SLN检出率为49%（36/73）。宫体注射组的SLN总检出率（71%，15/21）、双侧盆腔SLN检出率（43%，9/21）均显著低于宫颈注射组［分别为92%（23/25）、76%（19/25）］、联合注射组［分别为96%（26/27）、78%（21/27）；P均<0.05］；宫颈注射组的腹主动脉旁SLN检出率（28%，7/25）显著低于宫体注射组、联合注射组［分别为52%（11/21）、67%（18/27）；P均<0.05］。73例子宫内膜癌患者中，术后病理检查证实淋巴结转移者9例，其中8例SLN阳性、1例SLN未检测出淋巴结转移，SLN检测诊断子宫内膜癌患者淋巴结转移的总敏感度为89%、阴性预测值为98%；其中宫颈注射组和联合注射组的敏感度和阴性预测值均为100%，宫体注射组的敏感度为67%，阴性预测值95%。56例低危型患者中，仅1例SLN阳性患者术后病理证实淋巴结转移，转移率为2%（1/56），SLN检测诊断低危型患者淋巴结转移的敏感度和阴性预测值均为100%。17例中高危型患者中，8例（8/17）术后证实淋巴结转移，包括7例SLN阳性和1例SLN阴性患者，SLN检测诊断中高危型患者淋巴结转移的敏感度为88%、阴性预测值90%。（2）SLN分布部位：73例子宫内膜癌患者共检出SLN 459枚，显影比例最高的部位为髂外33.3%（153/459），其次为闭孔25.3%（116/459）、腹主动脉旁19.6%（90/459）、髂总12.0%（55/459）和骶前9.8%（45/459）。宫颈注射组腹主动脉旁SLN占12.4%（21/169），显著低于宫体注射组和联合注射组［分别为27.4%（26/95）、22.1%（43/195）；P均<0.05］。（3）病理超分期检查结果：64例SLN常规石蜡病理为阴性的患者中，检出4例淋巴结微小转移和1例孤立肿瘤细胞转移，SLN低体积转移（包括微小转移和孤立肿瘤细胞转移）率为8%（5/64），其中低危型患者2例，中高危型患者3例。 结论： SLN示踪对早期子宫内膜癌患者具有较高的敏感度和阴性预测值，可作为低危型患者系统性淋巴结切除术的替代方案。两步法双示踪可以进一步提高SLN的检出率，尤其可以有效避免腹主动脉旁阳性SLN的漏检，对于中高危型或肿瘤累及宫底部的患者推荐使用。.

TI  - RSEIFE: A new remote sensing ecological index for simulating the land surface eco-environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology, significant progress has been made in the evaluation of the eco-environment. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is one of the most widely used indices for the comprehensive evaluation of eco-environmental quality. This index is entirely based on remote sensing data and can monitor eco-environmental aspects quickly for a large area. However, the use of RSEI has some limitations. For example, its application is generally not uniform, the obtained results are stochastic in nature, and its calculation process cannot consider all ecological elements (especially the water element). In spite of the widespread application of the RSEI, improvements to its limitations are scarce. In this paper, we propose a new index named the remote sensing ecological index considering full elements (RSEIFE). The proposed RSEIFE is compared with commonly used evaluation models such as RSEI and RSEILA (Remote Sensing Ecological Index with Local Adaptability) in several types of study areas to assess the stability and accuracy of our model. The results show that the calculation process of RSEIFE is more stable than those of RSEI and RSEILA, and the results of RSEIFE are consistent with the real eco-environment surface and reveal more details about its features. Meanwhile, compared with RSEI and RSEILA, the results of RSEIFE effectively reveal the ecological benefits of both water bodies themselves and their surrounding environments, which lead to more accurate and compre-hensive basis for the implementation of environmental protection policies.

TI  - Monitoring the extreme flood events in the Yangtze River basin based on GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its successor GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite provide terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) estimates globally that can be used to monitor flood in various regions at monthly intervals. However, the coarse temporal resolution of GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite data has been limiting their applications at finer temporal scales. In this study, TWSA estimates have been reconstructed and then temporally downscaled into daily values based on three different learning-based models, namely a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, a long-short term memory (LSTM) model and a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. Furthermore, a new index incorporating temporally downscaled TWSA estimates combined with daily average precipitation anomalies is proposed to monitor the severe flood events at sub-monthly timescales for the Yangtze River basin (YRB), China. The results indicated that (1) the MLP model shows the best performance in reconstructing the monthly TWSA with root mean square error (RMSE) = 10.9 mm per month and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.89 during the validation period; (2) the MLP model can be useful in temporally downscaling monthly TWSA estimates into daily values; (3) the proposed normalized daily flood potential index (NDFPI) facilitates robust and reliable characterization of severe flood events at sub-monthly timescales; (4) the flood events can be monitored by the proposed NDFPI earlier than traditional streamflow observations with respect to the YRB and its individual subbasins. All these findings can provide new opportunities for applying GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite data to investigations of sub-monthly signals and have important implications for flood hazard prevention and mitigation in the study region.

TI  - Improving leaf chlorophyll content estimation through constrained PROSAIL model from airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll plays an important role in forest management and ecosystem balance. Hyperspectral images have been widely applied in leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) estimation. However, the complexity of canopy structures, such as leaf area index (LAI), weakens the performance of LCC estimation from hyperspectral images. The effect of LAI must be considered. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has advantages in LAI extraction. Therefore, this study theoretically and experimentally explored the potential of integrating the hyperspectral image and LiDAR data to improve LCC estimation. The PROSAIL model constrained by LiDAR-derived LAI was developed when the hyperspectral image was applied to LCC estimation. Theoretical evaluation and experimental validation were conducted to determine the performance of constrained PROSAIL models with four minimization algorithms. Four minimization algorithms included the fminsearchbnd, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm and Pareto sets. Three datasets were used: the synthetic dataset followed a uniform distribution, the synthetic dataset followed a normal distribution, and the airborne sensor dataset (airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data). The non-constrained PROSAIL model was as a comparison. Results showed the effectiveness of the constrained PROSAIL model through integrating hyperspectral and LiDAR data for the improvement of LCC estimation. The constrained PROSAIL model always had better performance than non-constrained PROSAIL model among all datasets and minimization algorithms. It demonstrated that constrained PROSAIL model with LAI constraint could improve the accuracy of LCC estimation, where the R2 could be increased by 10% to 29%, and 9% to 62% for the synthetic datasets and airborne sensor dataset, respectively. The constrained PROSAIL model with Pareto sets had the best accuracy with an R2 of 0.81 from airborne sensor dataset. This study provides a new strategy for the improvement of LCC estimation and has great potential to serve precision forestry.

TI  - Low-cost solutions incorporated in a standard surgical pathway for early breast cancer: A pilot study
T2  - TROPICAL DOCTOR
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the results of incorporation of low-cost solutions to provide a standard surgical care for early breast cancer (EBC) patients. This surgical pathway consists of a low-cost vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using low-cost methylene blue and fluorescin dyes under local anesthesia and oncoplastic breast surgery. Patients assessed as clinically node-negative axilla underwent such treatment. SLNB using low-cost dyes was performed without any complication. Oncoplastic surgical techniques were opted for in 32 patients, and the lumps were all excised with a similar to 1-cm all-around margin on the final histopathological examination. Standard breast cancer surgery can be provided in low-resource settings to eligible EBC patients with low-cost solutions.

TI  - Estimating soil salinity using Gaofen-2 imagery: A novel application of combined spectral and textural features
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-2 (GF-2) imagery data has been playing an important role in environmental monitoring. However, the scarcity of spectral bands makes GF-2 difficult to use in soil salinity estimation. In this paper, we combined spectral and textual features for soil salinity estimation from GF-2 imagery. The spectral features comprised five classes of predictors: spectral value, vegetation index, salinity index, brightness index, and intensity index. Four gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) indices were used as the textural features. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was applied to select features. Four methods, namely, Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were applied and compared. To this end, 211 soil samples were collected in the Yellow River Delta through field investigation. The results showed that GF-2 imagery could successfully estimate soil salinity by integrating spectral and texture features, and among the four methods, the RF had the highest accuracy with the determination coefficient for cross-validation (R2CV), a root mean square error for cross-validation (RMSECV), and the ratio of the standard deviation to the root mean square error of prediction (RPD) of 0.82, 2.36 g kg-1, and 2.28, respectively. Especially, the impact of different scale features on the soil salinity estimation accuracy was evaluated. The optimal window size for features was 9 x 9 pixels, and increasing or decreasing the window size will decrease the estimation accuracy. The study provides a novel application to soil salinity estimation from remote sensing imagery.

TI  - High contamination of a sentinel vertebrate species by azoles in vineyards: a study of common blackbirds (<i>Turdus merula</i>) in multiple habitats in western France
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Azoles represent the most used family of organic fungicides worldwide and they are used in agriculture to circumvent the detrimental impact of fungi on yields. Although it is known that these triazoles can contaminate the air, the soil, and the water, field data are currently and dramatically lacking to assess if, and to what extent, the use of triazoles could contaminate non-target wild vertebrate species, notably in agroecosystems. In this study, we aimed to document for the first time the degree of blood contamination of a generalist wild bird species by multiple azoles which are used for plant protection and fungi pest control in various habitats. We deployed passive air samplers and captured 118 Common blackbirds (Turdus merula) in an agroecosystem (vineyard), a protected forest, and a city in western France. We collected blood and analyzed the plasma levels of 13 triazoles and 2 imidazoles. We found that a significant percentage of blackbirds living in vineyards have extremely high plasma levels of multiple azoles (means (pg.g(-1)); tebuconazole: 149.23, difenoconazole: 44.27, fenbuconazole: 239.38, tetraconazole: 1194.16), while contamination was very limited in the blackbirds from the protected forest and absent in urban blackbirds. Interestingly, we also report that the contamination of blackbirds living in vineyard was especially high at the end of Spring and the beginning of Summer and this matches perfectly with the results from the passive air samplers (i.e., high levels of azoles in the air of vineyards during June and July). However, we did not find any correlation between the levels of plasma contamination by azoles and two simple integrative biomarkers of health (feather density and body condition) in this sentinel species. Future experi-mental studies are now needed to assess the potential sub-lethal effects of such levels of contamination on the physiology of non-target vertebrate species.

TI  - Resolving one of the holy grails of catalysis: Direct nonoxidative methane conversion to ethylene over plasma-assisted atomically dispersed Pt catalyst
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the holy grails of catalysis -direct nonoxidative methane conversion to ethylene is resolved in this study using dielectric barrier discharge plasma (DBDP) assisted catalysis. Motivated by the formation of ethane and very low amount of ethylene in the DBDP over acid or base treated kaolin supported Ni and oxalate ligand functionalized Ni in CO2 reforming of methane wherein Ni catalysts that were calcined at 800 degrees C showing higher methane conversion (XCH4), ethylene to ethane (C2 = /C2-) ratio, and hydrogen yield (YH2). A novel CeO2 confined atomically dispersed Pt supported on oxalate ligand functionalized Cu modified zeolite Y catalyst (PtCe/CuX-ZY) was synthesized to exhibit strong-metal-support interaction, which rendered the d-band center far away from the Fermi level, densification, and localization of d electrons thus weakening the adsorption of C2H4 upon formation to prevent subsequent hydrogenation to ethane. The novel PtCe/CuX-ZY catalyst showed an impressively high average XCH4, YC2H4, and YH2 of 73.5%, 23.9%, and 33.8%, respectively with a high C2 = /C2- ratio of ca. 12.3 compared to an average of 0.032 observed over Ni-based catalysts. This finding is impressive and opened up a further investigation in both academia and the industry.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Suspected coastal reclamation areas detection by spatiotemporal fusion of landsat TM and Sentinel-1A: A case study of Fuzhou, Fujian, China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing coastal reclamation activities have been undertaken to alleviate the shortage of land resources, posing significant challenges to the coordination of coastal reclamation, economic development and environmental protection. Over the past few decades, coastal reclamation has occurred extensively in the coastal region of China, especially the east coast, while the value of coastal wetlands and ecosystems has only been well under-stood and appreciated in the last decade. More recently, there is an important new trend to restore parts of reclaimed land to coastal wetlands for environmental protection purposes, which requires reliable reclamation detection results as a foundation for policy. This study aimed to propose a reclamation detection framework based on the spatiotemporal fusion of Landsat TM and Sentinel-1A. To utilize the complementary information of optical and SAR images, the proposed framework models the common and proprietary information of both types of data separately in a sparse manner. Then, with more reliable and detailed information, reclamation areas can be distinguished by band math and threshold segmentation using the spatiotemporal fusion of Landsat TM and Sentinel-1A images. Finally, taking Fuzhou in eastern China as an example, we provided a detailed analysis of coastal reclamation. The results confirmed that the proposed algorithm was effective for rapidly detecting sus-pected locations of coastal reclamation and showed great potential for monitoring the changes occurring in the coastal zone.

TI  - Interactions between anchovy fisheries and Peruvian boobies revealed by bird-borne cameras and movement loggers
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fisheries threaten marine predator populations through bycatch and competition for the same resources, but may also provide feeding opportunities. Understanding benefits and mitigating impacts, therefore, requires a detailed understanding of fishery interactions. The Humboldt Current system supports the world's largest single-species fishery (Peruvian anchoveta Engraulis ringens), along with abundant marine predators dependent on these forage fish, including seabirds. We combined bird-borne video cameras and GPS-acceleration-dive loggers to quantify the foraging behaviour of chick-rearing Peruvian boobies Sula variegata around Isla Macabi, Peru, in December 2020 and May 2021. Videos revealed that 18% of 77 Peruvian booby foraging trips included feeding at actively fishing purse seine vessels, diving in and around the nets. Most vessel interactions were close to the colony, and we found no difference in foraging effort (e.g. trip duration) between trips with and without vessel interactions. We recorded fishing effort in the foraging range of the colony using remotely sensed data from the vessel monitoring system accessed via Global Fishing Watch, finding more frequent interactions and catch depredation when fishing effort was high near the colony. We found no evidence that birds expended additional energy (e.g. dynamic body acceleration) or travelled to different locations to reach vessels. We emphasise the value of combining high-resolution movement and video loggers with remotely sensed fisheries data to monitor seabird-fishery interactions in detail, rather than just spatio-temporal overlap, and assess the potential for competition and bycatch. Threatened seabird populations may benefit from no-take zones or reduced fishing effort in core foraging areas of colonies.

TI  - Trace metals exposure in three different coastal compartments show specific morphological and reproductive traits across generations in a sentinel copepod
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of exposure from several compartments of the environment at the level of individuals was rarely investigated. This study reports the effect of contaminants from varied compartments like sediment resuspension, elutriation from re-suspended sediment (extract) and seawater spiked trace metal mixtures (TM) on morphological and reproductive traits of the pelagic bioindicator copepod Eurytemora affinis. At the population level of E. affinis, lowest survival was observed in dissolved exposures (TM and extract) in the first generation (G1), showing some adaptation in the second generation (G2). An opposite trend for resuspended sediment showed higher sensitivity in survival at G2. At the individual level, prosome length and volume proved to be sensitive parameters for resuspended sediments, whereas clutch size and egg diameter were more sensitive to TM and extract. Although the generation of decontamination (G3, no exposure), showed a significant recovery at the population level (survival % along with clutch size) of E. affinis exposed to resuspended sed-iment, morphological characteristics like prosome length and volume showed no such recovery (lower than control, p < 0.05). To the contrary, dissolved exposure showed no significant recovery from G1 to G3 on neither survival %, clutch size, egg diameter, prosome volume, but an increase of prosome length (p < 0.05). Such tradeoffs in combatting the stress from varied sources of toxicity were observed in all exposures, from G1 to G3. The number of lipid droplets inside the body cavity of E. affinis showed a significant positive correlation with trace metal bioaccumulation (p < 0.01) along with a negative correlation (p < 0.05) with survival and clutch size in each treatment. This confirms the inability of co-pepods to utilize lipids under stressful conditions. Our study tenders certain morphological and reproductive markers that show specificity to different compartments of exposure, promising an advantage in risk assessment and fish feed studies.

TI  - Modelling and Remote Sensing of Oil Spill in the Mediterranean Sea: A Case Study on Baniyas Power Plant Oil Spill
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An oil leakage occurred from one of the fuel tanks at the Baniyas thermal station as a result of cracks and wear that led to the leakage of fuel on August 23, 2021. The oil entered into the Mediterranean Sea, and travelled a path toward Cyprus port by the month of September. These spills are observed on a set of periodic Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired between August 24 and September 5, 2021. The oil spill trajectory is tracked using a simplistic mathematical model based on the random walk technique. Wind and ocean current information on the selected study region with 1 Hr. temporal resolution is used to input the model. Accuracy of prediction by the proposed model is evaluated using two performance metrics: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Centroid Skill Score (CSS). The simulated trajectory is in good agreement with that observed in the periodic Sentinel-1 images of the oil spill incident.

TI  - Towards real-time detection of ships and wakes with lightweight deep learning model in Gaofen-3 SAR images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for achieving accurate and efficient monitoring of maritime traffic by identifying ships and wakes. Ship wake can not only assist in ship detection, but also invert ship navigation information, which has attracted wide attention. However, most of the work on ship wake detection is still through non-deep learning methods. Limited by factors such as unclear features, complex background interference and insufficient label information in large-scale SAR images, deep learning methods have developed slowly in the field of ship wake detection. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning network for ship and wake detection. In the framework, a YOLO structure based deep learning is implemented to achieve ship and wake classification and localization. For this purpose, we initially create a Gaofen-3 SAR dataset containing about 1000 pairs of ships and wakes. To streamline the deep learning network, based on the background and pixel characteristics of SAR images, we design a combined convolutional module in combination with an attention mechanism, which replaces the convolutional layers in the backbone to extract more diverse feature maps at a low cost. In addition, in view of the geometric features of ship wake, the optimized design is conducted in the target prediction stage, and the angle-related loss function is developed to guide the training of the network, which not only ensures the detection of the ship target, but also greatly improves the accuracy of wake line detection. Experimental results show that the developed lightweight network achieves accurate and stable detection of ships and wakes in the dataset, and it has excellent generalization ability in complex background and weak target detection. The performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art models, where the average precision of ship and wake detection reaches 77.86% and 97.29%, respectively. Particularly, the average angle error between the predicted and actual values of wake lines is reduced by 3.476 degrees. Moreover, the low energy consumption (model size is one-sixth of YOLOv4) and real-time detection (>23.1 FPS) of the algorithm offer great potential for embedded deployment.

TI  - Mineral mapping in the Duolong porphyry and epithermal ore district, Tibet, using the Gaofen-5 satellite hyperspectral remote sensing data
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology is an exploration method that can directly map distribution of alteration minerals or zones associated with different types of mineral systems. Hyperspectral remote sensing can identify key path-finder minerals and compositional variations within minerals. The Duolong porphyry-epithermal ore district, which has proven reserves of approximately 20 million tons of Cu and 420 tons of Au, is part of an emerging world-class metallogenic area in the western part of the Bangong Co-Nujiang metallogenic belt, Tibet, China. The Gaofen-5 hyperspectral (GF-HS) reflectance data were used to map the distribution patterns of hydrothermal alteration and to locate areas potentially containing mineral deposits in the Duolong ore district (DOD). Based on the mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) technique and the absorption feature wavelength positions of the minerals, an alteration map was generated using GF-HS data for mineral mapping in the DOD with sparse vegetation. The widely distributed advanced argillic alteration (alunite + pyrophyllite + kaolinite +/- dickite), phyllic alteration (high content of Al-rich white mica), propylitic alteration (Mg-rich chlorite), and limited argillic alteration (kaolinite +/- dickite +/- white mica) were mapped in detail. The distribution patterns of alter-ation in known deposits were fairly consistent with the mineralogical information obtained in previous studies. In addition, we identified potential mineralization areas with characteristics similar to the Duobuza, Bolong and Naruo porphyry deposits.

TI  - Analyzing the multi-hazard coastal vulnerability of Matla-Bidya inter-estuarine area of Indian Sundarbans using analytical hierarchy process and geospatial techniques
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current global climate change era, the Indian Sundarbans Delta (ISD) is severely exposed to multiple environmental disasters especially high-intensity tropical cyclones, storm surges and flood inundation. These disasters threaten the lives and livelihoods of coastal communities. To formulate a disaster risk reduction strategy, it is necessary to identify priority areas based on their level of vulnerability. Therefore, this research aims to assess the multi-hazard coastal vulnerability of the Matla-Bidya Inter-estuarine (MBI) area of ISD considering exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability. The coastal vulnerability was derived in this study based on a total of 26 indicators using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in combination with remote sensing data and geospatial techniques. To better understand the impacts of recent natural disasters, a field survey was conducted in each village from 2020 to 2021 to collect information directly from households regarding the effects of recent disasters on the different aspects of livelihoods. The present study found that the coastal villages in the Basanti and Gosaba Blocks located within the southern MBI are the most vulnerable due to coastal proximity, tropical cyclones, storm surges and flooding incidents. The high exposure and sensitivity cause potential effects on coastal environments and a lack of resistance to environmental disasters, leading to a considerable increase in coastal vulnerability. Local people's livelihoods are at risk in almost 33% of MBI villages. In contrast, villages in the northern MBI, in the Canning II Block are less susceptible to the effects of extreme events due to better resilience. This village-level multi-hazard vulnerability study helps to identify priority areas considering the vulnerability level of each village and accordingly proposed effective strategic planning for environmental and socio-economic resilience.

TI  - Monitoring winter wheat growth performance at sub-field scale using multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A crop growth monitoring system should objectively and reproducibly reflect changes in crop biophysical properties during the growing season. By monitoring crop growth and performance at specific crop development stages, the farmer can obtain reliable information for timely crop management to achieve optimum crop pro-duction. This work aimed to evaluate crop development using five winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) bio-physical properties (shoots number, green area index, plant height, leaf N content, and aboveground dry biomass) predicted from Sentinel-2 data compared with benchmarks representing target growth from emergence to harvest. Data were collected for four principal phenology stages (tillering, stem elongation, heading, and fruit development) in 35 winter wheat fields in the Republic of Ireland and 40 in the United Kingdom in 2020 and 2021. A total of 1500 plots were selected for crop sampling over two growing seasons. The models were generally good, but phenology-specific models performed better (R2 between 0.72 and 0.87) than models for the entire season (R2 between 0.13 and 0.84). To assess the low-performance zones in fields, the predicted biophysical properties were compared to benchmarks taken from agronomic advice. Spatial analysis was then used to identify low-performance areas in fields, which were validated using farmers' feedback. It was concluded that the approach taken could be reliably used to monitor winter wheat over a wide area and through time.

TI  - Upgrade of LSA-SAF Meteosat Second Generation daily surface albedo (MDAL) retrieval algorithm incorporating aerosol correction and other improvements
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - MDAL is the operational Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)-derived daily surface albedo product that has been generated and disseminated in near real time by EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility for Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF) since 2005. We propose and evaluate an update to the MDAL retrieval algorithm which introduces the accounting for aerosol effects as well as other scientific developments: pre-processing recalibration of radiances acquired by the SEVIRI instrument aboard MSG and improved coefficients for atmospheric correction as well as for albedo conversion from narrow- to broadband. We compare the performance of MDAL broadband albedos pre- and post-upgrade with respect to three types of reference data: the EPS Ten-Day Albedo product ETAL is used as the primary reference, while albedo derived from in situ flux measurements acquired by ground stations and MODIS MCD43D albedo data are used to complete the validation. For the comparison to ETAL - conducted over the whole coverage area of SEVIRI - we see a reduction in average white-sky albedo mean bias error (MBE) from -0.02 to negligible levels (< 0.001) and a reduction in average mean absolute error (MAE) from 0.034 to 0.026 (-24 %). Improvements can be seen for black-sky albedo as well, albeit less pronounced (14 % reduction in MAE). Further analysis distinguishing individual seasons, regions and land covers show that performance changes have spatial and temporal dependence: for white-sky albedo we see improvements over almost all regions and seasons relative to ETAL, except for Eurasia in winter; resolved by land cover we see a similar effect with improvements for all types for all seasons except winter, where some types exhibit slightly worse results (crop-, grass- and shrublands). For black-sky albedo we similarly see improvements for all seasons when averaged over the full data set, although sub-regions exhibit clear seasonal dependence: the performance of the upgraded MDAL version is generally diminished in local winter but better in local summer. The comparison with in situ observations is less conclusive due to the well-known problem of the spatial representativeness of near-ground observations with respect to satellite pixel footprint sizes. Comparison with MODIS at the same locations shows mixed results in terms of change in performance following the proposed upgrade but proves the good quality of the MDAL products in general. Based on the evidence presented in this study, we consider the updated algorithm version to be able to deliver a valuable improvement of the operational MDAL product. This improvement is two-fold: primarily, there is the refinement of the albedo values themselves; secondarily, the increased alignment with the ETAL product is beneficial for those who wish to exploit synergies between EUMETSAT's geostationary and polar satellites to generate data sets based on the LSA-SAF albedo products from the two different missions.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth is an important parameter to characterize the characteristics of snow cover, and it is also one of the most sensitive response factors to regional climate change. However, the extent of snow depth variability and its driving mechanisms are still unknown in China. Therefore, in this study, we used the regression analysis, root-mean-square error analysis, anomalous year analysis, and correlation analysis methods to explore the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow depth in China from 1979 to 2019 based on the reanalysis snow depth dataset. The results show that (1) the snow distribution in China is obviously spatially heterogeneous, and the southeastern, western, and southern regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, northern Xinjiang, and northeastern China have high values of snow depth; (2) the high-value regions are also the sensitive regions for anomalous variations in snow depth in China; (3) in the past 41 years, the interannual variability of snow depth in China has shown a significantly decreasing trend, and the linear tendency of snow depth is - 0.093 cm/10 a (p < 0.01) and the snow depth in four seasons showed a decreasing trend (p < 0.05); and (4) the driving factors of snow heterogeneity are dissimilar in different regions and seasons. In temperate zones, average air temperature is the main factor affecting snow depth in cold temperature, mid temperature, and warm temperature zones; the maximum air temperature is the main factor affecting snow depth in mid temperate and warm temperate zones. Both the minimum air temperature and the average land-surface temperature are important factors affecting the snow depth in the cold temperate, mid temperate and warm temperate zones, and all passed the significance test of 0.01.

T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban municipalities throughout the world are facing grave challenge on the environmental front due to generation and mismanagement of massive amounts of municipal solid waste. This study focuses on the ecological damage caused by Municipal Solid Waste Open Dumps (MSWOD) in their vicinity. To study the adverse ecological impacts, satellite-based vegetation health indices and thermal measurements have been used as bio-thermal indicators to assess the deterioration of vegetation health and thermal heterogeneity around Mehmood Booti Municipal Solid Waste Open Dump in Lahore, Pakistan. Freely available satellite data and appropriate GIS techniques have been utilized to form basis of geospatial proximity analysis, making the approach efficient and economical. Zonal statistics and curve smoothing functions have been combined to prepare distance-dependent profiles that were subject to curve flattening technique for determination of impact range and severity in different seasonal conditions. Varying trends of high and low ranges for both indicators provide insight into factors other than main source of hazardous emissions, controlling bio-thermal conditions in the area as minor influencers. Similarly, role of meteorological variables in influencing waste decomposition and supporting vegetation health has also been distinguished. It has been discovered that the hazardous bio- and thermal influence zones around the study site have undergone expansion up to 761 m and 694 m, respectively, as compared to 650 m reported previously. Overall, the study supports the use of geospatial indicators to monitor and study environmental variables with a particular focus on emissions from MSWOD resulting from waste decomposition.

TI  - Information fusion approach for downscaling coarse resolution scatterometer data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The applications of scatterometer data (sigma degrees) are limited due to their coarser resolution (25-50 km). Some image reconstruction techniques are available to generate high-resolution products, but they require various sensor parameters and multiset observation, making them complex to use. Therefore, this paper proposes an information fusion approach to disaggregate the coarse resolution sigma degrees product. The coarse resolution backscattering signal includes the contribution from more than one land cover class, such as short vegetation, soil, urban and tall vegetation, the information of which can be obtained from normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), and fraction cover of urban and forests, respectively. Disaggregating this coarse resolution pixel, an optimum weight information is required that provides the distribution of each class. Since the distribution of land cover classes is not homogeneous for every pixel, a variance-based fusion approach has been used to obtain the optimum weight factors to fuse NDVI, VTCI, and fraction cover. These weight factors are used to disaggregate every coarse-resolution pixel into high-resolution pixels. The developed model is applied to Sentinel-1 and Scatsat-1 level-3 products, and the obtained results are quite satisfactory.

Here we show how to quantitatively detect and monitor temporal and spatial patterns in environmental heterogeneity, an important indicator of ecological integrity and biodiversity patterns. We used a 28-year time series (1991-2018) generated from freely available Landsat satellite imagery and Rao's quadratic index to calculate relative heterogeneity and trends in heterogeneity for 41 PAs across South Africa. We selected PAs where mega-herbivore assemblages were similar and where management objectives were broadly aligned with South African legislation to protect biodiversity. There was a three-fold difference in heterogeneity among PAs, mainly linked to variation in topography and rainfall. Heterogeneity decreased in 12 (29%), increased in three (7%) and remained stable in 26 (64%) PA's. These trends were not explained by overall heterogeneity, PA size, or rainfall - i.e., PAs that were smaller, drier, and more homogenous were not more likely to show decreasing trends than PAs that were larger, wetter, and generally more heterogenous. Rather trends in heterogeneity are likely the result of interactions between regional process (e.g., rainfall) and local factors such fire regimes, megaherbivore densities, and park management. The framework presented here can be extended to include every PA nationally, or even globally, and the data product fully automated. This presents an opportunity for conservation management to incorporate this important biodiversity indicator in PA monitoring programs as well as other large-scale ecological monitoring initiatives.

TI  - Performance comparison of two deep learning models for flood susceptibility map in Beira area, Mozambique
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are potentially devastating natural hazards that can threaten human life and ecosystems. The serious impact caused by floods is the reason for the urgent need to provide an appropriate flood susceptibility map (FSM). Floods can be triggered by various meteorological events, such as storms in coastal areas. On 14 March 2019, Cyclone Idai produced massive and severe flooding inundation in the coastal city of Beira, Mozambique. The extensive flood damage in Beira necessitated providing an accurate FSM and analyzing the factors associated with flooding. This study integrated the data of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), geographic information system (GIS), and two deep learning models, namely, the group method of data handling (GMDH) and convolutional neural network (CNN), to generate a precise FSM. We compared the performance of CNN and GMDH models in generating the FSMs for a case study of the March 2019 flood in the Beira Area, Mozambique. The result showed that the models produced a similar pattern of FSM, where the areas near the river, having a lower slope and lower altitude, have a higher flood risk. The FSM generated by CNN and GMDH models were compared to find a better model for flood risk assessment. The prediction performance of CNN model (AUC = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.022) was better than the result of GMDH model (AUC = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.089). The study should be used to mitigate the flood disaster and reduce flood risk in the future. (c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Improved burn severity estimation by using Land Surface Phenology metrics and red edge information estimated from Landsat
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global wildfire activities are expected to increase substantially in the near future. Existing techniques for spaceborne burn severity estimation often rely on bi-temporal spectral indices, which are related to in-situ burn severity data. However, due to cloud coverage and limited revisit frequency, in combination with the date of field surveys, it is a challenge to find suitable and phenologically comparable pre-and-post-fire images. To overcome these issues and to improve the accuracy of burn severity estimations by incorporating ecologically relevant spectral information, we investigated the capability of using Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics and incor-porating red edge spectral information. We examined the well-researched Jasper fire (September 2000, Black Hills, USA) with a dense time series of Landsat-5 and-7 data. We generated synthesized red edge spectral bands through a recently proposed spectral harmonization technique and computed several bi-temporal vegetation indices. Additionally, we derived various bi-annual LSP metrics from the same indices. We used linear regression between composite burn index (CBI) ground truth data and the various indices to measure the performance of each approach, and intercompared estimated burn severity maps. We found added value of both incorporating red edge spectral information into bi-temporal indices and into LSP metrics. Among the indices, NDVI and NDVIre1n performed best, with the latter being the overall winner. This was observed for both the bi-temporal indices and the bi-annual LSP metrics, wherein best estimation performance was found with Value of Peak of Season and Value of Green Mean metrics. Although the correlation between CBI point measurements and bi-temporal index data is similar to the LSP approach, the LSP-based burn severity maps show more robustness with regard to clouds and cloud shadows, altitude gradients and pre-processing uncertainty. The results are not only relevant for sensors with native red edge bands like Sentinel-2 but also suggest that back-casting the red edge spectral information to the Landsat archive combined with an LSP based estimation approach may improve existing burn severity maps, especially in more frequently clouded regions.

TI  - Mapping Lower Saxony?s salt marshes using temporal metrics of multi-sensor satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes act as an important natural buffer in terms of coastal protection in the light of the rising sea level. Due to weather events like extreme storms the extent of salt marshes changes. Hence, it is of great importance to regularly monitor these changes, especially for managing interventions and reporting their ecological status in the frame of environmental policies, like Natura 2000. In this study, the potential of freely available sallite imagery is investigated and a methodological approach suggested to map superior salt marsh types (pioneer zone, lower and upper salt marshes) for supporting regular monitoring compliances. Therefore, (spectral -)tem-poral metrics of optical Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 as well as SAR Sentinel-1 were calculated and used in different classification setups. The classifications were performed using a basic Random Forest classifier. A detailed accuracy assessment shows the impact of different datasets on the overall accuracy. The best result was achieved using S2 data, which led to an overall accuracy of 90.3 %. The combination of optical and SAR data, on the other hand, did not increase the classification accuracy. Overall, the freely available datasets and the pro-posed method proof useful and are considered well suited for monitoring salt marshes.

TI  - Quantifying the sensitivity of L-Band SAR to a decade of vegetation structure changes in savannas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global savannas are the third largest carbon sink with large human populations being highly dependent on their ecosystem services. However, savannas are changing rapidly due to climate change, fire, animal management, and intense fuelwood harvesting. In southern Africa, large trees (>5 m in height) are under threat while shrub cover (<3 m) is increasing. The collection of multi-date airborne LiDAR (ALS) data, initiated over a decade ago in the Lowveld of South Africa, provided a rare opportunity to quantify the ability of L-band SAR to track changes in savanna vegetation structure and this study is the first to do so, to our knowledge. The objective was to test the ability of ALOS PALSAR 1&2, dual-pol (HH, HV) data to quantify woody cover and volume change in savannas over 2-, 8-and 10-year periods through comparison to ALS. For each epoch (2008, 2010, 2018), multiple PALSAR images were processed to Gamma0 (gamma 0) at 15 m resolution with multi-temporal speckle filtering. ALS data were processed to fractional canopy cover and volume, and then compared to 5 x 5 aggregated (75 m) SAR mean gamma 0. The ALS cover change (Delta CALS) and volume change between pairs of years were highly correlated, with (R2 > 0.8), thus results for cover change applied equally to volume change. Cover change was predicted using (i) direct backscatter change or (ii) the difference between annual cover map product derived using the Bayesian Water Cloud Model (BWCM) and logarithmic models. The linear relationship between Delta gamma 0 and Delta CALS varied between year pairs but reached a maximum R2 of 0.7 for 2018-2010 and a moderate R2 of 0.4 for 2018-2008. Overall, 1 dB Delta gamma 0 corresponded to approximately 0.1 cover change. The three cover change models had very similar uncertainties with mean RMSE = 0.15, which is 13% of the observed cover change range (-0.6 to +0.6). The direct backscatter change approach had less underestimation of positive and negative cover change. The L -band backscatter had a higher sensitivity than suggested by previous studies, as it was able to reliably distinguish cover change at 0.25 increments. The SAR-derived cover change maps detected the loss of stands of big trees, and widespread increases in cover of 0.35-0.65 in communal rangelands due to shrub encroachment. In contrast, the maps suggest that cover generally decreased in conservation areas, forming distinct fence-line effects, potentially caused by significant increases in elephant numbers and frequent, intense wildfires in reserves.

TI  - Spatial-temporal characteristics and policy implication for non-grain production of cultivated land in Guanzhong Region
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-grain production of cultivated land (NGPOCL), as a severe threat to food security, has attracted great attention in China and other countries of the world. Although some scholars have focused on the NGPOCL, few studies performed the analysis at the plot scale across the whole region. This study takes Guanzhong Region as the study area and carries out a comprehensive analysis of NGPOCL according to the framework of "phenome-non-cause-countermeasure". According to the land-use map, the range of cultivated land was delineated; based on the 16-day time resolution MODIS vegetation index data, the NGPOCL range was further extracted from the cultivated land by distinguishing the grain/non-grain crops according to their seasonal variation characteristics on the vegetation index. Some spatial statistical methods were used to analyze the spatial-temporal character-istics of NGPOCL in the study area from 2000 to 2018, and it was observed as follows. Firstly, the NGPOCL problem in Guanzhong Region was getting worse during the study period, and the NGPOCL severity and area increased by 10.79% and 31.30% respectively. Secondly, the NGPOCL process showed significant temporal and spatial heterogeneity. The gravity center for NGPOCL was gradually shifted from Chunhua County to Xi'an City in the southeast. Meanwhile, the spatial autocorrelation of NGPOCL was weakening, and Moran' I was declining year by year. These indicated that the NGPOCL had been fully rolled out in the Guanzhong Region, and it had evolved from the past adjacent expansion to the current full bloom. As for the driving mechanism, while those natural factors determined the skeleton of the NGPOCL pattern, social and economic factors played an important role in the evolution process following, and different industrial policies have dominated the NGPOCL expansion at different stages. In the future, it is necessary to pay attention to the impact of industrial policies on NGPOCL and consider the demands of urbanization for non-grain agricultural products properly, so as to develop the characteristic agricultural products industry in a reasonable and compliant manner.

T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Background Robotic surgical systems enable surgeons to perform precise movement in the surgical field using high-resolution 3D vision and flexible robotic instruments. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of performing axillary lymph node dissection using a robotic surgical system in patients with node-positive breast cancer.Methods Thirty-two women with breast cancer who underwent robot-assisted nipple-sparing mastectomy (RNSM) and level I/II axillary lymph node dissection were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: RNSM with conventional axillary lymph node dissection (CALND) vs. RNSM with robotic axillary lymph node dissection (RALND). Clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes were analyzed.Results The median age of the patients was 44 (range 20-59) years. Eleven patients underwent RALND. None of the clinicopathologic features differed between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in surgical outcomes, except for the final incision size, between the two groups. The proportion of cases with an incision <= 40 mm was 63.6% in the RALND group and 36.4% in the CALND group (p = 0.020).Conclusion RALND can be safely performed in RNSM. RNSM with RALND is comparable to RNSM with CALND in terms of early surgical outcomes. The incision size can be reduced when using RALND.

TI  - An STP-HSI index method for urban built-up area extraction based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A change in an urban built-up area can reflect the process of urbanization and the development of a city. At present, multi-source remote sensing data extraction of built-up areas based on the human settlement index (HSI) has achieved relatively good results but the existence of noise, such as light spillover in the night-time light remote sensing data, seriously affects the accuracy of the HSI. In this paper, a high-precision human settlement index (STP-HSI) method based on spatio-temporal remote sensing and point-of-interest (POI) data is presented to improve the classification accuracy in urban built-up areas extractions. First, to correct light spillover, a new night-time light index the fuzzy c-means spatio-temporal point (FCM-STP) based on fuzzy c-means clustering is proposed, which integrates the spatio-temporal characteristics and uses night light video imaging data from Luojia-1 and POI data. Then, based on the FCM-STP index, the HSI is updated to the STP-HSI index. Finally, a random forest algorithm is used to extract the urban built-up areas, and the random forest feature database is composed of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and STP-HSI index features and texture features. To develop and evaluate the accuracy of the new method for built-up areas extraction with multi-source data, three test sites located in the cities of China (Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing) are used. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the single-source multi-spectral (Landsat 8) data extraction results, the overall accuracy is improved by up to 7.52%, and the kappa coefficient is improved by up to 14%. Compared with the HSI index, the maximum contribution rates of the STP-HSI increased by 25.74%. These experimental results show that the method in this paper is feasible.

TI  - Geospatial modeling to assess the past and future land use-land cover changes in the Brahmaputra Valley, NE India, for sustainable land resource management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) have revolutionalized the mapping, quantifying, and assessing the land surface processes, particularly analyzing the past and future land use-land cover (LULC) change patterns. Worldwide river basins have observed enormous changes in the land system dynamics as a result of anthropogenic factors such as population, urbanization, development, and agriculture. As is the scenario of various other river basins, the Brahmaputra basin, which falls in China, Bhutan, India, and Bangladesh, is also witnessing the same environmental issues. The present study has been conducted on the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam, India (a sub-basin of the larger Brahmaputra basin) and assessed its LULC changes using a maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The study also simulated the changing LULC pattern for the years 2030, 2040, and 2050 using the GIS-based cellular automata Markov model (CA-Markov) to understand the implications of the ongoing trends in the LULC change for future land system dynamics. The current rate of change of the LULC in the region was assessed using the 48 years of earth observation satellite data from 1973 to 2021. It was observed that from 1973 to 2021, the area under vegetation cover and water body decreased by 19.48 and 47.13%, respectively. In contrast, cultivated land, barren land, and built-up area increased by 7.60, 20.28, and 384.99%, respectively. It was found that the area covered by vegetation and water body has largely been transitioned to cultivated land and built-up classes. The research predicted that, by the end of 2050, the area covered by vegetation, cultivated land, and water would remain at 39.75, 32.31, and 4.91%, respectively, while the area covered by built-up areas will increase by up to 18.09%. Using the kappa index (ki) as an accuracy indicator of the simulated future LULCs, the predicted LULC of 2021 was validated against the observed LULC of 2021, and the very high ki observed validated the generated simulation LULC products. The research concludes that significant LULC changes are taking place in the study area with a decrease in vegetation cover and water body and an increase of area under built-up. Such trends will continue in the future and shall have disastrous environmental consequences unless necessary land resource management strategies are not implemented. The main factors responsible for the changing dynamics of LULC in the study area are urbanization, population growth, climate change, river bank erosion and sedimentation, and intensive agriculture. This study is aimed at providing the policy and decision-makers of the region with the necessary what-if scenarios for better decision-making. It shall also be useful in other countries of the Brahmaputra basin for transboundary integrated river basin management of the whole region.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rivers, lakes, and open water bodies play crucial roles in environmental development, especially in urban ecosystems. Accurate urban surface water body maps in high resolution are an important prerequisite for better and faster decision making for urban ecosystem monitoring, mitigating the effects of urban heat islands and urban climate change adaptation. Research presents new automatic algorithm for urban surface bodies mapping (AUWM). Algorithm was tested on Sentinel-2 data and can be applied globally for automatic mapping water bodies in 10-m spatial resolution. AUWM was developed based on modified normalized difference water index, pansharpening techniques (MNDWIPS), and k-means clustering algorithm. Research was provided on three study sites. The optimal number of classes for k-means in AUWM is four. Accuracy assessment results show that AUWM is a highly accurate method for water bodies mapping, confirmed by all statistical parameters; accuracy, kappa, precision, and F1 value are 0.997, 0.830, 0.998, and 0.998, respectively.

TI  - Witchcraft beliefs around the world: An exploratory analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new global dataset on contemporary witchcraft beliefs and investigates their correlates. Witchcraft beliefs cut across socio-demographic groups but are less widespread among the more educated and economically secure. Country-level variation in the prevalence of witchcraft beliefs is systematically linked to a number of cultural, institutional, psychological, and socioeconomic characteristics. Consistent with their hypothesized function of maintaining order and cohesion in the absence of effective governance mechanisms, witchcraft beliefs are more widespread in countries with weak institutions and correlate positively with conformist culture and in-group bias. Among the documented potential costs of witchcraft beliefs are disrupted social relations, high levels of anxiety, pessimistic worldview, lack of entrepreneurial culture and innovative activity.

TI  - Assessment of the vegetation sensitivity index in alpine meadows with a high coverage and toxic weed invasion under grazing disturbance
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining healthy ecosystems is essential to ensure sustainable socio-economic development. Studies combining remote sensing data with grassland health assessments, extensively performed at different scales, are important for monitoring grassland health from a spatiotemporal perspective to enable scientific grazing management. However, most studies only use quantitative grassland degradation indices, such as grassland cover; this is done despite the fact that some degraded grasslands maintain a high level of cover solely by virtue of the proliferation of toxic weeds. Thus, seeking indices that are a more accurate representation of the health status of grassland vegetation is of utmost importance. Therefore, in order to accurately characterize the ecological integrity of grasslands (i.e., while limiting the impact of confounding variables such as weeds), we chose the grassland health comprehensive evaluation index VOR (vigor, organization, and resilience) to assess the health of grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. We applied the VOR evaluation indices to two rangelands with different grazing intensity on the Tibetan Plateau, and extracted 11 commonly used vegetation indices based on remote sensing images of rangelands,then modeled them with the data from field surveys. Our results show that the FVC, PS, and VOR were higher in lightly grazed pastures than in heavily grazed pastures in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. At the beginning of the sampling period, Poaceae accounted for a greater proportion in the HG pasture. However, by August 2018, the proportion of Poaceae in the LG pasture exceeded that in the HG pasture. the proportion of Forbs in the HG pasture was significantly greater than that in the LG pasture. This indicates that vegetation response to grazing disturbance is not only a volume reduction but also a vegetation composition change. The ratio vegetation index was the most sensitive to the vegetation health response, enabling the quantification and prediction of regional vegetation health and objectively reflecting the actual condition of the grassland ecosystem. According to a multiple regression analysis, the main climatic limiting factor in the region is precipitation, which positively correlated with VOR; whereas, grazing disturbance is an important driving factor, and it is inversely correlated with VOR.

TI  - Damage detection on antarctic ice shelves using the normalised radon transform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas of structural damage mechanically weaken Antarctic ice shelves. This potentially preconditions ice shelves for disintegration and enhanced grounding line retreat. The development of damage and its feedback on marine ice sheet dynamics has been identified as key to future ice shelf stability and sea level contributions from Antarctica. However, it is one of the least understood processes that impact ice shelf instability since quantifying damage efficiently and accurately is a challenging task. Challenges relate to the complex surface of Antarctica, variations in viewing-illumination geometry, snow or cloud cover and variable signal-to-noise levels in satellite imagery. Therefore, automated damage assessment approaches require careful pre- and post-processing, lacking the option to be applied to wider spatiotemporal domains. Simultaneously, studies that use manual mapping are usually limited due to the effort required for extensive mapping, which either results in a limited spatial domain or the use of low resolution data.This study proposes the NormalisEd Radon transform Damage detection (NeRD) method to detect damage features and their orientations from multi-source satellite imagery. NeRD performs robust, high resolution, large-scale damage assessments. NeRD is applied to the ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) and validated with both manually labelled and existing fracture maps. Validation shows that NeRD detects damage with high recall and provides an accurate physical representation of multi-scale damage features and their orientation. Sensitivity analyses indicate NeRD is robust to different resolution parameter settings. NeRD consistently detects damage for different data sources ranging from optical Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 optical to Synthetic Aperture Radar Sentinel-1 data. Therefore, NeRD paves the way for synergistic multi-source damage detection that overcomes remaining limitations from individual sources. Results show varying damage patterns on the ice shelves in the ASE area in austral summer 2020-2021, with most damage located on the Pine Island, Crosson and Thwaites ice shelves. We show a damage increase on the Pine Island ice shelf between 2013-2019, and display advection and rotation of crevasses. The detected damage orientation can provide insight in the type of crevasse opening mode and the development of damage over time. The damage maps produced with NeRD can help evaluate ice sheet models or machine learning approaches, improving our understanding of damage evolution.

TI  - A multisensor satellite image classification for the detection of mangrove forests in Qeshm Island (Southern Iran)
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests in Iran are among the complex and productive ecosystems because these types of forests directly and indirectly play a significant role for humans and the environment. This study developed a parallel land cover classification method to identify mangrove forests (mangrove forests) in southern Iran using high-resolution (similar to 10 m) optical image of Sentinel-2 satellite and high-resolution (similar to 10 m) synthetic aperture radar image that presents ALOS-2 satellite (dipolar). Therefore, in this paper, ALOS-2 bipolar (VV, VH) was used for land cover classification and Sentinel-2 multispectral data as reference data. Generally, GLCM textures in different window sizes were applied to the SAR data, and then all of them were subjected to PCA transformation; finally, the first three components were used as input to the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm to classify the two mangrove classes. Other lands in addition, the backscatter image was also included separately in the MLC algorithm for land cover classification. The obtained statistical results showed that when the texture with different windows is placed in the input of the ML algorithm, it has a kappa coefficient value of 0.52, and when the input is a single backscattered image, it has a higher kappa coefficient value of about 0.83. In general, the results show that the map prepared by the only backscattered image performs better and similar to the optical image used. In addition, the accumulation of GLCM texture in the dimensions of the windows reduces the accuracy of the mangrove cover map, which as a result causes an exaggerated prominence in the land cover, especially the mangrove.

TI  - Spectral characteristics of winter wheat varieties depending on the development degree of <i>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</i>
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A promising direction in the field of plant protection is the creation of remote sensing methods to detect the development of plant diseases based on the analysis of the reflected radiation spectra. Spectral analysis is a relatively simple non-invasive method that allows to obtain high quality data. The objects of the study were 6 varieties of winter wheat with different levels of resistance to tan spot (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis). The purpose of the present study was to assess, in the field conditions, the informativeness of the spectral optical parameters of winter wheat varieties and their mixtures with different susceptibility to the tan spot pathogen. Using the ASD FieldSpec 3 Hi-Res spectroradiometer, high-precision ground-based measurements of selected plant objects were carried out. Analysis of changes in the morphology of spectral signatures of the studied objects showed that the most promising spectral ranges for detecting the development of tan spot at the early stages are 1445-1775 nm and 2050-2450 nm. According to the results of univariate analysis of variance, the influence of wheat varieties and the degree of disease development was confirmed. The hypothesis that the less resistant the wheat variety to tan spot is, the faster is the decrease in the spectral brightness coefficient (SBC) values in the near infrared range of the spectrum and the increase in the red range of the spectrum was confirmed.

TI  - Multi-branch self-learning Vision Transformer (MSViT) for crop type mapping with Optical-SAR time-series
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of crop types globally is essential for maintaining food security. In recent years, with the continued launch of the earth observation (EO) satellites, the freely accessible EO data with the high spa-tial-temporal resolution has made it possible to achieve crop type mapping at a finer scale. However, the dif-ficulty of crop type mapping elevates dramatically with multi-source data (such as optical and SAR), especially when dealing with long time-series across the temporal domain. Currently, most existing crop mapping studies have not considered exploiting complementary information from multi-modular time-series. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch self-learning Vision Transformer (MSViT) structure for crop classification to better achieve spatial-temporal feature extraction by jointly using optical-SAR time-series. The experiment results show that our proposed method outperforms the most commonly used deep learning crop classification schemes in terms of overall classification accuracy Kappa coefficient, and the F1-score index. In addition, the experiments quantitatively evaluate the impact of model depth, multi-source features, and contrast learning strategy on ac-curate crop identification, as well as visualize the degree of spatial-temporal feature contributions within the model.

TI  - Adaptive Sentinel Testing in Workplace for COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Testing and isolation of infectious employees is one of the critical strategies to make the workplace safe during the pandemic for many organizations. Adaptive testing frequency reduces cost while keeping the pandemic under control at the workplace. However, most models aimed at estimating test frequencies were structured for municipalities or large organizations such as university campuses of highly mobile individuals. By contrast, the workplace exhibits distinct characteristics: employee positivity rate may be different from the local community because of rigorous protective measures at workplace, or self-selection of co-workers with common behavioral tendencies for adherence to pandemic mitigation guidelines. Moreover, dual exposure to COVID-19 occurs at work and home that complicates transmission modeling, as does transmission tracing at the workplace. Hence, we developed bi-modal SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model and R-shiny tool that accounts for these differentiating factors to adaptively estimate the testing frequency for workplace. Our tool uses easily measurable parameters: community incidence rate, risks of acquiring infection from community and workplace, workforce size, and sensitivity of testing. Our model is best suited for moderate-sized organizations with low internal transmission rates, no-outward facing employees whose position demands frequent in-person interactions with the public, and low to medium population positivity rates. Simulations revealed that employee behavior in adherence to protective measures at work and in their community, and the onsite workforce size have large effects on testing frequency. Reducing workplace transmission rate through workplace mitigation protocols and higher sensitivity of the test deployed, although to a lesser extent. Furthermore, our simulations showed that sentinel testing leads to only marginal increase in the number of infections even for high community incidence rates, suggesting that this may be a cost-effective approach in future pandemics. We used our model to accurately guide testing regimen for three campuses of the Jackson Laboratory.

TI  - Vietnam wetland cover map: using hydro-periods Sentinel-2 images and Google Earth Engine to explore the mapping method of tropical wetland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical wetland resources have high ecological value to flood storage, greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity, with diverse types and widespread distribution. However, cloud pollution, inundation fluctuations, and spectral similarity pose unique challenges in the monitoring of tropical wetland using remote sensing. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive method for mapping the various types of tropical wetland using time series Sentinel-2 images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform integrated inundation dynamic, phenological, and geography features for multi-class topical wetland mapping (IPG-MTWM). Obtained a precise Vietnam wetland cover map (VWeC), which covers ten types of wetlands within a spatial resolution of 10 m. The overall accuracy (OA) of the VWeC was 82.07 %. compared the VWeC results with other wetland products showing the advantages of the IPG-MTWM in mapping complete wetland cover types with high spatial resolution and accuracy at large scales. The VWeC is the first thematic mapping on wetland cover types of Vietnam, it indicates that Vietnam has approximately 1,367,502.16 ha wetlands, of which coastal wetland accounts for approximately 44.27 % (605,318.3 ha). Vietnam's wetlands are mainly distributed in South Vietnam (SV). The integrated inundation dynamic, phenological, and geography features method, highlights the potential of precise and fast multi-class topical wetland mapping at a large-scale using hydro-periods Sentinel-2 images and GEE platform. This study provides an important technique and dataset for tropical wetland monitoring, protection, and management.

TI  - Monitoring trophic status using <i>in situ data</i> and Sentinel-2 MSI algorithm: lesson from Lake Malombe, Malawi
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With excessive nutrient enrichment exacerbated by anthropogenic drivers, many standing water bodies are changing from oligotrophic to mesotrophic, eutrophic, and finally hypertrophic-negatively affecting ecosystem functioning, biodiversity, and human populations. Efforts have been devoted to developing novel algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a), cyno-blooms, and floating vegetation. However, to this date, little research has focused on freshwater lakes in the data-scarce Sub-Saharan African countries such as Malawi. We, therefore, estimated the trophic status of Lake Malombe in Malawi-a lake likely to be affected by eutrophication and algal bloom-emerging threats to freshwater ecosystem functioning globally-especially with the onset of climatic and anthropogenic drivers. We integrated in situ data with high-resolution Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery Analysis (MSI). We independently assessed the remote sensing technique using in situ data and tested the model at multiple stages. The scatter plot showed that most points were in the 95% confidence interval. The validation results between the measured in situ chl-a concentrations and the Sentinel-2 MSI-based chl-a retrieval had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.88 mu g/L. The chl-a concentrations retrieved from MSI images were consistent with in situ data, indicating that the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) algorithm estimated chl-a concentrations in Lake Malombe with acceptable accuracy. Dissolved oxygen (DO), sulfate (SO42-), nitrite (NO2-), soluble reactive phosphorous (PO43-), total dissolved solids (TDS), and chl- a, except for temperatures from the hot-dry-season, cold-dry-windy-season, and rainy-season, were significantly different (P < 0.05). The Sentinel-2 MSI imagery analysis also depicted similar results, with high chl-a concentration reported in March (rainy season) and October (hot-dry season) and the lowest from May to August (cold-dry-windy season). On the contrary, the ANOVA results for water quality parameters from all five points had P > 0.05. The correlation matrix showed coefficients of (0.798 < r < 0.930, n = 30, P < 0.005), suggesting that Lake Malombe is homogenous. Our results demonstrate that integrating remote sensing based on MSI imagery and in situ data to estimate chl-a can provide an effective tool for monitoring eutrophication in small, medium, and large standing waterbodies-crucial information required to respond to global ecological and climatic dynamics.

TI  - An "unusual papillary lesion"
T2  - IMAGERIE DE LA FEMME
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the papillary breast lesions, encapsulated papillary carcinoma (or intracystic papillary carcinoma) is a complex diagnosis. It defines a malignant proliferation, most often of low grade, within a dilated duct. On imaging it appears as a circumscribed vascularised mass, continuous with the ductal network. The association of an encapsulated papillary carcinoma with an invasive component is a rare event; microlobutated contours of the lesion are synonymous with malignancy. Elastography and diffusion MRI are two complementary techniques for the characterisation of this type of lesion. Biopsies should include the periphery (wall) of the lesion to assess the presence or absence of myoepithelial cells by immunohistochemistry. Encapsulated papillary carcinoma is treated by lumpectomy with healthy margins, without sentinel lymphadenectomy unless an invasive component is suspected, and adjuvant irradiation.

TI  - The influence of urbanization on the morphology of the Barak River floodplain in Cachar District, Assam
T2  - WATER POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the meandering behavior of the Barak River (Cachar), Assam was traced. Flow path length, meander neck length, sinuosity index, and river migration were determined segment-by-segment to demonstrate morphological changes. Decadal land-use land cover (LULC) maps were also prepared at the section scale using Landsat data (1990-2020) validated with the Kappa coefficient to characterize changes along alluvial floodplains. Urban growth and agricultural activities affect river morphology, especially where intensive agriculture was recorded, according to LULC studies. Due to urbanization, forestation constantly decreased, causing river variability. According to the results of the present study, river migration is very slow between Sec 1 and Sec 3. In terms of river stability, the parts are more stable, particularly Sec 1, which features less urbanization and agricultural activity than the other sections. The most vulnerable segments within the study area were considered to be Sec 2 and 4. There is a rather large amount of migration within sections, especially segments CC and GG. The river segments became more vulnerable as a new oxbow lake was formed and LULC changed over a decade. This stretch of Barak is characterized by a broad alluvial floodplain and is shifting since this study applies to various meandering types. HIGHLIGHTSEven slight changes to river meandering parameters (such as flow channel length, meander neck length, and sinuosity index) can affect river stability. Changes in meandering parameters and land-use practices across the floodplain could also affect river morphology. Urbanization and agriculture within floodplains cause river morphological changes over a decade. River morphology changes significantly due to oxbow formation.

TI  - Intraoperative electron radiotherapy in early invasive ductal breast cancer: 6-year median follow-up results of a prospective monocentric registry
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOERT) can be used to treat early breast cancer during the conservative surgery thus enabling shorter overall treatment times and reduced irradiation of organs at risk. We report on our first 996 patients enrolled prospectively in a registry trial. Methods At Jules Bordet Institute, from February 2010 onwards, patients underwent partial IOERT of the breast. Women with unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma, aged 40 years or older, with a clinical tumour size <= 20 mm and tumour-free sentinel lymph node (on frozen section and immunohistochemical analysis). A 21 Gy dose was prescribed on the 90% isodose line in the tumour bed with the energy of 6 to 12 MeV (Mobetron (R)-IntraOp Medical). Results Thirty-seven ipsilateral tumour relapses occurred. Sixteen of those were in the same breast quadrant. Sixty patients died, and among those, 12 deaths were due to breast cancer. With 71.9 months of median follow-up, the 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of local recurrence was 2.7%. Conclusions The rate of breast cancer local recurrence after IOERT is low and comparable to published results for IORT and APBI. IOERT is highly operator-dependent, and appropriate applicator sizing according to tumour size is critical. When used in a selected patient population, IOERT achieves a good balance between tumour control and late radiotherapy-mediated toxicity morbidity and mortality thanks to insignificant irradiation of organs at risk.

TI  - Response of a large deep-seated gravitational slope deformation to meteorological, seismic, and deglaciation drivers as measured by InSAR
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the sensitivity of a large (area extent similar to 3 km(2)), deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (Feb slide, Alaska Range) to three specific drivers: (i) liquid surface water input from ERA-5 reanalysis snow melt and rainfall; (ii) locally projected seismic activity of Alaskan earthquakes; and (iii) lowering of Fels Glacier at the slide toe estimated from topographic data. A surface displacement map-series is derived from 1991 to 2016 spaceborne multi-sensor InSAR data (ERS, RADARSAT-1/2, ALOS, TerraSAR-X) using adaptive demodulation to unwrap interferograms of variable spatial resolution and quality. On this series we use independent component analysis (ICA) to uncover five displacement patterns that map to independently moving domains of the slide and then correlate the corresponding temporal pattern intensities with the suspected drivers. We find significant sub-annual correlation between displacement pattern intensities and seasonal water input variations. The correlation can be optimized, for each ICA pattern, by choosing appropriate values of temporal smoothing and lag to create depth-propagated versions of the water input driver. Lag time results ranging from one to 3 weeks relate to shallower and deeper propagations of water input, driving the different deformation patterns. For two of the deformation patterns, seasonal sensitivity to water input was strongly amplified by the 2002 M-w 7.9 Denali earthquake. Sensitivity of these patterns remained high for 4 years until abruptly dropping to below preearthquake values, which suggests a highly non-linear modulation by the seismic driver. Other deformation patterns show a steady intensity increase that appears linked to the deglaciation driver. Despite these observations, the inter-annual variations in ICA pattern intensities show no clear predictability by individual drivers or driver combinations. This suggests that the mechanical and hydraulic evolution of the slide, especially after damaging events such as earthquakes or heavy rainfall, is a crucial factor not adequately modeled in our approach. Despite this limitation, our analysis provides the first direct evidence that the Fels slide comprises several independently moving domains that respond differently to the suspected drivers as is suggestive of a complex slope deformation.

TI  - Revisiting the Hermeneutic of Divine Relationship: Contributions of Liberation Theology and Implications for Systemically Oriented Christian Therapists
T2  - CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This essay builds upon previous work introducing the hermeneutic of Divine relationship, a lens by which systemically oriented Christian therapists can begin to understand the connections between the relational nature of God and their systemic worldview. Specifically, we explore what liberation theology has to offer each of the five domains of the hermeneutic of Divine relationship (i.e., God's nature, human nature, sin and suffering, reconciliation, and hope) and by doing so demonstrate how a revisioning of the hermeneutic of Divine relationship through a liberation theology lens helps move the hermeneutic forward in its ability to aid all systemically oriented Christian therapists with their personal and professional integration. Additionally, this essay explores what a training course on the hermeneutic of Divine relationship could look like and presents a prototype curriculum for training on the hermeneutic of Divine relationship and personal/professional integration for systemically oriented Christian therapists.

TI  - Drivers and implications of the extreme 2022 wildfire season in Southwest Europe
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is a common phenomenon in Mediterranean countries but the 2022 fire season has been extreme in southwest Europe (Portugal, Spain and France). Here we provide a preliminary but comprehensive analysis of 2022's wildfire sea-son in southwest Europe. Burned area has exceeded the 2001-2021 median by a factor of 52 in some regions and large wildfires (>500 ha) started to occur in June-July, earlier than the traditional fire season. These anomalies were asso-ciated with record-breaking values of fuel dryness, atmospheric water demand and pyrometeorological conditions. Live fuel moisture content was below the historical minima for almost 50 % of the season in some regions. A few large wildfires were responsible for 82 % of the burned area and, in turn, 47 % of the area burned occurred in protected areas. Shrublands, transitional woodlands and conifer forests (but not eucalypt plantations) were the land cover types most affected by extreme fires. As climate change intensifies, we can expect such fire seasons to become the new nor-mal in large parts of the continent, potentially leading to major negative impacts on rural economies. These results highlight the need for landscape level fuel management also in protected areas, to avoid fire-induced biodiversity losses and landscape scale degradation. Our results have important policy implications and indicate that fire preven-tion should be explicitly addressed within continental forest legislation and strategies.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of species composition are important for assessing a wide range of ecosystem functions in forested landscapes, including processes shaping community structure at broader (e.g., climate) and finer (e.g., disturbance) scales. Incorporating recently available remotely sensed datasets has the potential to improve species composition mapping by providing information to help predict species presence and relative abundance. Using USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plot data and the gradient nearest neighbor imputation modeling approach in eastern Washington, USA, we developed tree species composition and structure maps based on climate, topography, and two sources of remote sensing: height from digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) of pushbroom aerial photography and Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery. We tested the accuracy of these maps based on their capacity to predict species occurrence and proportional basal area for 10 coniferous tree species. In this study region, climate, topography, and location explained much of the species occurrence patterns, while both DAP and Sentinel-2 data were also important in predicting species proportional basal area. Overall accuracies for the best species occurrence model were 68-92% and R-2 for the proportional basal area was 0.08-0.55. Comparisons of model accuracy with and without remote sensing indicated that adding some combination of DAP metrics and/or Sentinel-2 imagery increased R-2 for the proportional basal area by 0.25-0.45, but had minor and sometimes negative effects on model skill and accuracy for species occurrence. Thus, species ranges appear most strongly constrained by environmental gradients, but abundance depends on forest structure, which is often determined by both environment and disturbance history. For example, proportional basal area responses to moisture limitation and canopy height varied by species, likely contributing to regional patterns of species dominance. However, local-scale examples indicated that remotely sensed forest structures representing recent disturbance patterns likely impacted tree community composition. Overall, our results suggest that characterizing geospatial patterns in tree communities across large landscapes may require not only environmental factors like climate and topography, but also information on forest structure provided by remote sensing.

TI  - A GEE toolkit for water quality monitoring from 2002 to 2022 in support of SDG 14 and coral health in marine protected areas in Belize
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that provide many goods and ecosystem services globally. Coral reef ecosystems are also threatened by environmental stressors from anthropogenic sources and shifting climates. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 ("Life Below Water") addresses the need to conserve and sustainably use the ocean, seas, and marine ecosystems, including reef systems. Belize's coral reef system is the second largest in the world, providing sources of income to Belizeans through tourism and fisheries as well as coastline protection. In order to conserve their marine ecosystems, Belize has a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) throughout their coastal waters. Using Aqua MODIS satellite imagery from 2002 to 2022, Google Earth Engine, and RStudio, we present a workflow to calculate stress days on MPAs and a coral vulnerability index based on sea surface temperature (SST) and Kd (490), a proxy of water clarity. The Corozal Bay, Swallow Caye, Port Honduras, and South Water Caye MPAs had the highest percentages of stress days and coral vulnerability stress index score based on these two parameters among the 24 MPAs analyzed. Additionally, SST in the warmest month of the year in Belize were seen to increase across all MPAs from 2002 to 2022 (p < 0.01). This GEE toolkit provides a straightforward and accessible tool to help governments monitor both water quality and risks to coral reefs in accordance with SDG 14.

TI  - Solar X-ray and EUV imager on board the FY-3E satellite
T2  - LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The solar X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (X-EUVI), developed by the Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP), is the first space-based solar X-ray and Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imager of China loaded on the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite supported by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) for solar observation. Since started work on July 11, 2021, X-EUVI has obtained many solar images. The instrument employs an innovative dual-band design to monitor a much larger temperature range on the Sun, which covers 0.6-8.0 nm in the X-ray region with six channels and 19.5 nm in the EUV region. X-EUVI has a field of view of 42 ', an angular resolution of 2.5 '' per pixel in the EUV band and an angular resolution of 4.1 '' per pixel in the X-ray band. The instrument also includes an X-ray and EUV irradiance sensor (X-EUVS) with the same bands as its imaging optics, which measures the solar irradiance and regularly calibrates the solar images. The radiometric calibration of X-EUVS on the ground has been completed, with a calibration accuracy of 12%. X-EUVI is loaded on the FY-3E satellite and rotates relative to the Sun at a uniform rate. Flat-field calibration is conducted by utilizing successive rotation solar images. The agreement between preliminarily processed X-EUVI images and SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT images indicates that X-EUVI and the data processing algorithm operate properly and that the data from X-EUVI can be applied to the space weather forecast system of CMA and scientific investigations on solar activity.

TI  - Management of early-stage triple-negative breast cancer: recommendations of a panel of experts from the Brazilian Society of Mastology
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogenous subtype involving different patterns of behavior and clinical course, demanding a complex, individualized sequence of treatment. The knowledge and attitudes of the affiliated members of the Brazilian Society of Mastology regarding TNBC were evaluated and a consensus regarding management and treatment was reached. Methods Affiliates completed a survey involving 44 objective questions. In addition, a specialist meeting was held with 27 experts and 3 ad hoc consultants. The panelists completed the survey before and after brainstorming. Answers achieving 70% of agreement were considered consensual. The chi-square test was used to compare answers between panelists and affiliates and the Kappa coefficient to calculate agreement. Results Consensus among the panelists increased from 26 (59.1%) to 32 questions (72.7%) following brainstorming (p = 0.17), including 7/10 questions on systemic treatment. Among the affiliates, consensus was achieved for 24 questions (54.5%), resulting in moderate agreement (kappa = 0.445). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be indicated for almost all cases (except cT1a-b N0) and should include platinum agents. When indicated, immunotherapy is part of the standard of care. The panel reaffirmed the concept of no ink on tumor as indicative of adequate margins and the possibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy for cN1 patients who become cN0 following neoadjuvant therapy. Controversies remain on combining immunotherapy with capecitabine/olaparib in pertinent cases. Conclusion Expert consensus was achieved for > 70% of the questions, with moderate agreement between panelists and affiliates. Educational interventions on systemic breast cancer treatment affected decision-making in 60% of the questions.

TI  - Preoperative SPECT/CT plus intraoperative CT fusion enabling surgical augmented reality to target sentinel lymph node in endometrial cancer
T2  - EJNMMI PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To establish a proof-of-concept study using a phantom model to allow the fusion of preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) combined with computed tomography (CT), also known as SPECT/CT, with intraoperative CT, enabling the application of an augmented reality (AR) surgical guidance system for pelvic sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in endometrial cancer patients.Methods: A three-dimensional (3D) pelvic phantom model printed in a gelatin-based scaffold including a radiopaque pelvis, a vascular tree mimicking the iliac vessels, two 3D-printed fillable spheres representing the target pelvic sentinel lymph nodes, and a calibration board was developed. A planar with SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy and CT were performed independently on the model. We performed all the necessary steps to achieve the fusion between SPECT/CT and CT. Then, we performed a laparoscopy of the pelvic anatomy on the phantom model to assess in real time the overlay of the recording on the anatomical structures and AR guidance system performance.Results: We have successfully completed all the steps needed to fuse the two imaging procedures. This allowed us to apply, in real time, our surgical guidance system with the coverage rate of the visible surface by the augmented reality surface, respectively, on the left SLN 99.48% and on the right SLN 99.42%.Conclusion: Co-registration and real-time fusion between a preoperative SPECT/CT and intraoperative CT are feasible. The metric performance of our guidance system is excellent in relation to possible SPECT/CT and CT fusion. Based on our results, we are able to translate the technology to patients, and we initiated a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy of the AR guidance system for endometrial cancer surgery, with a correlation with indocyanine green (ICG)-based technique, representing the gold standard today in the intraoperative detection of SLN in endometrial cancers, despite various limitations.

TI  - Processing methodology for the ITS_LIVE Sentinel-1 icevelocity products
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The NASA MEaSUREs Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) project seeks to accelerate understanding of critical glaciers and ice sheet processes by providing researchers with global, low-latency, comprehensive and state of the art records of surface velocities and elevations as observed from space. Here we describe the image-pair ice velocity product and processing methodology for ESA Sentinel-1 radar data. We demonstrate improvements to the core processing algorithm for dense offset tracking, "autoRIFT ", that provide finer resolution (120 m instead of the previous 240 m used for version 1) and higher accuracy (20 % to 50 % improvement) data products with significantly enhanced computational efficiency (> 2 orders of magnitude) when compared to earlier versions and the state of the art "dense ampcor " routine in the JPL ISCE software. In particular, the disparity filter is upgraded for handling finer grid resolution with overlapping search chip sizes, and the oversampling ratio in the subpixel cross-correlation estimation is adaptively determined for Sentinel-1 data by matching the precision of the measured displacement based on the search chip size used. A novel calibration is applied to the data to correct for Sentinel-1A/B subswath and full-swath dependent geolocation biases caused by systematic issues with the instruments. Sentinel-1 C-band images are affected by variations in the total electron content of the ionosphere that results in large velocity errors in the azimuth (along-track) direction. To reduce these effects, slant range (line of sight or LOS) velocities are used and accompanied by LOS parameters that support map coordinate (x/y) velocity inversion from ascending and descending slant range offset measurements, as derived from two image pairs. After the proposed correction of ionosphere errors, the uncertainties in velocities are reduced by 9 %-61 %. We further validate the ITS_LIVE Version 2 Sentinel-1 image-pair products, with 6-year time series composed of thousands of epochs, over three typical test sites covering the globe: the Jakobshavn Isbr & UAELIG; Glacier of Greenland, Pine Island Glacier of the Antarctic, and Malaspina Glacier of Alaska. By comparing with other similar products (PROMICE, FAU, and MEaSUREs Annual Antarctic Ice Velocity Map products), as well as other ITS_LIVE version 2 products from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data, we find an overall variation between products around 100 m yr-1 over fast-flowing glacier outlets, where both mean velocity and variation are on the order of km yr-1, and increases up to 300-500 m yr-1 (3 %-6 %) for the fastest Jakobshavn Isbr & UAELIG; Glacier. The velocity magnitude uncertainty of the ITS_LIVE Sentinel-1 products is calculated to be uniformly distributed around 60 m yr-1 for the three test regions investigated. The described product and methods comprise the MEaSUREs ITS_LIVE Sentinel-1 Image-Pair Glacier and Ice Sheet Surface Velocities: version 2 (DOI: , Lei et al., 2022).

TI  - Optimization of snow-related parameters in the Noah land surface model (v3.4.1) using a micro-genetic algorithm (v1.7a)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowfall prediction is important in winter and early spring because snowy conditions generate enormous economic damages. However, there is a lack of previous studies dealing with snow prediction, especially using land surface models (LSMs). Numerical weather prediction models directly interpret the snowfall events, whereas LSMs evaluate the snow cover, snow albedo, and snow depth through interaction with atmospheric conditions. Most LSMs include parameters based on empirical relations, resulting in uncertainties in model solutions. When the initially developed empirical parameters are local or inadequate, we need to optimize the parameter sets for a certain region. In this study, we seek the optimal parameter values in the snow-related processes - snow cover, snow albedo, and snow depth - of the Noah LSM, for South Korea, using the micro-genetic algorithm and the in situ surface observations and remotely sensed satellite data. Snow data from observation stations representing five land cover types - deciduous broadleaf forest, mixed forest, woody savanna, cropland, and urban and built-up lands - are used to optimize five snow-related parameters that calculate the fractional snow cover, maximum snow albedo of fresh snow, and fresh snow density associated with the snow depth. Another parameter, reflecting the dependence of fractional snow cover on the land cover types, is also optimized. Optimization of these six snow-related parameters has led to improvement in the root mean squared errors by 17.0 %, 6.2 %, and 3.3 % in snow depth, snow albedo, and fractional snow cover, respectively. In terms of the mean bias, the underestimation problems of snow depth and overestimation problems of snow albedo have been alleviated through optimization of parameters calculating the fresh snow by about 44.2 % and 31.0 %, respectively.

TI  - Dietary zinc restriction affects the expression of genes related to immunity and stress response in the small intestine of pigs
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zinc (Zn) is an essential mineral and its deficiency manifests in non-specific clinical signs that require long time to develop. The response of swine intestine to Zn restriction was evaluated to identify early changes that can be indicative of Zn deficiency. Twenty-seven pigs (body weight = 77.5 +/- 2.5 kg) were assigned to one of three diets: diet without added Zn (Zn-restricted diet, ZnR), and ZnR-supplemented with either 50 (Zn50) or 100 mg of Zn/kg of diet (Zn100) of Zn supplied by ZnCl2. After 32 d consuming the diets, serum Zn concentration in ZnR pigs was below the range of 0.59-1.37 mu g/ml considered sufficient, thereby confirming subclinical Zn deficiency. Pigs showed no obvious health or growth changes. RNA-seq analysis followed by qPCR showed decreased expression of metallothionein-1 (MT1) (P < 0.05) and increased expression of Zn transporter ZEN (P < 0.05) in jejunum and ileum of ZnR pigs compared with Zn-supplemented pigs. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that Zn50 and Zn100 induced changes in genes related to nucleotide excision repair and integrin signalling pathways. The top gene network in the ZnR group compared with Zn100 was related to lipid and drug metabolism; and compared with Zn50, was related to cellular proliferation, assembly and organisation. Dietary Zn concentrations resulted in differences in genes related to immune pathways. Our analysis showed that small intestine presents changes associated with Zn deficiency after 32 d of Zn restriction, suggesting that the intestine could be a sentinel organ for Zn deficiency.

TI  - Exposure to soiled bedding reduces abnormal repetitive behaviors in mice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hygiene management protocols in laboratory mouse husbandries worldwide most commonly employ soiled bedding-exposed sentinel mice to monitor the occurrence of infections in mouse colonies. Using this approach, sentinel mice repeatedly receive a mixture of used bedding, supplied by a variety of cages of a defined hygienic unit for a period of several months. Hereby, microorganisms shed in the used bedding can infect the sentinel animals and can be detected in subsequent health monitoring procedures. However, murine excrements carry more than only microorganisms. Mouse feces and urine also contain a multitude of olfactory molecules, which the animals use to code information about social status and context. However, if and how the persistent and repeated experience with these odor cues affects the behavior of sentinel mice, has not yet been explored. To address this question, we conducted a longitudinal study for neurochemical output parameters related to an organism's responsiveness to challenging conditions, and for the exploratory assessment of a panel of home cage behaviors in soiled bedding and control female C57BL/6J mice. We found that the number of mice showing abnormal repetitive behaviors, including barbering and bar mouthing, was lower in the soiled bedding group. While neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and fecal corticosterone metabolites did not differ between groups, the within-group variance of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was reduced in the soiled bedding group. These results show that the occurrence of abnormal repetitive behaviors is lower in sentinel than in control mice and suggest a beneficial effect of soiled bedding on the welfare of laboratory mice and on outcome variability.

TI  - Milk fatty acids as covariates in multiple regression analysis is a robust approach to model the decrease in milk fat concentration and yield in small ruminants
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Milk fat depression (MFD) syndrome has been associated with the antilipogenic effects of trans-10 fatty acids (FA), such as t10, c12-CLA (CLA) and t10-18:1 (T10). However, these FA alone cannot completely explain the changes in milk fat in small ruminants. Thus, the aim of this study was to use multiple regression analysis to evaluate other FA that may be related to shifts in milk fat, as well as to improve model accuracy when different milk FA are used as covariates in the models. Previously published data were used in multiple regression analysis for goats (n = 106) and ewes (n = 68). Body weight (BW), vaccenic acid (t11-18:1), both trans-10 FA and the major milk FA were tested as covariates to model four response variables associated with MFD: fat concentration (FC), percentage change in milk fat concentration (CFC; %), fat yield (FY; g/d) and percentage change in milk fat yield (CFY; %). All four multiple regression models were significant for both species. When compared with simple regression models, all multiple regression models improved accuracy when estimating MFD. The improvements in model accuracy (lower RMSE) for FC, CFC, FY and CFY were 60.6%, 43.3%, 35.6% and 44.4% for ewes, and 52.1%, 60.1%, 33.6% and 14.9% for goats respectively. Linolenic acid and t11-18:1 were covariates in all models for goats, and palmitic acid and CLA were covariates in all ewe models. These FA should be investigated regarding their direct effect on gene expression associated with milk fat metabolism in the mammary gland of small ruminants. Multiple regression analysis is the most robust approach to account for the variation of milk fat and yield in goats and ewes.

TI  - Internal variability and forcing influence model-satellite differences in the rate of tropical tropospheric warming
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-model simulations exhibit approximately two times more tropical tropospheric warming than satellite observations since 1979. The causes of this difference are not fully understood and are poorly quantified. Here, we apply machine learning to relate the patterns of surface-temperature change to the forced and unforced components of tropical tropospheric warming. This approach allows us to disentangle the forced and unforced change in the model-simulated temperature of the midtroposphere (TMT). In applying the climate-model-trained machine-learning framework to observations, we estimate that external forcing has produced a tropical TMT trend of 0.25 +/- 0.08 K center dot decade(-1) between 1979 and 2014, but internal variability has offset this warming by 0.07 +/- 0.07 K center dot decade(-1). Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) large ensemble, we also find that a discontinuity in the variability of prescribed biomass-burning aerosol emissions artificially enhances simulated tropical TMT change by 0.04 K center dot decade(-1). The magnitude of this aerosol-forcing bias will vary across climate models, but since the latest generation of climate models all use the same emissions dataset, the bias may systematically enhance climate-model trends over the satellite era. Our results indicate that internal variability and forcing uncertainties largely explain differences in satellite-versus-model warming and are important considerations when evaluating climate models.

TI  - Synergistic retrieval and complete data fusion methods applied to simulated FORUM and IASI-NG measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the frame of Earth observation remote-sensing data analysis, synergistic retrieval (SR) and complete data fusion (CDF) are techniques used to exploit the complementarity of the information carried by different measurements sounding the same air mass and/or ground pixel. While more difficult to implement due to the required simultaneous access to measurements originating from different instruments, the SR method is sometimes preferred over the CDF method as the latter relies on a linear approximation of the retrieved states as functions of the true atmospheric and/or surface state. In this work, we study the performance of the SR and CDF techniques when applied to simulated measurements of the Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer - New Generation (IASI-NG) missions that will be operational in a few years, from two polar-orbiting satellites. The study is based on synthetic measurements generated for the two missions in clear-sky atmospheres. The target parameters of the inversion are the vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone mixing ratios, surface temperature, and spectral emissivity. We find that for exact matching of the measurements, the results of the SR and CDF techniques differ by less than 1/10 of their errors estimated through the propagation of measurement noise. For measurements with a realistic mismatch in space and time, the two methods provide more different results. Still in this case, however, the differences between the results are within the error bars due to measurement noise. We conclude that, when applied to FORUM and IASI-NG missions, the two methods are equivalent from an accuracy point of view.

TI  - Can late lymphoscintigraphy be omitted in the sentinel node procedure in early-stage vulvar cancer?
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIn the Netherlands, the sentinel lymph node procedure protocol consists of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy combined with intraoperative blue dye for identifying sentinel lymph nodes in early vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. This study aimed at investigating the role of early and late lymphoscintigraphy. Material and methodsFrom January 2015 to January 2019, early and late lymphoscintigraphies of 52 women were retrospectively analyzed. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed 30 minutes (early) and 2.5-4 hours (late) after vulvar injection of Tc-99m-labeled nanocolloid. We calculated the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) between number of sentinel lymph nodes detected on both images using the Lins concordance coefficient and correlated with clinicopathological data. ResultsThirty-four women had a midline tumor and 18 had a lateral tumor. Detection rates with early and late scintigraphy were 88.5% and 98.1%, respectively. Median number of detected nodes was 1.0 (0-7) and 2.0 (0-7). Good statistical correlation between number of sentinel lymph nodes detected on early and late imaging was found (CCC = 0.76) in most patients. In 18 women (35%) a mismatch occurred: a higher number of nodes was detected on late imaging. In 11 of 18 women re-injection was performed because no sentinel lymph nodes were visualized on early images. Late imaging and intraoperative detection showed a good statistical correlation (CCC = 0.61). One woman showed an isolated groin recurrence despite negative sentinel lymph nodes. ConclusionsThis study showed good statistical correlations between early and late scintigraphy in most patients. However, in 35% of women late scintigraphy detected more nodes. In case of poor visualization after the first scintigraphy, re-injection should be considered. Late scintigraphy is probably helpful in confirming successful re-injection and in showing deviating lymph flow in women with failed mapping after the first injection and successful re-injection. Because missing metastatic sentinel lymph nodes often leads to a poor prognosis, we prefer optimal correlations between imaging and intraoperative identification. Hence, late scintigraphy cannot be safely omitted.

TI  - Precarity and Islamism in Indonesia: the contradictions of neoliberalism
T2  - CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates the link between growing precarity - associated with the process of neoliberal economic globalization - and growing Islamist tendencies in Indonesian society, through a case study of app-enabled transport workers. It applies a Gramscian notion of common sense to understand workers' responses to their experiences of socio-economic marginalization and the articulation of their grievances. The combination of the near hegemony of a neoliberal worldview that encourages individual entrepreneurial prowess and an Islamist focus on moral self-cultivation inadvertently contributes to workers' normalization of their precarity, furthering the atomization of the workforce. It also helps provide the setting for mobilizations of the urban precariat under Islamic banners, without challenging the imposition of neoliberal ideology on work and life.

TI  - Retrieval of atmospheric CFC-11 and CFC-12 from high-resolution FTIRobservations at Hefei and comparisons with other independent datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic halogenated organic chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) play an important role in stratospheric ozone depletion and contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect. In this work, the mid-infrared solar spectra measured by ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to retrieve atmospheric CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl2F2) at Hefei, China. The CFC-11 columns observed from January 2017 to December 2020 and CFC-12 columns from September 2015 to December 2020 show a similar annual decreasing trend and seasonal cycle, with an annual rate of -0.47 +/- 0.06 % yr(-1) and -0.68 +/- 0.03 % yr(-1), respectively. So the decline rate of CFC-11 is significantly lower than that of CFC-12. CFC-11 total columns were higher in summer, and CFC-12 total columns were higher in summer and autumn. Both CFC-11 and CFC-12 total columns reached the lowest in spring. Further, FTIR data of NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) candidate station Hefei were compared with the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer) satellite data, WACCM (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model) data, and the data from other NDACC-IRWG (InfraRed Working Group) stations (St. Petersburg, Jungfraujoch, and Reunion). The mean relative difference between the vertical profiles observed by FTIR and ACE-FTS is -5.6 +/- 3.3 % and 4.8 +/- 0.9 % for CFC-11 and CFC-12 for an altitude of 5.5 to 17.5 km, respectively. The results demonstrate that our FTIR data agree relatively well with the ACE-FTS satellite data. The annual decreasing rate of CFC-11 measured from ACE-FTS and calculated by WACCM is -1.15 +/- 0.22 % yr(-1) and -1.68 +/- 0.18 % yr(-1), respectively. The interannual decreasing rates of atmospheric CFC-11 obtained from ACE-FTS and WACCM data are higher than that from FTIR observations. Also, the annual decreasing rate of CFC-12 from ACE-FTS and WACCM is -0.85 +/- 0.15 % yr(-1) and -0.81 +/- 0.05 % yr(-1), respectively, close to the corresponding values from the FTIR measurements. The total columns of CFC-11 and CFC-12 at the Hefei and St. Petersburg stations are significantly higher than those at the Jungfraujoch and Reunion (Maido) stations, and the two values reached the maximum in local summer or autumn and the minimum in local spring or winter at the four stations. The seasonal variability at the three stations in the Northern Hemisphere is higher than that at the station in the Southern Hemisphere.

TI  - CPUE retrieval from spaceborne lidar data: A case study in the Atlantic bigeye tuna fishing area and Antarctica fishing area
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurement of Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) supports the assessment of status and trends by managers. This proportion of total catch to the harvesting effort estimates the abundance of fishery resources. Marine environmental data obtained by satellite remote sensing are essential in fishing efficiency estimation or CPUE standardization. Currently, remote sensing chlorophyll data used for fisheries resource assessment are mainly from passive ocean color remote sensing. However, high-resolution data are not available at night or in high-latitude areas such as polar regions due to insufficient solar light, clouds, and other factors. In this paper, a CPUE inversion method based on spaceborne lidar data is proposed, which is still feasible for polar regions and at nighttime. First, Atlantic bigeye tuna CPUE was modeled using Cloud aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations (CALIPSO) lidar-retrieved chlorophyll data in combination with sea surface temperature data. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine Methods (SVM) were used for modeling, and the three methods were compared and validated. The results showed that the correlation between predicted CPUE and nominal CPUE was higher for the ANN method, with an R-2 of 0.34, while the R-2 was 0.08 and 0.22 for GLM and SVM, respectively. Then, chlorophyll data in the polar regions were derived using CALIPSO diurnal data, and an ANN was used for Antarctic krill. The inversion result performed well, and it showed that the R-2 of the predicted CPUE to nominal CPUE was 0.92. Preliminary results suggest that (1) nighttime measurements can increase the understanding of the diurnal variability of the upper ocean; (2) CALIPSO measurements in polar regions fill the gap of passive measurements; and (3) comparison with field data shows that ANN-based lidar products perform well, and a neural network approach based on CALIPSO lidar data can be used to simulate CPUE inversions in polar regions.

TI  - Intraoperative Sentinel Node Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy as a Substitute for Whole Sentinel Node Excisional Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients. Initial Report
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We aim at exploring intraoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy (SN-FNAB) of the sentinel node (SN) as a replacement for whole SN excision. We included 80 patients with breast cancer (BC) undergoing SN biopsy. With Z0011 criterion for axillary dissection, the Negative Predictive Value rise to 100%. Intraoperative SN-FNAB is highly accurate for swiftly depicting both low and high axillary tumor burden. Introduction: Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) is the choice procedure for axillary staging in Breast Cancer. Following the ACOSOG Z11 trial, axillary dissection is advised only in patients with more than 2 positive SNs. We aimed at exploring palpation-guided, intraoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the SN as a replacement for whole SN excision in node-negative BC patients to minimize side-effects. Patients and Methods: We included 80 patients with BC undergoing SNB between December 2020 and May 2022. After identification of the SN, the breast surgeon performed SN-FNAB. Results were compared with definitive pathological assessment. ResultsDiagnostic yield was 80%, including a "learning curve." 58 of 64 patients with suitable samples tested negative. In this group, the Negative Predictive Value was 77.6% (IC 64.7%-87.5 %). If micro metastasis is disregarded, the NPV would increase to 86.2% (IC 74.6%-93.9%). If we accept the Z11 criterion for axillary dissection, the NPV would rise to 100%. Six patients had a positive SN-FNAB. They were all confirmed as having macro metastatic-positive SNs at the final pathological assessment, and 3 of them also displayed extra nodal extension (ENE). Conclusion: We believe that intraoperative SN-FNAB is highly accurate for swiftly depicting both low axillary tumor burden/negative cases, in whom axillary dissection is to be omitted, as well as high axillary tumor burden cases.

TI  - Analysis of the relationship between yield in cereals and remotely sensed fAPAR in the framework of monitoring drought impacts in Europe
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the relationship between satellite-measured fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and crop yield cereals in Europe. Different features of the relationship between annual yield and multiple time series of fAPAR, collected during different periods of the year, were investigated. The two key outcomes of the analysis are the identification of the period: (i) from March to October as the one having the highest positive correlation between fAPAR and yield and (ii) from February to May as the period characterised by most of the estimated negative correlation. While both periods align well with the commonly assumed dynamic of the growing season, spatial differences are also observed across Europe. On the one hand, the Mediterranean regions report the highest correlation values (r > 0.8) and the longest continuous periods with positive statistically significant results (up to 7 months), covering most of the growing season. On the other hand, the central European region is characterised by the most limited positive correlation values, with only 2 months or less showing statistically significant results. While marked differences in the overall capability to capture the full dynamic of yield are observed across Europe, fAPAR anomalies seem capable of discriminating low-yield years from the rest in most of the cases.

TI  - High cardiovascular disease risk-associated with the incidence of Type 2 diabetes among prediabetics
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Prediabetes is a risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We report on the first cohort study of the association between high cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk with the incidence of T2D in prediabetics. First, estimate the direct effect of developing T2D on patients with prediabetes who have high CVDs risk; and 2) assess the potential increased risk of developing T2D mediated by statins.Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using a subset of data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) from 2000 to 2015. Cox proportional hazards (PH) regressions were conducted to estimate our primary outcome, which is the time to T2D among patients with prediabetes.Results: From the 4995 filtered prediabetic participants identified between 2000 and 2015, 2800 participants were diagnosed with high CVDs risk scores as measured by the Framingham risk score. 2195 participants were non-high CVDs risk controls. The covariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.24 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.31] for T2D by CVDs risk among prediabetics was observed. The total effect of CVDs risk on developing T2D was decomposed to a natural direct effect of high CVDs risk HR= 1.18 [95% CI, 1.01-1.48] and an indirect effect through statin therapy of HR= 1.06 [95% CI, 0.97-1.30]. Conclusion: Patients with prediabetes and high CVDs risk had a 24% higher chance of developing T2D. The high CVDs risk effect was mediated by statin therapy. Regular monitoring and counselling of prediabetics using statins is likely warranted to prevent the incidence of T2D.

TI  - Spatial distribution of evapotranspiration by fractional vegetation cover index on irrigated cropland banana (Musa Spp.) in the semiarid
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water management can be done in many ways, but the methods that use evapotranspiration (ET) are the most common. The Penman-Monteith FAO56 (PM) standard method is effectively used to estimate evapotranspiration and, in this way, ensure proper water application. In addition, re-mote sensing is also used for water management. The free availability of software and high -resolution satellite imagery opens many possibilities. Methods such as spatial distribution of ET provide an overall view that contributes to better use of water resources. In this sense, the objec-tive of this study is to demonstrate the spatial distribution of ET determined by the PM method by using an index that measures fractional vegetation cover (Fc). For this purpose, data from weather stations and Landsat 8 collection 2 level 1 image from the OLI/TIRS sensor in spectral bands 4 and 5 were used. The study area is a dwarf silver banana plantation located in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil, in the Missao Velha city area. The spatialization starts with the determination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), followed by the determina-tion of the Fc, using the ET from the PM method together with the crop coefficient (Kc). Evapo-transpiration mapping images with internalized calibration (METRIC) corresponding to the same location and date were also used to compare and analyze the results. The novelty of this study is utilizing the ET determinate with weather station data and make the spatial distribution of ET (SPD-ET) in satellite images, from a practical and easy way, which can be quickly replicated and used by anyone. The linear regression between SPD-ET and METRIC-ET gives an R2 above 0.80; similar results were obtained for the linear regression between EToF and Fc, with an R2, also above 0.80. The mean values between METRIC-ET and SPD-ET have a deviation of 1.62 mm d-1. The mean absolute percent error between METRIC-ET and SPD-ET was 9.75%, while between EToF and Fc 5.28%. The mean absolute percent error between METRIC-ET and SPD-ET was 9.75%, whereas between EToF and Fc it was 5.28%. Since the difference between the methods is just under 10%, we can conclude that spatializing ET with Fc is as accurate as ET, which was ob-tained from METRIC.

TI  - New two-step species-level AGB estimation model applied to urban parks
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation for urban parks has received less attention as an essential component of the global carbon cycle. Current studies focus on vast areas of natural or planted forests. The characteristics of these study areas make the use of homogenised vegetation grids (using remote sensing data) and plots (using field data) as the basic research unit a consensus. However, this data-level simplification can be significantly affected by buildings when applied to urban areas. Developing tree species identification methods based on remote sensing provides us with new ideas to explore urban AGB estimation methods at the species level. To this end, we developed a species-level AGB estimation model to address the AGB distribution in urban parks by combining multitemporal airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), optical remote sensing data, and field data from two urban parks in Hong Kong through a two-step strategy. First, we constructed optimal remote sensing feature-AGB mapping relationships for each sample species using sample data from the study area, the tropical allometric growth equation, and the five regression algorithms. We then explored a tree species iden-tification method based on the annual vegetation phenological change index (AVPCI), which allowed us to quickly obtain species distribution maps for the study area. Combining these two steps allowed us to obtain AGB information for the study area based on species-level mapping relationships based on species distributions. In the model validation, the correlation between the estimated and true values of the remote sensing feature and AGB mapping relationship was 0.91, with a significantly lower normalised root mean square deviation (RMSE). The overall accuracy of the sample tree species identification was 87.5%, which was better than the results of existing studies. The final AGB obtained was also within the reasonable interval of existing studies. In addition, with the model proposed in this study, we noted that the super typhoon Mangkhut in 2018 reduced the AGB in the study area by 32.6% and demonstrated the significant underestimation of high-density urban areas in existing global biomass products. The model developed in this study addresses the problems of existing AGB estimation methods for urban vegetation represented by urban parks while effectively contributing to understanding AGB distribu-tion and short-term carbon cycle dynamics in urban scenarios.

TI  - Mapping fire-impacted refugee camps using the integration of field data and remote sensing approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of fires on society and the environment are wide-ranging, and examining such fire incidents is of critical importance to communities, governments, and scientists. Satellite imagery analysis enables the moni-toring of burned scars and can help us better understand the social, ecological, and economic consequences of fires in more detail. However, most satellite studies measuring fire area and impacts focus on large areas in natural landscapes, typically forests. We highlight the need to develop methods for fire detection and analysis in human-dominated landscapes, specifically, such vulnerable populations as those found in refugee camps glob-ally. We calculate a suite of spectral indices (SI's) developed from Sentinel-2 data with a random forest algorithm to quantify the fire impact on the Rohingya refugee camps in Teknaf, Bangladesh. For this study, we developed a method called the Fractional Charred Index (FCI) using the field plots within the burn areas inside the refugee camp settlements and compared the FCI with differenced Spectral Indices (dSI's) to quantitively assess the burn severity at four levels: (i) high severity, (ii) moderate severity, (iii) low severity and (iv) unburned camp. Our study identified 140 acres of burn area, damaging over 8,000 refugee shelters, 1,760 of which were severely damaged and 3,452 of which suffered moderate damage. The FCI-dSIs relationship was measured by a simple linear model which indicated that the differenced Normalized Burned Index (dNBR) and the differenced Char Soil Index (dCSI) have the strongest positive correlation and can be used interchangeably to assess the scale and intensity of the fire-caused damage and fire severity assessment in this and similar types of case studies. The novel method presented here to determine fire severity in human-dominated landscapes, specifically refugee camps, may be quickly deployed and is easily interpretable and computationally inexpensive. Therefore, the proposed method of identifying burned settlements in refugee camps has significant potential for impact monitoring, disaster management, and recovery efforts after such fire events.

TI  - A deep learning method for individual arable field (IAF) extraction with cross-domain adversarial capability
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of agricultural fields from remote sensing imagery allows for the effective management of agricultural resources at large spatial scales. Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential in the extraction of individual arable fields (IAF) from high-resolution imagery; however, accurate boundary locali-zation and collection of adequate training samples remain a challenge. This study proposes a novel deep learning network (FieldSeg-DA) to extract IAFs from Chinese high-resolution satellite imagery (Gaofen-2). FieldSeg-DA adopts a parallel network structure consisting of two branch networks (UNet and DeepNetV3+) to indepen-dently extract the boundary and extent of IAFs. A post-processing module, connecting boundaries and filling field (CB-FF), was used to integrate the extracted boundary and extent and promote the integrity of each extracted IAF. The parallel network coupled with CB-FF improved the boundary and extent accuracy of IAF extraction. Moreover, we used fine-grain adversarial domain adaption (FADA) in the training stage to promote the trans-ferability of the trained network from source domains with labeled samples to target domains without any labeled samples. We found that FieldSeg-DA outperformed IAFRes, a state-of-the-art method for IAF extraction, in both the source and target domains, with improvements of 0.016 and 0.069 in the F1-score, respectively. Therefore, the proposed FieldSeg-DA method has the potential to extract IAFs accurately across diverse farming areas without training samples.

TI  - Streptococcus agalactiae <i>npx</i> Is Required for Survival in Human Placental Macrophages and Full Virulence in a Model of Ascending Vaginal Infection during Pregnancy
T2  - MBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a Gram-positive encapsulated bacterium that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of 30 to 50% of humans. GBS causes invasive infection during pregnancy that can lead to chorioamnionitis, funisitis, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and maternal and fetal demise. Upon infecting the host, GBS encounters sentinel innate immune cells, such as macrophages, within reproductive tissues. Once phagocytosed by macrophages, GBS upregulates the expression of the gene npx, which encodes an NADH peroxidase. GBS mutants with an npx deletion (Delta npx) are exquisitely sensitive to reactive oxygen stress. Furthermore, we have shown that npx is required for GBS survival in both THP-1 and placental macrophages. In an in vivo murine model of ascending GBS vaginal infection during pregnancy, npx is required for invading reproductive tissues and is critical for inducing disease progression, including PPROM and preterm birth. Reproductive tissue cytokine production was also significantly diminished in Delta npx mutant-infected animals compared to that in animals infected with wild-type (WT) GBS. Complementation in trans reversed this phenotype, indicating that npx is critical for GBS survival and the initiation of proinflammatory signaling in the gravid host.IMPORTANCE This study sheds new light on the way that group B Streptococcus (GBS) defends itself against oxidative stress in the infected host. The enzyme encoded by the GBS gene npx is an NADH peroxidase that, our study reveals, provides defense against macrophage-derived reactive oxygen stress and facilitates infections of the uterus during pregnancy. This enzyme could represent a tractable target for future treatment strategies against invasive GBS infections.This study sheds new light on the way that group B Streptococcus (GBS) defends itself against oxidative stress in the infected host.

TI  - Investigating the effects of drought and lockdowns on smallholder and commercial agricultural production in KwaZulu-Natal using remotely sensed data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Not many efforts have been made so far to understand the effects of both the 2015-2016 drought and the 2020 lockdown measures on the agricultural production of smallholder vis-a-vis commercial farmers in Kwazulu -Natal. Google Earth Engine, and random forest algorithm, are used to generate a dataset that help to investigate this question. A regression is performed on double differenced data to investigate the effects of interest. A k -mean cluster analysis, is also used to determine whether the distribution patterns of crop production changed with drought and disruption of agricultural production input. Results show that: (1) droughts affected the agricultural production of both areas similarly. Crop cover declined in both areas for one season after droughts were broken. Then recovery was driven by greener, more productive crops rather than the expansion of crop area. (2) The response of both areas to the COVID-19 lockdown was also similar. Both smallholder and commercial areas' Normalised Difference Vegetation Index - a proxy for crop vitality - improved in response to regulations favourable to the sector and improved rainfall. No significant adjustments in crop cover were observed. Production therefore changed primarily at the intensive margin (improved productivity of existing croplands) rather than the extensive (changing the extent of land under cultivation). (3) Cluster analysis allows for a more granular view, showing that the positive impact of lockdowns on agriculture were concentrated in areas with high rainfall and close proximity to metropolitan markets. Both smallholder and commercial farmers therefore are reliant on market access together with favourable environmental conditions for improved production.

TI  - Is sentinel lymph node assessment useful in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia?
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To determine the prevalence of underlying high-intermediate (high-IM) and high-risk endometrial cancer (EC) in patients with preoperative diagnosis of Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) and to assess the impact of the information retrieved from the sentinel lymph node (SLN) on adjuvant therapy.Methods. Retrospective cohort study of women undergoing hysterectomy, optional bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) and lymph nodes assessment for EIN between December 2007 and August 2021.Results. One hundred and sixty two (162) eligible patients were included, of whom 101 (62.3%) had a final diagnosis of EIN, while 61 (37.7%) were ultimately diagnosed with carcinoma. Out of 15 patients with high-IM to high-risk disease (9.25% of all EIN), 12 had grade 2-3 EC including 8 with >50% myometrial invasion, 2 with serous subtype, 1 with cervical invasion and 2 with pelvic lymph nodes involvement. Of the 3 patients with grade 1 EC, one patient had disease involving the adnexa and 2 patients had tumor invading >50% of the myometrium and with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI). Ten patients received vaginal brachytherapy after surgery, 3 patients with extrauterine spread were treated with systemic chemotherapy followed by vaginal brachytherapy and pelvic external-beam radiotherapy and 2 patients with early-stage serous carcinoma received chemotherapy followed by vaginal brachytherapy.Conclusions. Information from SLN, even when negative, can be helpful in the management of patients with EC after preoperative EIN, as some patients are found to have high-IM to high-risk disease on final pathology. These patients would require either re-staging surgery or adjuvant external beam radiotherapy, both could be avoided by proper staging.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Possibility of using the DInSAR method in the development of vertical crustal movements with Sentinel-1 data
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the possibility of using Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) to develop models of vertical crustal movements (VCMs). We determined VCM using the DInSAR method in the locations of four Polish GNSS stations: Borowa Gora, Borowiec, Lamkowko, and Jozefoslaw. They are included in the International GNSS service and EUREF permanent GNSS networks. All Sentinel-1A and 1B satellite data were from 2020, and the time intervals of the created interferograms are 12 days, 24 days, and 336 days for each of the orbits: ascending and descending. We verified the calculated results of VCM based on GNSS data recorded by individual stations. We developed reference data with the precise point positioning (PPP) method. We confronted them with the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory service. The GNSS data covered larger time intervals than the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. To calculate daily positions with the PPP method we used GipsyX software. The obtained results of the directions of displacement are convergent between SAR and GNSS data. The values differ from each other, both between the types of orbits and GNSS data. The obtained results allow us to assume that SAR data developed using the DInSAR method may provide additional support in the development of VCM models in the Polish area, but they cannot be the only source of such results.

TI  - Sixteen years of MOPITT satellite data strongly constrain Amazon CO fire emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the consensus on the overall downward trend in Amazon forest loss in the previous decade, estimates of yearly carbon emissions from deforestation still vary widely. Estimated carbon emissions are currently often based on data from local logging activity reports, changes in remotely sensed biomass, and remote detection of fire hotspots and burned area. Here, we use 16 years of satellite-derived carbon monoxide (CO) columns to constrain fire CO emissions from the Amazon Basin between 2003 and 2018. Through data assimilation, we produce 3 d average maps of fire CO emissions over the Amazon, which we verified to be consistent with a long-term monitoring programme of aircraft CO profiles over five sites in the Amazon. Our new product independently confirms a long-term decrease of 54 % in deforestation-related CO emissions over the study period. Interannual variability is large, with known anomalously dry years showing a more than 4-fold increase in basin-wide fire emissions relative to wet years. At the level of individual Brazilian states, we find that both soil moisture anomalies and human ignitions determine fire activity, suggesting that future carbon release from fires depends on drought intensity as much as on continued forest protection. Our study shows that the atmospheric composition perspective on deforestation is a valuable additional monitoring instrument that complements existing bottom-up and remote sensing methods for land-use change. Extension of such a perspective to an operational framework is timely considering the observed increased fire intensity in the Amazon Basin between 2019 and 2021.

TI  - Indocyanine green is a safe and effective alternative to radioisotope in breast cancer sentinel lymph node biopsy regardless of patient body mass index
T2  - EUROPEAN SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: A recent meta-analysis [1] has confirmed high sensitivity of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence mapping for sentinel node detection in early breast cancer. Concerns have previously been raised regarding the efficacy in patients with high body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods: All consecutive patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) for early breast cancer in NHS Tayside were included in a prospective audit of surgical and pathology findings. All patients included in the study received dual injection of patent blue dye and ICG. Approval was obtained from the local Caldicott guardian for collection and use of personal data. Results: Of 239 cases, all were female patients of mean age 62 years (range 27-93). In 4.2% (10/239) of cases neither blue dye nor ICG was present in the axilla. Of the remaining 229 SLNB cases in this series, surgeons documented retrieval of 451 nodes, with a mean surgical nodal count per case of 1.97 (range 1-5) and pathological nodal count of 2.15 (range 0-7). 83 cases were performed in patients with BMI 30-39.9 and 21 cases with BMI>40, with nodal detection rates of 96.4% (80/83) and 95.2% (20/21) respectively in these groups of patients. 20% (48/229) of cases had nodal metastases on histopathology. Conclusions: This is a large single centre study which demonstrates the safety and accuracy of the combined ICG and blue dye technique for SLNB in breast cancer. This is represented by nodal detection rates and node positivity rates which are comparable to previous multicentre studies of standard SLNB regardless of BMI.

TI  - Population-Level Impact of Omitting Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in Early Breast Cancer Women: Evidence from an Economic Evaluation in Germany
T2  - APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial showed that complete axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) did not improve survival benefits in patients with one or two tumour-involved sentinel lymph nodes and undergoing breast conservation. Still, a considerable number of the Z0011-eligible patients continue to be treated with cALND in various countries. Given the potential economic gain from implementation of the Z0011 recommendations, we quantified population-level impacts of omitting cALND among Z0011-eligible patients in clinical practice. Methods This 2-year economic analysis adopted both the perspective of patients under statutory insurance and the societal perspective, using data collected prospectively from 179 German breast cancer units between 2008 and 2015. The estimation of cost savings and health gain relied on a single decision tree, which considered three scenarios: clinical practice at the baseline; actual implementation in routine care; and hypothetical full implementation in all eligible patients. Results Data for 188,909 patients with primary breast cancer were available, 13,741 (7.3%) of whom met the Z0011 inclusion criteria. The use of cALND decreased from 94.3% in 2010 to 46.9% in 2015, resulting in a gain of 335 quality-adjusted life-years and a saving of EUR50,334,756 for the society. Had cALND been omitted in all eligible patients, the total gain would have been more than double. Conclusions The implementation of the Z0011 recommendations resulted in substantial savings and health gain in Germany. Our findings suggest that it is beneficial to introduce additional policy measures to promote further uptake of the Z0011 recommendations in clinical practice.

TI  - Detecting burnt severity and vegetation regrowth classes using a change vector analysis approach: a case study in the southern part of Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the development of burn severity and vegetation regrowth classes using vegetation (NDVI) and bareland (NDBI) indices-based change vector analysis (VI-CVA) with a case study on the fire event that occurred at the Berbak National Park, Jambi Province, in 2015. The main objective was to determine the type and the severity level of change due to fire or vegetation regrowth, as summarised in CVA magnitude and direction images. The vegetation and bareland indices were derived from Landsat medium-resolution images to detect the degree of change caused by the forest fires. The study found that severity and vegetation regrowth could be classified into five classes: unburnt, very low, low, and moderate severity burn classes and a moderate regrowth class from bare land to oil palm plantation, and unburnt. It was also found that the performance of this CVA approach was superior to the delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR) method as indicated by its ability to detect five post-fire severity classes with 87.7% overall accuracy compared with dNBR, which detected four post-fire severity classes with 66.9% overall accuracy.

TI  - Endometrial serous carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation mimicking primary endometrial squamous cell carcinoma: Clinicopathological and molecular analysis of a case with literature review
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the histological assessment of endometrial carcinoma, the presence of squamous differentiation is generally considered inconsistent with a serous histotype. Herein, we report a case of endometrial serous carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation mimicking squamous cell carcinoma, with literature review. A 67-years-old -woman underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sentinel lymph node resection, omental and peritoneal biopsies, due to a 8 cm endometrial mass. Histologically, the tumor showed squamous carcinoma features with positivity for squamous cell markers (p40, p63, cytokeratin-5/6, cytokeratin-3413E12) and nega-tivity for Mullerian markers (PAX8, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor). No immunohistochemical/mo-lecular alterations typical of endometrioid carcinoma (i.e., PTEN loss, mismatch repair deficiency, nuclear 13-catenin expression, POLE mutation) were observed. P53 showed aberrant pattern and p16 showed basal pos-itivity. The tumor infiltrated the myometrium full-thickness with extensive lymphovascular space invasion. Surprisingly, the sentinel lymph node metastasis showed overt serous carcinoma features. Additional sampling of the endometrial mass revealed a minor. In conclusion, serous carcinoma may show diffuse squamous differen-tiation. In the case of suspected primary endometrial squamous cell carcinoma, an extensive sampling is warranted.

TI  - Localizing Positive Axillary Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer Patients Post Neoadjuvant Therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Multiple trials demonstrated the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those trials reported > 10% false-negative rate; however, a subset analysis of the Z1071 trial demonstrated that removing the clipped positive lymph node (LN) during SLNB reduces the false-negative rate to 6.8% post neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. This study examines the factors that might contribute to the ability to identify the clipped nodes post neoadjuvant therapy (NAT).Materials and methods: Breast cancer patients with biopsy-proven metastatic axillary LN who underwent NAT, converted to N0, had preoperative localization, and then SLNB between 2018 and 2020 at a single institution were identified. A retrospective chart review was performed. Demographic and preoperative variables were compared between locali-zation and nonlocalization groups. Results: Eighty patients who met inclusion criteria were included. A total of 39 patients were localized after NAT completion (49%). Only half of the patients with ultrasound -detectable marker clips were able to be localized. Minimal LN abnormality was seen in imaging after NAT completion in 39 patients and is significantly associated with localiza-tion; 26 (67%) were localized (Odds Ratio 4.31, P = 0.002, 95% Confidence Interval 1.69-10.98).Conclusions: Our study suggests that radiologically abnormal LNs on preoperative imaging after NAT completion are more likely to be localized. Nodes that ultimately normalize by imaging criteria remain a significant challenge to localize, and thus localization before starting NAT is suggested. A better technology is needed for LN localization after prolonged NAT for best accuracy and avoids repeated procedures.Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Global biomass burning fuel consumption and emissions at 500 m spatialresolution based on the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In fire emission models, the spatial resolution of both the modelling framework and the satellite data used to quantify burned area can have considerable impact on emission estimates. Consideration of this sensitivity is especially important in areas with heterogeneous land cover and fire regimes and when constraining model output with field measurements. We developed a global fire emissions model with a spatial resolution of 500 m using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To accommodate this spatial resolution, our model is based on a simplified version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) modelling framework. Tree mortality as a result of fire, i.e. fire-related forest loss, was modelled based on the overlap between 30 m forest loss data and MODIS burned area and active fire detections. Using this new 500 m model, we calculated global average carbon emissions from fire of 2.1 +/- 0.2 (+/- 1 sigma interannual variability, IAV) Pg C yr(-1) during 2002-2020. Fire-related forest loss accounted for 2.6 +/- 0.7 % (uncertainty range =1.9 %-3.3 %) of global burned area and 24 +/- 6 % (uncertainty range =16 %-31 %) of emissions, indicating that fuel consumption in forest fires is an order of magnitude higher than the global average. Emissions from the combustion of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the boreal region and tropical peatlands accounted for 13 +/- 4 % of global emissions. Our global fire emissions estimate was higher than the 1.5 Pg C yr(-1) from GFED4 and similar to 2.1 Pg C yr(-1) from GFED4s. Even though GFED4s included more burned area by accounting for small fires undetected by the MODIS burned area mapping algorithm, our emissions were similar to GFED4s due to higher average fuel consumption. The global difference in fuel consumption could mainly be explained by higher SOC emissions from the boreal region as constrained by additional measurements. The higher resolution of the 500 m model also contributed to the difference by improving the simulation of landscape heterogeneity and reducing the scale mismatch in comparing field measurements to model grid cell averages during model calibration. Furthermore, the fire-related forest loss algorithm introduced in our model led to more accurate and widespread estimation of high-fuel-consumption burned area. Recent advances in burned area detection at resolutions of 30 m and finer show a substantial amount of burned area that remains undetected with 500 m sensors, suggesting that global carbon emissions from fire are likely higher than our 500 m estimates. The ability to model fire emissions at 500 m resolution provides a framework for further improvements with the development of new satellite-based estimates of fuels, burned area, and fire behaviour, for use in the next generation of GFED.

TI  - Coastal and marine plastic litter monitoring using remote sensing: A review
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Plastic pollution in coastal and marine areas is an ongoing environmental concern in the world. Despite its growing concern worldwide, there is a knowledge gap in terms of its detection and quantification of spatial distribution patterns. In this review paper, we investigated the existing trends in monitoring marine and beached (macro and meso) plastic debris using remote sensing techniques. Marine plastic debris monitoring using remote sensing data is highly complex, partially due to the constraints in spatial and spectral resolutions as well as due to the differences in surface reflectance properties of different polymers. Modern remote sensing with high-quality data, including airborne, spaceborne, and data taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), have revolu-tionized marine litter mapping. UAV platform offers a promising and cost-effective way for mapping both floating and beached marine plastic debris compared to data from other platforms. Automatic and manual delineation for mapping marine plastic litters can be applied depending on the objective of the study. For assisting beach clean-up processes, automatic detection of marine plastic debris is enough for locating the worksite. For detailed characterization of debris, including type, size and material, manual delineation of high resolution images is necessary. More accurate mapping of marine plastics can be achieved by developing detailed spectral libraries with material level details and launching dedicated sensors for marine litter mapping in the future. Challenges exist in mapping submerged marine plastics, plastic materials conglomerated with biomass and unaccounted for beached marine litter buried along the coasts due to accretion and erosion.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of major phytoplankton functional types in the coastal waters of the west coast of Canada derived from OLCI Sentinel 3A
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) in coastal oceans is essential for understanding fisheries production, changes in water quality, and carbon export to the deep ocean. The launch of new generation ocean color sensors such as OLCI (Ocean Land Color Instrument) onboard Sentinel 3A provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the surface dynamics of PFTs at high spatial (300 m) and temporal (daily) resolution. Here we characterize the seasonal dynamics of the major PFTs over the surface waters of the west coast of Canada using OLCI imagery and Chemical Taxonomy (CHEMTAX, v1.95) software. The satellite-based approach was adapted from a previously proven Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF)-based algorithm by using a local matchup dataset comprising CHEMTAX model output and EOF scores derived from OLCI remote sensing reflectance. The algorithm was developed for the following PFTs: diatoms, dinoflagellates, dictyochophytes, haptophytes, green algae, cryptophytes, cyanobacteria, raphidophytes, and total chlorophyll-a (TChla) concentration. Of these PFTs, first level evaluation of the OLCI-derived retrievals showed reliable performance for diatoms and raphidophytes. The second level of validation showed that TChla had the best performance, and green algae, cryptophytes, and diatoms followed seasonal trends of a high temporal resolution in situ CHEMTAX time-series. Somewhat reduced correspondence was observed for raphidophytes. Due to their low contribution to the phytoplankton community (26%) and low range of variation, weak performance was noted for haptophytes, dictyochophytes, cyanobacteria, and dinoflagellates. The EOF-based PFT maps from daily OLCI imagery showed seasonal spring and fall diatom blooms with succession from spring blooms to high diversity flagellate dominated summer conditions. Furthermore, strong localized summer raphidophyte blooms (Heterosigma akashiwo) were observed, which are a regionally important harmful species. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of the OLCI in deriving the surface dynamics of major PFTs of the Strait of Georgia (SoG), a critical habitat for the juvenile Pacific Salmon.

TI  - Remote sensing-based retrieval of soil moisture content using stacking ensemble learning models
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning combined with multisource remote sensing data to assess soil moisture content (SMC) has attracted considerable attention in SMC studies, but the retrieval results still remain uncertain. The purpose of this study is to combine multiple single machine learning models with integrated learning algorithms and propose an SMC retrieval method based on multiple differentiated models under a stacking integrated learning architecture. First, 19 factors, including: radar backscattering coefficient, vegetation index, and drought index, that affect SMC were extracted from SENTINEL-1, LANDSAT, and terrain factors. Those with the highest importance scores were selected as retrieval factors using the Boruta algorithm combined with four single machine learning methods-classified regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme random tree. In addition, the two stacking ensemble models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the generalized boosted regression model (GBM) were tested and applied to build the most reliable and accurate estimation model. The results showed that radar backscattering coefficient, temperature, vegetation drought index, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and solar local incident angle were the most important environmental variables for soil moisture retrieval. A comparison of the four machine learning methods in April and August showed that the GBDT model revealed the highest SMC retrieval accuracy, with root mean square error values of 1.87% and 1.64%, respectively. The stacking models were more accurate than the optimal single machine learning model, especially when using GBM. The multifactor integrated model constructed using spectral indices, radar backscatter coefficients, and topographic data exhibited high accuracy in soil surface moisture retrieval in an arid zone, providing a reference for land desertification studies and ecological environment management in the study region.

TI  - A CO<sub>2</sub>-independent cloud mask from Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) radiances for climate applications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - With more than 15 years of continuous and consistent measurements, the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) radiance dataset is becoming a reference climate data record. To be exploited to its full potential, it requires a cloud filter that is accurate, unbiased over the full IASI life span and strict enough to be used in satellite data retrieval schemes. Here, we present a new cloud detection algorithm which combines (1) a high sensitivity, (2) a good consistency over the whole IASI time series and between the different copies of the instrument flying on board the suite of Metop satellites, and (3) simplicity in its parametrization. The method is based on a supervised neural network (NN) and relies, as input parameters, on the IASI radiance measurements only. The robustness of the cloud mask over time is ensured in particular by avoiding the IASI channels that are influenced by CO2, N2O, CH4, CFC-11 and CFC-12 absorption lines and those corresponding to the nu(2) H2O absorption band. As a reference dataset for the training, version 6.5 of the operational IASI Level 2 (L2) cloud product is used. We provide different illustrations of the NN cloud product, including comparisons with other existing products. We find very good agreement overall with version 6.5 of the operational IASI L2 with an identical mean annual cloud amount and a pixel-by-pixel correspondence of about 87 %. The comparison with the other cloud products shows a good correspondence in the main cloud regimes but with sometimes large differences in the mean cloud amount (up to 10 %) due to the specificities of each of the different products. We also show the good capability of the NN product to differentiate clouds from dust plumes.

TI  - Fear for the future: Eco-anxiety and health implications, a systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Although there is no standard definition for eco-anxiety, most authors define it as people's emotional reaction of concern, worry, anxiety, and fear in view of global Climate Change (CC) threats and concurrent environmental degradation. This systematic review was carried out to critically evaluate the evidence on eco-anxiety related to CC and its health implications in general populations. Methods: We performed a search for scientific articles in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central. Studies were included if they complied with the study objective. Selection of articles and data extraction were carried out independently by 2 reviewers. We used the Axis tool and JBI critical appraisal checklist to assess the quality of the studies. Results: A final sample of 12 articles was included in this review. The methodological quality of the studies was limited. A wide variety of eco-anxiety definitions was used in the different studies but further research is needed to provide conceptual clarity of the term eco-anxiety. Eco-anxiety was associated with functional impairment, symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, stress and insomnia, lower self-rated mental health, and reluctance to have children. Moreover, habitual worry about global warming was associated with a pro-ecological worldview, a green self-identity and pro-environmental behavior, strongly suggesting a constructive nature. Indeed, pro -environmental behavior in the form of climate activism would buffer the impact of CCA cognitive-emotional impairment on MDD symptoms. However, sometimes engaging in pro-environmental behavior might not be successful in dealing with eco-anxiety, since individuals might perceive that their efforts do not help to mitigate the CC crisis. Conclusions: Results have to be interpreted with caution since the methodological quality of the studies was limited. However, they do suggest a link between eco-anxiety and negative mental health outcomes, mainly in younger generations, women, and poorer countries in the "Global South". Eco-anxiety may constitute a stressor to mental health, particularly if coping mechanisms are not successfully developed.

TI  - Predicting spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 concentrations during spring festival for county-level cities in China using VIIRS-DNB data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term PM2.5 increment is one of the severe air quality issues in the urban areas of China during the Spring Festival (SF) owing to the large amount of firework (FW) displays. This study proposed a hybrid self-adaptive deep learning algorithm, named Self-adaptive deep belief network (SADBN), which calibrates PM2.5-AOD rela-tionship self-adaptively by the spatial relation between each predictor and the others around it, to estimate the short-term rapid changes of PM2.5 concentration during SF of China urban areas. Firstly, all the urban areas were extracted for 4 years (2015-2018) by using the optimal threshold method based on VIIRS-DNB data. Secondly, the SADBN model was constructed through integration of VIIRS-DNB data, PM2.5 ground measurements and meteorological fields. Then the PM2.5 concentrations were mapped for the urban areas of China during SF used SADBN model. Finally, the spatiotemporal changes of PM2.5 were analyzed based on three periods (Previous, During and Post) of SF from 2015 to 2018. The results demonstrated that the VIIRS-DNB product could be able to capture the short-term variability of PM2.5 concentration at high spatiotemporal resolution with acceptable accuracy, which is affected by human activity. The SADBN could be improved by the consideration of VIIRS-DNB data with increments R2 of 0.06 and decrements of RMSE of 4.98 mu g/m3. The results indicated that the rapid increase of PM2.5 concentration caused by FW can affect the monthly average PM2.5 of most of the urban areas during SF. The mapping results showed that there were obvious temporal trends during and after SF, the PM2.5 concentration increased rapidly During period and decreased significantly Post period of SF in the most of the urban areas.

TI  - Using a combination of nighttime light and MODIS data to estimate spatiotemporal patterns of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at multiple scales
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping spatiotemporal patterns of CO2 emissions and understanding its driving factors are very important, it is useful for the scientific and rational formulation of carbon emission reduction policies. Nevertheless, due to data availability issues, most studies have been limited to the global and national scales, and the models used were relatively simple. In this paper, we used the 500 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIR-SDNB) data and the 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS NDVI) and proposed an improved CO2 emissions index (ICEI) to calculate CO2 emissions. Compared with the total nighttime light (NTL), the average regression coefficient (R-2) can be improve from 0.73 to 0.78. We also used the coefficient of variation, spatial autocorrelation, and geographically weighted regression models to analyze the temporal and spatial variation mode of CO2 emissions, as well as the associated correlation and heterogeneity, at three different administrative unit scales during 2012-2019. Our experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the improved index (ICEI) is better than the traditional variable (NTL) in estimating CO2 emissions; (2) the highest CO2 emissions are primarily gathered in the developed coastal areas in eastern China; and (3) at the provincial level, the added value of the secondary industry is the most significant factor, whereas the added value of the tertiary industry is negatively correlated with CO2 emissions.

TI  - Dynamically tunable frequency-domain multifunctional reconfigurable polarization conversion metasurface
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The design of electromagnetic device with arbitrary polarization manipulation is the hot spot of the current research. Multifunctional reconfigurable electromagnetic devices have been put into wide applications in radar, satellite communication and other fields. In this work designed is a multifunctional reconfigurable polarization conversion metasurface based on two PIN diodes, which can realize linear polarization conversion, linear-circular polarization conversion and total reflection switching in the different frequency bands, and the multi-function converter can still maintain the high-efficient broadband conversion characteristics when the oblique incidence angle is less than 30 degrees. The polarization conversion and reconfigurability are mainly due to the anisotropy of the structure and the changes of coupling mode in different states of PIN diodes. In addition, the physical mechanism of polarization conversion is explained by surface current. The combined action of electric resonance and magnetic resonance results in polarization conversion. Finally, the experimental results of the sample are in good agreement with the simulation results. The device has the potential application values in polarization manipulation, frequency control, intelligent reflecting surface design, and antenna design and so on.

TI  - Long-term records of glacier evolution and associated proglacial lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (1976-2020)
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) constitute critical sources of water for the proglacial lakes and many rivers found downstream. To better understand the evolution of glaciers and the impact of this on proglacial lakes, seven glaciers corresponding to continenntal, subcontinental, and marine climate types that are influenced by westerlies and the Indian summer monsoon were selected for study. The evolution of the edges of these glaciers and their associated proglacial lakes were identified based on the visual interpretation of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images. A dataset covering the period 1976-2020 that included the glacier and proglacial lake edge vectors was then created. The relative errors in the areas of the individual glaciers were less than 3%, and for the proglacial lakes these errors were in the range 0%-7%. The dataset was used to effectively compare the changes in glaciers and proglacial lakes that have occurred over the past four decades. The most striking changes that were found were the retreat of glaciers and the formation of small proglacial lakes. This dataset could also be used as a proxy to support research on changes in mountain glaciers, particularly their response to climate change and water resources. This response is of great scientific significance and is important in many applications, including assessments of the ecological problems caused by melting glaciers. The dataset can be downloaded from .

TI  - Role of space station instruments for improving tropical carbon flux estimates using atmospheric data
T2  - NPJ MICROGRAVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropics is the nexus for many of the remaining gaps in our knowledge of environmental science, including the carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry, with dire consequences for our ability to describe the Earth system response to a warming world. Difficulties associated with accessibility, coordinated funding models and economic instabilities preclude the establishment of a dense pan-tropical ground-based atmospheric measurement network that would otherwise help to describe the evolving state of tropical ecosystems and the associated biosphere-atmosphere fluxes on decadal timescales. The growing number of relevant sensors aboard sun-synchronous polar orbiters provide invaluable information over the remote tropics, but a large fraction of the data collected along their orbits is from higher latitudes. The International Space Station (ISS), which is in a low-inclination, precessing orbit, has already demonstrated value as a proving ground for Earth observing atmospheric sensors and as a testbed for new technology. Because low-inclination orbits spend more time collecting data over the tropics, we argue that the ISS and its successors, offer key opportunities to host new Earth-observing atmospheric sensors that can lead to a step change in our understanding of tropical carbon fluxes.

TI  - A new synergistic approach for Sentinel-1 and PALSAR-2 in a machine learning framework to predict aboveground biomass of a dense mangrove forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are well-recognized for their very high carbon sequestration potential. However, studies on their role in global carbon cycling and climate change are hindered due to lack of operational methodologies to model and map their biophysical properties. This study establishes a robust methodological protocol for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation using i) field measurements, ii) a generic (in the absence of species-specific) allometric equation, iii) multi-sensor/polarization SAR data and derived variables thereof, and iv) machine learning models; that demonstrated high prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.93) and low uncertainty (mean <= 3% and median <= 1.5%) for a mangrove forest. Following stratified random sampling and on-field accessibility criteria, we laid out 314 elementary sampling points of 0.04 ha each at Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary (BWS), India and measured circumference at breast height (CBH) and canopy tree height for 18 species. The estimated AGB range of a generic allometric equation was 9-474 Mg/ha for BWS, with a major representation of 9-347 Mg/ha. We utilized Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and derived their variables for AGB prediction. Compared to single sensor-based model, we observed higher prediction accuracy for combined sensor data (R-2 = 0.63, 0.87, 0.93; RMSE = 66.75, 39.95, 28.35 Mg/ha; MAE = 52.63, 24.21, 19.55 Mg/ha; and Bias = 3.42, 0.22, 2.15 Mg/ha for C, L and C & L bands respectively using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) over Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The higher uncertainty pixels represented seasonal grassland and scrubs in the swampy areas and along the fringes of the creeks that experience diurnal tidal fluctuations. This robust methodology can be replicated for AGB estimates in other mangrove ecosystems to meet the operational carbon accounting requirements of various entities.

AB  - Mucosal tissues are constantly exposed to the outside environment. They receive signals from the commensal microbiome and tissue-specific triggers including alimentary and airborne elements and are tasked to maintain balance in the absence of inflammation and infection. Here, we present neutrophils as sentinel cells in mucosal immunity. We discuss the roles of neutrophils in mucosal homeostasis and overview clinical susceptibilities in patients with neutrophil defects. Finally, we present concepts related to specification of neutrophil responses within specific mucosal tissue microenvironments.

TI  - Multi-resolution soil moisture retrievals by disaggregating SMAP brightness temperatures with RADARSAT-2 polarimetric decompositions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping soil moisture (SM) at high spatial resolution assists to trigger important agricultural management, such as irrigation, to enhance crop yields. This study investigates disaggregation of SMAP brightness temperature (TB) using RADARSAT-2 polarimetric decompositions to retrieve high-resolution SM. Compared to Sentinel-1 back -scattering coefficients used in the SMAP baseline active-passive SM retrieval algorithms, the RADARSAT-2 surface scattering power Ps with a reduced vegetation influence was hypothesized to be more relevant to disaggregate the SMAP TB. Different polarimetric decompositions were evaluated to extract an optimal Ps, fol-lowed by an incidence angle normalization. Then, the optimal Ps parameter was aggregated to the same spatial resolution as the SMAP TB to develop empirical relationships between Ps and TB. Furthermore, the airborne TB data collected by Passive Active L-band Sensor (PALS) were analyzed in terms of the Ps across multiple spatial resolutions, to account for the scale effect on the Ps/TB relationships. Finally, the tau-omega emission model was used to retrieve SM at multiple spatial resolutions (10 km, 1 km, 500 m, 100 m, and 50 m). The impacts of spatial resolution on retrieval accuracy were analyzed to determine the best spatial resolution for SM retrievals. The results indicated that the An polarimetric decomposition with the de-orientation provided the highest surface scattering powers, which may benefit the SM estimation. In contrast to the traditional cosine algorithms, the incidence angle normalization of Ps with span resulted in a temporally decreasing surface scattering power, because of the increasing vegetation attenuation as the crop grows. The sensitivity of TB to Ps decreases as the resolution scale varies from 36 km to 50 m. The SM retrievals across multiple resolutions obtained marginal differences in retrieval accuracy. Although slightly better results were obtained with 1 km spatial resolution which is close to the nominal size of agricultural fields in the study area (R = 0.68-0.8 and RMSE = 0.039-0.062 m3/m3), the retrievals at 50 m spatial resolution (R = 0.63-0.76 and RMSE = 0.046-0.067 m3/m3) capture the spatial heterogeneity of SM within and across different fields which could be very helpful for the precision agriculture.

TI  - Multivariable integrated risk assessment for cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes and its spatiotemporal characteristics
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has catalyzed the global expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic , lakes and threatens water security. In most studies, the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in lakes were evaluated using field-collected data from multiple indicators or spatially continuous data from one cyanobacteria-related indicator. Neverthe-less, the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes has clear spatial heterogeneity and is affected by numerous factors. Therefore, we developed a multivariable integrated risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms in lakes using five spatially continuous datasets to estimate the risk level of cyanobacterial blooms at the pixel scale (250 m). The spatial and temporal variations in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels from May 1, 2002, to October 31, 2020, were investigated for three typical eutrophic lakes in China: Lakes Taihu, Chaohu, and Dia-nchi. Seasons and regions of high cyanobacterial bloom risk were identified for each lake. Environmental characteristics were discussed. A long-term investigation revealed that owing to its warm climate, the cyano-bacterial risk levels in summer and autumn were much higher than those in the other two seasons. At the synoptic scale, Lake Taihu had a lower cyanobacterial bloom risk than Lakes Chaohu and Dianchi. A further comparison found that precipitation, wind speed, and temperature were responsible for the differences in cya-nobacterial bloom risk levels among the three lakes. At the pixel scale, the risk map indicated that the cyano-bacterial bloom risk levels of Lake Taihu were unevenly distributed, and the cyanobacterial bloom risk of the lakeshore was higher than that of the other subregions. Nutrient levels played the most critical role in the regional differences in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in a lake. While the differences of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in three lakes were resulted by the climates. Bloom events were defined and classified as "long-term bloom" or "flash bloom" according to their duration (over or below a year). Overall, this study can assist in advanced water management with a pixel-scale evaluation of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels.

TI  - Integrated approach of remote sensing and machine learning to simulate and predict petroleum pollution and algal blooms along Aqaba Gulf
T2  - BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To simulate and predict the appropriate indices for algal blooms and petroleum pollution, this study combined remote sensing data and models of Machine Learning ML for the Aqaba Gulf's condition. For algal blooms indication; floating algal index (FAI) was selected as the best index with 0.937 and for petroleum indices; ratio index (RI) was selected with 0.984. The collected data within the number of samples were separated into two parts: 80% for calibration to train and ad-just the back propagation in neural network BPNN and partial least squares regression PLSR, and 20% for the external validation. Therefore, and based on the RI data, FAI was predicted using MLP, the obtained results showed that the ML algorithms gave models with high quality perfor-mance with R2= 0.955 and RMSE = 10.90. The PLSR and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were used to predict petroleum pollution using the extracted values to bands. The results showed that both models were obtained excellent models for predicting petroleum pollution. In general, MLP outperforms PLSR; within R2=0.941. Accordingly, the ML model was able to estimate the algal blooms and petroleum contamination with good accuracy. In the validation process, the determi-nation coefficient R2 was 0.84 with an average square error equal to 0.076. As demonstrated, MLP could be a powerful mathematical tool for environmental analysis and prediction. The inte-gration of remote sensing indices and data-driven statistical modeling were highly recommended for further similar studies.

TI  - Impact of Lockdown on Air Quality During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is crucial to study air quality and its impact on human health, as it can leave not only short-term effects but also have long-term effects, especially on people suffering from cardiovascular and lung diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a major lockdown of almost 70 days in four different phases was announced in India. Due to this exercise, many visually observed a drastic change in air quality; however, actual quantifications were limited. Therefore, there is a need to quantify how air quality changed from before to during and post-lockdown scenarios. This study quantifies the COVID-19 India lockdown impact on air quality by analyzing the change in major air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O-3, PM2.5, and PM10. The major objectives of this study are to quantify the change in major air pollutants across India during the lockdown and to identify their trends and respective hotspots. In order to achieve these objectives, air quality estimates are obtained from Sentinel 5P satellite, while PM2.5 and PM10 values are taken from Central Pollution Control Broad's ground monitoring stations. For temporal analysis, different time intervals starting from before the lockdown (i.e., March 1, 2020) till the end of the fourth lockdown (i.e., May 31, 2020) were analyzed across India. Results state that (1) There was a significant decline of - 48.11% and - 11.56% in concentrations of SO2 and NO2, respectively, after averaging values at their respective hotspots (2) A decrease of - 6.78% and - 0.42% was observed in O-3 and CO concentration during the lockdown period in the year 2020 compared with the same period in the year 2019. (3) For PM2.5, Kolkata had the maximum drop of - 83.28%, while Bengaluru had the least drop of - 38.86%, whereas, for PM10, Kolkata had the maximum drop again of - 80.53%, while Delhi, on the other hand, had an increment of 13.42% at the end of the fourth lockdown. The results indicate the indirect benefit of the COVID-19 lockdown on air quality. It also provides a better understanding of hotspots and trends that can aid the government and the policy-makers to identify precautionary measures to reduce air pollution and prioritize hotspots.

TI  - So2Sat POP - A Curated Benchmark Data Set for Population Estimation from Space on a Continental Scale
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Obtaining a dynamic population distribution is key to many decision-making processes such as urban planning, disaster management and most importantly helping the government to better allocate socio-technical supply. For the aspiration of these objectives, good population data is essential. The traditional method of collecting population data through the census is expensive and tedious. In recent years, statistical and machine learning methods have been developed to estimate population distribution. Most of the methods use data sets that are either developed on a small scale or not publicly available yet. Thus, the development and evaluation of new methods become challenging. We fill this gap by providing a comprehensive data set for population estimation in 98 European cities. The data set comprises a digital elevation model, local climate zone, land use proportions, nighttime lights in combination with multi-spectral Sentinel-2 imagery, and data from the Open Street Map initiative. We anticipate that it would be a valuable addition to the research community for the development of sophisticated approaches in the field of population estimation.

TI  - Combining remote sensing analysis with machine learning to evaluate short-term coastal evolution trend in the shoreline of Venice
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing storminess and incessant sea-level rise, coastal erosion is becoming a primary issue along many litto-rals in the world. To cope with present and future climate change scenarios, it is important to map the shoreline posi-tion over years and assess the coastal erosion trends to select the best risk management solutions and guarantee a sustainable management of communities, structures, and ecosystems. However, this objective is particularly challeng-ing on gentle-sloping sandy coasts, where also small sea-level changes trigger significant morphological evolutions. This study presents a multidisciplinary study combining satellite images with Machine Learning and GIS-based spatial tools to analyze short-term shoreline evolution trends and detect erosion hot-spots on the Venice coast over the period 2015-2019. Firstly, advanced image preprocessing, which is not frequently adopted in coastal erosion studies, was performed on satellite images downloaded within the same tidal range. Secondly, different Machine Learning classifi-cation methods were tested to accurately define shoreline position by recognizing the land-sea interface in each image. Finally, the application of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System tool was performed to evaluate and visualize coastal changes over the years.Overall, the case study littoral reveals to be stable or mainly subjected to accretion. This is probably due to the high presence of coastal protection structures that stabilize the beaches, enhancing deposition processes. In detail, with re-spect to the total length of the considered shoreline (about 83 km), 5 % of the coast is eroding, 36 % is stable, 52 % is accreting and 7 % is not evaluable. Despite a significant coastal erosion risk was not recognized within this region, well-delimited erosion hot-spots were mapped in correspondence of Caorle, Jesolo and Cavallino-Treporti municipal-ities. These areas deserve higher attention for territorial planning and prioritization of adaptation measures, facing climate change scenarios and sea-level rise emergencies in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of the rainfall runoff pollution: case study of Shiwuli River watershed, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall runoff is the key factor of water quality deterioration in highly urbanized area, which is characterized by intensive human activities and frequent extreme weather events. Urban landscape system is composed of highly diverse and heterogeneous land patches, which makes the effective management of urban runoff pollution difficult. Therefore, high-resolution land-use data is imperative for the identification and analysis of spatial-temporal characteristics of urban runoff pollution. In this study, Shiwuli River watershed, a rapidly urbanizing area in China, is selected as the study area. We first interpret nine kinds of land-use types with a high-resolution remote sensing data of 2 m x 2 m. Then, a localized Soil Conservation Service model based on field observation and rainfall experiments is applied to map the spatial-temporal pattern of runoff pollution. The results indicate that the COD, NH3-N, TP, and TN load generated by the runoff in the watershed accounted for 23.4%, 3.7%, 8.2%, and 9.0% of the total pollution load in 2016, respectively. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal pattern of the assessed runoff pollution was mainly subject to the distribution of rainfall and land-use patterns. We suggest that the sponge city construction combined with surface pollution control is an effective way to reduce the runoff pollution. This study highlights the necessity to identify spatial-temporal hotspots in developing precise pollution control measures, which provides valuable information for pollution control policy-making in Shiwuli River watershed and could serve as a reference for other river watersheds undergoing rapid urbanization.

TI  - Generating 250 m-resolution regional NO<sub>2</sub> concentration products first from MODIS retrievals using extreme gradient boosting
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is highly related to multiple adverse human health and environmental effects. The current satellite-derived surface NO2 products generally have a coarse spatial resolution, limiting their applications in evaluating the spatial characteristics of NO2 in urbans and their central districts, where the NO2 pollution and population density are relatively high. This study proposes an approach to produce the 250 m surface NO2 concentrations using an ensemble learning model based on MODIS-derived surface PM2.5 concentrations. It is the first time to produce such high spatial resolution of NO2 products from the satellite retrievals with high frequency. The approach was tested over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration of China. The model has high accuracy on instantaneous NO2 estimations with a cross-validated coefficient of determination of 0.82, a root-mean-square error of 8.5 mu g/m(3), and a mean prediction error of 6.2 mu g/m(3), and a mean relative prediction error of 20.8%, respectively. The model accurately captures the fine-detailed distribution of NO2 concentrations over the YRD region, urbans, and their central districts in YRD under different atmospheric pollutant levels. The ultrahigh spatial resolution NO2 products have an obvious advantage for producing finer NO2 distribution, possibly offering a way for locating NO2 emission sources and monitoring the local NO2 episodes. The products are useful for air pollution monitoring, controlling, and epidemiological- and environmental-related studies, especially in urbans and their districts. The study enriches the applications of MODIS in environmental studies.

TI  - Placental pathology of resuscitated apparent stillbirth
T2  - PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Resuscitated apparent stillbirth (RAS) is defined as an infant with APGAR scores of 0 at 1 minute of life who receives successful resuscitation. Assessment of placental pathology is considered standard of care in such infants, but the clinical significance of these placental findings as they relate to clinical outcomes has yet to be described within the literature. We report the findings of a retrospective study of placental pathology as defined by the Amsterdam and Dublin criteria of RAS infants born in South Australia over an 8-year period. The aim of this study was to assess whether placental pathology was able to predict RAS clinical outcomes of death, survival with adverse neurological outcomes, and survival with normal neurological outcomes. The RAS cohort within our study is small, reflecting the low incidence of RAS. Of the 25 RAS subjects 16 survived, five with abnormal neurological outcomes and 11 with normal neurological outcomes. No statistically significant difference was seen between the clinical outcome groups in the incidence of specific macroscopic and microscopic placental findings. No sentinel lesion was seen in any one clinical outcome group. Relevant placental pathology was found in all but one subject validating the role of placental pathology in determination of the aetiology of RAS. The most common finding was maternal vascular malperfusion. Placental pathology in RAS infants remains relevant but is unable to contribute to the matrix of predictive information available to the clinician and family.

TI  - Simulating future land use by coupling ecological security patterns and multiple scenarios
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A land use simulation model with coupling constraints of ecological security patterns (ESPs) and multiple scenarios (MSs) was developed using the PLUS model. The research scale was zoned with environmental functional regions, where land management policies were formulated. A case study in Anji County successfully demonstrated the applica-tion of the ESP-MS-PLUS model. First, we constructed three different levels of ESPs as ecological constraints by utiliz-ing ecosystem services evaluation and circuit theory. Second, four scenarios of land use and land cover changes (LUCCs) in 2034 were assumed, namely business as usual (BAU), priority given to urban development (PUD), priority given to ecological protection (PEP), and balanced urban development and ecological protection (BUE). Then, the basic ecological constraints (ecological red line areas and waters) and three types of ESPs were coupled with the four scenarios. The results of the simulation and analysis of landscape metrics under each scenario showed that the PEP and BUE scenarios would effectively reduce the degree and speed of ecological destruction. In addition, there were three environmental functional areas that could be used as priority areas for urban construction to ensure economic development. This study provides a new mechanism for land use optimization in the context of ecological protection at scales conducive to practice.

TI  - Development and validation of a modified QuEChERS method for extracting polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides from marine mammal blubber
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in blubber of key sentinel marine mammal species has been conducted using established techniques for decades. Although these methods for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide determination provide accurate and reproducible results, they possess some drawbacks in terms of cost, time, and a need for large volumes of toxic solvents. QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) extractions may help address these issues, but have not been applied to marine mammal blubber/adipose. As such, our aim was to develop, validate, and apply a QuEChERS method for the extraction of PCB and OC contaminants in marine mammal blubber. First, we tested multiple solid-phase extraction and clean-up steps to find the approach that provided the cleanest extracts along with consistent and acceptable analyte recovery, accuracy, and precision. QuEChERS extractions followed by two enhanced matrix removal-lipid (EMR-lipid), one primary-secondary amine (PSA), and one silica gel clean-up showed the highest matrix removal and acceptable recoveries of spiked internal (62 & ndash;97%) and external standards (61 & ndash;94%). Solvent usage was reduced by-393% and extraction time was reduced by-25% (from 16 to 12 h). Next, the method was validated using standard reference material (SRM) NIST 1945. Recovery experiments on SRM (n = 5) showed acceptable recovery for 76% and 77% of PCBs and OC pesticides, respectively, and high precision for & nbsp;73% and 69% of PCBs and OCs, respectively. Finally, the method was used on a set of southeast Greenland killer whales (n = 13), with previously published PCB and OC data. Bland-Altman plots indicated good agreement between QuEChERS and current-use methods for sigma PCBs and some OCs with no significant constant or propor-tional bias. These results demonstrate that this QuEChERS extraction method represents an effective, lower cost alternative to current-use extractions for PCBs and OCs in blubber, and likely other high-lipid samples.

TI  - MUSTFN: A spatiotemporal fusion method for multi-scale and multi-sensor remote sensing images based on a convolutional neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal data fusion is a commonly-used and well-proven technique to enhance the application potential of multi-source remote sensing images. However, most existing methods have trouble in generating quality fusion results when areas covered by the images undergoes rapid land cover changes or images have substantial registration errors. While deep learning algorithms have demonstrated their capabilities for imagery fusion, it is challenging to apply deep-learning-based fusion methods in regions that experiences persistent cloud covers and have limited cloud-free imagery observations. To address these challenges, we developed a Multi-scene Spatiotemporal Fusion Network (MUSTFN) algorithm based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our approach uses multi-level features to fuse images at different resolutions acquired by multiple sensors. Furthermore, MUSTFN uses the multi-scale features to overcome the effects of geometric registration errors between different images. Additionally, a multi-constrained loss function is proposed to improve the accuracy of imagery fusion over large areas and solve fusion and gap-filling problems simultaneously by utilizing cloud-contaminated images with the fine-tuning method. Compared with several commonly-used methods, our pro-posed MUSTFN performs better in fusing the 30-m Landsat-7 images and 500-m MODIS images over a small area that has undergone large changes (the average relative Mean Absolute Errors (rMAE) of the first four bands are 6.8% by MUSTFN as compared to 14.1% by the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), 12.8% by the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF), 8.4% by the Extended Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (ESRCNN), 8.1% by the Spatiotemporal Fusion Using a Generative Adversarial Network (STFGAN)). In particularly for images at different resolutions with different registration accuracies (e.g., 16-m Chinese GaoFen-1 and 500-m MODIS), MUSTFN achieved fusion results of good quality with an average rMAE of 9.3% in spectral reflectance at the first four bands. Finally, we demonstrated the applicability of MUSTFN (average rMAE of 9.18%) when fusing long-term Landsat-8 composite images and MODIS images over a large region (830 km x 600 km). Overall, our results suggest the effectiveness of MUSTFN to address the challenges in imagery fusion, including rapid land cover changes between image acquisition dates, geometric misregistration between images and limited availabilities of cloud-free images.

TI  - Spatiotemporal modelling for assessing the impacts of land use/land cover on Idku lake, Egypt
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable water resource management requires a knowledge of the spatiotemporal changes of land use and land cover (LULC). This is an essential preparatory stage in identifying the natural or anthropogenic activities that had a negative impact on it. This research used the spatiotemporal modelling approach in Idku Lake, Egypt between 1973 and 2021. Various image processing such as vector analysis, spectral indices and supervised classification were used to classify the satellite images into the identified LULC features. Water, hydrophytes, and fish farms were recognized using multi-temporal Landsat images. The findings indicated that the hydrophytes growth is a minor component that has in the past caused a decrease in the lake's water area, particularly in the years 1973, 1985, and 1990. This hydrophyte cover is caused by both the drainage system and the nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. But from 2003 to 2021, this factor started to decline due to the government's efforts to protect the lake. An additional issue that started to appear, particularly from 1985, is human activities including the establishment of fish farms. This led to the loss of 72.89 km(2) (57%) over a 48-year period. In other words, human encroachments on Idku lake are the primary cause of its deformation, and this needs to be taken into account to ensure that it is preserved as an aspect of sustainable development of water sources. The methodology and results of this research will assist the government and stockholders in developing a future plan for protecting the environment and ecosystems not only in Idku lake but also in other lakes with similar environmental conditions.

TI  - Temperature shocks and gambling*
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change threatens sustainable development by influencing myriad of outcomes. We examine if temperature shocks contribute to the gambling, which is a major public health concern globally. We use longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey coupled with satellite data capturing neighbourhood temperature shocks. Our results suggest that temperature shocks increase the prevalence of gambling, and that psychological distress and social capital are channels through which temperature shocks transmit to gambling behaviour. Our results point to the need for policies that promote mental health and encourage social capital amidst extreme weather events in order to offset the effects of weather shocks on gambling behaviour.

TI  - The coastal fog and ecological balance for plants in the Jizan region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog water collection provides a sustainable resource for watering of crops. The Jizan region is one of the smallest states in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) but very rich with unique flora, fauna, landscape diversity, and occurrence of fog. According to satellite data from the period between (1991-2021) the average visibility in this fog belt varied between 5 m and 100 m. Specific relief properties, such as elevation contrast, present rare space for flora preservation and sustainable fog utilization and use in the watering of crops. Some results showed that number of foggy days is not equal and can be divided in three big cycles. It was estimated that 8 x 1013 L, or 80 m(3) of fresh water from fog per year, could be used for drinking and partly for farming in Jizan region from settlements Al Araq and Al Gandla, city of Jizan, Al Madaya, Al Mubarakiyah, Muwassam. This amount of water varied through time. The last observational period had large amount of water, 10 x 1013 L or 100 m(3). The main methodologies used in this research were advanced GIS (Geographical Information Systems), Remote Sensing (RS), and numerical analysis. Satellite data were downloaded from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Landsat 8 and 9 satellite missions. This kind of alternative water may produce stability for three main plants in Jizan region, palm, wheat and olive. Typical arid regions in KSA can be transformed by water used from the fog.

TI  - Potential of frost damage of off-ground foundation stones in Norwegian Stave Churches since 1950 using land surface temperature
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The Stave Churches (SCs) are one of the most iconic heritages in Norway, and only 28 medieval SCs have survived till our age in this country. They are built on wood with staves and wooden sleepers standing off the ground on foundation stones which have the primary purpose of guaranteeing structural support, ensuring integrity of the leveled foundation, and avoid ground water or rainwater penetration up to the valuable wooden structures. This paper aims to analyze the risk of Freeze-Thaw (F-T) decay on the foundation stones of the 28 SCs using an algorithm with a single climate input parameter i.e., the land surface temperature, extracted from the Global Land Data Assimilation System GLDAS which integrates satellite-and ground-based observational data products. The novel proposed algorithm estimates a climate-based index of F-T risk on foundation stones starting from the analysis of the variability of a 70-year (i.e., 1950 to 2020) land surface temperature datasets at these 28 locations. The outcome is further used to evaluate the average lifetime (half-life time) of foundation stones as well as the number of interventions necessary to guarantee their structural soundness thus providing a quantitative, predictive, and timely effective information to SC churches managers, and conservators on the climate change effect on foundation stones degradation at support of prioritization of maintenance interventions.

TI  - Epidemic Surveillance of Influenza Infections: A Network-Free Strategy-Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, 2008-2011
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The ease of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) non-pharmacological interventions and the increased susceptibility during the past COVID-19 pandemic could be a precursor for the resurgence of influenza, potentially leading to a severe outbreak in the winter of 2022 and future seasons. The recent increased availability of data on Electronic Health Records (EHR) in public health systems, offers new opportunities to monitor individuals to mitigate outbreaks.Methods: We introduced a new methodology to rank individuals for surveillance in temporal networks, which was more practical than the static networks. By targeting previously infected nodes, this method used readily available EHR data instead of the contact -network structure.Results: We validated this method qualitatively in a real-world cohort study and evaluated our approach quantitatively by comparing it to other surveillance methods on three temporal and empirical networks. We found that, despite not explicitly exploiting the contacts' network structure, it remained the best or close to the best strategy. We related the performance of the method to the public health goals, the reproduction number of the disease, and the underlying temporal-network structure (e.g., burstiness). Discussion: The proposed strategy of using historical records for sentinel surveillance selection can be taken as a practical and robust alternative without the knowledge of individual contact behaviors for public health policymakers.

TI  - Large-Scale Rice Mapping Based on Google Earth Engine and Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mastering the distribution of rice cultivation has important implications for food subsidies and food security. We used Google Earth Engine, a remote sensing big data cloud computing platform, and combined with multi-source remote sensing imagery (e.g. Sentinel, Landsat) to conduct experiments on large-scale range rice classification algorithms in Hunan Province, China. Firstly, a multi-source remote sensing data fusion algorithm was constructed to generate complete remote sensing images of the rice growth cycle in order to deal with the missing data phenomenon caused by clouds and fog. Then, different rice types such as early rice, middle rice and late rice were effectively classified based on the growth phenological characteristics of various rice, combined with NDVI time series characteristics for analysis. Finally, the experimental accuracy was evaluated by UAV. The overall accuracy of early rice, middle rice, late rice were 85.15%, 89.78%, 86.01. Experimental results showed that our method achieved high accuracy and robustness, which also provided some meaningful reference for other rice classification studies.

TI  - Monitoring multiple satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products within the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) data assimilation system
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)provides near-real-time forecast and reanalysis of aerosols using the ECMWFIntegrated Forecasting System with atmospheric composition extension,constrained by the assimilation of MODIS and the Polar Multi-Sensor AerosolOptical Properties (PMAp) aerosol optical depth (AOD). The objective of thiswork is to evaluate two new near-real-time AOD products to prepare for theirassimilation into CAMS, namely the Copernicus AOD (collection 1) from the Seaand Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on board Sentinel 3-A/Bover ocean and the NOAA EPS AOD (v2.r1) from VIIRS on board S-NPP andNOAA20 over both land and ocean. The differences between MODIS (C6.1), PMAp(v2.1), VIIRS (v2.r1), and SLSTR (C1) AOD as well as their departure from themodeled AOD were assessed at the model grid resolution (i.e., level-3)using the 3-month AOD average (December 2019-February 2020 and March-May 2020). VIIRS and MODIS show the best consistency across the products, which isexplained by instrument and retrieval algorithm similarities. VIIRS AOD isfrequently lower over the ocean background and higher over biomass burningand dust source land regions compared to MODIS. VIIRS shows larger spatialcoverage over land and resolves finer spatial structures such as thetransport of Australian biomass burning smoke over the Pacific, which can beexplained by the use of a heavy aerosol detection test in the retrievalalgorithm. Our results confirm the positive offset over ocean (i) betweenTerra/MODIS and Aqua/MODIS due to the non-corrected radiometric calibrationdegradation of Terra/MODIS in the Dark Target algorithm and (ii) betweenSNPP/VIIRS and NOAA20/VIIRS due to the positive bias in the solar reflectivebands of SNPP/VIIRS. SLSTR AOD shows much smaller level-3 values than therest of the products, which is mainly related to differences in spatialrepresentativity at the IFS grid spatial resolution due to the stringentcloud filtering applied to the SLSTR radiances. Finally, the geometrycharacteristics of the instrument, which drive the range of scatteringangles sampled by the instrument, can explain a large part of thedifferences between retrievals such as the positive offset between PMAp datasets from MetOp-B and MetOp-A.

TI  - EOdal: An open-source Python package for large-scale agroecological research using Earth Observation and gridded environmental data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation by means of remote sensing imagery and gridded environmental data opens tremendous opportunities for systematic capture, quantification and interpretation of plant-environment interactions through space and time. The acquisition, maintenance and processing of these data sources, however, requires a unified software framework for efficient and scalable integrated spatio-temporal analysis taking away the burden of data and file handling from the user. Existing software products either cover only parts of these requirements, exhibit a high degree of complexity, or are closed-source, which limits reproducibility of research. With the open-source Python library EOdal (Earth Observation Data Analysis Library) we propose a novel software that enables the development of fully reproducible spatial data science chains through the strict use of open-source developments. Thanks to its modular design, EOdal enables advanced data warehousing especially for remote sensing data, sophisticated spatio-temporal analysis and intersection of different data sources, as well as nearly unlimited expandability through application programming interfaces (APIs).

TI  - Earth Observation and Artificial Intelligence <i>Understanding emerging ethical issues and opportunities</i>
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethics is a central and growing concern in all applications utilizing artificial intelligence (AI). Earth observation (EO) and remote sensing (RS) research relies heavily on both big data and AI or machine learning (ML). While this reliance is not new, with increasing image resolutions and the growing number of EO/RS use cases that have a direct impact on governance, policy, and the lives of people, ethical issues are taking center stage. In this article, we provide scientists engaged with AI for EO (AI4EO) research, 1) a practically useful overview of the key ethical issues emerging in this field, with concrete examples from within EO/RS to explain these issues, and 2) a first road map (flowchart) that scientists can use to identify ethical issues in their ongoing research. With this, we aim to sensitize scientists to these issues and create a bridge to facilitate constructive and regular communication among scientists engaged in AI4EO research, on the one hand, and ethics research, on the other hand. The article also provides detailed illustrations from four AI4EO research fields to explain how scientists can redesign research questions to more effectively grab ethical opportunities to address real-world problems that are otherwise akin to ethical dilemmas with no winwin solution in sight. The article concludes by providing recommendations to institutions that want to support ethically mindful AI4EO research and provides suggestions for future research in this field.

M3  - Article
AB  - Object Land snails are found to be an appropriate sentinel organism, and the biomarkers chosen are effective for terrestrial heavy metal biomonitoring. The study aimed to compare the biological, biochemistry, and histology of two land snails in the Ismailia governorate, Egypt. Methods Random snails were collected from January 2015 to December 2015 from two sites in the Ismailia Governorate. The study used morphometric parameters and oxidative stress as well as histopathological changes to clarify the impact of heavy metals on two of the land snails. Results It was noticed that most of the morphometric parameters were higher in Eobania vermiculata (Sp. 1) than in Monacha obstructa (Sp. 2). In the more polluted areas with heavy metals, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and total protein contents were changed in the snails. The snails displayed lower levels of glutathione (GSH) as compared to snails at a less polluted site. GSH and LPO levels have a negative relationship between them. Histopathological alterations in the digestive gland were more obvious in the general architecture of the digestive gland which had lost its tubular appearance. The excretory cells showed an increase in their excretory granules' number and size while calcium cells decreased. Gonad follicles have lost their normal architecture with the degeneration of some stages of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Conclusion The overall results display the usefulness of E. vermiculata and M. obstructa land snails as bioindicator organisms and support the application of this ecotoxicological approach for evaluating the biological impact of toxins. E.vermiculata is more abundant than M. obstructa. The density, morphometric, biochemical, and histology of E. vermiculata and M. obstructa were different.

TI  - Semantic object-based urban scene analysis for feature fusion of VHR imagery and Lidar DSM
T2  - SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More complexities in urban areas due to the existence of buildings with roofs made of various materials, roads and parking lots, diverse plant species and vehicles along with developed very high spatial resolution (VHR) remote sensing imageries lead to increase the difficulties of urban objects recognition. Defining human cognition semantic categories of land cover objects is proposed in this paper to improve the object-based scene analysis. After performing the segmentation algorithm, semantically feature fusion of the VHR imagery and Lidar DSM is performed in the context of object-based procedures. For this reason, high-level semantics composed of human cognition object categorization and visual-conceptual descriptions of land cover objects in the complex urban scene is used for low-level features measurement followed by classification rules generation. The pan-sharpened WorldView-2 satellite image and Lidar DSM over a complex urban area in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) are used to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed semantic object-based scene analysis. The evaluation of the obtained object recognition results shows the 93.98% overall accuracy and 0.937 Kappa coefficient. Comparing the obtained semantic object recognition results with non-semantic object-based procedures indicates the improvements in overall accuracy for 20.68 and 2.18% in object-based spectral and object-based spectral-structural classifications, respectively. Increasing the true positive pixels of the spectrally and height similar object categories (such as buildings and road), and using threshold training without requiring high-dimensional training samples are some of the advantages of the proposed semantic object-based scene analysis method.

TI  - Semi-supervised 3D-InceptionNet for segmentation and survival prediction of head and neck primary cancers
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancers, known collectively as head and neck cancers, usually begin in the squamous cells that line the head and neck's mucosal surfaces, forming a tumour mass. It usually develops in the salivary glands, nose and sinuses, voice box (larynx), throat (pharynx), or muscles or nerves in the head and neck, but these types of cancer are much less common than squamous cell carcinomas. Nearly 4% of all cancers are H&N cancers with a very low survival rate (a five-year survival rate of 64.7%). The most commonly used molecular imaging procedure for diagnosing or guiding the treatment of head and neck cancer is Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning (FDG-PET/CT), which is often used in conjunction with computed tomography (CT) scanning, and sentinel node biopsy. This work presents a semi-supervised 3D Inception -Residual framework with 3D depth-wise convolution and squeeze and excitation block. In the first phase, we performed pre-training of 3D-auto-encoder using both train and test unlabelled dataset. We, then used pre -trained weight to fine-tune the later network which is aided with depth-wise convolution-inception encoder consisting of an additional 3D squeeze and excitation block and a 3D depth-wise convolution-based residual learning decoder under deep supervision (Semi 3D-IncNet). The proposed network not only helps to recalibrate the channel-wise features adaptively through explicit inter-dependencies modelling but also integrates the coarse and fine features resulting in accurate tumour segmentation. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of semi-supervised inception-residual encoder-decoder architecture in achieving better dice scores and the impact of depth-wise convolution in lowering the computational cost. For survival prediction, we applied random forest on deep, clinical, and radiomics features. Experiments were conducted on the benchmark HECKTOR2021 and HECKTOR2022 challenge showed significantly better performance by surpassing the state-of-the-artwork and achieved 0.824/0.836 and 0.754/0.678 Dice/Concordance index for HECKTOR2021 and HECKTOR2022 respectively. We made the model and code publicly available. 1

AB  - The current guidelines for the surgical care of cutaneous melanoma have been shaped by multiple randomized controlled clinical trials. Six prospective randomized trials performed between 1980 and 2004 have informed the current NCCN guidelines for margin excision in melanoma, and the currently enrolling MelMarT trial will provide important information on the safety of narrower surgical margins for thicker lesions in the era of SLNB. MSLT-I led to the common practice of SLNB for patients with intermediate thickness and thick melanomas primarily for prognostication and staging, and MSLT-II and DECOG-SLT demonstrated safety in observing the nodal basin with serial ultrasound compared with immediate CLND in patients with a positive sentinel node. Additionally, for patients with nodal disease (stage III), recent developments in targeted and immune therapy have led to effective adjuvant therapy options with demonstrated improvements in RFS. As the melanoma landscape continues to evolve with an increasing interest in neoadjuvant therapy approaches, it is anticipated that future clinical trials will continue to change practice, improving the care for patients with cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Deep learning based distributed scatterers acceleration approach: Distributed scatterers prediction Net
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed scatter (DS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar is a powerful technology for analyzing dis-placements of the earth's surface. Unfortunately, the preparatory step of DS pre-processing is enormously time consuming. The present research puts forward a deep learning-based approach called Distributed Scatterers Prediction Net (DSPN), that can reduce the computational load considerably. DSPN is a convolutional neural network, which generates DS candidate masks based on nine input layers. Masked pixels with low prospect of being DS are omitted during DS pre-processing. Tests on 6 different terrains in North Rhine-Westphalia and Sicily with Sentinel-1 data show that DSPN saves 11% to 87% computation time depending on the scene without significantly reducing coverage with information. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can effectively predict DS candidates and speeds up processing, indicating its potential for analyzing the big data of remote sensing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to do a classification in DS candidates and non-DS candidates as a preparatory step to DS pre-processing.

TI  - Occurrence of contaminants of emerging concern in the Eerste River, South Africa: Towards the optimisation of an urban water profiling approach for public- and ecological health risk characterisation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study evaluated the presence and fate of various contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from a South African wastewater treatment works (WWTW) and surface waters located around an urban setting. A total of 45 CECs were quantified from nine sampling locations over an 11-month period. Daily loads (g/day) of the target analytes in the WWTW showed persistence of some CECs, along with population-normalised daily loads (mg/day/1000inh) of pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse (DOA) that were estimated for the first time in the study area. Multiple chemical markers were recorded in river water located upstream of the WWTW discharge throughout the study period, suggesting a high degree of diffuse pollution from urban communities in the study area that are not connected to sewage networks or where sanitation services are limited. The potential of using defined surface water locations to perform community-wide substance use profiling for non-sewered communities was also explored. Environmental risk characterisation for the WWTW effluent and surface waters throughout the study period provided multiple risk quotients (RQ) for the target list of CECs spanning over various sentinel trophic levels. High risk profiles (RQ > 1.0) with a frequency of exceedance (FoE) larger than 75 % were recorded for several CECs in both WWTW effluent and surface water locations that suggest potential long-term ecological health risk impacts of pollution hotspot areas in the river catchment situated around the urban area. We present challenges in surface water quality within the study area that is relatable, or may even present more challenging, in other low- or middle-income country (LMICs) settings. The study also highlighted some challenges and limitations associated with the much-needed application of wastewater -based epidemiology (WBE) intervention in non-sewered communities that can inform on public health and communal substance use profiles of the entire urban setting.

TI  - Exploration of Potential Zones of Groundwater in Jamuna Watershed, Assam, by Applying Multi-influencing Factor Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a very valuable natural resource of freshwater availability on the earth. For sustainable and effective management of groundwater systems, it is essential to assess and continuously monitor the potential zones of groundwater across different parts of the world. The present work attempts to identify different potential zones of groundwater in Jamuna watershed, Assam, using remote sensing, GIS and multi-influencing factor techniques. Different influencing factors that have a direct or indirect influence on the resurgence of groundwater, which includes geomorphology, soil texture, geology, slope, drainage density, lineament concentration, rainfall, and land use, are considered in the study. Very good groundwater potentiality is observed in the south-western region of the watershed, while the north-eastern region is observed to be having poor potential zones of groundwater due to steep slopes and hilly terrain. The potential zones of groundwater have been validated with water yield data through correlation analysis, and it reveals a strong positive correlation between them. Further significance test validates the result.

TI  - Water hyacinth infestation in Lake Tana, Ethiopia: a review of population dynamics
T2  - LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Lake Tana, the largest lake in Ethiopia, has been severely threatened by water hyacinth infestation over the last decade, especially along the northeastern shore. Since this invasive weed is extremely difficult to eradicate, sustainable management strategies should be put in place to reduce negative impacts on local ecological and socio-economic systems; this requires a better understanding of the population dynamics. In this paper, we review the seasonal change of water hyacinth coverage in Lake Tana and explore its linkages with various environmental factors. During the rainy seasons, increased nutrient concentrations, humidity, and especially water level can promote the formation of extensive water hyacinth mats. In the dry season, diminishing lake water in surrounding floodplains, along with concomitantly increased temperature and solar radiation, may support seed germination and lead to the next life cycle. Currently, water hyacinth mainly occurs in northeastern Lake Tana due to coastal eutrophication, lake topography and westerlies. Expansion of the infested area is slowing down. However, further spread of water hyacinth is still possible in other parts of the lake basin due to changing climate and environmental conditions. Integrated control methods should be put in place in the near future to prevent water hyacinth infestation in Lake Tana, and upstream basin management is vital to reduce nutrients transportation into the lake as a long-term plan.

TI  - Identification of volatile organic compound emissions from anthropogenic and biogenic sources based on satellite observation of formaldehyde and glyoxal
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are serious pollutants in the atmosphere because of their toxicity and as precursors of secondary organic aerosols and ozone pollution. Although in-situ measurements provide accurate information on VOCs, their spatial coverage is limited and insufficient. In this study, we provide a global perspective for identifying anthropogenic VOC emission sources through the ratio of glyoxal to formaldehyde (RGF) based on satellite observations. We assessed typical cities and polluted areas in the mid latitudes and found that some Asian cities had higher anthropogenic VOC emissions than cities in Europe and America. For heavily polluted areas, such as the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the areas dominated by anthropogenic VOCs accounted for 23 % of the total study areas. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in RGF values was observed in the YRD and western United States, corresponding to a reduction in anthropogenic VOC emissions. Furthermore, developing countries appeared to have higher anthropogenic VOC emissions than developed countries. These observations could contribute to optimising industrial structures and setting stricter pollution standards to reduce anthropogenic VOCs in developing countries.

TI  - Knowledge of Mongolian veterinarians towards canine vector-borne diseases
T2  - ONE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mongolia is an expansive nation, dominated by agriculture with livestock under nomadic herder care contrib-uting significantly to the economy. Mongolian veterinarians service these herder's livestock and dogs, and are often the first point of contact for animal health advice, including ectoparasite prophylaxis. Dogs are competent reservoir and sentinel hosts for several zoonotic vector-borne diseases (VBD). These diseases in dogs can be dependent on the presence of other sylvatic or domestic reservoir hosts, the abundance of competent vectors and supporting environmental and climatic conditions. Therefore, VBD present a true One Health challenge. The direct and close association of nomadic herders with livestock and livestock protection dogs coupled with frequent relocation (associated with nomadic lifestyles) places all three host groups (herders, livestock and livestock protection dogs) at risk of acquiring VBD. Our study set out to investigate the overall knowledge, perceptions and practices of Mongolian veterinarians towards canine vector-borne diseases (CVBD). A hardcopy questionnaire was delivered through the Mongolian Veterinary Medical Association to a cohort of veterinarians representing 39% of Mongolia's total veterinary workforce with a 53% response rate. A total of 297 participants were included in the final study. The bulk of participants were livestock veterinarians, followed by mixed animal veterinarians. Overall Mongolian veterinarians' knowledge of CVBD were scored as low (58%; 0-3 points) or medium (32%; 4-6 points) on a ten-point scale. There was a significant discrepancy between self-rated and actual knowledge. Females had 1.7 (95% CI 1.1, 2.8) times higher knowledge compared with males and those veter-inarians who had 3-5 canine consultations per day were also found to have higher knowledge (odds ratio 1.4, 95% CI 0.4, 4.5). Most veterinarians utilised two or less resources to source information on CVBD over the previous 12 months. The potential of climate-induced emergence of vector populations and their associated pathogens makes it imperative that veterinarians in Mongolia have the necessary resources and knowledge to be on the forefront of CVBD preparedness and mitigation. This study identifies the knowledge gaps and addresses the need for further resources for Mongolian veterinarians to effectively engage in a One Health approach for negating CVBD in animals and humans.

TI  - Dam-mediated flooding impact on outpatient attendance and diarrhoea cases in northern Ghana: a mixed methods study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Floods are the most frequently occurring natural disaster and constitute a significant public health risk. Several operational satellite-based flood detection systems quantify flooding extent, but it is unclear how far the choice of satellite-based flood product affects the findings of epidemiological studies of associated public health risks. Few studies of flooding's health impacts have used mixed methods to enrich understanding of these impacts. This study therefore aims to evaluate the relationship between two satellite-derived flood products with outpatient attendance and diarrhoeal disease in northern Ghana, identifying plausible reasons for observed relationships via qualitative interviews. Methods A convergent parallel mixed methods design combined an ecological time series with focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Through an ecological time series component, monthly outpatient attendance and diarrhoea case counts from health facilities in two flood-prone districts for 2016-2020 were integrated with monthly flooding map layers classified via the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite sensors. The relationship between reported diarrhoea and outpatient attendance with flooding was examined using Poisson regression, controlling for seasonality and facility catchment population. Four focus group discussions with affected community members and four key informant interviews with health professionals explored flooding's impact on healthcare delivery and access. Results Flooding detected via Landsat better predicted outpatient attendance and diarrhoea than flooding via MODIS. Outpatient attendance significantly reduced as LandSat-derived flood area per facility catchment increased (adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.61-0.99, p < 0.05), whilst reported diarrhoea significantly increased with flood area per facility catchment (adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 4.27, 95% CI: 2.74-6.63, p < 0.001). Key informants noted how flooding affected access to health services as patients and health professionals could not reach the health facility and emergency referrals were unable to travel. Conclusions The significant reduction in outpatient attendance during flooding suggests that flooding impairs healthcare delivery. The relationship is sensitive to the choice of satellite-derived flood product, so future studies should consider integrating multiple sources of satellite imagery for more robust exposure assessment. Health teams and communities should plan spatially targeted flood mitigation and health system adaptation strategies that explicitly address population and workforce mobility issues.

TI  - Assessment of urban heat islands and thermal discomfort in the Amazonia biome in Brazil: A case study of Manaus city
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) is an important phenomenon due to its direct and indirect impacts on the health of the population residing in urban environments. Very few studies have been conducted on the relationships be-tween UHI and outdoor thermal comfort in the Amazonia biome. In this work, we analyzed the behavior of hourly variability of the UHI, heat index (HI), thermal discomfort, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Manaus (Brazil). The novelty of the study is to assess the degree of alteration of the UHI with changes in vegetation cover in the Amazon biome. Temperature and air humidity data were collected from six weather stations from July 2013 to July 2014. In addition, satellite images of the TM and OLI/TIRS sensors onboard the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites for the years 1987, 1998, 2007, and 2015 were used. The intensity of the UHI increased during the analyzed period. The weather stations located in the urban area had temperatures above 30.0 degrees C, while the temperatures in the rural area ranged from 25.0 to 26.5 degrees C. As a direct implication of the results found, it is noted that in Manaus, the UHI can reduce thermal comfort in urban spaces, directly impacting people's quality of life and health. The periods with the least amount of precipitation in the city (August and September) can generate thermal discomfort inside houses during the night period, meaning an increase in the number of hours in which people are exposed to heat.

TI  - Epidemiology, Disease Severity and Outcome of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and Influenza Viruses Coinfection Seen at Egypt Integrated Acute Respiratory Infections Surveillance, 2020-2022
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES & MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Cocirculation of influenza (Flu) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (SARS-CoV-2/Flu) represent a public health concern as it may worsen the severity and increase fatality from coronavirus disease 2019. An increase in the number of patients with coinfection was recently reported. We studied epidemiology, severity, and outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2/Flu coinfection seen at Egypt's integrated acute respiratory infections surveillance to better describe disease impact and guide effective preventive measures. Methods. The first two outpatients were seen daily, and every fifth patient admitted to 19 sentinel hospitals with respiratory symptoms was enrolled. Patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire and provided nasopharyngeal swabs to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza by real-time polymerase chain reaction at the central laboratory. Data from all patients with coinfection were obtained, and descriptive data analysis was performed for patients' demographics, clinical course, and outcome. Results. The total number of patients enrolled between January 2020 and April 2022 was 18,160 and 6,453 (35.5%) tested positive for viruses, including 52 (0.8%) coinfection. Of them, 36 (69.2%) were coinfected with Flu A/H3, 9 (17.3%) Flu-B, and 7 (13.5%) Flu A/H1. Patients' mean age was 33.2 +/- 21, 55.8% were males, and 20 (38.5%) were hospitalized, with mean hospital days 6.7 +/- 6. At the hospital, 14 (70.0%) developed pneumonia, 6 (30.0%) ICU admitted, and 4 (20.0%) died. The hospitalization rate among patients coinfected with Flu-B and Flu A/H3 was 55.6 and 41.7%, with mean hospital days (8.0 +/- 6 and 6.4 +/- 6), pneumonia infection (40.0 and 80.0%), ICU admission (40.0 and 26.7%), and death (20.0% for both), while no patients hospitalized with A/H1. Conclusions. The recent increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2/Flu coinfections was identified in Egypt. The disease could have a severe course and high fatality, especially in those coinfected with Flu-B and Flu A/H3. Monitoring disease severity and impact is required to guide preventive strategy.

TI  - Southern Ocean cloud and shortwave radiation biases in a nudged climate model simulation: does the model ever get it right?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean radiative bias continues to impact climate and weather models, including the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS). The radiative bias, characterised by too much shortwave radiation reaching the surface, is attributed to the incorrect simulation of cloud properties, including frequency and phase. To identify cloud regimes important to the Southern Ocean, we use k-means cloud histogram clustering, applied to a satellite product and then fitted to nudged simulations of the latest-generation ACCESS atmosphere model. We identify instances when the model correctly or incorrectly simulates the same cloud type as the satellite product for any point in time or space. We then evaluate the cloud and radiation biases in these instances. We find that when the ACCESS model correctly simulates the cloud type, cloud property and radiation biases of equivalent, or in some cases greater, magnitude remain compared to when cloud types are incorrectly simulated. Furthermore, we find that even when radiative biases appear small on average, cloud property biases, such as liquid or ice water paths or cloud fractions, remain large. Our results suggest that simply getting the right cloud type (or the cloud macrophysics) is not enough to reduce the Southern Ocean radiative bias. Furthermore, in instances where the radiative bias is small, it may be so for the wrong reasons. Considerable effort is still required to improve cloud microphysics, with a particular focus on cloud phase.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and to identify their determinants among students and staff during February to June in the academic year 2020-2021. We performed two complementary studies, a cross-sectional and a longitudinal component, using a questionnaire to collect nominal data and testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We describe the results and perform a univariate and multivariate analysis. The initial crude seroprevalence was 14.8% (95% CI: 13.1-16.5) and 22% (95% CI: 18.3-25.8) for students and staff respectively, and the active infection prevalence was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3-1) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.1-2). The overall incidence for persons at risk was 2.73 per 100 person-month and 2.89 and 2.34 per 100 person-month for students and staff, respectively. Socioeconomic, self-reported knowledge, risk perceptions and contact pattern variables were positively associated with the outcome while sanitary measure compliance was negatively associated, the same significance trend was observed in multivariate analysis. In the longitudinal component, epidemiological close contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection was a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection while the highest socioeconomic status level was protective as was compliance with sanitary measures. The small number of active cases detected in these schools suggests a low transmission among children in school and the efficacy of public health measures implemented, at least in the epidemiological scenario of the study period. The major contribution of this study was to provide results and evidence that help analyze the transmission dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the associations between sanitary protocols implemented, and measures to avoid SARS-CoV-2 spread in schools.

TI  - Multicomponent Induction Logging Responses in Layered Uniaxial and Biaxial Anisotropic Media
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to different sedimentary environments, the realistic formation always presents different electrical anisotropic characteristics. Multicomponent induction logging technology is an efficient method to solve complicated electrical anisotropy problems. However, because of the mathematical complexity, the investigation of unconventional electrical anisotropy in borehole geophysics is still insufficient. Additional situations, such as the classification of electrical anisotropy and the corresponding solution, need to be considered. For convenience, we introduce a universal algorithm to solve arbitrary electrical anisotropic problems. Uniaxial and biaxial anisotropic resistivity media are studied. In addition, the anisotropic dip and azimuth angles are used to further characterize the complex electrical anisotropy conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the robustness of the algorithm, and illustrate the tool responses under different electrical anisotropic situations. It can be concluded that anisotropic dip and azimuth can exert a great influence on triaxial induction logging responses. Some important phenomena can be observed; for example, critical borehole and critical anisotropic dip exist in the rotated uniaxial and biaxial media. Different monotonic rules can be found before and after these critical angles. Cross-coupling magnetic components, H-xy (H-yx) and H-yz (H-zy), are closely related to the anisotropic azimuth. The proposed algorithm can effectively overcome the deficiency of the traditional method and reduce the uncertainties in resistivity interpretation.

TI  - A relational approach to social impact: Moving beyond instrumental and consumer approaches
T2  - PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Social impact can be understood as the real or perceived, intended or unintended, relational and agentic con-sequences that emerge from organizational decisions or actions for individuals, communities, and societies. Inherent here is the recognition that social impact aligns with consequences, whether it be on individuals, communities, and societies, and that these consequences stem from organizational decisions and behaviors. Drawing on wider social impact scholarship, this paper identifies two approaches-instrumental and consum-er-that have provided lenses on how organizations make decisions about social impact and related conse-quences, and the level of involvement stakeholders have in these decisions. This paper proposes that the understanding of social impact should evolve to reflect the relational worldview advocated in the public relations discipline, which is one that emphasizes the importance of organizations, individuals, and communities contributing to a fully functioning society. A relational lens shows that social impact can be understood as changes-whether they be intended or unintended, anticipated or unanticipated, positive or negative-in the way people live, experience, sustain, and function within their society, resulting from organizational decisions and consequent behaviors as co-determined by organizations and their stakeholders. The relational approach re-quires the adoption of a relational perspective on identifying, predicting, evaluating, managing, and reporting on social impact, operationalized via the seven-step Relational Framework of Social Impact conceptualized in this paper. While social impact is a relatively new term in the public relations literature, this paper highlights how public relations scholarship is well placed to enrich the social impact discipline due its emphasis on fostering a fully functioning society.

TI  - Self Psychology's Contribution to the Spiritual Dimension of Psychoanalysis
T2  - PSYCHOANALYTIC INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - For a generation now, the future development of psychoanalysis has been awaiting a proper absorption of the spiritual dimension into the fabric of meta-theory and therapeutic practice. This paper proposes self psychology as a paradigm capable of making a unique contribution to the study of the spiritual dimension in human psyche, and in the encounter between a human and her/his Other.The feasibility of a spiritual psychoanalytic thinking originated in the conceptual passage from the Guilty man and the Tragic man to the Mystic man, and it springs from the shift from a psychoanalysis based on an orientation of separateness towards a psychoanalysis anchored in unified worldview. Four crucial contributions make self psychology a pioneering pathfinder in systematic theorization of the spiritual in psychoanalysis: A. the 'self' as flow-concept between the experience of structured psyche and the being of unstructured spirit; B. the absolute and the individual's ability to reside in it via the contextual web of selfobject matrix; C. the transformation of a human's evolution from emergence into individual existence, to the human's dissolving into transcendent being of supra-individual existence of participation in the world; and D. therapeutic change, that is not satisfied merely with change-making within existing materials but dares to aspire to the creation of as-yet non-existing spiritual states of mind which deserve to come into being. The essay concludes with an examination of the spiritual dimension ingrained in self-psychology and its application to the political field and the unsolved riddle of leadership.

TI  - Worldview Orientations and Personal and Social Risk Perceptions for COVID-19 in a US Population-Based Sample
T2  - JOURNAL OF PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Adoption of COVID-19 preventive behaviors involves considering personal risk and the risk to others. Consequently, many COVID-19 prevention measures are intended to protect both the individual engaging in the behavior and others in the population. Yet, the preponderance of research is focused on perceptions of an individual's personal risk, making risk perception for others a critical area for investigation. Two worldview orientations describing values regarding how society should be organized, hierarchy-beliefs prioritizing social hierarchy, and individualism-beliefs prioritizing personal autonomy, have been linked to a range of risk perceptions. This study objective is to examine the association of worldview orientations with COVID-19 risk perceptions for oneself and others in a United States context. Using a national sample of 410 U.S. adults, we examined the associations between worldview orientations and six facets of risk (absolute risk, risk certainty, comparative risk, risk severity, fear, feelings of risk) using demographics-adjusted multivariable regression models. We conducted separate analyses for each of the following referents: (1) personal risk, (2) risk for the average person within the United States, and (3) risk to people within specific social groups (e.g., family, co-workers). Results indicate that stronger hierarchical and individualistic orientations were associated with lower COVID-19 risk perceptions for all three referents. The results were particularly consistent for fear and feelings of risk. Individualism was related to higher risk perception certainty for personal risk and the risk to people within specific social groups. Hierarchy was related to lower perceived severity for all referents. Findings suggest that U.S. public health messaging sensitive to worldview orientations may be needed to optimize acceptance of recommendations for protective behaviors, including vaccination. The relationship of worldview orientations to health risk perceptions may help guide messaging for future infectious outbreaks where risk perceptions are t drivers of protective behavior.

TI  - Modelling the Public Perception of Urban Public Space Lighting Based on SDGSAT-1 Glimmer Imagery: A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Public space lighting is important for public perception, human health and urban planning. Previous studies used nighttime light remote sensing data to evaluate light pollution and its impacts on human health, few investigated the impact on public perception. This study combines Beijing's SDGSAT-1 imagery with ground-measured and public perception data to evaluate the feasibility of SDGSAT-1 images simulating public perception. First, ground measurements were performed to collect light attributes and questionnaires were distributed to assess public safety and comfort. Next, the relationship between SDGSAT-1 image and measured illuminance was established. Lastly, public perception in Beijing was estimated. The results show that, (1) public perception is affected by panoramic illuminance, uniformity, and blue light; (2) although illuminance is positively related to public perception, it shows diminishing marginal returns; (3) a strong correlation is found between panoramic illu-minance and SDGSAT-1 image; (4) the perception map shows that most areas in Beijing can provide safe and comfortable lighting, while there are also insufficient or overlit in some places. This study explores methods for assessing public perceptions by satellite data, indicates remote sensing can provide a larger-scale and quanti-tative evaluation of public perception, which can contribute to urban lighting design and sustainable development.

AB  - Geospatial imagery play a key role in deciding land usage for agrarian planning and assessment by acknowledging the food security problems, impacts of climatic changes, and global population increase. The proposed approach provides geospatial methods combined with machine learning methods to predict crop yield for a specific Region of Interest, including different weather patterns. This research utilizes U-Net and Random Forest algorithm to predict the agricultural yield estimation and comprehensively analyse the yield prediction specific to the Vellore region of interest. The study area of 28.4 hectares is validated with specific labelled classes to estimate the agricultural produce. The proposed method demonstrates a well-suited yield mapping of vegetation from sentinel images through a combination of U-Net and RF at 99.38% for large-scale crop yield prediction.

TI  - Use of maximum entropy to improve validation and prediction of active fires in a Brazilian savanna region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring fires using satellite images is a fundamental tool for managers of protected areas (PAs). However, false alerts hinder their ability and make their application unfeasible, since there are few fire brigades available for field checks. Thus, this research proposes the validation, identification, and prediction of active fires for the years 2001 to 2018 for a protected area of the Brazilian savanna. The validation was performed by counting the active fires that were effectively contained in a burning area by cross-referencing MODIS sensor images. Iden-tification was performed by analyzing the spectral behavior of burning and non-burning in the active fire area. The maximum entropy was calculated from the spectral values and compared between an active focus with and without burning. In the prediction, the climatic conditions of the month before burning were analyzed, and the maximum entropy value was evaluated for model viability. The results indicated that only 30% of the active fires were actually in a burned area. The use of maximum entropy favors the improvement of the MODIS active fire product. The confirmed fires were in regions where the probability was above 75%, whereas the non-burning fires were approximately 60%. The variables evapotranspiration, wind speed, water deficit, and road prox-imity were the most relevant for the active fire prediction model. For the validation years 2019 and 2020, this method predicted the location of fires in 75% of the cases. This methodology, once employed by PA managers, can ensure accurate, efficient, and cost-effective monitoring of forest fire prevention and combat.

TI  - Human and vector behaviors determine exposure to <i>Anopheles</i> in Namibia
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although the Republic of Namibia has significantly reduced malaria transmission, regular outbreaks and persistent transmission impede progress towards elimination. Towards an understanding of the protective efficacy, as well as gaps in protection, associated with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), human and Anopheles behaviors were evaluated in parallel in three malaria endemic regions, Kavango East, Ohangwena and Zambezi, using the Entomological Surveillance Planning Tool to answer the question: where and when are humans being exposed to bites of Anopheles mosquitoes?Methods: Surveillance activities were conducted during the malaria transmission season in March 2018 for eight consecutive nights. Four sentinel structures per site were selected, and human landing catches and human behavior observations were consented to for a total of 32 collection nights per site. The selected structures were representative of local constructions (with respect to building materials and size) and were at least 100 m from each other. For each house where human landing catches were undertaken, a two-person team collected mosquitoes from 1800 to 0600 hours.Results: Surveillance revealed the presence of the primary vectors Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles funestus s.s., along with secondary vectors (Anopheles coustani sensu lato and Anopheles squamosus), with both indoor and outdoor biting behaviors based on the site. Site-specific human behaviors considerably increased human exposure to vector biting. The interaction between local human behaviors (spatial and temporal presence alongside LLIN use) and vector behaviors (spatial and temporal host seeking), and also species composition, dictated where and when exposure to infectious bites occurred, and showed that exposure was primarily indoors in Kavango East (78.6%) and outdoors in Ohangwena (66.7%) and Zambezi (81.4%). Human behavior-adjusted exposure was significantly different from raw vector biting rate.Conclusions: Increased LLIN use may significantly increase protection and reduce exposure to malaria, but may not be enough to eliminate the disease, as gaps in protection will remain both indoors (when people are awake and not using LLINs) and outdoors. Alternative interventions are required to address these exposure gaps. Focused and question-based operational entomological surveillance together with human behavioral observations may considerably improve our understanding of transmission dynamics as well as intervention efficacy and gaps in protection.

TI  - Comparison of OCO-2 target observations to MUCCnet - is it possible to capture urban X<sub>CO2</sub> gradients from space?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we compare Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) measurements of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (DMF) of CO<INF>2</INF> (X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF>) and its urban-rural differences against ground-based remote sensing data measured by the Munich Urban Carbon Column network (MUCCnet). Since April 2020, OCO-2 has regularly conducted target observations in Munich, Germany. Its target-mode data provide high-resolution X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> within a 15 km x 20 km target field of view that is greatly suited for carbon emission studies from space in cities and agglomerated areas. OCO-2 detects urban X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> with a root mean square different (RMSD) of less than 1 ppm when compared to the MUCCnet reference site. OCO-2 target X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> is biased high against the ground-based measurements. The close proximity of MUCCnet's five fully automated remote sensing sites enables us to compare spaceborne and ground-based X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> in three urban areas of Munich separately (center, north, and west) by dividing the target field into three smaller comparison domains. Due to this more constrained collocation, we observe improved agreement between spaceborne and ground-based X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> in all three comparison domains. For the first time, X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> gradients within one OCO-2 target field of view are evaluated against ground-based measurements. We compare X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> gradients in the OCO-2 target observations to gradients captured by collocated MUCCnet sites. Generally, OCO-2 detects elevated X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> in the same regions as the ground-based monitoring network. More than 90 % of the observed spaceborne gradients have the same orientation as the X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> gradients measured by MUCCnet. During our study, urban-rural enhancements are found to be in the range of 0.1 to 1 ppm. The low urban-rural gradients of typically well below 1 ppm in Munich during our study allow us to test OCO-2's lower detection limits for intra-urban X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> gradients. Urban X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> gradients recorded by the OCO-2 instruments and MUCCnet are strongly correlated (R2=0.68) with each other and have an RMSD of 0.32 ppm. A case study, which includes a comparison of one OCO-2 target overpass to WRF-GHG modeled X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF>, reveals a similar distribution of enhanced CO<INF>2</INF> column abundances in Munich. In this study, we address OCO-2's capability to detect small-scale spatial X<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF> differences within one target observation. Our results suggest OCO-2's potential to assess anthropogenic emissions from space.

TI  - Pan-oceanic distribution of mercury (Hg) in sea turtles: a review
T2  - ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - With no known biological function, mercury (Hg) is highly toxic, bio-accumulates, and biomagnifies up the food web. Long-living marine animals, such as sea turtles, can be exposed to Hg in the oceans. The wide distributions of these reptiles and lifespans compatible with Hg residence time in ocean surface waters (approximately 30 yr) makes them reliable biological monitors of the long-term changes in Hg concentrations in the oceans. Taking this into consideration, we conducted a thorough review of studies to compare the concentrations of Hg in the 7 species of sea turtles distributed in different regions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. Hg concentrations in muscle and scutes of Chelonia mydas were highest in the South Atlantic, whereas the highest concentrations found in Caretta caretta occurred in the Mediterranean Sea. The differences could be associated with the feeding habits of each species and the characteristics of the environment, such as the oligotrophic nature of the water and the lower productivity in the Mediterranean Sea. Unfortunately, few studies exist for the other 5 sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea, Eretmochelys imbricata, Lepidochelys olivacea, L. kempii, and Natator depressus), which hampers a more detailed regional or ecological comparison among species. The results found in this review reveal information gaps that should be filled through more numerous studies focused on different oceanic regions and species.

TI  - Fusing GEDI with earth observation data for large area aboveground biomass mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate and spatially explicit estimation of biomass is required for sustainable forest management, pre-vention of biodiversity loss, and carbon accounting for climate change mitigation. This study offers a method-ology to generate wall-to-wall aboveground biomass density (AGBD) maps that exclusively relies on open access earth observation (EO) data. Specifically, spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR data were fused with Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar, Sentinel-2 multispectral, elevation, and land cover data to produce biomass maps of Australia and the United States for 2020. The gradient boosting machine learning framework was applied to predict AGBD and its uncertainty at the resolutions of 100 m and 200 m. The per-formance of models based on (1) Sentinel-2 imagery and land cover and (2) a combination of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 imagery with elevation and land cover data were compared. The most accurate gradient boosting model was identified using a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with a 5-fold cross-validation. The Sentinel -2 imagery and land cover data analysis resulted in AGBD estimated with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.61 - 0.71, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 59 - 86 Mg/ha, and relative root-mean-square error (RMSE%) of 45 - 80%. The accuracy of the models improved with the addition of Sentinel-1 and elevation data: AGBD estimation with R2 of 0.66 - 0.74, RMSE of 55 - 81 Mg/ha, and RMSE% of 41 - 77%. It was found that Sentinel-2 and land cover-derived predictors were the most important in estimating annual AGBD. The proposed method also reduced the saturation effect, which is common in high biomass areas when predicting AGBD using satellite imagery. Prediction maps produced in this study could serve as a baseline for current AGB stocks of forested lands equal to 9.8 Pg and 37.1 Pg in Australia and the United States, respectively. Overall, this research high-lights methodological opportunities for combining open access EO data to yield more accurate and globally applicable AGB maps through data fusion.

TI  - Mapping the Changjiang Diluted Water in the East China Sea during summer over a 10-year period using GOCI satellite sensor data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Changjiang River loads freshwater into the East China Sea (ECS) and the Yellow Sea (YS). A low-salinity plume known as Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) is formed by mixing with saline ambient waters; it disperses toward Jeju Island and the East/Japan Sea due to the dominant southerly wind and tide during summer. To map the offshore surface CDW in the ECS, a proxy was developed using surface water beam attenuation (c) and salinity from 18 annual summer cruises matched with synchronous Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data. We followed a two-step empirical approach. First, a relationship between in situ salinity and c was obtained from hydrographic cruises (1998, 2003-2018, and 2021). Second, in situ c was matched with GOCI remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) band ratios of all available blue-to-green wavelengths (2011-2018). Finally, satellite-derived surface salinity was determined directly by combining the two empirical relationships, providing a robust estimate over a range of salinities (22-34 psu). Our algorithm was then compared and validated with five previous satellite-derived salinity algorithms based on colored dissolved organic matter and particle concentrations. In the first step, surface salinity was matched and well correlated with c using an 18-year full conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) dataset (N = 1,345, R-2 = 0.93). In the second step, c was synchronously matched and well correlated with GOCI Rrs band ratios using an 8-year summer CTD dataset (N = 391, R-2 = 0.93). The satellite-derived surface salinity based on the GOCI was compared with five other approaches and validated using an 8-year summer CTD dataset (2011-2018, N = 707, RMSE = 0.43, bias = 0.053, mean ratio = 1.002). We mapped satellite-derived surface salinity using monthly GOCI images during the summer from 2011 to 2020. The spatial patterns of the CDW were connected to the Changjiang River mouth and extended to the east-northeast during summer. Saline water was confined to the warm current and the upper slope in the eastern part of the study area. Anomalous dispersion of the CDW occurred in August 2016, 2017, and 2020, and limited dispersion occurred in August 2014 and 2019.

TI  - Modelling salmon lice-induced mortality of wild salmon post-smolts is highly sensitive to calibration data
T2  - AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salmon lice from fish farms in open net pens pose a threat to the survival of wild salmon post-smolts migrating through areas with high farm and lice densities. Reliable estimation of this mortality is fundamental for the sustainable management of aquaculture in such areas but is challenged by considerable uncertainty about several of the processes that link reported lice numbers in fish farms to post-smolt mortality. Utilising recent access to lice data from post-smolt trawling, we revised a virtual post-smolt model that estimates salmon lice-induced mortality of seaward-migrating wild salmon post-smolts. We also assessed the sensitivity of model results to model assumptions that differ among the virtual post-smolt models currently being used as management support in Norway. The spatiotemporal variation in infestation pressure along the entire Norwegian coast was calculated based on monitoring data for salmon lice, temperature and fish abundance in all Norwegian salmonid farm locations. The revised model integrates lice data from sentinel cage experiments and post-smolt trawling to quantify the spatiotemporal variation in infestation rate of wild post-smolts from the spatiotemporal infestation pressure, while also estimating the effect of calibration data type on infestation rate. Results show 10 times higher infestation rate in trawl-caught post-smolts than in post-smolts from sentinel cage experiments. Mortality estimates calibrated to trawl data are more sensitive to assumptions about possible density dependence in lice infestation rate than to assumptions about migration speed. These findings contribute to explaining why different virtual post-smolt models provide different estimates of salmon lice-induced mortality.

TI  - Atmospheric observations suggest methane emissions in north-eastern China growing with natural gas use
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dramatic increase of natural gas use in China, as a substitute for coal, helps to reduce CO2 emissions and air pollution, but the climate mitigation benefit can be offset by methane leakage into the atmosphere. We estimate methane emissions from 2010 to 2018 in four regions of China using the GOSAT satellite data and in-situ observations with a high-resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) inverse model and analyze interannual changes of emissions by source sectors. We find that estimated methane emission over the north-eastern China region contributes the largest part (0.77 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) of the methane emission growth rate of China (0.87 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) and is largely attributable to the growth in natural gas use. The results provide evidence of a detectable impact on atmospheric methane observations by the increasing natural gas use in China and call for methane emission reductions throughout the gas supply chain and promotion of low emission end-use facilities.

TI  - Yield estimation of summer maize based on multi-source remote-sensing data
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating regional-scale crop yields is substantial in determining current agricultural production performance and effective agricultural land management. The Yuncheng Basin is an important grain-producing area in the Shanxi Province. This paper used Sentinel 2A with a spatial resolution of 10 m and MODIS with a temporal resolution of 1 d in 2020. The spatial and temporal nonlocal filter-based fusion model (STNLFFM) was used to obtain fused data with a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal resolution of 1 d, combined with the Carnegie-Ames-StanfordApproach (CASA) and light-use efficiency model to achieve summer maize (Zea mays L.) yield estimation. The results showed that the fused normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) could inherit the spatial Sentinel-2A NDVI details and express the spatial differences between smaller features more effectively. The STNLFFM NDVI curve was consistent with the actual summer maize growth condition, which accurately reflects the NDVI trend and local abrupt change information during the summer maize growth period. Moreover, the fused NDVI was influenced by topographic differences and artificial irrigation factors, whereas the summer maize yield in mountainous and plateau areas of the Yuncheng Basin was <5,000 kg ha(-1) and those in the alluvial plain of the Sushui River reached 8,000 kg ha(-1). The accuracy of the yield estimation model constructed based on STNLFFM NDVI (mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] = 5.47%, - 13.74% <= relative error [RE] <= 0.12%) was significantly higher than that of the model based on MODIS NDVI (MAPE = 15.65%, - 19.67% <= RE <= 20.88%), indicating that the use of spatio-temporal fusion technology can effectively improve the summer maize yield estimation accuracy.

TI  - Geospatial characteristics of Colorado wildfire occurrences from 2001 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are a major environmental concern and can pose a direct threat to the environment, communities, and people living in fire-prone areas. Colorado has experienced an increase in wildfire frequency and severity in recent years and with the population increasing and commu-nities expanding, it is imperative to understand the spatial patterns of wildfires and which areas are most at risk. Here we use geostatistical techniques to analyze the spatial distribution and seasonal patterns of fires in Colorado from 2001 to 2020 and assess fire risk for June 2021. Over the past 20 years, forest fires in Colorado have varied seasonally in concentration and dispersion, moving in a circular pattern from the southeast in the winter to the northwest in the summer. On an annual scale, the observed active fires varied latitudinally in recent years, with greater northward expansion. Several active fire hotspots were revealed in Colorado: two hotspots in the northwest towards Grand Junction and a large hotspot in the central north, of great concern for its expansion into the Rocky Mountain National Park and its location near more populated areas. Our fire risk model (which included topography, vegetation, drought intensity, and historical fire occurrences) showed that fire risk was greater along the western border of Colorado, and 45% of active fires occurred within the top two fire risk classes (100% occurred in the top three). Therefore, this fire risk map is a suitable tool to identify and locate areas that are at greater risk for fire occurrence in Colorado.

TI  - Impacts of aquaculture on the area and soil carbon stocks of mangrove: A machine learning study in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove is an important carbon sink, as it can achieve climate regulation by sequestering carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, 50 % of mangrove species are threatened with extinction in China, and the carbon stocks in vegetation has also dropped by 53.1 %. Here, we couple remote sensing data with Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost to analyse mangroves inmainland China from1986 to 2019. We find that aquaculture has crucial impacts onmangroves and prediction error. Future predictions indicate that the changes of mangroves in different cities range from-5.09E + 06 m(2) to 2.30E + 06 m (2), and soil carbon(C) stocks is "-1.90E+05Mg similar to 8.57E+04Mg". To protectmangroves, exploring the balance between aquaculture andmangroves and paying attention to the sustainable transformation of aquaculture are urgently required. In this way, mangroves can fully play the role of carbon sequestration and contribute to China's dual carbon goals.

TI  - The prognostic significance of further axillary dissection for sentinel lymph node micrometastases in female breast cancer: A competing risk analysis using the SEER database
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been widely recognized as an excellent surgical and staging procedure for early-stage breast cancer, and its development has greatly improved the detection of micrometastases. However, the axillary treatment of micrometastasis has been the subject of much debate. MethodsWe identified 427,131 women diagnosed with breast cancer from 2010 to 2018 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients whose nodal status was micrometastases (pTxN1miM0) were classified into two groups: the SLNB only group and SLNB with complete ALND group, and we used these classifications to carry out propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis. The primary and secondary endpoints were OS and BCSS, respectively. We then implemented the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model and used Fine and Gray competitive risk regression to identify factors associated with the risk of all-cause mortality. ResultsAfter the PSM, 1,833 pairs were included in total. The SLNB with complete ALND showed no significant difference in OS (HR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.84-1.28, P=0.73) or BCSS (HR= 1.03, 95% CI: 0.79-1.35, P=0.82) compared to the SLNB only group, and axillary treatment was not associated with breast cancer-specific death (BCSD) (HR=1.13, 95% CI: 0.86-1.48, P=0.400) or other cause-specific death (OCSD) (HR=0.98, 95% CI:0.70-1.38, P=0.920). There was no statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence of BCSD (Grey's test, P=0.819) or OCSD (Grey's test, P=0.788) for between the two groups either. For different molecular subtypes, patients in the SLNB only group showed no statistically significant differences from those in the SLNB with complete ALND group with Luminal A (HR=1.00, 95% CI:0.76-1.32, P=0.98) or Luminal B (HR=0.82, 95% CI:0.42-1.62, P=0.55) but similar OS to HER2-enriched (HR=1.58, 95% CI:0.81-3.07, P=0.19) or triple negative breast cancers (HR=1.18, 95% CI:0.76-1.81, P=0.46). ConclusionsOur results suggest that in early breast cancer patients with micrometastasis, complete ALND does not seem to be required and that SLNB suffices to control locoregional and distant disease, with no significant adverse effects on survival compared to complete ALND.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics analysis of aquaculture zones and its impact on green tide disaster in Haizhou Bay, China
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid marine economic development, the problem of the marine ecological environment has become progressively prominent. Mariculture monitoring plays an essential role in sustaining ecological stability, rational planning, and green economic development of sea areas. Using the Landsat image, the raft-mariculture area information of Haizhou Bay and its adjacent southern waters were extracted by the object-oriented clas-sification method based on remote sensing techniques. Landscape pattern index and principal component analysis were used to analyze the spatiotemporal expansion and structural changes of mariculture areas, and to quantify the effects of natural, socio-economic factors on the spatiotemporal variations of mariculture areas. This study discusses the correlation between the mariculture area and the outbreak scale of Enteromorpha Enter-omorpha green tide. Results show that the object-oriented classification method has the highest accuracy, with total classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient of more than 90% and 0.79, respectively. The total area, patch density, and landscape shape index of mariculture areas in Haizhou Bay increase yearly, which demonstrates that the heterogeneity and fragmentation increase with the expansion of the mariculture area. The landscape pattern changes in the mariculture area are predominantly impacted by annual mean sea surface temperature (SST), annual average wind speed, social development level, and population density, etc. The larger the area of raft-aquaculture, the wider the outbreak scale of the Enteromorpha prolifera disaster. Study results can provide scientific references for the further development of mariculture in Haizhou Bay and marine environmental protection.

TI  - TOI-3884 b: A rare 6-<i>R</i><sub>E</sub> planet that transits a low-mass star with a giant and likely polar spot
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission identified a deep and asymmetric transit-like signal with a periodicity of 4.5 days orbiting the M4 dwarf star TOI-3884. The signal has been confirmed by follow-up observations collected by the ExTrA facility and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, which reveal that the transit is chromatic. The light curves are well modelled by a host star having a large polar spot transited by a 6-R-E planet. We validate the planet with seeing-limited photometry, high-resolution imaging, and radial velocities. TOI-3884 b, with a radius of 6.00 +/- 0.18 R-E, is the first sub-Saturn planet transiting a mid-M dwarf. Owing to the host star's brightness and small size, it has one of the largest transmission spectroscopy metrics for this planet size and becomes a top target for atmospheric characterisation with the James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes.

TI  - Analysis of long-term wetland variations in China using land use/land cover dataset derived from Landsat images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most productive ecosystems on earth and play an important role in maintaining ecological balance and regulating climate. In this paper, 30 m resolution land use/land cover (LULC) data (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020) were employed to analyze the characteristics of spatial and temporal changes in the distribution of wetlands in China and their evolution patterns in the last two decades. The results indicated that the total area of wetlands in China showed an increasing trend during 2000-2020. During the study period, provinces with more increase in wetland area were concentrated in Qinghai Province, Tibet Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. And the provinces with more reduction in wetland area were mainly in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The analysis of wetland change driving mechanism by introducing PLS-SEM model and GWR model found that good climate conditions as well as agricultural and economic conditions are favorable for wetland conservation in 2000-2020, while accelerated urbanization and population growth showed negative effects on wetland change. The spatial distribution pattern of wetland and NPP (Net Primary Production) changes showed spatial consistency in the extent of NPP changes and wetland transfer. The results of this study are intended to provide a basis for wetland conservation, rational use of wetland resources and sci-entific restoration in China.

T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important practises for the long-term management of groundwater resources is the delineation of groundwater potential zones. Prospecting for groundwater with sufficient precision is a challenging task. The use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) in conjunction with Multi-Criterion Decision Making Approach (MCDM) of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodologies to delineate the nonlinear behaviour of groundwater occurrence has shown to be extremely dependable. The weighted overlay analysis, which is based on remote sensing tech-nology, is one of the many essential tools used for ground water potential zonation and has been extensively utilized in numerous research studies. Ten thematic layers like Land use land cover (LULC), Soils, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Geology, Geomorphology, Normalized Built-up Index (NDBI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Slope, Lineament Density (LD), Drainage Density (DD) are castoff to produce Groundwater Potential Zones (GWPZs) map for the semi-arid regions in and around the Anantapur urban city, AP, India. The final ground-water potential zone map is delineated into five categories, namely 'very high', 'high', 'good', 'poor', and, 'very poor'. The results reveal that the huge portion of the research area, 62.08%, has "Poor" and "Very poor" groundwater potential, suggesting that the region's groundwater resource is restricted and deteriorating in comparison to previous studies. The "good" zone occupies 25.23%, the "high" zone occupies 9.97%, and the "very high" zone occupies 2.27% in the total study an similar to rea.

TI  - An ensemble method for monitoring land cover changes in urban areas using dense Landsat time series data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new method for monitoring land cover change in urban areas using all available Landsat time series data, named the Ensemble of Bidirectional Time Series Analysis (EBTSA). In this method, the bidi-rectional Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) and the Chow Test are combined to improve the robustness against data scarcity in earlier times and reduce break detection errors and refine classification results. There are three key stages in this method: break detection using bidirectional CCDs, break refinement using the Chow Test, and bidirectional model integration and classification. The EBTSA method was evaluated over the Tianjin metropolitan area in China using Landsat data from 1989 to 2018. Results show that the pro-posed method improved spatial and temporal accuracies of both land cover classification and change detection, by reducing the influence of sparser Landsat data in the earlier years and the break detection errors. Using the land cover change results in the Tianjin area obtained using the EBTSA method, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution of land cover classification and change detection. It is found from the results that the Tianjin area experienced dramatic urban land changes, characterized by rapid urban expansion and noticeable transition from vegetation to urban land, with diverse changes from urban land to various nonurban land cover types. Results of this study showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method in land cover change monitoring in urban areas, which facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of urban land change dynamics and diversity.

TI  - Impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy through the axillary cribriform fascia approach on intraoperative indicators and postoperative complications
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare intraoperative indicators and postoperative complications of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) via the axillary cribriform membrane and traditional axillary fold with blue dye to make a priority choice. This single-center, retrospective cohort study enrolled 330 eligible breast cancer patients with stage of cTis similar to 2N0M0 in our hospital from August 2018 to July 2021. Multiple linear and binary logistic regression were used to evaluate the effects of different surgical approaches on intraoperative indicators (drainage volume, tube time, intraoperative bleeding, operative time and the number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs)) and postoperative complications (upper limb edema and dysfunction). All statistical tests were two sided. Multiple linear and logistic regression results after adjusting the covariate showed that the axillary cribriform fascia approach could render more greater intraoperative indictors and reduce the risk of upper limb dysfunction (P = 0.038, OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.11-0.94). High BMI could increase the drainage volume, tube time and operative time. There was no significant difference in the number of SLNs between the two approaches and it also had no relationship with intraoperative indicators and postoperative complications. Overall, 6 (1.8%) experienced upper limb edema and 18 (5.5%) experienced upper limb dysfunction. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that radiotherapy increased the risk of upper limb edema (P = 0.032, OR = 12.76, 95%CI 1.25-130.06). SLNB through the axillary cribriform fascia approach produces more satisfied intraoperative indictors, a lower risk of upper limb dysfunction.

TI  - Improvement of the Aerosol Forecast and Analysis Over East Asia With Joint Assimilation of Two Geostationary Satellite Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we present the first simultaneous assimilation of aerosol optical thicknesses (AOTs) over East Asia retrieved from two next-generation geostationary satellites named Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) and Himawari-8 with an advanced data assimilation system. A new stringent data-control method is proposed to assimilate only the high quality aerosol products of FY-4A. The AOTs retrieved from the two geostationary satellites are both comparable to the ground-based observations over East Asia, and the FY-4A provides twice the number of the Himawari-8 AOT retrievals. Validations with independent observations demonstrate the joint assimilation significantly improve the aerosol analysis and forecast skill over East Asia especially in South China, reducing the model biases of 70% and 40%. The aerosol model performances at 95% independent 61 ground-based sites are more benefited from joint assimilation than single-sensor assimilation. This demonstrates the high impact and innovative application of joint assimilation technique in the air quality modeling.

TI  - Elective nodal irradiation mitigates local and systemic immunity generated by combination radiation and immunotherapy in head and neck tumors
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Neck dissection and/or elective nodal irradiation (ENI) are commonly performed in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) to minimize local and regional recurrence. However, here the authors show that ENI blunts the immune response to combined radiation and immunotherapy, increasing local and distant tumor growth in HNSCC preclinical models.In the setting of conventional radiation therapy, even when combined with immunotherapy, head and neck cancer often recurs locally and regionally. Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) is commonly employed to decrease regional recurrence. Given our developing understanding that immune cells are radio-sensitive, and that T cell priming occurs in the draining lymph nodes (DLNs), we hypothesize that radiation therapy directed at the primary tumor only will increase the effectiveness of immunotherapies. We find that ENI increases local, distant, and metastatic tumor growth. Multi-compartmental analysis of the primary/distant tumor, the DLNs, and the blood shows that ENI decreases the immune response systemically. Additionally, we find that ENI decreases antigen-specific T cells and epitope spreading. Treating the primary tumor with radiation and immunotherapy, however, fails to reduce regional recurrence, but this is reversed by either concurrent sentinel lymph node resection or irradiation. Our data support using lymphatic sparing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

TI  - Plastics and waterbirds in Brazil: A review of ingestion, nest materials and entanglement reveals substantial knowledge gaps and opportunities for research
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Plastic pollution is an increasing global problem, especially in aquatic environments. From invertebrates to vertebrates, many aquatic species have been affected by plastic pollution worldwide. Waterbirds also interact with plastics, mainly by ingesting them or using them as nest material. Brazil has one of the largest aquatic environment areas, including the most extensive wetland (the Pantanal) and biggest river (the Amazon), and a similar to 7500 km long coastline, which hosts a remarkable waterbird diversity with more than 200 species from 28 bird families. Here, we synthesise published and grey literature to assess where, how, and which waterbirds (marine and continental) interact with plastics in Brazil. We found 96 documents reporting interaction between water -birds and plastics. Only 32% of the occurring species in the country had at least one individual analysed. Plastic ingestion was reported in 67% of the studies, and seabirds were the study subject in 79% of them. We found no reports in continental aquatic environments, unveiling entire regions without any information regarding in-teractions. Consequently, this geographic bias drew a considerable taxonomic bias, with whole families and orders without information. Additionally, most studies did not aim to search for plastic interactions, which had a twofold effect. First, studies did not report their findings using the proposed standard metrics, hampering thus advances in understanding trends or defining robust baselines. Second, as it was not their main objective, plastics were not mentioned in titles, abstracts, and keywords, making it difficult to find these studies. We propose means for achieving a better understanding of waterbird-plastic interactions in space and time, and recommend searching for sentinel species and for allocating research grants.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval over crop fields based on two-component polarimetric decomposition: a comparison of generalized volume scattering models
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Model-based polarimetric decomposition can separate to some extent the backscattered radar signals from the vegetation canopy and the underlying ground, hence enabling a strategy for soil moisture retrieval in vegetated agricultural fields. However, the volume scattering models used in previous studies are only applicable to specific cases, making it difficult to completely remove the volume component induced by the vegetation layer. In this paper, three generalized volume scattering models (i.e., generalized volume scattering model (GVSM), simplified adaptive volume scattering model (SAVSM), and simplified Neumann volume scattering model (SNVSM)) are incorporated in the decomposition and evaluated for soil moisture retrieval. Considering the complexity and descriptive ability of the available physical models, a modified two-component model-based decomposition is proposed as the basic decomposition framework. This decomposition is also based on the physical constraint of the dielectric constants included in the model. The employed models combine an X-Bragg surface scattering model with three continuous generalized volume scattering models. The analytic solution of the parameters is obtained, and the minimum residual power criterion is used to determine the optimal solution to fit the model. By using the proposed model-based decomposition framework, the performance of the three models to simulate the canopy scattering and, as a result, to later estimate soil moisture under agricultural vegetation is evaluated. Fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 C-band images acquired on eight dates in 2013 and 2015 over fields covered by two crops (wheat and soybean) were employed for validation. Results show that the proposed decomposition method, using any of the three volume scattering models, can provide promising inversion results of soil moisture, with RMSEs ranging from 2.89 to 7.43 [vol.%]. Compared with the other two models, the SNVSM simulates the vegetation contribution more accurately in this framework, and it provides a stable soil moisture inversion performance at different crop phenological stages, with an optimal overall accuracy of RMSE = 4.99 [vol.%] and a correlation coefficient of R = 0.78.

TI  - Impact of Clouds and Blowing Snow on Surface and Atmospheric Boundary Layer Properties Over Dome C, Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and blowing snow (BLSN) occur frequently over Antarctica, where it is critical to understand their feedbacks to surface and atmospheric boundary layer processes. Dome C, an elevated East Antarctic station, dominated by lengthy periods of surface longwave (LW) radiative cooling, is selected to reveal cloud and BLSN impacts within a largely stable environment. The sky condition is classified as clear, cloudy, or BLSN, using 3 years of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations satellite data. Co-located and contemporaneous in situ observations are used to investigate the relationship of sky condition with surface and atmospheric boundary layer thermal structure, focusing on seasonal variability. Results show that increased downwelling LW radiation from clouds abate surface radiative cooling losses, contributing to warming during all seasons. An increase of 3 degrees C in the mean surface air temperature is observed during spring, whereas, a more dramatic rise (around 10 degrees C), due to accompanying large-scale subsidence, is observed during fall and winter in association with clouds. For all seasons, the wind speed and wind speed shear are strongest during BLSN events, and the surface-based inversion is weakened by cooling which peaks in a shallow above-surface turbulent layer. The stronger background stability during fall and winter seasons, restricts turbulence and BLSN depths generally to the lowest tens of meters. The Earth's cryosphere is among the most rapidly evolving yet least well-observed regions, and knowledge of clouds and BLSN interactions with the typical stable atmospheric boundary layer can help further understand energy and moisture exchanges.

TI  - Monitoring and estimating spatial-temporary land use changes of the Aegean region with remotely sensed data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural resources are affected by parameters such as natural events, global warming, or irregular urbanization, and land use classes are changing. Faulty practices or wrong approaches to land uses can also lead to deterioration and destruction in the structure of land use classes. For this reason, it should be monitored regularly, and plans for the future should be made. Aegean region, covering 12% of Turkey, is one of the most important regions in terms of tourism, agriculture, and industry. Based on the previous research results, although the spatial change on the basis of cities has been examined, the spatial change of the entire Aegean region has not been examined so far and predictions for the future have not been made. This study aims to examine the change in land use classes of the Aegean Region between 2001 and 2019 using MCD12Q1.006 MODIS Land Cover Type Yearly Global 500 m data. In addition, an estimation study was made using these data for the year 2030. The results showed an increase in the urban area, forest, savannas, wetlands, and ice/snow between 2001 and 2019. On the other hand, a decrease was detected in agricultural areas, water bodies, grasslands, bare lands, and shrubs. Using the cellular automata (CA) method for estimation, first of all, the accuracy of the model was determined by estimating the year 2019. Then, using the same model, an estimation study was carried out for the year 2030. When the estimation results for 2030 are examined, an increase is detected in urban areas; it has been determined that there is a decrease in agricultural areas. This study has demonstrated the successful usability of MODIS data in spatial change estimation. In addition, the results obtained have revealed a comprehensive foresight that can be used in urban planning in order to ensure the sustainable development of the Aegean region in the future.

TI  - Characterizing Vertical Stratification of the Cloud Thermodynamic Phase With a Combined Use of CALIPSO Lidar and MODIS SWIR Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud thermodynamic phase information derived from the CALIPSO lidar (CALIOP) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) channels of Aqua/MODIS represents different penetration depths within a cloud layer. This study combined them to better characterize the vertical stratification of the cloud thermodynamic phase within the atmospheric column. The temperature dependences of the phase occurrences were first compared between the two sensors to find a significant quantitative difference, which appeared to be large enough to affect climate model evaluations of the cloud phase representations. The two pieces of cloud phase information obtained from the two sensors, each binarized into liquid or ice, were then combined to define the four categories of cloud phases resulting from combinations of the two sensors that provide two cloud phases each (liquid and ice). Global occurrences of the four phase categories were validated against temperature information from MODIS thermal infrared (TIR) channels to confirm that the four categories are reasonably associated with cloud-top temperature and brightness temperature differences. The vertical stratification of the cloud thermodynamic phase characterized by CALIOP and SWIR was then investigated through comparisons with CloudSat/CPR radar profile statistics to illustrate how cloud vertical structures vary systematically with different combinations of the two cloud phases from CALIOP and SWIR. The results suggest that the combined use of complementary information from the four sensors (lidar, SWIR, TIR, and radar) can better characterize the vertical structures of the cloud thermodynamic phase, which could then provide more detailed observational constraints for model representations of the cloud phase.

TI  - Building footprint extraction and counting on very high-resolution satellite imagery using object detection deep learning framework
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Building footprints are the most visible features in urban areas. Detecting building footprint has a substantial position in decision-making problems such as city planning and development, urban mapping and management, population estimation, etc. In this paper, we aim to automatically detect and count building footprints by leveraging deep learning techniques and the potential availability of remote sensing datasets at high spatial resolutions. We build object detection deep learning models by integrating the partitioning segmentation and convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture using the WorldView-3 very high-resolution optical satellite imagery data. Our detection model is implemented on data from the Paris, France, and Khartoum, Sudan regions. These regions were chosen because it has very different characteristics and large data variation, making it challenging to extract building features from satellite imagery. This challenge is even greater because one area is taken perpendicularly and the other area is taken at an angle of several degrees which causes more noise, one of which is the shadow of the building. The detection models can detect and count the building footprints and have promising performance on large variable data with an Average Precision (AP) of 64.19%. Paris was detected better by 74.66% compared to Khartoum by 56.19%. The partitioning segmentation technique is used to tune the anchor boxes of CNN input images. Our result offers a potential practical implementation for rapid yet accurate estimation of urban monitoring and city planning, particularly in metropolitan regions.

T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The decreasing of Arctic sea ice is projected to continue with global warming, which makes the summer navigation conditions of the Arctic improve. Based on the multi-source remote-sensing data with inter-sensor calibration processing and the ship-based observational data from R/V Xuelong and M/V Yongsheng, the sea ice conditions of the Arctic Northeast Passage (NEP) during the 2002-2021 summer seasons were analyzed, and the navigability of the NEP between July and October from 2002 to 2021 was discussed. Inter-sensor calibration could effectively reduce the deviation from different passive microwave data. Sea ice extent and thickness in the NEP decreased annually, which resulted in the navigability of the NEP showing a potential tendency toward improvement in navigability. The navigation period was mainly concentrated in early August to early October. The middle part of the NEP was primarily affected by sea ice. This influence decreased over time, while the navigation period increased, especially in the Vilkitsky Strait, which is a key shipping area. This analysis of sea ice conditions and navigability in the past 20 years could provide a reference for future scientific investigations and aid in merchant ship navigation in the Arctic summer.

TI  - Artificial neural network and random forest regression models for modelling fatty acid and tocopherol content in oil of winter rapeseed
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the aid of models used in artificial intelligence, a wide range of data can be processed quickly with high accuracy. The quality of rapeseed oil from 40 genotypes cultivated during four consecutive years was analysed. Two machine learning techniques (artificial neural network - ANN, and random forest regression - RFR) were applied for the modelling of fatty acids content (C16:0; C18:0; C18:1; C18:2; C18:3 and C22:1), alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol and total tocopherols, according to the data of production year and winter rapeseed genotype. The developed models exerted high-quality anticipation features, showing high r2 during the training cycle. The best fit between the modelled and measured traits for ANN model was observed for erucic acid content. RFR modelling for all fatty acids was more effective than ANN model, with the highest precision for palmitic, stearic, and oleic fatty acids (r2>0.9). This study emphasized the possibility of using ANN and RFR models to model winter rapeseed quality traits.

TI  - Biological-based and remote sensing techniques to link vegetative and reproductive development and assess pollen emission in Mediterranean grasses
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Connecting the signals of the vegetative and reproductive cycles of plants using large-scale phenological tech-niques is not always an easy task, and this complexity increases considerably when analysing the plant life cycle in grasses, due to the ubiquity and diversity of this taxonomic family. This work integrates remote sensing techniques (NDVI from satellite remote sensing data and greenness from near-surface imagery) and biological -based techniques (airborne pollen monitoring and field observations and sampling) to analyse phenological patterns and productivity in grass-dominated vegetation types. We aim to answer two main applied and unan-swered questions; i) how are the specific phases of vegetative and reproductive cycles in grasses linked at the species and plant community level? and ii) which grass-dominant habitats are the major contributors of grass pollen emission to the atmosphere at the plant community level? The multi-scale integration and validation of large-scale methods such as satellite remote sensing data and aerobiological monitoring using high-resolution or field phenological techniques is recommended. The results clearly support the hypothesis that the highest rates of grass pollen emission are successively produced when the major grass-dominated vegetation types go through the final phases of vegetative development during their biological senescence or equivalent phases. At the plant community level, natural and semi-natural grass-dominated vegetation types, rather than grass cropland habi-tats, constitute the major sources of pollen emission. The major contributors to the grass pollen emission at the species level are also identified. Finally, a positive relationship between year-to-year primary productivity (measured as annual sum or maximum NDVI) and pollen production (measured as airborne pollen intensity) was observed at the community level. This is a very timely study, as the availability of remote sensing data is increasing interest in generating enhanced forecasting model of allergenic airborne pollen.

AB  - Objective. - To update French oncology guidelines concerning penile cancer.Methods. - Comprehensive Medline search between 2020 and 2022 upon diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of testicular germ cell cancer to update previous guidelines. Level of evidence was evaluated according to AGREE-II.Results. - Epidermoid carcinoma is the most common penile cancer histology. Physical exami-nation is mandatory to define local and inguinal nodal cancer stage. MRI with artificial erection can help to assess deep infiltration in cases of organsparing intention. Node negative patients (defined by palpation and imaging) will present micro nodal metastases in up to 25% of cases. Invasive lymph node assessment is thus advocated except for low risk patients. Sentinel node dynamic biopsy is the first line technique. Modified bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy is an option with higher morbidity. 18-FDG-PET is recommended in patients with palpable nodes. Chest, abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography is an option. Fine needle aspiration (when positive) is an easy way to assess inguinal palpable node pathological involvement. Its results determine the type of lymphadenectomy to be performed (for diagnostic or curative purposes). Treatment is mostly surgical. Free margins status is essential, but it also has to be organ-sparing when possible. Brachytherapy and topic agents can cure in selected cases. Lymph node assessment should be synchronous to the removal of the tumour when possible. Limited inguinal lymph node involvement (pN1 stage) can be cured with the only lymphadenectomy. In case of larger lymph node stage, one should consider multidisciplinary treatment including chemotherapy and inclusion in a trial.Conclusions. - Penile cancer needs demanding surgery to be cured, surrounded by chemother-apy in node positive patients. Lymph nodes involvement is a major prognostic factor. Thus, inguinal node assessment cannot be neglected.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landslides are frequent mountainous geohazards induced by multiple factors, such as extreme rainfall, river erosion, and intense anthropogenic activities. On 17 June 2020, a rainstorm hit Danba County, Sichuan Province, and triggered the catastrophic Aniangzhai landslide. The impact of this rainstorm on landslide kinematics in this region has seldom been investigated. We used a time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis to map the active slopes in Danba County using one ascending (2015-2021) and one descending (2018-2021) Sentinel-1 dataset. A total of 36 landslides (63.1 km2) were detected along riverbanks. The time series of eastward and vertical displacements during 2018-2021 were retrieved by integrating the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets. The maximum eastward and vertical displacement rates obtained are 229 and -75 mm/yr, respectively. Seasonal accelerations are correlated with concentrated rainfall. We suggest that the 2020 rainstorm and the abundant precipitation during the water year 2020 altered the long-term displacement trends of active landslides. We further constrained the volumes of the Niela and Gaoding landslides in the order 3.6-6.9 x 107 m3 and 5.4-6.0 x 108 m3, respectively, using 2D displacement rates and mass conservation equations. Our results demonstrate that multi-temporal and multi-orbit InSAR measurements can provide insights into the evolution and mechanism of landslides.

AB  - Map fracture network analysis study using Landsat 8 image data accompanied with ground data was carried out in Nadhour Sisseb- El Amen Basin applying the concepts spatial statistics. Various image enhancement techniques were applied to retrieve structural lineaments which are possible fractures. This was verified with ground geological mapping. The rose diagrams show four peaks, in frequency and in length, corresponding to four directional families N40 degrees-45 degrees, N85 degrees-90 degrees, N130 degrees-135 degrees and N175 degrees-180 degrees. The resulted lineament map represents the main directional faults and fractures that could be recognized in field, with some amplification in frequency and length. The fractures induce the communication between aquifer layers and improve the rainwater infiltration rate. The N110 degrees-N130 degrees directional family, identified from satellite image and in outcrop has partially control groundwater flow in the aquifer systems. A proposed 3D conceptual model highlights the main types of fractures and their contribution in the hydrodynamic functioning in the deep aquifers.

TI  - Assessment of seasonal and spatial water quality variation in a cascading lake system in Chennai, India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality and scarcity are among the most severe problems humans have been facing in the last decades. India, as a fast-developing country, is not an exception. The surface water quality has deteriorated due to anthropogenic activi-ties. Another factor which impacts the water quality is the heavy rainfall during monsoon season. To maintain the qual-ity and the sustainability of water resources, there is the need to study how human activities impact water quality. We hypothesized that the water quality can be impacted by the spatial land use types and by the seasonality. In the present study, seasonal and spatial water quality regarding physical, chemical, and biological parameters from a lake cascading system was assessed monthly from July to December 2019. Land use/cover data was produced by Impact Observatory, Microsoft, and Esri based on the 10-m Sentinel-2 images. Redundancy analysis was applied to investigate the relation-ship between land use/cover data and water quality in the riparian of 500 and 1000 m to the lakes. Our results showed clear temporal and spatial variation of water quality in 2019, with better water quality in rainy season (Oct.-Dec.) and downstream lakes while relatively worse water quality was recorded in dry season (Jul.-Sep.) and upstream lakes. The water quality variation was explained 27.8 % and 42.7 % by the land use types within 500 m and 1000 m buffer widths, respectively. The outlet of the catchment showed exceptional results due to the impact of a dumpsite. Our find-ings indicate that the water quality is highly impacted by human-induced land use/cover. The land use/cover types, such as crops, woodland and urban area, show negative impacts and relate to the high level of nutrient concentrations. In opposite, grass land shows positive effects and leads to better water quality. Our study confirms that the lake water quality is distinguished in both spatial and seasonal aspects. Monsoon season improves the water quality.

TI  - A review on irrigation parameterizations in Earth system models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Irrigation is the process of artificially providing water to agricultural lands in order to provide crops with the necessary water supply to ensure or foster the growth of the plants. However, its implications reach beyond the agro-economic aspect as irrigation affects the soil-land-atmosphere interactions and thus influences the water and energy cycles in the Earth system. Past studies have shown how through these interactions, an increase in soil moisture due to irrigation also affects the atmospheric state and its dynamics. Thus, the lack of representation of irrigation in numerical Earth system models-be it for reanalysis, weather forecasting or climate prediction-can lead to significant errors and biases in various parameters of the system including but not limited to surface temperature and precipitation. In this study, we aim to summarize and discuss currently available irrigation parameterizations across different numerical models. This provides a reference framework to understand the impact of irrigation on the various components of Earth system models. Specifically, we discuss the impact of these parameterizations in the context of their spatio-temporal scale representation and point out the benefits and limitations of the various approaches. In fact, most of the parameterizations use irrigation as a direct modification of soil moisture with just a few implementations add irrigation as a form of surface water. While the former method might be suitable for coarse spatio-temporal scales, the latter better resembles the range of employed irrigation techniques. From the analysis, we find that not only the method or the spatio-temporal scales but the actual amount of water used is of great importance to the response of the Earth system model.

TI  - Comparison between Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3 sensors in mapping wetland vegetation communities of the Grassland Biome of South Africa, for monitoring under climate change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes in the areal extent and geographic distribution of wetland vegetation has become more critical considering the impact of anthropogenic and climate changes. We compared the capabilities of the optical space-borne sensors Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3 (WV3) to distin-guish between wetland and terrestrial vegetation for improved reporting to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) sub-indicator 6.6.1a, and also map different wetland vegetation com-munities for two catchments in the Grassland Biome of South Africa. Ground truthing of vege-tation communities was conducted between 2016 and 2018. A Random Forest classification algorithm was used with a 100-fold cross-validation to assess mean accuracies using all combi-nations of bands, a digital elevation model generated from fine-scale contours, spectral vegetation indices (VIs) and above-ground biomass (AGB). Five and eight wetland vegetation classes were mapped for Hogsback and Tevredenpan, respectively, of a total of 13 classes for each of the sites. Wetland and terrestrial vegetation were found to be highly separable, with overall accuracies (OAs) attaining 91-99% and individual user's accuracies 88-99% for both sensors and study areas. Even though the wetland vegetation communities consisted of a mosaic of smaller com-munities, monodominant species and plant functional type classes, they were found to be highly separable across sensors and study areas. The highest average OA of 83% for Hogsback's wetland vegetation communities was achieved using WV3 bands with elevation, AGB and the VIs, while the Sentinel-2 bands, elevation, AGB and VIs attained an average OA of 78%. For Tevredenpan, the use of the Sentinel-2 bands and elevation achieved the highest mean OA of 79% for the classification of wetland vegetation communities, while the WV3 (in this case the short-wave infrared bands were not available owing to shortage of funding) maximized at 74%. The inclusion of elevation data and spectral indices in the classification scenarios of wetland vege-tation communities increased the OA by 4-17%. Omitting the red-edge and shortwave infrared bands for classification of vegetation classes resulted in a varied response across sensors and study areas, but decreased the OA by 4.8-7.3% when using the Sentinel-2 sensors. These results show promise for improved reporting and monitoring of the extent and types of palustrine wetlands in the Grassland Biome of South Africa using freely-available Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Melanoma surgery-An update
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is the major cause of mortality from all skin cancers. The treatment has been revolutionized in recent years by introduction of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for melanoma patients Stages III and IV. Therefore, the role of surgery in melanoma treatment needs to be redefined. In this narrative review, we will focus on surgery for diagnosis, treatment of primary tumor, and metastases in the era of new and effective medical treatment options. Neoadjuvant therapy is currently investigated in several trials. Surgery for treatment-resistant metastases is another field of interest. In conclusion, surgery remains a cornerstone for diagnosis and treatment of primary melanoma. Therapeutic lymphadenectomy has lost importance while surgery in sentinel lymph node diagnostics and metastasectomy are useful in a tailored individual approach of combined treatments. There is a trend to less invasive surgical procedures.

TI  - Dust Aerosol Impacts on the Time of Cloud Formation in the Badain Jaran Desert Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust, as absorbing aerosols, can change the stability of the atmosphere through radiative effects, thereby affecting the formation and characteristics of clouds. In order to explore the influence of dust aerosols on cloud formation, this study takes the Badain Jaran Desert area as the research area where cloud formation is less disturbed by human activities compared to other densely populated areas such as the North China Plain, and uses the high temporal resolution Himawari-8 satellite data to identify 469 cases with cloud formation after 03:00 UTC (11:00 Beijing time). Through the analysis of individual cases, we find that the cloud formation time is dominated by the low tropospheric stability (LTS) when the total precipitable water (TPW) is less than about 18.5 kg/m(2), and greatly affected by the TPW when it is larger than 18.5 kg/m(2). Dust aerosols near the ground absorb shortwave solar radiation, making the atmospheric structure unstable (decreased LTS) and conducive to cloud formation. Statistically, for every 0.1 increase in aerosol optical depth, the cloud formation time is advanced about 138 min compared to low aerosol cases. Further analysis shows that dust aerosols actually inhibit the formation of convective clouds through microphysical processes when the TPW is small, while promote the formation of convective clouds through radiative processes when the TPW is large. This study reveals the effects of dust aerosols on the time of cloud formation along with the underlying mechanisms, which provides observational support for improving cloud parameterization in numerical models.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the extent and determinants of urban land expansion and fragmentation for 104 U.S. metropolitan areas for the time period 2001-2019. It leverages temporally and spatially consistent, satellite-based data. The analysis distinguishes among four different intensity levels of urban development and makes use of a number of landscape fragmentation metrics. Estimation relies on two-way fixed-effects panel techniques. Our time fixed-effects indicate that high-intensity urban developments grew by about 25% from 2001 to 2019, low-intensity developments by about 5%. The percentage increases for the corresponding fragmentation statistics are higher, at about 40% and 15%, respectively. Higher gasoline prices are associated with less urban land expansion and fragmentation.

TI  - Fluorescence-guided lymph node sampling is feasible during up-front or delayed nephrectomy for Wilms tumor
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymph node sampling is critical to surgical staging in Wilms tumor; failure to sample lymph nodes is associated with under-staging and an increased incidence of local relapse. However, no standard lymphatic mapping method is currently being utilized for Wilms tumor to aid identification of regional draining lymph nodes. Herein, we describe the use of fluorescence-guided lymphatic mapping for Wilms tumor. Materials and methods: Two tertiary level referral centers independently began indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-guided nodal mapping. In one center, this was achieved with ipsilateral intra-parenchymal (IP) injection of ICG during minimally invasive tumor nephrectomy (MIN) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in the other, with Peri-Hilar (PH) injection during upfront, open tumor nephrectomy (ON). Successful lymph node mapping was defined as the presence of fluorescence signal in draining lymph nodes. Results: Eight patients (median age of 2.5 years) underwent fluorescence-guided lymphatic mapping (four IP and four PH injection). Lymphatic mapping was successful in seven patients (88%) including each of the four patients with IP injection. Conclusions: Fluorescence-guided lymphatic mapping of Wilms tumor drainage is feasible by both IP injection and PH injection techniques. However, whether lymphatic mapping improves the precision of lymph node sampling is unknown and should be studied in prospective trials. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Enhanced spatio-temporal electric load forecasts using less data with active deep learning
T2  - NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To enable electrification of cities, thereby decarbonizing energy grids, it is essential to predict electricity consumption with high spatio-temporal accuracy. To reduce the need for large amounts of training data, an active deep learning approach is developed to make accurate forecasts of electric load profiles at the scale of single buildings.An effective way to mitigate climate change is to electrify most of our energy demand and supply the necessary electricity from renewable wind and solar power plants. Spatio-temporal predictions of electric load become increasingly important for planning this transition, while deep learning prediction models provide increasingly accurate predictions for it. The data that are used for training deep learning models, however, are usually collected at random using a passive learning approach. This naturally results in a large demand for data and associated costs for sensors such as smart meters, posing a large barrier for electric utilities when decarbonizing their grids. Here we investigate whether electric utilities can use active learning to collect a more informative subset of data by leveraging additional computation for better distributing smart meters. We predict ground-truth electric load profiles for single buildings using only remotely sensed data from aerial imagery of these buildings and meteorological conditions in the area of these buildings at different times. We find that active learning can enable 26-81% more accurate predictions using 29-46% less data at the price of 4-11 times more computation compared with passive learning.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; SBW) outbreaks in the northeastern USA and Canada are recurring phenomena leading to large-scale mortality of spruce (Picea sp.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) forests as susceptibility to SBW is primarily determined by the availability of host species and their maturity. Our study examined several satellite remote sensing (Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), PALSAR L-band SAR, and Sentinel-2 multispectral) and site variables over space and time to develop a method to produce large-scale SBW stand impact types and susceptibility maps in Maine, USA. We used two machine-learning algorithms (Random Forest, RF; Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) to map SBW host species where RF produced better results than MLP. Our best model with site (elevation and aspect) and Sentinel-2 data attained an overall accuracy (OA) of 83.4%. However, the addition of SAR variables did not improve the model further. Combining host species data with age data retrieved from Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) products, we demonstrated that SBW susceptibility map (based on stand impact types) could be produced with an OA of 88.3%. The fine spatial resolution (20 m) maps derived from our study provide reliable products for landscape-level SBW interventions in the region.

TI  - Optimization of adult mosquito trap settings to monitor populations of <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes, vectors of arboviruses in La Reunion
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Competent arbovirus vectors are found in the culicid mosquito fauna of south-west Indian Ocean (SWIO) islands. In La Reunion, Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are known vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Culex quinquefasciatus is a potential vector of Rift Valley fever and West Nile viruses. To prepare a vector-control field trial against Ae. aegypti, this study aimed at identifying the best trapping strategy to catch adult Ae. aegypti, using BG-Sentinel traps (Biogents, Germany). It was implemented in two sites in southern La Reunion. Catches of Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were also recorded. A Latin square design was used to estimate the detection probability and the apparent daily density-according to the BG-Sentinel trapping strategy: none, carbon dioxide (CO2), a commercial attractant-BG-Lure (Biogents, Germany), or both. The use of CO2 alone was associated with a higher detection probability for Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, as well as a large increase in their apparent density. Traps with BG-Lure-alone or in combination with CO2, did not improve the detection probability of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. The same result was found for male Ae. albopictus. For females, baiting BG-Sentinel traps with CO2 or BG-Lure had no significant effect. The same apparent densities were found for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in both study sites-where Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were found at very low densities during previous surveys.

TI  - Timing landslide and flash flood events from SAR satellite: a regionally applicable methodology illustrated in African cloud-covered tropical environments
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides and flash floods are geomorphic hazards (GHs) that often co-occur and interact. They generally occur very quickly, leading to catastrophic socioeconomic impacts. Understanding the temporal patterns of occurrence of GH events is essential for hazard assessment, early warning, and disaster risk reduction strategies. However, temporal information is often poorly constrained, especially in frequently cloud-covered tropical regions, where optical-based satellite data are insufficient. Here we present a regionally applicable methodology to accurately estimate GH event timing that requires no prior knowledge of the GH event timing, using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing. SAR can penetrate through clouds and therefore provides an ideal tool for constraining GH event timing. We use the open-access Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR satellite that provides global coverage, high spatial resolution (& SIM;10-15 m), and a high repeat time (6-12 d) from 2016 to 2020. We investigate the amplitude, detrended amplitude, spatial amplitude correlation, coherence, and detrended coherence time series in their suitability to constrain GH event timing. We apply the methodology on four recent large GH events located in Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) containing a total of about 2500 manually mapped landslides and flash flood features located in several contrasting landscape types. The amplitude and detrended amplitude time series in our methodology do not prove to be effective in accurate GH event timing estimation, with estimated timing accuracies ranging from a 13 to 1000 d difference. A clear increase in accuracy is obtained from spatial amplitude correlation (SAC) with estimated timing accuracies ranging from a 1 to 85 d difference. However, the most accurate results are achieved with coherence and detrended coherence with estimated timing accuracies ranging from a 1 to 47 d difference. The amplitude time series reflect the influence of seasonal dynamics, which cause the timing estimations to be further away from the actual GH event occurrence compared to the other data products. Timing estimations are generally closer to the actual GH event occurrence for GH events within homogenous densely vegetated landscape and further for GH events within complex cultivated heterogenous landscapes. We believe that the complexity of the different contrasting landscapes we study is an added value for the transferability of the methodology, and together with the open-access and global coverage of S1 data it has the potential to be widely applicable.

TI  - Spatialization and Spatio-temporal Dynamics of Energy Consumption Carbon Emissions in China
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The adverse effects of global climate change on human production and life are becoming increasingly prominent. Responding to climate change has become a severe challenge faced by human society, and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has gradually become a common action by all countries. Therefore, analyzing carbon emissions through scientific methods has become an important foundation for responding to the national "dual carbon" strategy. This study used provincial-level carbon emission statistics, combined with nighttime light data and population data, and assigned carbon emissions to the grid scale. It also analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics and evolution characteristics of carbon emissions in China in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018, as well as the correlation between carbon emissions and the economy. The results showed that: 1 from 2000 to 2018, the total CO2 emissions in China continued to grow, but the growth rate slowed over time. The average annual growth rate of carbon emissions dropped from 9.9% in 2000-2010 to 7.4% in 2010-2018. From the perspective of spatial distribution, carbon-free areas were mainly distributed in the northwest uninhabited area and northeast forest and mountainous areas, low-carbon emissions were mainly distributed in the vast small and medium-sized cities and towns, and high-carbon emissions were concentrated in northern, central, eastern coastal, and western provincial capitals and urban agglomerations. 2 Carbon emissions had high-value or low-value agglomerations at prefecture-level cities; this agglomeration tended to stabilize as a whole and had strengthened after 2005. Low-low agglomeration areas were mainly distributed in the western contiguous areas and Hainan Island. With economic and social development, low-low agglomeration areas began to fragment and reduce in size; high-high agglomeration areas were mainly distributed in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, Taiyuan urban agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations, and Pearl River Delta urban agglomerations, and the scale was gradually strengthened and consolidated; high-low and low-high agglomeration areas mainly appeared in neighboring cities with large differences in economic development levels. 3 Carbon emissions in most parts of China were relatively stable. The areas where carbon emissions had changed were mainly distributed in the peripheral areas of provincial capitals and key cities, and there was a circle structure with no changes in the central urban area and changes in carbon emissions in the peripheral areas. 4 The overall process of urban development in China from 2000 to 2018 followed a shift from "low emission-low income" to "high emission-low income" to "high emission-high income" and finally to "low emission-high income." The growth rate of carbon emissions in China is slowing down. Under the background of the "dual carbon" strategy, different regions face different carbon emission reduction tasks and pressures due to different carbon emission situations. Therefore, the differentiated carbon emissions policy should be implemented by regions and industries.

TI  - 3DUNetGSFormer: A deep learning pipeline for complex wetland mapping using generative adversarial networks and Swin transformer
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many ecosystems, particularly wetlands, are significantly degraded or lost as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Simultaneously, developments in machine learning, particularly deep learning methods, have greatly improved wetland mapping, which is a critical step in ecosystem monitoring. Yet, present deep and very deep models necessitate a greater number of training data, which are costly, logistically chal-lenging, and time-consuming to acquire. Thus, we explore and address the potential and possible limitations caused by the availability of limited ground-truth data for large-scale wetland mapping. To overcome this persistent problem for remote sensing data classification using deep learning models, we propose 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) to adaptively synthesize wetland training data based on each class's data availability. Both real and synthesized training data are then imported to a novel deep learning architecture consisting of cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Networks and vision transformers for wetland mapping. Results demonstrated that the developed wetland classifier obtained a high level of kappa coefficient, average accuracy, and overall accuracy of 96.99%, 97.13%, and 97.39%, respectively, for the data in three pilot sites in and around Grand Falls-Windsor, Avalon, and Gros Morne National Park located in Canada. The results show that the proposed methodology opens a new window for future high-quality wetland data generation and classification. The developed codes are available at https://github.com/aj1365/3DUNetGSForme r.

TI  - The Use of Machine Learning to Reduce Overtreatment of the Axilla in Breast Cancer: Retrospective Cohort Study.
T2  - JMIR perioperative medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with early breast cancer undergoing primary surgery, who have low axillary nodal burden, can safely forego axillary node clearance (ANC). However, routine use of axillary ultrasound (AUS) leads to 43% of patients in this group having ANC unnecessarily, following a positive AUS. The intersection of machine learning with medicine can provide innovative ways to understand specific risks within large patient data sets, but this has not yet been trialed in the arena of axillary node management in breast cancer.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess if machine learning techniques could be used to improve preoperative identification of patients with low and high axillary metastatic burden.METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed on patients with breast cancer who had a preoperative AUS, and the specificity and sensitivity of AUS were calculated. Standard statistical methods and machine learning methods, including artificial neural network, naive Bayes, support vector machine, and random forest, were applied to the data to see if they could improve the accuracy of preoperative AUS to better discern high and low axillary burden.RESULTS: The study included 459 patients; 142 (31%) had a positive AUS; among this group, 88 (62%) had 2 or fewer macrometastatic nodes at ANC. Logistic regression outperformed AUS (specificity 0.950 vs 0.809). Of all the methods, the artificial neural network had the highest accuracy (0.919). Interestingly, AUS had the highest sensitivity of all methods (0.777), underlining its utility in this setting.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that machine learning improves identification of the important subgroup of patients with no palpable axillary disease, positive ultrasound, and more than 2 metastatically involved nodes. A negative ultrasound in patients with no palpable lymphadenopathy is highly indicative of low axillary burden, and it is unclear whether sentinel node biopsy adds value in this situation. Further studies with larger patient numbers focusing on specific breast cancer subgroups are required to refine these techniques in this setting.

TI  - Investigating ancient agricultural field systems in Sweden from airborne LIDAR data by using convolutional neural network
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, the advances in airborne LIDAR technology provide high-resolution datasets that allow specialists to detect archaeological features hidden under wooded areas more efficiently. Still, the complexity and large scale of these datasets require automated analysis. In this respect, artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis has recently created an alternative approach for interpreting remote sensing data. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to detect clearance cairns, which are visible in today's landscape and act as important markers of past agricultural activities. For this aim, the U-shape network architecture is adapted, trained from scratch with an original labelled dataset and tested in various field sites, focusing on southern Sweden. Although it is challenging to tune the hyperparameters and decide on the proper network architecture to obtain reliable prediction, long-running experimental tests with this model produced promising results, with training and validation metrics of 0.8406 Dice-coefficient, 0.7469 Val-dice coefficient, and 0.7350 IuO and 0.6034 Val-IoU values, once trained with the best parameters. Thus, the proposed CNN model in this study made data interpretation quicker and guided scholars to focus on the location of the target objects, opening a new frontier for future landscape analysis and archaeological research.

TI  - A new analytic tool for assessing the impact of the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory actions
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Develop and test a flexible, scalable tool using interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess the impact of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory actions on drug use. Methods We applied the tool in the Sentinel Distributed Database to assess the impact of FDA's 2010 drug safety communications (DSC) concerning the safety of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) in adult asthma patients. We evaluated changes in LABA use by measuring the initiation of LABA alone and concomitant use of LABA and asthma controller medications (ACM) after the DSCs. The tool generated ITS graphs and used segmented regression to estimate baseline slope, level change, slope change, and absolute and relative changes at up to two user-specified time point (s) after the intervention. We tested the tool and compared our results against prior analyses that used similar measures. Results Initiation of LABA alone declined among asthma patients aged 18-45 years before FDA DSCs (-0.10% per quarter; 95%CI: -0.11% to -0.09%) and the downward trend continued after. Concomitant use of LABA and ACM was stable before FDA DSCs. After FDA DSCs, there was a small trend decrease of 0.006% per quarter (95% CI, -0.008% to -0.003%). We found similar results among those aged 46-64 years and patients with poorly-controlled asthma. Our results were consistent with previous studies, confirming the performance of the new tool. Conclusions We developed and tested a reusable ITS tool in real-world databases formatted to the Sentinel Common Data Model that can assess the impact of regulatory actions on drug use.

TI  - Mapping rill soil erosion in agricultural fields with UAV-borne remote sensing data
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion by water is a main form of land degradation worldwide. The problem has been addressed, among others, in the United Nations Sustainability Goals. However, for mitigation of erosion consequences and adequate management of affected areas, reliable information on the magnitude and spatial patterns of erosion is needed. Although such need is often addressed by erosion modelling, precise erosion monitoring is necessary for the calibration and validation of erosion models and to study erosion patterns in landscapes. Conventional methods for quantification of rill erosion are based on labour-intensive field measurements. In contrast, remote sensing techniques promise fast, non-invasive, systematic and larger-scale surveying. Thus, the main objective of this study was to develop and evaluate automated and transferable methodologies for mapping the spatial extent of erosion rills from a single acquisition of remote sensing data. Data collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle was used to deliver a highly detailed digital elevation model (DEM) of the analysed area. Rills were classified by two methods with different settings. One approach was based on a series of decision rules applied on DEM-derived geomorphological terrain attributes. The second approach utilized the random forest machine learning algorithm. The methods were tested on three agricultural fields representing different erosion patterns and vegetation covers. Our study showed that the proposed methods can ensure recognition of rills with accuracies between 80 and 90% depending on rill characteristics. In some cases, however, the methods were sensitive to very small rill incisions and to similar geometry of rills to other features. Additionally, their performance was influenced by the vegetation structure and cover. Besides these challenges, the introduced approach was capable of mapping rills fully automatically at the field scale and can, therefore, support a fast and flexible assessment of erosion magnitudes.

TI  - Genomic Insights into the Mobilome and Resistome of Sentinel Microorganisms Originating from Farms of Two Different Swine Production Systems
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to public health due to long-term antimicrobial use (AMU), which promotes the bacterial acquisition of antimicrobial resistance determinants (ARDs). Within food-producing animals, organic and extensive Iberian swine production is based on sustainable and eco-friendly management systems, providing an excellent opportunity to evaluate how sustained differences in AMU impact the development and spread of AMR. Here, through a whole-genome sequencing approach, we provide an in-depth characterization of the resistome and mobilome and their interaction in 466 sentinel bacteria, namely, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Campylobacter coli, and Staphylococcus spp., recovered from 37 intensive and organic-extensive pig farms. Both ARDs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were primarily taxon-associated, with higher similarities among bacteria which were closely phylogenetically related. E. coli exhibited the most diverse resistome and mobilome, with 85.4% mobilizable ARDs, 50.3% of which were plasmid-associated. Staphylococcus spp. exhibited a broad repertoire of ARDs and MGEs, with 52.3% of its resistome being mobilizable. Although Enterococcus spp. carried the highest number of ARDs per isolate and its plasmidome was similar in size to that of E. coli, 43.7% of its resistome was mobilizable. A narrow spectrum of ARDs constituted the C. coli resistome, with point mutations as its main AMR driver. A constrained AMU, as observed in organic-extensive herds, determined a reduction in the quantitative composition of the resistome and the complexity of the resistome-mobilome interaction. These results demonstrate taxon-associated AMR-MGE interactions and evidence that responsible AMU can contribute to reducing AMR pressure in the food chain.IMPORTANCE This study provides the first integral genomic characterization of the resistome and mobilome of sentinel microorganisms for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance from two different swine production systems. Relevant differences were observed among taxa in the resistomes and mobilomes they harbored, revealing their distinctive risk in AMR dissemination and spread. Thus, Escherichia coli and, to a lesser extent, Staphylococcus spp. constituted the main reservoirs of mobilizable antimicrobial resistance genes, which were predominantly plasmid-associated; in contrast to Campylobacter coli, whose resistome was mainly determined by point mutations. The reduced complexity of mobilome-resistome interaction in Enterococcus spp. suggested its limited role in AMR dissemination from swine farms. The significant differences in antimicrobial use among the studied farms allowed us to assess the suitability of whole-genome sequencing as a rapid and efficient technique for the assessment of mid- to long-term on-farm interventions for the reduction of antimicrobial use and the evaluation of AMR status.

TI  - Purification in religious sojourns: consuming in relatively sacred spaces
T2  - QUALITATIVE MARKET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeUsing the canvas of the author's sojourn with the Islamic preaching group Tablighi Jamaat, this study aims to exhibit reflections on how spaces can be categorized as more sacred or less sacred according to a specific religious worldview. The paper extends the conversation on Mary Douglas's concepts of purity and danger by sharpening the focal lens on place in Douglas's theoretics. The paper also proffers the idea of a sojourn as a vehicle of purification. Design/methodology/approachThis paper depicts findings from the author's multi-sited ethnographic field notes carried out from a 40-day sojourn with the Islamic preaching group Tablighi Jamaat in Pakistan. FindingsThe study unveils the concept of relative sacredness or how some spaces can be considered more sacred than others. The differential sacred status of these variegated spaces, each with its own etiquettes, meaning and consumption rituals is a means for purification for sojourners. Originality/valueThis paper prioritizes a focus on place in Mary Douglas's arguments on purity and impurity in a religious consumption context. The thesis argues that place is a significant concept associated with metaphorical cleanliness/sacredness, which in religious terms guides consumer action.

TI  - Relating McArthur fire danger indices to remote sensing derived burned area across Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - The McArthur grassland and forest fire danger indices, widely used in Australia, predict six fire danger classes from 'Low-Moderate' to 'Catastrophic.' These classes were linked to the rate of fire spread and difficulty of suppression. However, the lack of rate of fire spread data, especially for elevated fire danger classes, has hindered improvement of the McArthur methodology or an alternate approach. We explored the relationship between fire danger classes and burned areas (derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument) within six climate zones during the 2000-2016 Australian fire seasons. A negative binomial linear regression model was used to explore this relationship. The fire danger classes demonstrated a corresponding increase in burned area from 'Low-Moderate' to 'Very High' classes in Australia's inland regions. The elevated fire danger classes did not contribute to this trend. In coastal regions, the satellite-derived burned area showed no relationship between fire danger classes and satellite-derived burned area. We used accumulated burned area from the daily MODIS product, which could be subjected to lagged detection as observed in the Kilmore East fire. Thus, the satellite-derived total burned area may not be a suitable metric for informing the McArthur fire danger classes across Australia.

TI  - Satellite mapping of urban built-up heights reveals extreme infrastructure gaps and inequalities in the Global South
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on urban built-up infrastructure is essential to understand the role of cities in shaping environmental, economic, and social outcomes. The lack of data on built-up heights over large areas has limited our ability to characterize urban infrastructure and its spatial variations across the world. Here, we developed a global atlas of urban built-up heights circa 2015 at 500-m resolution from the Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected satellite data. Results show extreme gaps in per capita urban built-up infrastructure in the Global South compared with the global average, and even larger gaps compared with the average levels in the Global North. Per capita urban built-up infrastructures in some countries in the Global North are more than 30 times higher than those in the Global South. The results also show that the built-up infrastructure in 45 countries in the Global North combined, with similar to 16% of the global population, is roughly equivalent to that of 114 countries in the Global South, with similar to 74% of the global population. The inequality in urban built-up infrastructure, as measured by an inequality index, is large in most countries, but the largest in the Global South compared with the Global North. Our analysis reveals the scale of infrastructure demand in the Global South that is required in order to meet sustainable development goals.

TI  - Towards an operational model for estimating day and night instantaneous near-surface air temperature for urban heat island studies: outline and assessment
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (NSAT) is key for assessing urban heat islands, human health, and well-being. However, a widely recognized and cost-and time-effective replicable approach for estimating hourly NSAT is still urgent. In this study, we outline and validate an easy-to-replicate, yet effective, operational model, for automating the estimation of high-resolution day and night instantaneous NSAT. The model is tested on a heat wave event and for a large geographical area. The model combines remotely sensed land surface temperature and digital elevation model, with air temperature from local fixed weather station networks. Achieved NSAT has daily and hourly frequency consistent with MODIS revisiting time. A geographically weighted regression method is employed, with exponential weighting found to be highly accurate for our purpose. A robust assessment of different methods, at different time slots, both day-and night-time, and during a heatwave event, is provided based on a cross-validation protocol. Four-time periods are modelled and tested, for two consecutive days, i.e. 31st of July 2020 at 10:40 and 21:50, and 1st of August 2020 at 02:00 and 13:10 local time. High R2 was found for all time slots, ranging from 0.82 to 0.88, with a bias close to 0, RMSE ranging from 1.45 degrees C to 1.77 degrees C, and MAE from 1.15 degrees C to 1.36 degrees C. Normalized RMSE and MAE are roughly 0.05 to 0.08. Overall, if compared to other recognized regression models, higher effectiveness is allowed also in terms of spatial autocorre-lation of residuals, as well as in terms of model sensitivity.

TI  - Long-term trajectory and temporal dynamics of tropical peat subsidence in relation to plantation management and climate
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Disentangling land-use and climatic influences on peat subsidence, and establishing the long-term trajectory of subsidence, are necessary to determine the future economic and environmental sustainability of managed peatland landscapes. While many peatlands in temperate regions such as Europe have been drained for centuries, those of Southeast Asia have mostly been drained for agriculture and forestry practices within the last 30 years. These areas are subsiding rapidly, but few long-term subsidence records exist, and it is unclear whether currently high subsidence rates will be maintained in future. Furthermore, large-scale climate fluctuations associated with the El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) exert a strong year-to-year influence on rainfall rates, affecting water table depth dynamics in both managed and intact peatlands. In this study, we analysed data collected over more than a decade of subsidence measurements from over 400 plantation and forest plots in Sumatra, Indonesia, including a unique set of 62 sites that have been continuously monitored since 2007. We show that spatial and temporal variations in subsidence rates are primarily determined by water table depth. We also find evidence of declining subsidence rates as a function of time since initial drainage, consistent with previous instrumental records from high-latitude peatlands and recent satellite data from tropical peatlands. Subsidence rates over the study period were strongly affected by the large ENSO/IOD-linked drought event in 2015-16, which caused an acceleration of subsidence across all sites. In plantation areas, we estimate that this climate perturbation caused around 14 % of subsidence observed over a twelve year period. At interior forest sites this rose to 32 %, and we found little evidence of ecosystem recovery to the end of 2018. This raises the possibility that repeated extreme droughts in the region could lead to long-term degradation of peat swamp forest ecosystems.

TI  - Extraction and mapping of downpour impact and their Cumulonimbus origin, 20 May 2020, Valcea (Romania) via Sentinnel-1 SAR dual polarization
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to study the impact and characteristics of the meteorological phenomenon that occurred on May 20, 2020 in Valcea County, Romania. For this purpose, we used SAR radar images from the Sentinel-1 series at different dates, before, during and after the event. The methodology consists in exploiting and combining the two polarisations, VV and VH, of the recorded radar wave. The results obtained can be summarised as the extraction of areas completely covered by water and areas characterised by high roughness and very high humidity. The latter (roughness/humidity) can have two different origins. The first one corresponds to an area affected by downpours, giving a high roughness due to the interaction of water drops with the ground and also to the presence of hail, amplified by the wind factor. On the other hand, the second one coincides, quite simply, with the presence of a thundercloud, precisely a Cumulonimbus, which formed in that particular place as a result of the favourable geomorphological characteristics and meteorological conditions, giving a high humidity due to the high water content. We also determined the total impacted area of about 96.71 km(2), whose 60.17 km(2) of water covered area, which is 2.45% of the study area. The remaining 36.54 km(2) (1.49%) represents the affected rough surface, located in the plain, or the humid surface corresponding to the area of the Cumulonimbus head covering the plain.

TI  - Desertification process and its effects on vegetation carbon sources and sinks vary under different aridity stress in Central Asia during 1990-2020
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification has hampered eco-environment sustainable development in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas. However, the effect of the desertification process on vegetation carbon sources and sinks remains un-clear in Central Asia. Based on Landsat images and cloud computing, this study applied and evaluated five machine learning methods (i.e., classification and regression tree, random forest, support vector machine, gradient tree boost (GTB), and naive bayes) and desertification difference index method to improve desertifi-cation estimation by integrating vegetation, soil, terrain, and climate conditions. According to the optimal method and net ecosystem production (NEP) model, we quantitatively explored vegetation carbon sources and sinks in Central Asia from 1990 to 2020, and then the effect of the desertification process on them was quantified under different aridity stress. The results showed that GTB method performs best on the test set and spatial pattern, which has higher overall accuracy (82.1 %) and Kappa coefficient (0.78) than other five methods. The desertification area has decreased by 8.58 % (341,643 km(2)) from 1990 to 2020. Among them, the severe and slight desertification areas decreased by 62.42 % and 32.11 %, respectively, while the moderate and high desertification areas increased by 24.6 % and 13.11 %, respectively. In particular, land restoration areas where the desertification restored one or above levels, accounted for 33.91 % of the total area. NEP in Central Asia showed an increasing trend at a rate of 0.54 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 1990-2020, and the area passed the t-test (p < 0.05) was mainly located in Kazakh Steppe, Kazakh Uplands, and the edge of Tianshan Mountains. In general, restoring the land of degraded ecosystems has stored up 61.08 x 10(3) t carbon, accounting for 59.61 % of the total net change of NEP, but the fragile ecological environments in the existing desertification areas have been further aggravated.

TI  - A hybrid calibration method for improving hydrological systems using ground-based and remotely-sensed observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Confidence in the simulation of hydrological models to accurately represent the inherent variability of a watershed is dependent on proper calibration. Calibration of hydrological models using streamflow and actual evapotranspiration (AET) data, which the latter has a remarkable spatial and temporal distribution in the watershed scale, gives more confidence on the partitioning of water between soil storage and aquifer recharge. Therefore, this study aims to improve hydrological response of the agricultural-based Neishaboor watershed, located at the northeast of Iran, using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). To this end, monthly streamflow data at three hydrometric stations (1997-2010) and monthly AET values, computed by SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) algorithm using MODIS products (2001-2010), were employed for the SWAT hybrid calibration and validation. The results showed that RCHRG_DP, SOL_AWC, ESCO, EPCO and CANMX are the most sensitive parameters to AET estimation. The proposed hybrid calibration method had reasonable per-formance on AET estimation in which NS and RMSE values varied between 0.7-0.88 and 7.89-9.96 mm.month-1 in calibration and 0.86-0.93 and 6.79-7.91 mm.month-1 in validation periods, respectively. In comparison to SEBAL-based AET, a general under-prediction tendency was observed by the SWAT-based AET with the proposed method. Highest error rate of the SWAT model for the calibration (average RMSE = 17.18) and validation (average RMSE = 9.44) periods was obtained in the range of measured AET values which were higher than 50 mm.month-1. In the watershed scale, the calibrated SWAT model with the proposed hybrid calibration method provides efficient tool for hydrological monitoring, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Paddy rice methane emissions across Monsoon Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although rice cultivation is one of the most important agricultural sources of methane (CH4) and contributes similar to 8% of total global anthropogenic emissions, large discrepancies remain among estimates of global CH4 emissions from rice cultivation (ranging from 18 to 115 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) due to a lack of observational constraints. The spatial distribution of paddy-rice emissions has been assessed at regional-to-global scales by bottom-up inventories and land surface models over coarse spatial resolution (e.g., > 0.5 degrees) or spatial units (e.g., agro-ecological zones). However, high-resolution CH4 flux estimates capable of capturing the effects of local climate and management practices on emissions, as well as replicating in situ data, remain challenging to produce because of the scarcity of high-resolution maps of paddy-rice and insufficient understanding of CH4 predictors. Here, we combine paddy-rice methane-flux data from 23 global eddy covariance sites and MODIS remote sensing data with machine learning to 1) evaluate data-driven model performance and variable importance for predicting rice CH4 fluxes; and 2) produce gridded up-scaling estimates of rice CH4 emissions at 5000-m resolution across Monsoon Asia, where similar to 87% of global rice area is cultivated and similar to 90% of global rice production occurs. Our random-forest model achieved Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.59 and 0.69 for 8-day CH4 fluxes and site mean CH4 fluxes respectively, with land surface temperature, biomass and water-availability-related indices as the most important predictors. We estimate the average annual (winter fallow season excluded) paddy rice CH4 emissions throughout Monsoon Asia to be 20.6 +/- 1.1 Tg yr(-1) for 2001-2015, which is at the lower range of previous inventory-based estimates (20-32 CH4 Tg yr(-1)). Our estimates also suggest that CH4 emissions from paddy rice in this region have been declining from 2007 through 2015 following declines in both paddy-rice growing area and emission rates per unit area, suggesting that CH4 emissions from paddy rice in Monsoon Asia have likely not contributed to the renewed growth of atmospheric CH4 in recent years.

TI  - The Upper Paleolithic rock art of Ukraine between here and nowhere
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The complex of Kamyana Mohyla is the westernmost rock art location of the Eurasian Steppe and the largest accumulation of cave art sites in the Eastern Europe. So far it has been believed that the complex contains the Upper Paleolithic cave art images as well as portable art collection that resemble the instances of Upper Paleolithic worldview. Though this belief lacked the support of archaeological context and chronological attribution it remained neither proved nor disputed. However, the application of digital photogrammetric tools allowed to perform the sub-millimeter surface modeling of the rock art objects and to re-examine and reconsider the engravings that were previously attributed to Pleistocene. The modeling results presented in this article revealed the complete absence of figurative images for the collection of portable art specimens and the dubious character of those for the cave art one. Therefore, the whole collection should be reconsidered, studied and attributed according to the state of the art and contemporary archaeological record in the region. This contribution attempts to think over the possible Upper Paleolithic origin of the motifs from Kamyana Mohyla in the light of new data and proposes three hypotheses towards the understanding of the rock art assemblage from one of the caves in the complex.

TI  - Predictive soil mapping in the Boreal Plains of Northern Alberta by using multi-temporal remote sensing data and terrain derivatives
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As Canada's vast Boreal Plains are extensively managed, predictive soil mapping could be used as an effective tool to generate high-resolution soil information for the region to inform sustainable resource management. This study aimed to investigate the use of multi-temporal remote sensing data and terrain derivatives to map soil types in the region. A method of constraining subgroup and great-group soil-type predictions based on the predictions at higher-order levels (great-group and order, respectively) was tested. Sentinel time series median values obtained by using Google Earth Engine were tested in combination with first-and second-order digital elevation model derivatives for use as predictor variables in the predictive models. A recursive feature selection process was implemented to reduce the number of predictor variables used in model training. Soil classes were predicted at the order, great-group, and subgroup levels and two approaches were tested. In the first approach, models were unconstrained based on previous predictions. In the second approach, models were constrained to predict only soil great group classes that occur within the predicted soil order for a given location and similarly predict only soil subgroup classes that occur within the predicted soil great group for a given location. Determined through independent validation testing, the most probable predicted soil maps had overall accuracies ranging from 42% to 68% and kappa scores ranging from 0.33 to 0.48. Overall, the constrained models had the best performance of the approaches tested.

TI  - Total Tumor Load to assist in the decision for additional axillary surgery in the positive sentinel node breast cancer patients
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - The Total Tumor Load (TTL) concept has been demonstrated to accurately predict the status of the non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLN) in breast cancer patients. In 2019, our center implemented the TTL cut-off of 30,000 CK19 mRNA copies/mu L as sole criterion for deciding on performing ALND.This retrospective, unicentric, study analyzed 87 cT1-3N0 breast cancer patients treated consecutively in a period of two years and aimed to evaluate the performance of this criterion. Secondary objectives included the comparison of the criterion versus our previous Clinical Decision Rule (CDR) versus ACOSOG Z0011 criteria for avoiding an ALND in proportion of patients spared an ALND and in proportion of patients left with a surgically untreated metastasized axilla. An interim analysis revealed new TTL cut-offs for deciding on performing an ALND.The 30,000 CK19 mRNA copies/mu L criterion yielded an area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.849, a false positive (FP) rate of 30.1% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 38.9%. The 30,000 CK19 mRNA copies/mu L criterion spared 58.6% of the patients an ALND versus 41.4% with CDR versus 73.6% with Z0011 and left 0.0% patients with a surgically untreated metastasized axilla versus 21.4% with CDR versus 42.9% with Z0011. The new TTL cut-off of 260,000 CK19 mRNA copies/mu L for deciding on an ALND yielded an AUC of 0.753, a FP rate of 13.7% and a PPV of 47.4%. This new criterion spared 78.2% of the study sample an ALND and left 35.7% of metastasized axillae surgically untreated.This study emphasizes the need to find a new balance between locoregional control and the morbidity associated with Berg levels I + II axillary lymph node dissection.

TI  - In-situ investigations via confocal video-processing analyses of mullite vs. alumina refractories for application to biomass-fueled gasifiers
T2  - CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) targets modular gasifiers that can accommodate diversified carbon feedstock such as biomass and waste plastics. Towards this goal, it is necessary to better understand interactions of candidate refractory ceramics with feedstock ashes. In this work, confocal scanning laser microscopy in conjunction with a variety of image-processing techniques was utilized to assess these interactions insitu with biomass ashes. We found that various ash components followed different timelines. A key factor which further affected these timelines was proximity to chemical and/or topological boundaries, including but not limited to other ash or slag, pores, cracks, crevices, grain boundaries, and matrix-aggregate boundaries. Alignment techniques such as Scale-Invariant Features Transformation (SIFT) enabled increased comparability of features as ZY or XZ planes could be aligned fully onto a consistent location of an ash. In tandem with thresholding techniques and assessment of useful features, SIFT allows potential for future rapid analyses of otherwise difficult to quantify videography.

TI  - Pine pest detection using remote sensing satellite images combined with a multi-scale attention-UNet model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pest monitoring of forest areas is essential to pest control. The existing remote sensing satellite image methods have been widely used in detecting pine wilt disease due to their low cost and large detection range. However, most existing methods for pine wilt disease detection are based on multi-phase remote sensing satellite imagery and use manually designed features or machine learning-based algorithms. This makes these methods time-consuming and does not allow early detection of pest-infested forests and can also lead to further spread of the disease. In addition, machine learning-based algorithms can have poor detection performance and gener-alization ability. To address these shortcomings, this paper uses the pine forest in the Qingyuan area of Liaoning Province in China as a study area to analyze the physiological characteristics of pine pests based on the aerial photography data collected by a Quadrotor-type unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). By combining these data with the artificial field survey data, the pest-infested areas of forest are marked in the Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing (SRS) images. Further, an end-to-end automatic pest detection framework is designed based on a multi -scale attention-UNet (MA-UNet) model and monophasic images. In addition, the detection performance of the developed model is further optimized using the data augmentation technique to extend the labeled dataset. Compared with the traditional model, the proposed model achieves a much better recall rate of 57.38% in detecting pest-infested forest areas, while the recall rates of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), UNet, attention-UNet, and MedT models are 14.38%, 49.33%, 48.02%, and 33.64%, respectively. According to the results, the proposed model can achieve timely detection and screening of pest-infested forest areas, improving forest management efficiency.

TI  - Glacier elevation change during two periods in the Lenglongling mountains derived from bistatic SAR interferometry
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Bistatic SAR interferometry is a feasible technique of deriving glacier height changes. Early studies on glacier change in the Qilian Mountains showed that the glacier area declined, terminus retreated, and flow velocity slowed down. In this study, five pairs of X-band bistatic TerraSAR-X/TamDEM-X images from 2014 to 2019 and an iterative D-InSAR method respect to SRTM DEM of 2000 were employed, which improved the reliability and accuracy of glacier height changing observations. From 2000 to 2014, the height of glaciers in the Lenglonglin Mountains decreased by (-0.64 +/- 0.06) m year(-1). Glaciers in the Gangshika peak and its surrounding region thinned at the rate of (-0.68 +/- 0.09) m year(-1) from 2014 to 2019. The values observed using remote sensing was in accordance with RTK-GPS measured values. Stable precipitation and increasing temperature since 1990 could be responsible for the quick glacier mass loss.

TI  - Plasma metabolomics for the assessment of the progression of non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MARKERS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objectives Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading type of lung cancer with a high mortality rate worldwide. Although many procedures for the diagnosis and prognosis assessment of lung cancer exist, they are often laborious, expensive, and invasive. This study aimed to develop an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS)-based analysis method for the plasma biomarkers of NSCLC with the potential to indicate the stages and progression of this malignancy conveniently and reliably. Methods A total of 53 patients with NSCLC in early stages (I-III) and advanced stage (IV) were classified into the early and advanced groups based on the tumor node metastasis staging system. A comprehensive metabolomic analysis of plasma from patients with NSCLC was performed via UPLC-MS/MS. Principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis were conducted for statistical analysis. Potential biomarkers were evaluated and screened through receiver operating characteristic analyses and correlation analysis. Main differential metabolic pathways were also identified by utilizing metaboanalyst. Results A total of 129 differential metabolites were detected in accordance with the criteria of VIP >= 1 and a P-value of <= 0.05. The receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that 11 of these metabolites have the potential to be promising markers of disease progression. Apparent correlated metabolites were also filtered out. Furthermore, the 11 most predominant metabolic pathways with alterations involved in NSCLC were identified. Conclusion Our study focused on the plasma metabolomic changes in patients with NSCLC. These changes may be used for the prediction of the stage and progression of NSCLC. Moreover, we discussed the metabolic pathways wherein the altered metabolites were mainly enriched.

TI  - Outdoor light at night in relation to glucose homoeostasis and diabetes in Chinese adults: a national and cross-sectional study of 98,658 participants from 162 study sites
T2  - DIABETOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims/hypothesis Exposure to artificial light at night (LAN) disrupts the circadian timing system and might be a risk factor for diabetes. Our aim was to estimate the associations of chronic exposure to outdoor LAN with glucose homoeostasis markers and diabetes prevalence based on a national and cross-sectional survey of the general population in China.Methods The China Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance Study was a nationally representative study of 98,658 participants aged >= 18 years who had been living in their current residence for at least 6 months recruited from 162 study sites across mainland China in 2010. Diabetes was defined according to ADA criteria. Outdoor LAN exposure in 2010 was estimated from satellite data and the participants attending each study site were assigned the same mean radiance of the outdoor LAN at the study site. The linear regression incorporating a restricted cubic spline function was used to explore the relationships between LAN exposure and markers of glucose homoeostasis. Cox regression with a constant for the time variable assigned to an individuals and with robust variance estimates was used to assess the associations between the levels of outdoor LAN exposure and the presence of diabetes by calculating the prevalence ratios (PRs) with adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, family history of diabetes, household income, urban/rural areas, taking antihypertensive medications, taking lipid-lowering medications, and BMI.Results The mean age of the study population was 42.7 years and 53,515 (weighted proportion 49.2%) participants were women. Outdoor LAN exposure levels were positively associated with HbA(1c), fasting and 2 h glucose concentrations and HOMA-IR and negatively associated with HOMA-B. Diabetes prevalence was significantly associated with per-quintile LAN exposure (PR 1.07 [95% CI 1.02, 1.12]). The highest quintile of LAN exposure (median 69.1 nW cm(-2) sr(-1)) was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of diabetes (PR 1.28 [95% CI 1.03, 1.60]) compared with the lowest quintile of exposure (median 1.0 nW cm(-2) sr(-1)).Conclusions/interpretation There were significant associations between chronic exposure to higher intensity of outdoor LAN with increased risk of impaired glucose homoeostasis and diabetes prevalence. Our findings contribute to the growing evidence that LAN is detrimental to health and point to outdoor LAN as a potential novel risk factor for diabetes.

TI  - Flood mitigation effects of lake-reservoir group on the Poyang Lake watershed based on runoff-weighted model from multi-satellite weekly observation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Poyang Lake watershed is located on the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. It has been hit by frequent floods in past few decades.Study focus: Lake-reservoir groups (LRG) are important in extreme hydrologic event mitigation in watersheds. This study used runoff-weighted model to quantify the influence of LRG on the flood mitigation in Poyang Lake based on weekly observations of GF-1 and Sentinel-1.New hydrological insights for the region: The weekly water storage volume of LRG in the Poyang Lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of increasing (April-September) first and then decreasing (October-March) from 2016 to 2020. The runoff-weighted model has a better effect on the calculation of detained flood volume and residence time of retained flood. The average annual total detained flood volume of LRG were 4.39 x 10(8) m(3), 5.06 x 10(8) m(3), 1.64 x 10(8) m(3), 0.54 x 10(8) m(3), and 0.15 x 10(8) m(3) in the Xiushui, Ganjiang, Fuhe, Xinjiang, and Raohe basins, respectively, among which Xiushui and Ganjiang basins contributed the most to flood detention. The residence time of retained flood by LRG in the five basins are long during the dry season (October to March) but short during the wet season (April to September), and they are generally longer than those in the natural state with no reservoir. The delay days of the LRG to flood peaks were about 12, 7, 13, 22, and 26 d for each basin, respectively.

TI  - Worldview defence and self-determination theory explain the return of racial voting: Evidence from the 2016 US election
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We use self-determination (SDT) and worldview defence theories (WDT) to explicate the psychological roots of identitarian voting in recent US, UK and EU elections. We test our theory using the 2016 US election as a case study, data from a representative sample of nearly half a million Americans, and a measure of racial animus derived from Google search data. We find that worry has a strong and significant positive association with Trump's vote share, as predicted by WDT. However, this is reversed in counties with high levels of relatedness-one of the three basic psychological needs emphasised by SDT. The positive relationship between racial animus and Trump also loses significance once an interaction between racial animus and relatedness is introduced. These results imply that identitarianism is driven at least in part by a desire for in-group affiliation emerging out of worldview defence and unmet basic psychological needs.

TI  - Low-cost molecular methodology for blood group antigens identification and genotyping contribution to transfusion efficacy in multiple transfused patients
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Blood transfusions usually result in the production of alloantibodies, complicating subsequent transfusions. Many blood group systems, in addition to ABO and Rh, can lead to the production of irregular antibodies in multiple transfused patients. Objectives The aim of this work was to standardize a molecular biology methodology for identified some alleles of KEL, FY, JK and DI blood group system; the transfusion efficacy of chronically transfused patients with phenotype-matched blood was also evaluated. Methods A PCR-SSP was developed and validated using Sanger sequencing. The genotype and frequencies of 141 multiple transfused patients treated at blood banks of Maringa were compared with the blood donor's population to assess the availability of compatible blood bags. The clinical history of 29 patients on a phenotype-compatible transfusion regimen was followed to assess pre- and post-genotyping alloimmunization. Results The PCR-SSP was effective in identifying the genotypes under study. Significant differences were observed in genotype and allele frequencies for FY and JK. Compatible bags were identified for all patients. Most patients (93.1%) did not develop new alloantibodies after erythrocyte genotyping. Conclusion Erythrocyte genotyping proved to be important both in the search for positive blood bags for rare alleles and in the prevention of alloimmunization.

TI  - Determination of potential secondary lahar hazard areas based on pre-and post-eruption UAV DEMs: Automatic identification of initial lahar starting points and supplied lahar volume
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary lahars, generated after volcanic eruptions, may pose significant threats to life and infrastructure. Secondary lahars typically develop from ash deposits and other volcanic debris that remobilize downstream via intense rainfall. The lahar inundation zone after eruptions must be predicted to minimize the impact. This prediction can be modeled based on digital elevation models (DEMs) and two parameters associated with lahar simulations: the lahar starting point (LSP), which indicates the potential locations at which a lahar flow may initiate, and supplied lahar volume (SLV), which is the lahar volume corresponding to each LSP. These parameters are typically determined by assumptions based on past lahar events, which may be unrealistic and often misinterpreted in the inundation prediction. To address this problem, this paper proposes an automated method to estimate the LSP and SLV based on pre-and post-eruption DEMs generated by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and simulate the inundation zone using the LAHARZ model. The study site is located in the southeast region of Mount Agung (Indonesia), and the objective is to mitigate the potential secondary lahar hazard after the 2017-2019 eruption crisis. Results show that the parameter estimations using the high-resolution UAV DEM and LAHARZ produce a realistic lahar simulation, with a satisfactory similarity of 82%, as verified against the lahar footprint. Moreover, we compare the results with those obtained using TerraSAR-X DEM and demonstrate the importance of using a detailed UAV DEM to avoid underestimating the lahar runout and ensure that the simulated inundation zones mimic real lahars.

TI  - Between the devil and the deep blue sea: Trends, drivers, and impacts of coastal reclamation in Malaysia and way forward
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities all over the world are edging further into the ocean. Coastal reclamation is a global conservation issue with im-plications for ocean life, ecosystems, and human well-being. Using Malaysia as a case study, the coastal reclamation trends over three decades (1991-2021) were mapped using Landsat images and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) via the Google Earth Engine platform. The changes in drivers and impacts of these coastal expansions through-out the decades were also reviewed. Twelve out of the 14 states in Malaysia had planned, active, or completed recla-mations on their shorelines. Between 1991 and 2021, an absolute area of 82.64 km2 has been or will be reclaimed should all the projects be completed. The most reported driver for coastal expansion in Malaysia is for development and modernization (41 %), followed by rise in human population (20 %), monetary gains from the development of prime land (15 %), and agriculture and aquaculture activities (9 %). Drivers such as reduction of construction costs, financial advantage of prime land, oil and gas, advancement of technology, and tourism (Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H)) had only started occurring within the last decade, while others have been documented since the 1990's. Pollution is the most reported impact (24 %) followed by disruption of livelihoods, sources of income and human well-being (21 %), destruction of natural habitats (17 %), decrease in biodiversity (11 %), changes in land-scapes (10 %), erosion / accretion (8 %), threat to tourism industry (6 %), and exposure to wave surges (3 %). Of these, changes in landscape, shoreline alignment, seabed contour, and coastal groundwater, as well as wave surges had only started to surface as impacts in the last two decades. Efforts to protect existing natural coastal and marine eco-systems, restore degraded ones, and fund endeavours that emphasize nature is needed to support sustainable develop-ment goals for the benefit of future generations.

TI  - Ecological vulnerability assessment of a China's representative mining city based on hyperspectral remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining cities are clusters of communities that specialized in mining and extractive industries. The extensive mining activities in these cities have stimulated widespread and substantial ecological stresses to the surrounding environment, that significantly jeopardize the health condition of vegetation and human. Given the recent recognition of remote sensing in monitoring large-scale environmental change, we incorporated Ziyuan #1-02D, a recently released hyperspectral remote sensing data, into the ecological vulnerability assessment framework, using Panzhihua city as a case study, which is recognized as one of the most representative mining cities in China. The multi-spectral imaging data was widely applied in previous research. However, with the wide bands, multi-spectral imaging data cannot depict detailed characteristics of spectral targeted. As a result, we introduce indexes from the hyperspectral imaging to ecological vulnerability assessment proposed in this study, which can depict and monitor the growth and restoration of vegetation more accurately. We used the optimum index factor method to select bands from the satellite-based Ziyuan #1-02D data for quantifying vegetation indexes and red edge. Besides, we obtained inventory data, land-use, soil type, and typography of Panzhihua city to reconstruct its ecological vulnerability index (EVI) for 2020 and 2021. Comparing to the multi-spectral data, the ecological vulnerability results from hyperspectral imaging performed better in precision and concentration in EVI values, reaching the conclusions more directly. Specifically, the mining area and the relevant hazard types and impact areas were delineated through intensive fieldwork. Results suggested that the east and west districts, and north of Renhe district suffer great ecological stress, in which we observed intensive coal and metal-related mining in-dustry. The central region, which occupies vanadium titanomagnetite mines, also shows substantial ecological issues, while the other mining industries, such as granite ore did not significantly influence the local environ-ment. Although the newly released satellite-based data only have two-year periods, we still observed improving ecological conditions, with the southeast and west regions showing much lower ecological vulnerability values. The spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested that the high-high clustering region of EVI is located in the east, west, and Renhe districts, primarily due to the mining industries of variations scales. We also found that the clustering of low ecological vulnerable regions, mostly surrounds the vanadium titanomagnetite excavation industry, thanks to the local restoration projects.

TI  - Carbon estimation in an integrated crop-livestock system with imaging sensors aboard unmanned aerial platforms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass and carbon estimates in integrated crop-livestock (iLP) systems remain scarce. Recently, sensors aboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have been used for such estimation and can represent an efficient and low-cost method for acquiring accurate remote-sensing data. This study aimed to estimate the relationship between vegetation indices (VIs) and carbon stock in an up-land rice field intercropped with Brachiaria, an exotic grass species in the savanna ecosystem of Brazil (Cerrado biome), using multispectral aerial imaging with a high cartographic scale. The re-search was conducted in an experimental iLP system located at the Brazilian Agricultural Re-search Corporation (Embrapa Arroz e Feijao), Goias State. During the data collection stage, flights were conducted with a fixed-wing UAV (eBee Plus RTK) on the same day or close to col-lecting biomass samples in the field. In the processing step, a correlation was performed between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio (SR), soil-adjusted vegetation in-dex (SAVI), and modified photochemical reflectance index (MPRI) VIs and the biomass measured in the field. The results indicated that the vegetation index (VI) that used the near-infrared (NIR) band showed a stronger correlation with biomass than the VI that used only the visible band in-formation. All VIs were significantly correlated with the estimated field biomass (P < 0.05) using Pearson's correlation. The regression models were able to predict the biomass and carbon stock in Phase 1 (3.93 Mg ha-1, 1.66 Mg ha-1, R2 = 0.748) and Phase 2 (7.53 Mg ha-1, 3.19 Mg ha-1, R2 = 0.816). From the best model selected for each phase, maps with the spatial and temporal distribution of the biomass of the iLP system were plotted, demonstrating one of the advantages of employing remote sensing techniques based on drones and multispectral imaging sensors.

TI  - Production of orthophoto map using mobile photogrammetry and comparative assessment of cost and accuracy with satellite imagery for corridor mapping: a case study in Manesar, Haryana, India
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to find a low-cost alternate technology to get imagery, using mobile platform, and produce digital orthophoto for corridor mapping, with a higher degree of accuracy and which can reduce the lag time of acquisition of data. The present study uses digital single-lens reflex cameras, mounted on a mobile vehicle, and acquisition of data in the video format rather than still photographs, as traditionally used in mobile mapping systems. The videos are used to create a set of images and orthophotos. A widespread ground control points were recorded in the study area, using the global navigation satellite system receiver, which measured the control points in real-time kinematic mode. Generation of digital orthophoto has been completed using the captured mobile imagery and ground control point. Furthermore, procurement of satellite imagery and aerial triangulation using ground control points have been done. While comparing the planimetric accuracy of orthophoto against satellite imagery using the ground control points, the achieved root mean square error value of produced orthophoto is 0.171 m in X axis and 0.205 m in Y axis. However, for Cartosat -1 satellite imagery, the RMSE value for X is 1.22 m and for Y is 1.98 m. This research proposes the alternate low-cost mobile mapping method to capture the imagery for orthophoto production. The cost of orthophoto production from mobile image was found 77% cheaper than the orthophoto cost from fresh/latest satellite imagery procurement, while the overall production was 70% cost-effective than the orthophoto maps made from archived imagery.

TI  - Bayesian model averaging to improve the yield prediction in wheat breeding trials
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate pre-harvest prediction of wheat yield through secondary traits helps to facilitate plant breeding and reduce costs. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly applied to grain yield with remote sensing data. However, the performance of individual ML algorithms varies for different species in different environments due to different sources of uncertainty. This study proposed a novel wheat yield prediction framework based on canopy hyperspectral reflectance (350-2500 nm) and adopted the ensemble Bayesian model averaging (EBMA) method to improve model performance. To develop the yield prediction models, important bands extracted by the Boruta feature selection method were fed into four linear ML models and four nonlinear ML models. Meanwhile, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) weights obtained based on model cross-validation performance were used to combine the predictions of individual ML models. Compared to the best-performing individual model, the EBMA models obtained a weak accuracy improvement by integrating only the linear models or the nonlinear models. Additionally, the integration of two linear models and two non-linear models simultaneously was analyzed. Results indicate that most EBMA combinations of mixed linear and non-linear models achieved higher prediction accuracy than those integrating a single type of model and the best-performing individual model. The advantage of the EBMA method is that it produces a prediction distribution that reflects the un-certainty associated with deterministic predictions. With full consideration of the model diversity of ensemble members, the EBMA modeling framework provides an alternative method for predicting grain yield in plant breeding trials.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in desmoplastic melanoma - the percent desmoplastic component matters: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a less common form of cutaneous melanoma that has been described for decades; however, controversy remains regarding the management and use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The purpose of this study is to identify whether SLNB is indicated in all cases of DM, including the pure subtype.Methods: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed (with access to MEDLINE) along with the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 2001 to 2019. Case series and case-control studies were included.Results: Eighteen studies were included for a total population of 3,914 patients. SLNB was per-formed in 2229 patients. The percentage of positive SLNB results was 8.5%. However, patients with pure DM ( > 90% desmoplastic component) were found to have a significantly lower rate of occult metastatic node positivity when compared with that of mixed DM (4.9% and 14.8%, respectively). Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of the pathologist reporting percentage of desmoplastic component in melanoma. SLNB should be strongly considered for patients with mixed DM. However, the low rate of occult metastatic node positivity in pure DM is beneath the threshold for using SLNB as a staging procedure.Summary: Previous studies have suggested that desmoplastic melanoma is less likely to metas-tasize to regional lymph nodes when compared with conventional melanoma. This review sug-gests that it is imperative to distinguish the histologic subtype of desmoplastic melanoma to determine if staging procedure is indicated.(c) 2022 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

TI  - Chemistry of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in haze events in two East Asian cities during winter-spring 2019
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - East Asian experiences frequent severe haze episodes (EPs) during winter-spring, and their causes are not fully understood. Two EPs (daily average PM2.5 > 35 mu g m(-3)) occurred at Tianjin (TJ), China, and Daejeon (DJ), Korea, during late February (EP-1) and early March (EP-2) 2019. The mean total PM2.5 concentrations at the TJ and DJ sites during these events (82.9 and 66.2 mu g m(-3), respectively) were approximately three times higher than those observed during non-haze events (27.3 and 23.0 mu g m(-3), respectively). MODIS satellite RGB images suggested that aerosols were transported regionally from east Asian countries to the DJ site during EPs. After NO3-, the major contributors to PM2.5 during the EPs at both sites were NH4+, SO42- , and organic carbon (OC), indicating that secondary aerosols were important in severe haze formation. During the EPs, the distributions of secondary chemical species were similar at the two sites, with coefficient of divergence (COD) values of <0.2, whereas primary chemical species had dissimilar distributions with COD values of >0.2. This suggests that secondary aerosols may be impacted by regional influences, whereas primary aerosols are subject to more local influence. The average COD values in the first two days (27-28 February) relative to the remaining days (1-7 March) were <0.2 at the DJ site during EP-2, indicating no additional local production of secondary and primary species. Sulfur oxidation ratios (SOR) were lower at the TJ site than at the DJ site, while nitrogen oxidation ratios (NOR) were higher. Gradual increases observed in SOR and NOR at the TJ site early in the EPs imply significant secondary formation of SO42- and NO3-. Strong correlations between aerosol liquid-water content (ALWC) and SOR and NOR at the TJ site indicate that aqueous-phase reactions were important in the formation of SO42- and NO3-. Although high concentrations of SO42- and NO3- were observed at the DJ site, correlations between ALWC and SOR/NOR were weak with low regression gradients, implying that SO42- and NO3- may have been associated with regional transport. Low COD values, and SOR and NOR values similar to those at the beginning of EP-2, imply that additional formation of SO42- or NO3- at the DJ site is not active, with stagnant atmospheric conditions prevailing.

TI  - Reliability of cross-regional applications of global fire danger models: a Peruvian case study
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Fire danger indexes (FDIs) are used as proxies for fire potential and are often developed for specific locations. For practical purposes, the extrapolation of the underlying calculations into novel locations is common, but it is generally uncertain if the relationships between FDIs and fire potential observed in the environment in which the index was developed are equally relevant in others. For example, although a topographically, ecologically, and climatologically complex country, f ire danger forecasts in Peru use a standard set of nationwide thresholds applied to the Fire Weather Index. In this study, we validate the underlying assumption that weather-fire relationships are spatially uniform within Peru by (1) making cross-regional comparisons of the statistical distributions of four FDIs-Burning Index, Energy Release Component, Fire Weather Index, and Keetch-Byram Drought Index, and (2) making crossregional comparisons of the expected daily MODIS hotspot count percentiles conditioned on FDI values.Results: Significant regional differences in the distributions of daily FDI values were observed in every pair of regions within Peru, and with the exception of a pair of regions within the Amazon, little data (< 90 days) were necessary to detect these differences. After controlling for FDI values and seasonal and annual effects with regressions, differences in predicted hotspot percentiles were common, differing by as much as 47 percentage points. Across the pairs of regions, the magnitude of these differences tended to decrease as climatic similarity increased, but some counterexamples were also apparent.Conclusions: The noticeable differences in the distributions of daily FDI values suggest that a standard set of breakpoints may produce unreliable inferences regarding fire potential. We also find that even if the climatic conditions were similar across Peru, the same FDI values in two locations can produce substantially differing predictions of wildfire activity. This suggests that other factors besides FDI values can strongly mediate wildfire activity and that better fire potential predictions could be produced if these factors are accounted for.

TI  - Multi-spectral multi-image super-resolution of Sentinel-2 with radiometric consistency losses and its effect on building delineation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution remote sensing imagery is used in a broad range of tasks, including detection and classification of objects. High-resolution imagery is however expensive to obtain, while lower resolution imagery is often freely available and can be used for a range of social good applications. To that end, we curate a multi-spectral multi-image dataset for super-resolution of satellite images. We use PlanetScope imagery from the SpaceNet-7 challenge as the high resolution reference and multiple Sentinel-2 revisits of the same location as the low-resolution imagery. We present the first results of applying multi-image super-resolution (MISR) to multi -spectral remote sensing imagery. We, additionally, introduce a radiometric-consistency module into the MISR model to preserve the high radiometric resolution and quality of the Sentinel-2 sensor. We show that MISR is superior to single-image super-resolution (SISR) and other baselines on a range of image fidelity metrics. Furthermore, we present the first assessment of the utility of multi-image super-resolution on a semantic and instance segmentation - common remote sensing tasks - showing that utilizing multiple images results in better performance in these downstream tasks, but MISR pre-processing is non-essential.

TI  - Cloud detection using sentinel 2 imageries: a comparison of XGBoost, RF, SVM, and CNN algorithms
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study reports results of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in comparison to Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate cloud mask comprising of six classes: low cloud, high cloud, cloud shadow, ground, snow, and water. Here, Baetens-Hagolle dataset and WHUS2-CD dataset was considered. Various texture features derived using GLCM, morphological profile analysis, bilateral filtering, and deep features derived using Residual Network (Resnet) were used in combination with spectral information. The first phase of the study suggested both XGBoost and RF exhibit comparable performance for both traditional texture features and deep features, the second phase highlighted that XGBoost showed better generalization capabilities with respect to the different environmental conditions, and finally, comparison with threshold-based methods (Function of Mask [Fmask], Sen2cor, and Maccs-Atcor Joint Method [MAJA]) suggested that XGBoost and RF based cloud detection is a good alternative of existing state-of-the-art cloud detection.

TI  - Land cover classification using multi-fusion based dense transpose convolution in fully convolutional network with feature alignment for remote sensing images
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With advances in social development and economic growth, remote sensing technology has been attracted greater attention in monitoring the earth data using radar and optical sensors on satellite platforms for a wide range of applications in different fields such as coastal, hazard and natural resources. Satellite images could play a greater role in improving classification accuracy with high spatial resolution and rich spectral information for land cover classification. However, existing image fusion methods achieves low accuracy due to large-scale feature space. To focus on these issues, a deep learning network structure needs to classify different classes with high spatial resolution and rich spectral information to obtain higher accuracy. In this paper, a feature-based classification approach is proposed namely Multi-Fusion based Dense Transpose Convolutional layer in Fully Convolutional Network with Feature Alignment framework (MF-DTCFCN) to label and categorizes the label region in Remote Sensing Images (RSI). Initially, a multi-fusion feature framework is designed by adding a point-wise addition structure to handle large-scale feature space for high-resolution images. Secondly, the optimized features are pre-trained to classify the labels comprised of the most discriminative features in the pre-training network. The density of output label maps are improved by introducing dense transpose convolution in the network. Then combine the output to the feature alignment with point-wise addition is employed to balance the different features and similarities to achieve additional performance for classification. Here, the Land Use/land Cover (LULC) satellite image dataset namely, Sentinel-2 were used to classify the urban areas of Hyderabad city, India. Experimental results depict that the MF-DTCFCN approach outperforms an accurate improvement in classification accuracy than existing methods.

TI  - Improving species distribution models for dominant trees in climate data-poor forests using high-resolution remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are useful for predictive and explanatory purposes, allowing biologists to identify how human and environmental factors influence distributions of plants and animals. Lack of high -resolution climatic variables is one of the challenges for accurately predicting distributions of organisms at local or landscape scales. This study used SDMs to predict four dominant tree species distributions in northern Iran temperate forests (400km2 area) using high-resolution Sentinel-2 data (20 m) and topographic variables. We divided the explanatory variables into four datasets with increasing complexity of Sentinel-2 data and modelled distributions using four statistical and machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), generalized boosting model (GBM), generalized linear model (GLM), and generalized additive model (GAM). Our results suggested differences in the predictive performance of the four algorithms. We found the most complex dataset, including topographic variables, Sentinel-2 bands, and vegetation and soil indices, gave the best fit for the four tree species, improving the accuracy of models for the different species between 5 and 16%. We then selected the most complex dataset to produce an ensemble model of the modeling algorithms where evaluation criteria were varied for tree species. Our result showed that the performance of SDMs improved using different satellite remote sensing data including raw bands, topographic variables and indices in the Hyrcanian forest, northern Iran. Elevation was a more significant variable than Sentinel bands and Sentinel vegetation indices variables for predicting the tree species distributions. With the Hyrcanian Forest included in this study region of northern Iran recently declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, a key result of our improved species distribution maps for these four dominant tree species is to support conservation management of forest biodiversity in this region.

TI  - Mapping snow density through thermal inertia observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow, as a fundamental reservoir of freshwater, is a crucial natural resource. Specifically, knowledge of snow density spatial and temporal variability could improve modelling of snow water equivalent, which is relevant for managing freshwater resources in context of ongoing climate change. The possibility of estimating snow density from remote sensing has great potential, considering the availability of satellite data and their ability to generate efficient monitoring systems from space.In this study, we present an innovative method that combines meteorological parameters, satellite data and field snow measurements to estimate thermal inertia of snow and snow density at a catchment scale. Thermal inertia represents the responsiveness of a material to variations in temperature and depends on the thermal conductivity, density and specific heat of the medium. By exploiting Landsat 8 data and meteorological modelling, we generated multitemporal thermal inertia maps in mountainous catchments in the Western European Alps (Aosta Valley, Italy), from incoming shortwave radiation, surface temperature and snow albedo. Thermal inertia was then used to develop an empirical regression model to infer snow density, demonstrating the possibility of mapping snow density from optical and thermal observations from space. The model allows for estimation of snow density with R-CV(2) and RMSECV of 0.59 and 82 kg m(-3), respectively. Thermal inertia and snow density maps are presented in terms of the evolution of snow cover throughout the hydrological season and in terms of their spatial variability in complex topography. This study could be considered a first attempt at using thermal inertia toward improved monitoring of the cryosphere. Limitations of and improvements to the proposed methods are also discussed.This study may also help in defining the scientific requirements for new satellite missions targeting the cryosphere. We believe that a new class of Earth Observation missions with the ability to observe the Earth's surface at high spatial and temporal resolution, with both day and night-time overpasses in both optical and thermal domain, would be beneficial for the monitoring of seasonal snowpacks around the globe.

TI  - Forecasting sunflower grain yield using remote sensing data and statistical models
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting crop production a few weeks before harvest is of strategical interest for the cooperatives which collect, store and market grains. The recent development of Sentinel satellites opened new avenues for yield forecasting at field and farm level, thanks to their operational spatial resolution and revisiting time. In this study, we combined remote sensing data (in-season green area index, GAI) and statistical modeling to forecast sun-flower yield at field level for a range of cultivars and crop practices over different small production areas and years in southwestern France. From 2014-2016, 359 sunflower fields were monitored throughout the growing season in the 'Haute-Garonne' and 'Gers' administrative departments (SW France). From the satellite GAI esti-mates, two variables were calculated: GAImax (maximum GAI, between F1 stage and F1 + 10 days) and GAD (Green Area Duration). Different statistical modeling procedures were tested namely a linear regression (LR), a second degree polynomial regression (PR), a random forest regressor (RF) and a Gaussian process (GP). In each case, the models were tested using either GAD, GAImax or both variables, and each model was trained using in a first time GAD and GAI(max) obtained with linear interpolation, and in a second time, the same variables computed using the double sigmoid interpolation. In a perspective of yield prediction, GAD was calculated from anthesis to maturity but also from anthesis to 10/07, 20/07, 30/07 and 10/08 using remote sensing data. Sunflower grain yield at maturity was predicted with 10 models differing by their forms and the agronomic variables involved. At individual level, GY was slightly better predicted by models including GAD + GAI(max) or GAD, while models based only on GAI(max) were the less accurate. This was consistent with the major importance of post-anthesis radiation interception and senescence dynamics in the development of grain yield in sunflower. Better pre-dictions were achieved in 2014, then in 2015 and finally 2016. However, at the grain catchment area level, PR models including GAD were the most accurate ones with absolute errors ranging from 0.53 to 4.68 q.ha(-1) as a function of years. Only the predictions obtained with 2014 data and over the 3 years were sufficiently accurate to be of operational value for a cooperative manager.

TI  - Best practices in surgical and nonsurgical management of head and neck Merkel cell carcinoma: An update
T2  - MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, highly aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. Controversy exists regarding optimal management of MCC as high-quality randomized studies and clinical trials are limited, and physicians are bound to interpret highly heterogeneous, retrospective literature in their clinical practice. Furthermore, the rising incidence and notably poor prognosis of MCC urges the establishment of best practices for optimal management of the primary tumor and its metastases. Herein, we summarized the relevant evidence and provided an algorithm for decision-making in MCC management based on the latest 2021 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Additionally, we report current active MCC clinical trials in the United States. The initial management of MCC is dependent upon the pathology of the primary tumor and presence of metastatic disease. Patients with no clinical evidence of regional lymph node involvement generally require sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) while clinically node-positive patients should undergo fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy and full imaging workup. If SLNB or FNA/core biopsy are positive, a multidisciplinary team should be assembled to discuss if additional node dissection or adjuvant therapy is necessary. Wide local excision is optimal for primary tumor management and SLNB remains the preferred staging and predictive tool in MCC. The management of MCC has progressively improved in the last decade, particularly due to the establishment of immunotherapy as a new treatment option in advanced MCC. Ongoing trials and prospective studies are needed to further establish the best practices for MCC management.

TI  - Introducing the VIIRS-based Fire Emission Inventory version 0 (VFEIv0)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A new open biomass burning inventory is presented that relies on the fire radiative power data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi NPP satellite. This VIIRS-based Fire Emission Inventory (VFEI) provides emission data from early 2012 to 2019 for more than 40 species of gases and aerosols at spatial resolutions of around 500 m. We found that VFEI produces similar results when compared to other major inventories in many regions of the world. Additionally, we conducted regional simulations using VFEI with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) for Southern Africa (September 2016) and North America (July-August 2019). We compared aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the model against two observational datasets: the MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) product and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) stations. Results showed good agreement between both simulations and the datasets, with mean AOD biases of around +0.03 for Southern Africa and -0.01 for North America. Both simulations were not only able to reproduce the AOD magnitudes accurately, but also the inter-diurnal variations of smoke concentration. In addition, we made use of the airborne data from the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES; Southern Africa) and the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments Experiment and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ; North America) campaigns to evaluate the simulations. In Southern Africa, results showed correlations higher than 0.77 when comparing carbon monoxide and black carbon. In North America, correlations were lower and biases higher. However, this is because the model was not able to reproduce the timing, shape, and location of individual plumes over complex terrain (Rocky Mountains) during the FIREX-AQ campaign period.

TI  - Synthesis of field and satellite data to elucidate recent mass balance of five ice rises in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated mass balance changes over five ice rises in the last few decades near Fimbul and Nivl ice shelves in central Dronning Maud Land. We use the Input-Output Method constrained using field-based geophysical measurements conducted during the austral summers of 2012-14 over three ice rises near the Fimbul Ice Shelf. Further, we use satellite altimetry data (ICESat, ICESat-2, and CryoSat-2) to estimate geodetic mass balance over all five ice rises in recent decades. Both field- and satellite-based estimates show that until 2010, three out of five ice rises were thickening (0.4-0.2 m(ieq) a(-1)) while two were close to balance. However, over the last decade, the ice rises thickening previously started to thin (-0.2--0.6 m(ieq) a(-1)) while the other two remained close to balance. Much of this variability is likely associated with regional surface mass balance trends, with each ice rise exhibiting its characteristics depending on its local glaciological settings.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, drought status analyses of Beysehir-Kasakli Sub-Basin were carried out in the 35-year period (1984-2018) using remote sensing techniques, and accordingly, climate change factors were investigated. In this context, Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS were used. LST, NDVI, VCI, TCI, and VHI indexes were used as satellite-based drought monitoring techniques. Drought analyses were examined separately both for the basin in general and for the immediate surroundings of the Beysehir and Seydisehir districts, the two largest districts of the basin. According to the results of drought categories evaluated by the VHI, Beysehir and its surroundings and the entire basin underwent the highest droughts in 1985, 2000, and 2006. For Seydisehir and its surroundings, 1985, 1996, and 2000 were found to be the highest drought years. In addition, we sought to determine by variance analyses whether there is a statistically significant difference between the result values of VHI for different years. When the results of parametric and non-parametric variance analyses are examined, both variances show a statistically significant difference between VHI values for different years according to the analysis method.

TI  - Enhanced extracellular raw starch-degrading α-amylase production in<i> Bacillus</i><i> subtilis</i> through signal peptide and translation efficiency optimization
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A strategy that combines signal peptide (SP) optimization and translation efficiency improvement was used to enhance the extracellular production of raw starch-degrading alpha-amylase AmyZ1 from Pontibacillus sp. ZY in Bacillus subtilis. The optimal SPYpuAscreened from 173 B. subtilis SPs mediated a 1.28-fold higher AmyZ1 activity than the original SPamyQ. Then, strategies of translation efficiency improvement, including optimizing the Shine-Dalgarno-like (SD-like) sequence, constructing a dual 5 '-untranslated region (dual-UTR), optimizing the spacer region of the UTR, and optimizing the 5 '-proximal coding sequence, were used to enhance AmyZ1 production. The resulting recombinant strain (BZYACO6) containing SD-like3, dUTR2, and an optimized 5 '-proximal coding sequence (O6) produced the highest extracellular alpha-amylase activity of 2974.0 U/mL in shake flask, 2.07-fold higher than that of the original strain BZd34 (1437.6 U/mL). After fermentation optimization, the BZYACO6 strain produced an extracellular AmyZ1 activity of 3915.2 U/mL in shake flask and 25,070 U/mL in 3-L fermenter, representing the highest level of recombinant raw starch-degrading alpha-amylase production reported to date. Furthermore, this work provides a strategic reference for enhancing the extracellular production of other recombinant proteins in B. subtilis.

TI  - Seagrass distribution, areal cover, and changes (1990-2021) in coastal waters off West-Central Florida, USA
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows of West-Central Florida (USA), between 27 degrees 3 ' N - 28 degrees 12 ' N; 82 degrees 24 ' W - 82 degrees 50 ' W, are closely monitored by federal, state, and local groups for benthic composition, density, and areal cover (extent). Biennial aerial mapping, annual in situ surveys, and monthly water quality measurements inform management and conservation actions. Here we leverage a complete archive of multiple satellite imagery products (i.e., Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 imaging sensor data) to reconstruct seagrass areal cover estimates (1990-2021) in four regions of West-Central Florida: St. Joseph Sound, Clearwater Harbor, Tampa Bay, and Sarasota Bay. Satellite imagery hosted in Google Earth Engine (GEE) was screened for low cloud cover (<40%), and clear atmosphere and water conditions using a semi-automated process followed by visual inspection. Im-agery meeting these conditions for seagrass mapping was available for 16 years: 1990, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2004-2006, 2010, and 2015-2021. Space-based time series of seagrass areal cover for each region showed positive correlation with estimates from aerial mapping (r > 0.61). Over the period 1990-2021, satellite-derived estimates show seagrass areal cover increased by 24.3 km(2) (34.4%) in Tampa Bay, 18.0 km(2) (74.1%) in St. Joseph Sound, 6.3 km(2) (182.6%) in Clearwater, and 1.3 km(2) (5.3%) in Sarasota. Overall, the combined seagrass areal cover for the entire region increased by 49.9 km(2) (40.6%), or similar to 1.4% yr(-1), from 1990 through 2021. In-creases in seagrass areal cover before 2020 coincide with improvements in water quality throughout the region (i.e., a general decrease in chlorophyll-a, phosphorous, nitrogen concentration, and turbidity). The publicly available satellite datasets in GEE provide resource managers with complementary and unique tools for syn-optic and repeated seagrass areal cover assessments. This is an important approach to monitor the seagrass cover Essential Ocean Variable (EOV) of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).

TI  - Preliminary investigation of saline water intrusion (SWI) and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) along the south-eastern coast of Andhra Pradesh, India, using groundwater dynamics, sea surface temperature and field water quality anomalies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive anthropogenic activities along the coastal plains of Andhra Pradesh (such as urbanisation, agriculture and aquaculture) rely extensively on coastal fresh groundwater resources that are pumped at unsustainable rates causing groundwater decline and water quality problems due to saline water intrusion. Hydrogeological studies are imperative to implement groundwater conservation strategies in coastal Andhra Pradesh, which is experiencing a severe freshwater shortage due to overexploitation and saline water intrusion as well as clean water loss through the aquifer system close to the coastal plains. An attempt is made in this study to demarcate the submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and saline water intrusion (SWI) zones adopting a three-tier validation system, i.e. groundwater dynamic, LANDSAT resultant sea surface temperature (SST) variance and site-specific water characteristics along the southeast coast of Andhra Pradesh, India. A total of 234 water samples (139 porewater, 31 groundwater and 64 seawater samples) were evaluated along similar to 450 km southeast coastline of Andhra Pradesh. In situ porewater physio-chemical parameters, i.e. EC, TDS, pH, DO, temperature, and salinity, at every 1 km except non-accessible areas and groundwater for every 5 km were analysed and used for identification of SGD zones in the study area. The hydraulic gradient values vary from - 11 to 250 m in post-monsoon and - 14 to 250 m in pre-monsoon. And sea surface temperature anomaly for 2017, 2018 and 2019 varies between 21-39 degrees C, 15-34 degrees C and 20-39 degrees C. Three districts out of the four districts studied (Krishna, Guntur and Nellore) were shown to be prone to SWI, whereas Prakasam district was susceptible for SGD. For the first time, this kind of preliminary study was carried out in the coastal Andhra Pradesh region, and it will serve as a basis for the meticulous analysis of the fresh and saline water mixing zones/process as well as to develop and manage the groundwater resources along the water-stressed coastal plains of Andhra Pradesh, India.

TI  - Classification of MODIS fire emission data based on aerosol absorption Angstrom exponent retrieved from AERONET data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning emits a large quantity of gaseous pollutants and aerosols into the atmosphere, which perturbs the regional and global climate and has significant impacts on air quality and human health. In order to understand the temporal and spatial distributions of biomass burning and its contribution to aerosol optical and radiative impacts, we examined fire emis-sion data and its contribution to aerosol optical and radiative impacts over six major hot-spot continents/sub-continents across the globe, namely North-Central (NC) Africa, South America, US-Hawaii, South Asia, South East Asia, and Australia-New Zealand, using long-term satellites, ground-based and re-analysis data during 2000-2021. The selected six sites contributed & SIM;70% of total global fire data. The classification of biomass burning, such as pre, active, and post burning phases, was performed based on the Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) estimated from 55 AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) stations. The study found the highest contribution of fire count (55 %) during the active burning phase followed by post (36 %) and pre (8 %) burning phases. Such high fire counts were associated with high absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) during the active fire event. Strong dominance of fine and coarse mode mixed aerosols were also observed during active and post fire regimes. High AAOD and low Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) over NC Africa during the fire events suggested presence of mineral dust mixed with biomass burning aerosols. Brightness temperature, fire radiative power and fire count were also dominated by the active burning followed by post and pre burning phases. The maximum heating rate of 3.15 K day(-1) was observed during the active fire events. The heating rate profile shows clear variations for three different fire regimes with the highest value of 1.80 K day-1 at & SIM;750 hPa altitude during the active fire event.

TI  - Dating springlines from hydrogeological and archaeological evidence
T2  - QUATERNARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between prehistoric populations and water is often poorly understood, partly as a function of historical reliance on qualitative and fragmentary datasets in many regions. Here, we adopt a quantitative approach to analyze a specific aspect of the relationship between prehistoric populations and water for the Cotswold Hills, southwest UK; an area of documented hydrogeological change and extensive Neolithic (ca. 5.5 ka) activity. Using a database of all known Neolithic monuments, we interrogate the significance of water to their habitation. By marshaling a large dataset of recent (ca. 100 years) changes in the discharge and elevation of 259 springs, we establish a striking negative relationship between present-day spring discharge and annual elevation change. We then formulate an inverse problem to predict spring elevations in Neolithic times. Spring elevations are predicted to be closer to, and higher than, Neolithic-dated sites relative to the location of modern springs. These results emphasize a utilitarian and/or reverential link between water and prehistoric populations. Our approach of reconciling markedly different datasets and timescales can easily be adapted to other regions. While groundwater had behaved reasonably predictably since Neolithic times, recent human activity is (and will continue to be) far more significant in influencing groundwater behavior.

TI  - Glacier retreat in Himachal from 1994 to 2021 using deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional glacier identification using satellite data involves making basic band combinations, image processing, and calculations based on the spectral properties of glacier bodies. The results from computer processing of satellite data are sometimes affected by segmentation and thresh-olding techniques, due to which water bodies, rock surfaces, and other features are classified as glaciers. Deep learning (DL) based methods for image classification, object detection, and seg-mentation have proven to be very efficient and accurate in recent years. Deep learning-based sim-ple semantic network U-Net has been utilized in various disciplines for image processing and effi-cient image segmentation. This paper emphasizes the application of this simple semantic segmen-tation network, i.e., U-net, for glacier identification using Indian Remote sensing (IRS) and Land-sat satellite data with some improvement in segmentation and glacier identification. The glaciers in the Himachal Pradesh province of India, located in the Western Indian Himalayas are identi-fied, segmented, and mapped using the U-net. The glaciers for the past three decades, i.e. from 1994 to 2021 mapped in the study area to assess the impact of climate change on glacial retreat. The suggested technique can automate the entire glacial mapping process, has a greater identifi-cation accuracy of 95 percent, and is less time-consuming. The glaciated area in Himachal Pradesh decreased at a rate of 67.84 km2 per annum from 4020.6 km2 in 1994-2198.5 km2 in 2021. It is observed that from 1994 to 2021, the glacier area decreased approximately by a per-centage loss of 1.678 per annum, with decreasing decadal trend from 2.31% in 1994-2001 to 1.398 in 2011-2021.

TI  - Variability of the thermal front and its relationship with Chlorophyll-a in the north Bay of Bengal br
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variability of the thermal fronts and their relationship with chlorophyll-a in the north Bay of Bengal (BOB) was studied using time series of MODIS daily Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and weekly chlorophyll-a concentration to investigate the locations of intense fish catch activities in the continental shelf and slope as inferred from NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime boat detection products. An edge-detection algorithm operated on each SST image to identify thermal fronts in which a gradient of 0.3 degrees C/pixel (similar to 0.075 degrees C/km) was chosen following the sensitivity analysis. These thermal fronts at the daily scale were aggregated weekly to estimate the thermal front density. A least square-based harmonic analysis procedure was adopted to estimate mean climatology and seasonal harmonics of thermal front density and chlorophyll-a data sets. It shows persistent and coherent spatial features between the datasets in their climatology and seasonal cycles. They exhibit distinct locations of maxima co-occurring between the 10 and 50 m isobaths in the continental shelf and slope region coincided with the areas of the VIIRS mapped fishing vessels cluster sites. The annual frequency dominates the seasonal cycles of TFD with a positive phase during November-March (winter and spring seasons) and peaks in January. Mean (residual) circulation, as simulated from a regional ocean model, shows coherent spatial features congruent to the persistent thermal fronts and steered by the bathymetry. These locations with a high probability of thermal fronts and high concentrations of Chlorophyll-a can be considered as the perennial potential fishing zone, with the winter season being a more favorable period for fishing.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - SiDroForest: a comprehensive forest inventory of Siberian boreal forest investigations including drone-based point clouds, individually labeled trees, synthetically generated tree crowns, and Sentinel-2 labeled image patches
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The SiDroForest (Siberian drone-mapped forest inventory) data collection is an attempt to remedy the scarcity of forest structure data in the circumboreal region by providing adjusted and labeled tree-level and vegetation plot-level data for machine learning and upscaling purposes. We present datasets of vegetation composition and tree and plot level forest structure for two important vegetation transition zones in Siberia, Russia; the summergreen-evergreen transition zone in Central Yakutia and the tundra-taiga transition zone in Chukotka (NE Siberia). The SiDroForest data collection consists of four datasets that contain different complementary data types that together support in-depth analyses from different perspectives of Siberian Forest plot data for multi-purpose applications. i. Dataset 1 provides unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne data products covering the vegetation plots surveyed during fieldwork (Kruse et al., 2021, ). The dataset includes structure-from-motion (SfM) point clouds and red-green-blue (RGB) and red-green-near-infrared (RGN) orthomosaics. From the orthomosaics, point-cloud products were created such as the digital elevation model (DEM), canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM) and the digital terrain model (DTM). The point-cloud products provide information on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the forest at each plot. Dataset 2 contains spatial data in the form of point and polygon shapefiles of 872 individually labeled trees and shrubs that were recorded during fieldwork at the same vegetation plots (van Geffen et al., 2021c, ). The dataset contains information on tree height, crown diameter, and species type. These tree and shrub individually labeled point and polygon shapefiles were generated on top of the RGB UVA orthoimages. The individual tree information collected during the expedition such as tree height, crown diameter, and vitality are provided in table format. This dataset can be used to link individual information on trees to the location of the specific tree in the SfM point clouds, providing for example, opportunity to validate the extracted tree height from the first dataset. The dataset provides unique insights into the current state of individual trees and shrubs and allows for monitoring the effects of climate change on these individuals in the future. Dataset 3 contains a synthesis of 10 000 generated images and masks that have the tree crowns of two species of larch ( and ) automatically extracted from the RGB UAV images in the common objects in context (COCO) format (van Geffen et al., 2021a, ). As machine-learning algorithms need a large dataset to train on, the synthetic dataset was specifically created to be used for machine-learning algorithms to detect Siberian larch species. Larix gmeliniiLarix cajanderiDataset 4 contains Sentinel-2 (S-2) Level-2 bottom-of-atmosphere processed labeled image patches with seasonal information and annotated vegetation categories covering the vegetation plots (van Geffen et al., 2021b, ). The dataset is created with the aim of providing a small ready-to-use validation and training dataset to be used in various vegetation-related machine-learning tasks. It enhances the data collection as it allows classification of a larger area with the provided vegetation classes. The SiDroForest data collection serves a variety of user communities.The detailed vegetation cover and structure information in the first two datasets are of use for ecological applications, on one hand for summergreen and evergreen needle-leaf forests and also for tundra-taiga ecotones. Datasets 1 and 2 further support the generation and validation of land cover remote-sensing products in radar and optical remote sensing. In addition to providing information on forest structure and vegetation composition of the vegetation plots, the third and fourth datasets are prepared as training and validation data for machine-learning purposes. For example, the synthetic tree-crown dataset is generated from the raw UAV images and optimized to be used in neural networks. Furthermore, the fourth SiDroForest dataset contains S-2 labeled image patches processed to a high standard that provide training data on vegetation class categories for machine-learning classification with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) labels provided. The SiDroForest data collection adds unique insights into remote hard-to-reach circumboreal forest regions.

TI  - InSAR time-series deformation forecasting surrounding Salt Lake using deep transformer models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The free and open data policy of Sentinel-1 SAR images enables Radar interferometry (InSAR) to perform time series surface deformation monitoring over large areas. InSAR deformation monitoring and prediction can investigate the freeze-thaw cycles of permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, the convolutional and recurrent neural net-works cannot accurately model long-term and complex relations in multivariate time series data, it is challenging to implement time series deformation prediction with high spatial resolution. In this paper, an innovative InSAR defor-mation prediction integrated algorithm based on the transformer models is proposed to predict time series deforma-tion more accurately surrounding Salt Lake. Compared with the other solutions, the unique feature of the proposed method is that: 1) this method takes advantage of the self-attention mechanism to study complicated dynamic defor-mation features of permafrost caused by temperature and other variables from InSAR time series deformation. 2) The transformer-based model can more accurately simulate seasonal and non-seasonal deformation signals, and is effective for short-term prediction of surface deformation in permafrost areas. The InSAR deformation prediction results dem-onstrate that the InSAR deformation prediction method achieves better prediction performance in predicting the de-formation trends of permafrost with a point scale compared with the prediction results of other models. Based on the predicted deformation and the water extraction results, the expansion trends surrounding Salt Lake are discussed and evaluated. The total area of Salt Lake increased by 57.32 km2 during the period 2015-2019. And Salt Lake maintained slowing expansion trend from 2019 to 2022. The time series deformation forecasting method can be used as a generic framework for modeling nonlinear deformation processes in complex permafrost areas, and it reveals the potential impact of the Salt Lake outburst event on the deformation processes and the degradation of permafrost.

TI  - Retrieval of ice water path from the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) aboard FengYun-3B (FY-3B) satellite polarimetric measurements based on a deep neural network
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice water path (IWP) is an important cloud parameter in atmospheric radiation, and there are still great difficulties in its retrieval. Artificial neural networks have become a popular method in atmospheric remote sensing in recent years. This study presents a global IWP retrieval based on deep neural networks using the measurements from the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) aboard the FengYun-3B (FY-3B) satellite. Since FY-3B/MWHS has quasi-polarization channels at 150 GHz, the effect of the polarimetric radiance difference (PD) was also studied. A retrieval database was established using collocations between MWHS and CloudSat 2C-ICE (CloudSat and CALIPSO Ice Cloud Property Product). Then, two types of networks were trained for cloud scene filtering and IWP retrieval. For the cloud filtering network, the microwave channels show a capacity with a false alarm ratio (FAR) of 0.31 and a probability of detection (POD) of 0.61. For the IWP retrieval network, different combination inputs of auxiliaries and channels were compared. The results show that the five MWHS channels combined with scan angle, latitude, and the ocean/land mask of inputs of auxiliary variables perform best. Applying the cloud filtering network and IWP retrieval network, the final root mean squared error (RMSE) is 916.76 g m-2, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 92 %, and the correlation coefficient (CC) is 0.65. Then, a tropical cyclone case measured simultaneously by MWHS and CloudSat was chosen to test the performance of the networks, and the result shows a good correlation (0.73) with 2C-ICE. Finally, the global annual mean IWP of MWHS is very close to that of 2C-ICE, and the 150 GHz channels give a significant improvement in the midlatitudes compared to using only 183 GHz channels.

Statistically significant differences in this outcome (i.e., self-reported subsequent injury but no ACC claim) were found between Maori and non-Maori when comparing across occupation type and severity of participants' sentinel injuries. Few differences were observed between Maori and non-Maori in the percentages of ACC claims accepted that compensated various treatments and supports; this was similar for average compensation amounts provided.CONCLUSIONS: Maori and non-Maori who received support from ACC for a sentinel injury prior to sustaining another injury appear to have received equitable ACC compensation for the treatment and rehabilitation of the subsequent injury with two potential exceptions. Further research is needed to determine how generalisable these findings are. Establishing routine systems for collecting data about the support needed, treatment pathways and outcomes once accessing ACC support is vital to ensure positive and equitable injury outcomes for Maori.

TI  - Multisource data-based integrated drought monitoring index: Model development and application
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we proposed a new integrated remote sensing drought monitoring indices, i.e. Multiple Remote Sensing Drought Index integrated by Principal Component Analysis (PSDI), Multiple Remote Sensing Drought Index integrated by multiple linear regression (MRSDI) and Multiple Remote Sensing drought index integrated by gradient boosting method (GBMDI), based on the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI). The monitoring performance of PSDI, MRSDI and GBMDI was compared and verified based on the real-world observed droughts during 2002 to 2016. We also evidenced drought monitoring performance of the PSDI MRSDI and GBMDI by comparison between PSDI, MRSDI, GBMDI and SPEI, SPI and PDSI based on the in situ observed meteorological data. We found that the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts monitored by the PSDI, MRSDI and GBMDI were generally in good agreement with those by the SPI and SPEI. The GBMDI performs better than PSDI and MRSDI in describing drought processes and spatial patterns of droughts of different drought intensities. Com-parison between the real-world observed drought-affected croplands and those monitored by PSDI, MRSDI and GBMDI indicated better drought monitoring performance of GBMDI than PSDI and MRSDI in monitoring droughts across widespread drought-affected regions. Besides, the trend of GBMDI is in good agreement with standardized crop yield. Therefore GBMDI should be the first choice in drought monitoring practice. The GBMDI developed in this study can help to provide an alternative drought monitoring index for large-scale drought monitoring across China and also in other regions of the globe.

TI  - Evaluation of models for prediction of diffuse solar radiation and comparison with satellite values
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The diffuse radiation data are one of the important parameters required in solar energy projects. However, this parameter has not been measured in everywhere of Turkey. In the present study, models in the open literature for the determination of horizontal diffuse radiation with clearness index are investigated and, new models are developed for thirteen provinces over the Eastern Anatolia Region (EAR) of Turkey where the diffuse radiation values are not existing. In the monthly average, these models have a relation between the diffuse coefficient (H-d/H-o) and the diffuse fraction (H-d/H) with the daily clearness index. The most appropriate models based on NASA Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (NASA-SSE) values are determined. For this, the diffuse radiation data taken from the NASA-SSE and calculated from the models are compared for the locations mentioned in the study. The validation of the correlations obtained to predict the diffuse radiation over the EAR for which experimental data are not available is firstly tested by using the NASA-SSE satellite data. The performances of the models are indicated with the statistical test methods as mean absolute bias error (MABE), root mean square error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE), and mean relative error (MRE). The results indicate that some models are reasonably well to forecast the diffuse radiation. In addition, the diffuse radiation predictions of the new correlations obtained in the study are compared with satellite data. When the diffuse radiation values taken from the NASA-SSE and calculated from the models are compared, it is seen that the Model 4 for Agri, Bingol, Bitlis, Elazi.g, Erzincan, Hakkari, Igdir, Kars, and Mus, Model 14 for Erzurum, Model 20 for Malatya and Tunceli, and Model 11 for Van indicate the best performance. According to the RMSE values of twenty models in the literature and the NASASSE, the best result among all provinces is obtained from the Model 11 with 0.2385 MJ m(-2) day(-1) for Van.

TI  - Comparative analysis of spectral indexes for soil salinity mapping in irrigated areas in a semi-arid region, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization reduces agricultural yield and sustainable development in the long term. In this study, we identified the spectral index that best estimates soil salinity in the area of the Baixo-Acu irrigated perimeter in northeast Brazil. We also established how vegetation canopy and satellite image spatial resolution influence the results. The electrical conductivity of 42 sampling points was determined and correlated with 20 spectral salinity indexes. The spatial resolution influence on index response was evaluated using OLI/Landsat8 and MSI/Sentinel2 satellite images, with spatial resolutions of 30 and 10 m, respectively. They were applied to bare soil and vegetation canopy areas to assess the vegetation canopy influence on the indexes. Normalized Differential Vegetation Index greater than 0.33 indicated soils with vegetation canopy. In all analyses performed, the bare soil areas had the best results. From the 18 analyzed indexes, Sentinel2 images outperform Landsat8 images. The Soil Index-1 showed an 80.34%-determination coefficient that outperformed the other 19 indexes in soil salinity identification. These results indicate that the association of the Soil Index-1, Sentinel2 images, and the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index less than 0.33 improves the evaluation of the salinized areas.

TI  - Dissolved oxygen estimation in aquaculture sites using remote sensing and machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the most critical parameters for aquaculture, as it is vital for all living organisms. The survival, growth and food intake of fish is directly affected by changes in DO concentration. Therefore, the systematic and continuous monitoring of DO is of crucial im-portance for proper production management. DO does not change the optical properties of water, so it is impossible to estimate its concentration directly from the reflection values of satellite sen-sors. However, several studies have suggested that it can be estimated indirectly, based on its cor-relation with other parameters such as chlorophyl-a (chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST). The present study aims to integrate satellite data, along with in-situ observations to bring forth in-novative approaches on how DO can be estimated and monitored on large scale near aquaculture facilities. In this context we exploited daily CMEMS data (chl-a and SST) along with in-situ data (DO) to train a support vector regression (SVR) model. Our in-situ dataset included daily DO mea-sures from Agrilia fish farm in Lesvos for the year 2021. The accuracy of our model was tested us-ing the value of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our prelimi-nary results indicate that our model performs well locally with promising scalability, which paves the way for the development of real-time monitoring systems for aquaculture.

TI  - Monitoring spatiotemporal evolution of Kaiyang landslides induced by phosphate mining using distributed scatterers InSAR technique
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Kaiyang landslides in southwest China have brought heavy damages to lives and properties due to years of underground phosphate mining. However, affected by karst geomorphology including dense vegetation, complex topography, few in situ measurements were conducted to investigate the potentially unstable slopes and derive the kinematic process. In this study, 19 L-band ALOS/PALSAR-2 images are selected, and both phase-stacking and distributed scatterers (DS) InSAR methods are employed to identify the unstable slopes and to derive the spatiotemporal evolution of Kaiyang landslides. At first, we calculate the annual deformation rate and investigate the unstable slopes in a wide range of Kaiyang County through the phase-stacking method. Then, the typical landslides suffering apparent deformation are taken as the region of interest (ROI), and the effects of spatial and temporal decorrelation are suppressed by the process of phase enhancement and point-target optimization. The influence of trigger factors on the Kaiyang landslides is assessed subsequently by the logistic model and precipitation data. Finally, the previous and current failure processes of Kaiyang landslides are analyzed according to the deformation process. The results reveal that the continuous underground phosphate mining leads to the ongoing expansion of the Kaiyang landslides. It can not only reactivate the previous landslide, but also accelerate the deformation of the slope under the action of strong precipitation. Furthermore, the technical route presented in this research can provide valuable guidance for the monitoring and mitigation of mining-induced landslides in the karst mountain areas.

TI  - Impacts of urban sprawl in the Administrative Region of Ribeira∼o Preto (Brazil) and measures to restore improved landscapes
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study addressed the problem of urban expansion in a large metropolis of Brazil (ARRP - Adminis-trative Region of Ribeira similar to o Preto), relating the evolution of urbanization in the past 35 years with losses of agricultural area and respective equivalent production and economic effects. Besides these food security and agribusiness issues, the study tracked important environmental consequences of the observed growing urbani-zation. This included water insecurity related with the occupation of watercourse networks, destruction of ri-parian vegetation that is legally protected as Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs), and the occupation of Guarani Aquifer recharge areas with impermeable surfaces. The database consisted of Landsat images interpreted and processed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The results indicate losses of rural area exceeding 350 km2 in the studied timeframe, with equivalent production and economic losses around 1.1 Mton/year and 230 MR$/year, on average. It is worth to mention the 40-75% overlap between the impermeable surfaces of some ARRP municipalities (e.g., Cajuru, Altin ' opolis) and recharge areas of Guarani Aquifer. The impermeable surfaces within the ARRP also affected approximately 7000 headwaters that were potential hotspots of shallow aquifer recharge. The urban sprawl destroyed more than 9100 km of natural watercourses and nearly 630 km2 of PPAs. The pathways recognized to improve the ARRP landscape included implementation of urban agriculture and landscape planning measures capable to protect the recharge to and the quality of Guarani Aquifer water, mostly anchored in the Municipal Director Plans, the prominent land use policy tools in the ARRP. This integrated, long-term, spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of urban sprawl impacts assembled with indications of landscape restoration policies and measures is novel in Brazil. On the other hand, studying the ARRP is worthwhile because of its historical relationship with the Brazilian ethanol program that brought an accelerated development to the region following the World oil crisis of 1970 s until now.

TI  - Organotypic sinonasal airway culture systems are predictive of the mucociliary phenotype produced by bronchial airway epithelial cells
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Differentiated air-liquid interface models are the current standard to assess the mucociliary phenotype using clinically-derived samples in a controlled environment. However, obtaining basal progenitor airway epithelial cells (AEC) from the lungs is invasive and resource-intensive. Hence, we applied a tissue engineering approach to generate organotypic sinonasal AEC (nAEC) epithelia to determine whether they are predictive of bronchial AEC (bAEC) models. Basal progenitor AEC were isolated from healthy participants using a cytological brushing method and differentiated into epithelia on transwells until the mucociliary phenotype was observed. Tissue architecture was assessed using H&E and alcian blue/Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining, immunofluorescence (for cilia via acetylated alpha-tubulin labelling) and scanning electron microscopy. Differentiation and the formation of tight-junctions were monitored over the culture period (day 1-32) by quantifying trans-epithelial electrical resistance. End point (day 32) tight junction protein expression was assessed using Western blot analysis of ZO-1, Occludin-1 and Claudin-1. Reverse transcription qPCR-array was used to assess immunomodulatory and autophagy-specific transcript profiles. All outcome measures were assessed using R-statistical software. Mucociliary architecture was comparable for nAEC and bAEC-derived cultures, e.g. cell density P = 0.55, epithelial height P = 0.88 and cilia abundance P = 0.41. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance measures were distinct from day 1-14, converged over days 16-32, and were statistically similar over the entire culture period (global P < 0.001). This agreed with end-point (day 32) measures of tight junction protein abundance which were non-significant for each analyte (P > 0.05). Transcript analysis for inflammatory markers demonstrated significant variation between nAEC and bAEC epithelial cultures, and favoured increased abundance in the nAEC model (e.g. TGF beta and IL-1 beta; P < 0.05). Conversely, the abundance of autophagy-related transcripts were comparable and the range of outcome measures for either model exhibited a considerably more confined uncertainty distribution than those observed for the inflammatory markers. Organotypic air-liquid interface models of nAEC are predictive of outcomes related to barrier function, mucociliary architecture and autophagy gene activity in corresponding bAEC models. However, inflammatory markers exhibited wide variation which may be explained by the sentinel immunological surveillance role of the sinonasal epithelium.

TI  - Criteria for selecting sentinel unit locations in a surveillance system for vector-borne disease: A decision tool
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives With vector-borne diseases emerging across the globe, precipitated by climate change and other anthropogenic changes, it is critical for public health authorities to have well-designed surveillance strategies in place. Sentinel surveillance has been proposed as a cost-effective approach to surveillance in this context. However, spatial design of sentinel surveillance system has important impacts on surveillance outcomes, and careful selection of sentinel unit locations is therefore an essential component of planning. Methods A review of the available literature, based on the realist approach, was used to identify key decision issues for sentinel surveillance planning. Outcomes of the review were used to develop a decision tool, which was subsequently validated by experts in the field. Results The resulting decision tool provides a list of criteria which can be used to select sentinel unit locations. We illustrate its application using the case example of designing a national sentinel surveillance system for Lyme disease in Canada. Conclusions The decision tool provides researchers and public health authorities with a systematic, evidence-based approach for planning the spatial design of sentinel surveillance systems, taking into account the aims of the surveillance system and disease and/or context-specific considerations.

TI  - Understanding seasonal contributions of urban morphology to thermal environment based on boosted regression tree approach
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban morphology significantly affects the urban thermal environment. Seasonal impacts of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) urban morphology on land surface temperature (LST) remain uncertain, and the impacts exist scale effects. Thus, taking Beijing as the study area, boosted regression tree (BRT) model was used to investigate the seasonal contributions of urban morphology to the thermal environment. Building density (BD), building height (BH), floor area ratio (FAR), sky view factor (SVF), and frontal area index (FAI), were used to comprehensively characterize urban morphology, and 13 scales ranging from 30 m to 600 m were used to investigate scale effects. The results showed that there are obvious spatial differences in LST and urban morphology indicators in the study area. 270 m was determined as the optimal scale for modeling in the study area. BH and BD are the domain indicators, which together contribute more than 75% of the variance of LST among four seasons, while the relative influences of SVF, FAR, and FAI are relatively low. Relationships between urban morphology indicators and LST are nonlinear among four seasons. The findings provide a scientific un-derstanding for urban planners on mitigating the UHI effects through optimizing buildings.

TI  - Spatial-temporal interpolation of satellite geomagnetic data to study long-distance animal migration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - :Introduction: Increased access to remote sensing datasets presents opportunities to model an animal's in-situ experience of the landscape to study behavior and test hypotheses such as geomagnetic map navigation. Mag-Geo is an open-source tool that combines high spatiotemporal resolution geomagnetic data with animal tracking data. Unlike gridded remote sensing data, satellite geomagnetic data are point-based measurements of the magnetic field at the location of each satellite. MagGeo converts these measurements into geomagnetic values at an animal's location and time. The objective of this paper is to evaluate different interpolation methods and data frameworks within the MagGeo software and quantify how accurately MagGeo can model geomagnetic values and patterns as experienced by animals. Method: We tested MagGeo outputs against data from 109 terrestrial geomagnetic observatories across 7 years. Unlike satellite data, ground-based data are more likely to represent how animals near the Earth's surface experience geomagnetic field dynamics. Within the MagGeo framework, we compared an inverse-distance weighting interpolation with three different nearest-neighbour interpolation methods. We also compared model geomagnetic data with combined model and satellite data in their ability to capture geomagnetic fluc-tuations. Finally, we fit a linear mixed-effect model to understand how error is influenced by factors like geomagnetic activity and distance in space and time between satellite and point of interest.Results and conclusions: The overall absolute difference between MagGeo outputs and observatory values was <1% of the total possible range of values for geomagnetic components. Satellite data measurements closest in time to the point of interest consistently had lowest error which likely reflects the ability of the nearest neighbour in time interpolation method to capture small continuous daily fluctuations and larger discrete events like geomagnetic storms. Combined model and satellite data also capture geomagnetic fluctuations better than model data alone across most geomagnetic activity levels. Our linear mixed-effect models suggest that most of the variation in error can be explained by location-specific effects originating largely from local crustal biases, and that high geomagnetic activity usually predicts higher error though ultimately remaining within the 1% error range. Our results indicate that MagGeo can help researchers explore how animals may use the geomagnetic field to navigate long distances by providing access to data and methods that accurately model how animals moving near the Earth's surface experience the geomagnetic field.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigates the land use and land cover (LULC) in Errachidia province (Pre-Saharan of Morocco) in the period 2005-2020. To this end, remote sensing (RS) tools such as LULC, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, and precipitations were processed and combined. The monitoring of LULC over this period reveals different changes in this area. Generally, for water bodies, two trends can be observed, an increasing trend since 2006 and a decreasing trend from 2011 to the present. However, an increasing trend was recorded for the urban-and-built-up-lands and the grasslands categories. NDVI, NDWI, and EVI showed three major peaks recorded in the same periods (in 2007, 2009, and 2015). In terms of water storage, three phases were found. The first depicted the lowest groundwater quantities with a decreasing trend, which corresponds to a period of drought and/or human pressure. The second phase, the most important that recorded the greatest storage of water while the third phase corresponds to low storage with a decreasing trend. LULC of croplands reveals a slightly increasing trend from 2012 to 2020, which shows an orientation to an extension of crops mainly of date palm encouraged by government programs. A strong correlation between the seasonal NDVI and water storage using GRACE-Data for the period was found. In the end, recommendations on the adaptation to CC were proposed. The findings demonstrate that RS techniques are useful tools to detect hydrological droughts, observe, and conserve land resources. In arid areas such as Errachidia, the solution lies in rationalizing the use of water resources protecting them from uncontrolled anthropogenic events, which may alleviate the pressure. To support local sustainable development, environmental scientists and decision-makers may use the outputs of this study.

TI  - Sensing whales, storms, ships and earthquakes using an Arctic fibre optic cable
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our oceans are critical to the health of our planet and its inhabitants. Increasing pressures on our marine environment are triggering an urgent need for continuous and comprehensive monitoring of the oceans and stressors, including anthropogenic activity. Current ocean observational systems are expensive and have limited temporal and spatial coverage. However, there exists a dense network of fibre-optic (FO) telecommunication cables, covering both deep ocean and coastal areas around the globe. FO cables have an untapped potential for advanced acoustic sensing that, with recent technological break-throughs, can now fill many gaps in quantitative ocean monitoring. Here we show for the first time that an advanced distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) interrogator can be used to capture a broad range of acoustic phenomena with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratios and distances. We have detected, tracked, and identified whales, storms, ships, and earthquakes. We live-streamed 250 TB of DAS data from Svalbard to mid-Norway via Uninett's research network over 44 days; a first step towards real-time processing and distribution. Our findings demonstrate the potential for a global Earth-Ocean-Atmosphere-Space DAS monitoring network with multiple applications, e.g. marine mammal forecasting combined with ship tracking, to avoid ship strikes. By including automated processing and fusion with other remote-sensing data (automated identification systems, satellites, etc.), a low-cost ubiquitous real-time monitoring network with vastly improved coverage and resolution is within reach. We anticipate that this is a game-changer in establishing a global observatory for Ocean-Earth sciences that will mitigate current spatial sampling gaps. Our pilot test confirms the viability of this 'cloud-observatory' concept.

TI  - Forest foliage fuel load estimation from multi-sensor spatiotemporal features
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Foliage fuel is the most flammable component in crown fires. Spatiotemporal dynamics of foliage fuel load (FFL) are important for fire managers to assess fire risk. Here, we integrated optical data from the Landsat 8 Opera-tional Land Imager (OLI) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 to estimate FFL. We first reconstructed seamless time series from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 imagery by accounting for unequal time intervals between image observations and outliers. We then extracted temporal features that are proxies of the intra-and inter-annual dynamics from these time series. In addition, we derived spatial features from the imagery that quantify spatial context and therefore used varying window sizes. The random forest regression was implemented to assess the importance of the spatiotemporal features, reduce errors, and derive robust FFL es-timates. The satellite estimates were validated against 96 field measurements from Pinus yunnanensis forests in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China. Both the spatiotemporal features of SAR and optical data importantly contributed to FFL estimation. When only optical data was used, the model achieved a R2 of 0.75 (relative Root Mean Squared Error (rRMSE) = 25.3 %), while when only SAR data was used the R2 was 0.76 (rRMSE = 25.6 %). However, when optical and SAR data were combined, the R2 increased to 0.81 (rRMSE = 23.2 %). We also found that temporal features were more important predictors of FFL than features that captured spatial context. We demonstrated our FFL mapping method by a case study in the Chinese Sichuan Province, in relation to the occurrence of a fire. Our method needs additional validation over different tree species and forest types, yet has potential for mapping forest fuel loads and fire risk.

TI  - Drought history and vegetation response in the Angolan Highlands
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought negatively impacts health systems, agriculture, economies, energy, and the natural environment. The vulnerability of the Angolan Highlands rural communities that are dependent on rain-fed agriculture is a concern due to the prospect of climate change and the trajectory of increasing frequency of droughts in the region. The Angolan Highlands is an essential source water region for the Okavango Delta, and southern Africa more broadly. This study integrates Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) and vegetation indices from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the first historical assessment of drought in the Angolan Highlands. Using the standardized precipitation index (SPI), eight distinct drought periods were identified: 1981-1982, 1989-1990, 1994, 1995-1997, 1999-2000, 2014-2016, 2017-2018, and 2018-2020, with the frequency of drought increasing since 1981. The relationship between drought occurrence and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is not linear; with two of the eight drought periods occurred exclusively during El Nino years. The seasonality of precipitation, MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are similar, with NDVI and EVI being lowest at the end of the dry winter months (August), and highest during the summer rainfall season. The strong relationship between precipitation and vegetation, anthropogenic pressure on the landscape, and increased drought occurrence are likely to lead to potential environmental degradation in future. Mitigation and adaptation strategies to drought may be required, especially concerning water resources and agricultural practices within the Angolan Highlands region.

TI  - Genotypic characterization of Japanese encephalitis virus circulating in swine population of India: Genotype-III still in dominance
T2  - VIRUS GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - Swine is considered as a suitable sentinel to predict Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) outbreaks in humans. The present study was undertaken to determine the circulating genotypes of JEV in swine population of India. A total of 702 swine serum samples from four states of western, northern, northern-temperate, and north-eastern zones of India were screened by real-time RT-PCR targeting envelope gene of JEV, which showed positivity of 35.33%. The viral copy number ranged from 3 copies to 6.3 x 10(4) copies/reaction. Subsequently, the capsid/prM structural gene region of JEV positive samples was amplified by nested RT-PCR, sequenced, and genetically characterized. The phylogenetic analysis of the partial sequences of the capsid gene of 42 JEV positive samples showed that they all belonged to genotype-III (G-III) of JEV. Notably, JEV positive swine samples showed high nucleotide identity with human isolates from China and Nepal which explains the probable spillover of infection between neighboring countries probably by migratory birds. The novel mutations were observed in JEV positive sample B8 at C54 position (Phe -> Ser), and JEV positive sample K50 at C62 (Thr -> Ala) and C65 (Leu -> Pro) positions which were absent from other JEV isolates reported till now. The mutation at the C66 position (Leu -> Ser) observed in live attenuated vaccine SA14-14-2 strain was not found in JEV positive samples of our study. The detection of the G-III JE virus from climatically diverse states of India reinforces the need to continue the ongoing human vaccination program in India by extending vaccine coverage in temperate states.

TI  - Spatial variability of soil properties, nitrogen balance and nitrate leaching using digital methods on heterogeneous arable fields in southern Germany
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatial variability of nitrogen (N) balances and potential nitrate leaching were determined in heterogeneous arable fields in southern Germany using digital methods (tractor-mounted multispectral sensor, satellite data, vegetation indices and models) and measurements of nitrate stocks in deeper zones (1-2.5 m soil depth) with deep drilling. The aim of this study was to achieve precise localisation of N losses at high spatial resolution (sub field level; 10 x 10 m grid). The spatial variability of plant parameters within uniformly fertilised fields (crop yield, N uptake) was determined for the calculation of the N balances. The spatial variability of soil properties (e.g. soil organic carbon content, soil total nitrogen content) were determined to identify the causes of high or low N surpluses and nitrate leaching in sub-fields. N surplus determined using different digital methods and measured nitrate stocks showed similar spatial patterns. Site-specific N balancing identified zones with high N loss potential (N surplus up to 86 kg ha(-1)). Deep drilling showed zones with high nitrate loss (nitrate N up to 94 kg ha(-1)). N surplus and nitrate loss correlated with r = 0.49. This relationship could be impacted by many other soil and management factors. Soil properties showed considerable spatial variation within the fields. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (TN) content were closely correlated in all fields (up to r = 0.96) and were most closely positively correlated with crop yield and N uptake (up to r = 0.74) and negatively correlated with N surplus (up to r = - 0.73). The sensor data and satellite data (crop yield, N uptake, N surplus) showed similar distribution patterns. Based on these results, digital technologies are suitable for the calculation of site-specific N surplus and estimation of nitrate leaching risk. Satellite or sensor based site-specific and yield-oriented fertilization is one approach to reduce N surplus on sub fields with low yield potential and high nitrate leaching risk.

TI  - Land cover classification using Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data and open source Eo-Learn library
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Depending on the development of remote sensing technologies, data at various spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions are obtained and play a key role in Earth investigation. Land cover/use maps are also created using these data. These data play an important role as a base for determining land cover and land use classes, detecting changes, monitoring forest, agriculture and wetlands, as well as updating the LPIS data used by countries. As well as being reference data in the LPIS update, current land cover and land use classification results with satellite images also provide statistical information about which class has changed over the years and how much the class or classes need to be updated, and will also provide the planning of the update to be made on a national scale. In this study, land cover classification for 2020 covering civril-Baklan Plain, which is between the borders of Denizli Province (Turkey), Baklan, cal and civril Districts, was performed. The LPIS classes of the study area drawn in 2015 and the land cover classes as a result of the 2020 classification were compared as a result of the classification process, and particularly the areas with change were referenced in the LPIS update. In the classification process, the open source Eo-Learn library, which uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms in remote sensing studies and Sentinel-2 images that can be accessed directly in this library were used. The open source Eo-Learn library has been preferred because it provides great convenience to users in the classification process with ready-made machine learning models and easy access to satellite images, image processing steps (cloud masking, calculate index, feature extraction, temporal interpolation) are carried out in a certain workflow. Instead of land cover classification from a single image, 17 different time (multi-temporal) images between 01.02.2020 and 31.11.2020 were used. In the classification process, 12 different features were used for the image taken on each date, including NDVI, NDWI, NDBI indices and Tasseled Cap transformations, as well as (Blue) B02, (Green) B03, (Red) B04, (NIR) B08, (SWIR-1) B11, (SWIR-2) B12 bands. In the classification process, the Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) algorithm in the Eo-Learn library and the physical blocks produced within the scope of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) project were used as ground truth data; arable land, bare land, forest, artificial surface, shrubland, tree crops and water classes were created. The classification results were evaluated using the K fold (k = 5) cross validation method, with F1 score, recall, and precision values calculated for each class, and the overall accuracy %92.2. When the classification result is compared with the LPIS data, it is seen that the arable land, shrub land, and water classes have changed. This study determined that these classes, in particular, need to be updated.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variations of Satellite-Based Aerosol Optical Depths, Angstrom Exponent, Single Scattering Albedo, and Ultraviolet-Aerosol Index over Five Polluted and Less-Polluted Cities of Northern India: Impact of Urbanization and Climate Change
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely acknowledged that factors such as population growth, urbanization's quick speed, economic growth, and industrialization all have a role in the atmosphere's rising aerosol concentration. In the current work, we assessed and discussed the findings of a thorough analysis of the temporal and spatial variations of satellite-based aerosol optical parameters such as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), and Ultraviolet-Aerosol Index (UV-AI), and their concentration have been investigated in this study over five polluted and less-polluted cities of northern India during the last decade 2011-2020. The temporal variation of aerosol optical parameters for AOD ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 with decadal mean 0.86 +/- 0.36 for Patna region shows high value with a decadal increasing trend over the study area due to rise in aerosols combustion of fossil fuels, huge vehicles traffic, and biomass over the past ten years. The temporal variation of AE ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 with decadal mean 1.72 +/- 0.11 for Agra region shows high value as compared to other study areas, which indicates a comparatively higher level of fine-mode aerosols at Agra. The temporal variation of SSA ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 with decadal mean 0.92 +/- 0.02 for SSA shows no discernible decadal pattern at any of the locations. The temporal variation of UV-AI ranging from -1.01 to 2.36 with decadal mean 0.59 +/- 0.06 for UV-AI demonstrates a rising tendency, with a noticeable rise in Ludhiana, which suggests relative dominance of absorbing dust aerosols over Ludhiana. Further, to understand the impact of emerging activities, analyses were done in seasonality. For this aerosol climatology was derived for different seasons, i.e., Winter, Pre-Monsoon, Monsoon, and Post-Monsoon. High aerosol was observed in Winter for the study areas Patna, Delhi, and Agra which indicated the particles major dominance of burning aerosol from biomass; and the worst in Monsoon and Post-Monsoon for the Tehri Garhwal and Ludhiana study areas which indicated most of the aerosol concentration is removed by rainfall. After that, we analyzed the correlation among all the parameters to better understand the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of aerosols over the selected region. The value of r for AOD (550 nm) for regions 2 and 1(0.80) shows a strong positive correlation and moderately positive for the regions 3 and 1 (0.64), mostly as a result of mineral dust carried from arid western regions. The value of r for AE (412/470 nm) for region 3 and (0.40) shows a moderately positive correlation, which is the resultant of the dominance of fine-mode aerosol and negative for the regions 5 and 1 (- 0.06). The value of r for SSA (500 nm) for regions 2 and 1 (0.63) shows a moderately positive correlation, which explains the rise in big aerosol particles, which scatters sun energy more efficiently, and the value of r for UV-AI for regions 1 and 2 shows a strong positive correlation (0.77) and moderately positive for the regions 3 and 1 (0.46) which indicates the absorbing aerosols present over the study region.

TI  - On the value of satellite remote sensing to reduce uncertainties of regional simulations of the Colorado River
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As the major water resource in the southwestern United States, the Colorado River is experiencing decreases in naturalized streamflow and is predicted to face severe challenges under future climate scenarios. To better quantify these hydroclimatic changes, it is crucial that the scientific community establishes a reasonably accurate understanding of the spatial patterns associated with the basin hydrologic response. In this study, we employed remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and snow cover fraction (SCF) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to assess a regional hydrological model applied over the Colorado River Basin between 2003 and 2018. Based on the comparison between simulated and observed LST and SCF spatiotemporal patterns, a stepwise strategy was implemented to enhance the model performance. Specifically, we corrected the forcing temperature data, updated the time-varying vegetation parameters, and upgraded the snow-related process physics. Simulated nighttime LST errors were mainly controlled by the forcing temperature, while updated vegetation parameters reduced errors in daytime LST. Snow-related changes produced a good spatial representation of SCF that was consistent with MODIS but degraded the overall streamflow performance. This effort highlights the value of Earth observing satellites and provides a roadmap for building confidence in the spatiotemporal simulations from regional models for assessing the sensitivity of the Colorado River to climate change.

TI  - Evaluating Soil Loss for Identification of Land Risk Area in the Kabe Watershed of Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is the main cause of topsoil loss in farming land, which results in reduction in cropland productivity. Soil loss estimation is crucial for developing soil and water conservation strategies for Ethiopia. The investigation aimed to estimate the soil loss in various intensifications of land use patterns, including slope categories, using the soil estimation model associated with the ArcGIS process. It is analyzed in Ethiopian conditions based on erosivity, soil erodibility, vegetative cover (C) remote sensing data, slop-length factor (LS), and management practices (P). The mean soil loss was relatively high (20.01 t ha(-1)yr(-1)) in the cultivated land, whereas it was lowest (0.17 t ha(-1)yr(-1)) under forest land. Soil loss in the watershed shows a significant variation under slope classification. Moreover, the land having a greater slope angle, or the upper slope of the watershed, contains maximum soil erosion, while the lower slope position has a minimum soil erosion rate. The validation shows that there is an insignificant variation between the predicted model and the experimental data. Therefore, this confirms that the model can be applied in the study watershed or elsewhere with similar agroecology to the study area. This research is also used to prepare an erosion management strategy for the conservation of soil and water in the watersheds.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) mapping is relevant for many applications, from Earth system and climate modelling to territorial and urban planning. Global LULC products are continuously developing as remote sensing data and methods grow. However, there still exists low consistency among LULC products due to low accuracy in some regions and LULC types. Here, we introduce Sentinel2GlobalLULC, a Sentinel-2 RGB image dataset, built from the spatial-temporal consensus of up to 15 global LULC maps available in Google Earth Engine. Sentinel2GlobalLULC v2.1 contains 194877 single-class RGB image tiles organized into 29 LULC classes. Each image is a 224 x 224 pixels tile at 10 x 10 m resolution built as a cloud-free composite from Sentinel-2 images acquired between June 2015 and October 2020. Metadata includes a unique LULC annotation per image, together with level of consensus, reverse geo-referencing, global human modification index, and number of dates used in the composite. Sentinel2GlobalLULC is designed for training deep learning models aiming to build precise and robust global or regional LULC maps.

TI  - Characterizing groundwater heat transport in a complex lowland aquifer using paleo-temperature reconstruction, satellite data, temperature-depth profiles, and numerical models
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat is a naturally occurring, widespread groundwater tracer that can be used to identify flow patterns in groundwater systems. Temperature measurements, being relatively inexpensive and effortless to gather, represent a valuable source of information which can be exploited to reduce uncertainties on groundwater flow, and, for example, support performance assessment studies on waste disposal sites. In a lowland setting, however, hydraulic gradients are typically small, and whether temperature measurements can be used to inform us about catchment-scale groundwater flow remains an open question. For the Neogene Aquifer in Flanders, groundwater flow and solute transport models have been developed in the framework of safety and feasibility studies for the underlying Boom Clay formation as a potential host rock for geological disposal of radioactive waste. However, the simulated fluxes by these models are still subject to large uncertainties as they are typically constrained by hydraulic heads only. In the current study, we use a state-of-the-art 3D steady-state groundwater flow model, calibrated against hydraulic head measurements, to build a 3D transient heat transport model, for assessing the use of heat as an additional state variable, in a lowland setting and at the catchment scale. We therefore use temperature-depth (TD) profiles as additional state variable observations for inverse conditioning. Furthermore, a Holocene paleo-temperature time curve was constructed based on paleo-temperature reconstructions in Europe from several sources in combination with land surface temperature (LST) remotely sensed monthly data from 2001 to 2019 (retrieved from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS). The aim of the research is to understand the mechanisms of heat transport and to characterize the temperature distribution and dynamics in the Neogene Aquifer. The simulation results clearly underline advection/convection and conduction as the major heat transport mechanisms, with a reduced role of advection/convection in zones where flux magnitudes are low, which suggests that temperature is also a useful indicator in a lowland setting. Furthermore, the performed scenarios highlight the important roles of (i) surface hydrological features and withdrawals driving local groundwater flow systems and (ii) the inclusion of subsurface features like faults in the conceptualization and development of hydrogeological investigations. These findings serve as a proxy of the influence of advective transport and barrier/conduit role of faults, particularly for the Rauw fault in this case, and suggest that solutes released from the Boom Clay might be affected in similar ways.

TI  - Modelling Net Ecosystem Exchange in the Biebrza Wetlands using satellite and meteorological data
T2  - MISCELLANEA GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The CO2 flux on Biebrza Wetlands in Poland is analysed by ground measurements and satellite data. The main goal of this study was to determine the Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) for sedges, reeds and grasses using meteorological, soil and vegetation parameters and satellite indicators. The calculations are based on chamber measurements scattered over the main habitats and meteorological registrations, and compared to the 2015-2022 eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The NEE model, to get its distribution throughout the day, was elaborated using modelled gross primary production GPP and modelled respiration RESP. The model of ecosystem respiration was developed applying air temperature, soil temperature, soil moisture and NDVI. The satellite vegetation index NDVI, surface and air difference temperature (T-S-T-A), and NDII proved to be good predictors for the daily mean GPP. The data from the EC tower was used to compare the results from modelled NEE and CO2 flux.

TI  - Hyperspectral imagery reveals large spatial variations of heavy metal content in agricultural soil-A case study of remote-sensing inversion based on Orbita Hyperspectral Satellites (OHS) imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread heavy metal contamination in soil induced by extensive human disturbance has been a global significant issue because of its chronic toxic effects on human health. However, the establishment of effective monitoring and assessing methods for heavy metal content in the soil remain a long-term challenge due to the intrinsic limitation of the current multi-band remote sensing technology and field measurement methods. Prompted by this significant technique gap, we represent an implementation of remote-sensing inversion models based on hyperspectral imagery to reconstruct soil heavy metal contents within an experimental farmland located in Mianzhu city, Sichuan, China. We collected soil samples at the pre-defined sites, and measured soil heavy metal contents and soil spectrum in the laboratory condition. Meanwhile, we obtained Orbita Hyper -spectral Satellites (OHS) imagery and quantified the associated vegetation indexes. The measured soil spectrum, bands of OHS, and the generated vegetation indexes were mathematically transformed to better represent their relations with soil heavy metal contents. Consequently, the most sensitive variables were selected as potent predictors of soil heavy metal contents in the inversion models. After evaluating the optimal inversion models for each heavy metal element, we implemented them to reconstruct the spatial patterns of soil heavy metal contents over the study landscape. We found obvious benefits of the remote sensing inversion model in predicting the spatial heterogeneity of heavy metal content within this small landscape patch. Specifically, the inversion model unraveled a normal distribution of heavy metal contents within the landscape, while the traditional spatial interpolation based on field measurements may suggest a largely skewed distribution. Compared with airborne -based studies, this study represents an application of spaceborne satellite data, which can be easily applied to a large spatial scale and long-term monitoring.

TI  - Two decades of satellite surface chlorophyll a concentration (1998-2019) in the Spanish Mediterranean marine waters (Western Mediterranean Sea): Trends, phenology and eutrophication assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of satellite surface chlorophyll of more than 20 years were built for the Spanish Mediterranean waters. Chlorophyll data from SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-Suomi-NPP were generated based on the locally developed SMED algorithms. Nevertheless, it was necessary to harmonize the trends between the three different sensors before merging the data in the com-posite time series. Cluster analysis of the monthly chlorophyll averages allowed distinguishing four main areas with distinctive seasonal and phenological features in the study region. The western Alboran Sea showed high productivity during all the year. In the other areas, the average duration of the productive period was also extensive (about 180 days) starting at the beginning of November, but coastal waters in general showed a belated ending. These results suggest that nutrients are the main limiting factor of the primary production in the region. During the last 20 years, a general decreasing trend in the surface chlorophyll concentration was observed in the Spanish Mediterranean waters; nevertheless, a strong variability in the intensity of the productive annual period probably related with long scale climatic oscillations was observed. The surface chlorophyll concentration reduced in a decade from 10% in coastal waters to 20% in offshore waters. Some patches in the region showed positive trends, including offshore areas around the Balearic Islands in winter and the coastal areas of the Gulf of Valencia in summer, but in the southern coasts of the Gulf of Alicante the positive trends were persistent during all the year. The performed analysis can be used globally for eutrophication assessment as well as for the evalu-ation of changes on the phytoplankton phenology probably driven by the global change.

TI  - Assimilation of S5P/TROPOMI carbon monoxide data with the global CAMS near-real-time system
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Copernicus Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5P) satellite, launched in October 2017, provides a wealth of atmospheric composition data, including total columns of carbon monoxide (TCCO) at high horizontal resolution (5.5 km x 7 km). Near-real-time TROPOMI TCCO data have been monitored in the global data assimilation system of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) since November 2018 to assess the quality of the data. The CAMS system already routinely assimilates TCCO data from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) outside the polar regions.The assimilation of TROPOMI TCCO data in the CAMS system was tested for the period 6 July to 31 December 2021, i.e. after the TROPOMI algorithm update to version 02.02.00 in July 2021. By assimilating TROPOMI TCCO observations, the CAMS CO columns increase by on average 8 %, resulting in an improved fit to independent observations (LAGOS aircraft profiles and NDACC Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) tropospheric and total-column CO data) compared to a version of the CAMS system where only TCCO from MOPITT and IASI is assimilated. The largest absolute and relative changes from the assimilation of TROPOMI CO are found in the lower and middle troposphere, i.e. that part of the atmosphere that is not already well constrained by the assimilated TIR MOPITT and IASI data. The largest impact near the surface comes from clear-sky TROPOMI data over land, and additional vertical information comes from the retrievals of measurements in cloudy conditions.July and August 2021 saw record numbers of boreal wildfires over North America and Russia, leading to large amounts of CO being released into the atmosphere. The paper assesses the impact of TROPOMI CO assimilation on selected CO plumes more closely. While the CO column can be well constrained by the assimilation of TROPOMI CO data, and the fit to individual IAGOS CO profiles in the lower and middle troposphere is considerably improved, the TROPOMI CO columns do not provide further constraints on individual plumes that are transported across continents and oceans at altitudes above 500 hPa.

TI  - Sea Surface Temperature Trends in the Coastal Zone of Southern England
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) trends along the south coast of England (northern English Channel) were examined based on data from systematic buoy measurements deployed by the National Network of Regional Coastal Monitoring Programmes of England (NNRCMP) since 2003. These data were supplemented with: (1) long-term, coastal SST measurements by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS); (2) global data sets compiled by the Hadley Centre since 1900, and (3) satellite-derived observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Aqua) since 2002. These data sets were used to evaluate de-seasoned nearshore trends in SST along the south coast of England and examine links to regional ocean-atmosphere teleconnections. The analyses of long-term, CEFAS data support the proposal that prior to the mid-1980s there were no de-seasoned trends in SST and conditions from year to year were relatively stable. Subsequently, interannual fluctuations appear to have increased, associated with a period of warming between 1985 and 2003 (0.28 degrees C/decade). Post 2003, interannual fluctuations in SST monitored by the NNRCMP buoys continued, and the warming trend appears to be greater (0.42 degrees C/decade). This trend in SST is greatest in the nearshore and decreases with distance offshore. The warming in SST also varied greatly from month to month. The greatest warming took place from December to March, whilst the least heating (and sometimes cooling) occurred between September and November. Analysis of Hadley (HadSST1.1) and MODIS data sets substantiated these trends. The greatest warming (post 2003) was found west of Portland Bill (up to 0.76 degrees C/decade) and decreased towards the Strait of Dover. Despite this west-to-east trend, all 12 NNRCMP stations between Penzance and Folkestone showed remarkably similar results, suggesting regional and global sources of heat rather than local sources. This is corroborated through wavelet coherence analysis linking SST anomalies to regional/global ocean-atmosphere teleconnection indices at seasonal scales.

TI  - Extensive inland thinning and speed-up of Northeast Greenland Ice Stream
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past two decades, ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has increased owing to enhanced surface melting and ice discharge to the ocean(1-5). Whether continuing increased ice loss will accelerate further, and by how much, remains contentious(6-9). A main contributor to future ice loss is the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), Greenland's largest basin and a prominent feature of fast-flowing ice that reaches the interior of the GrIS(10-)(12). Owing to its topographic setting, this sector is vulnerable to rapid retreat, leading to unstable conditions similar to those in the marine-based setting of ice streams in Antarctica(13-20). Here we show that extensive speed-up and thinning triggered by frontal changes in 2012 have already propagated more than 200 km inland. We use unique global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations, combined with surface elevation changes and surface speeds obtained from satellite data, to select the correct basal conditions to be used in ice flow numerical models, which we then use for future simulations. Our model results indicate that this marine-based sector alone will contribute 13.5-15.5 mm sea-level rise by 2100 (equivalent to the contribution of the entire ice sheet over the past 50 years) and will cause precipitous changes in the coming century. This study shows that measurements of subtle changes in the ice speed and elevation inland help to constrain numerical models of the future mass balance and higher-end projections show better agreement with observations.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 rates and equity impacts using labor and delivery patients in Phoenix, Arizona
T2  - PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Proactive management of SARS-CoV-2 requires timely and complete population data to track the evolution of the virus and identify at risk populations. However, many cases are asymptomatic and are not easily discovered through traditional testing efforts. Sentinel surveillance can be used to estimate the prevalence of infections for geographical areas but requires identification of sentinels who are representative of the larger population. Our goal is to evaluate applicability of a population of labor and delivery patients for sentinel surveillance system for monitoring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested 5307 labor and delivery patients from two hos-pitals in Phoenix, Arizona, finding 195 SARS-CoV-2 positive. Most positive cases were associated with people who were asymptomatic (79.44%), similar to statewide rates. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that SARS-CoV-2 disproportionately impacts people of color, with Black people having the highest positive rates (5.92%). People with private medical insurance had the lowest positive rates (2.53%), while Medicaid patients had a positive rate of 5.54% and people without insurance had the highest positive rates (6.12%). With diverse people reporting for care and being tested regardless of symptoms, labor and delivery patients may serve as ideal sentinels for asymptomatic detection of SARS-CoV-2 and monitoring impacts across a wide range of social and economic classes. A more robust system for infectious disease management requires the expanded participation of additional hospitals so that the sentinels are more representative of the population at large, reflecting geographic and neighborhood level patterns of infection and risk.

TI  - Structural projection points estimation and context priors for oil tank storage estimation in SAR image
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - 3D information extraction is a key direction in the development of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology. Extracting the implicit 3D information in SAR image, such as the structure, texture, and occlusion relationship between the environment and the targets, is of significant and challenging for SAR image target interpretation, refined structure parameter extraction and 3D reconstruction. In this article, with a focus on the storage estimation of oil tank in SAR image, we modeled the structural projection points description operator to estimate the fine 3D structural parameters of oil tank and invert the storage information. We proposed the SAR image context prior to further extract the 3D information of the oil tank targets. In addition, by improving the separate offset regressor and adding different attention mechanisms in different branches, we better improved the estimation precision of the structural projection point of the oil tank target. We evaluated our model on the SAR image datasets from RADARSAT-2 with different observation conditions and resolutions, which demonstrates that our proposed model achieves the AP of 87.2% compared with 82.8% of baseline. Finally, we further discussed the effectiveness of the proposed method, as well as the future application prospect and promoting role in the field of SAR image 3D information extraction.

TI  - Concentration and distribution of phytoplankton nitrogen and carbon in the Northwest Atlantic and Indian Ocean: A simple model with applications in satellite remote sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the critical role phytoplankton play in marine biogeochemical cycles, direct methods for determining the content of two key elements in natural phytoplankton samples, nitrogen (N) and carbon (C), remain difficult, and such observations are sparse. Here, we extend an existing approach to derive phytoplankton N and C indirectly from a large dataset of in-situ particulate N and C, and Turner fluorometric chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), gathered in the off-shore waters of the Northwest Atlantic and the Arabian Sea. This method uses quantile regression (QR) to partition particulate C and N into autotrophic and non-autotrophic fractions. Both the phytoplankton C and N estimates were combined to compute the C:N ratio. The algal contributions to total N and C increased with increasing Chl-a, whilst the C:N ratio decreased with increasing Chl-a. However, the C:N ratio remained close to the Redfield ratio over the entire Chl-a range. Five different phytoplankton taxa within the samples were identified using data from high-performance liquid chromatography pigment analysis. All algal groups had a C:N ratio higher than Redfield, but for diatoms, the ratio was closer to the Redfield ratio, whereas for Prochlorococcus, other cyanobacteria and green algae, the ratio was significantly higher. The model was applied to remotely-sensed estimates of Chl-a to map the geographical distribution of phytoplankton C, N, and C:N in the two regions from where the data were acquired. Estimates of phytoplankton C and N were found to be consistent with literature values, indirectly validating the approach. The work illustrates how a simple model can be used to derive information on the phytoplankton elemental composition, and be applied to remote sensing data, to map pools of elements like nitrogen, not currently provided by satellite services.

TI  - Clustering has a meaning: optimization of angular similarity to detect 3D geometric anomalies in geological terrains
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The geological potential of sparse subsurface data is not being fully exploited since the available workflows are not specifically designed to detect and interpret 3D geometric anomalies hidden in the data. We develop a new unsupervised machine learning framework to cluster and analyze the spatial distribution of orientations sampled throughout a geological interface. Our method employs Delaunay triangulation and clustering with the squared Euclidean distance to cluster local unit orientations, which results in minimization of the within-cluster cosine distance. We performed the clustering on two representations of the triangles: normal and dip vectors. The classes resulting from clustering were attached to a geometric center of a triangle (irregular version). We also developed a regular version of spatial clustering which allows the question to be answered as to whether points from a grid structure can be affected by anomalies. To illustrate the usefulness of the combination between cosine distance as a dissimilarity metric and two cartographic versions, we analyzed subsurface data documenting two horizons: (1) the bottom Jurassic surface from the Central European Basin System (CEBS) and (2) an interface between Middle Jurassic units within the Krakow-Silesian Homocline (KSH), which is a part of the CEBS. The empirical results suggest that clustering normal vectors may result in near-collinear cluster centers and boundaries between clusters of similar trend, thus pointing to axis of a potential megacylinder. Clustering dip vectors, on the other hand, resulted in near-co-circular cluster centers, thus pointing to a potential megacone. We also show that the linear arrangements of the anomalies and their topological relationships and internal structure can provide insights regarding the internal structure of the singularity, e.g., whether it may be due to drilling a nonvertical fault plane or due to a wider deformation zone composed of many smaller faults.

TI  - Mauriora and the environment: a Kaupapa Maori exploration of adventure therapy in Aotearoa, New Zealand
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
M3  - Article
AB  - We are He Hiringa, an early career research group of new Maori academics in the Division of Sciences at the University of Otago. Drawing on an auto-ethnographic approach, this paper shares the kaupapa (purpose, collective vision) of He Hiringa, that of mauriora (flourishing wellness) and how our shared vision for flourishing wellness across the broad disciplines of Maori physical education and health, social and clinical psychology, and Maori urban design and surveying, may support adventure therapy in Aotearoa, New Zealand. While anecdotally, we know the importance of the environment for health and wellbeing, adventure therapy in this country is largely dominated by Eurocentric views and fails to account for Maori ways of thinking, being and engaging with the taiao (environment) for therapeutic benefit and healing. We argue that grounding adventure therapy in a Te Ao Maori worldview which favours a cultural, communal, ecological, and spiritual perspective will better meet the hauora (health) needs of Maori and should drive the philosophy and practice of adventure therapy here in Aotearoa, New Zealand.

TI  - Impact of climate change on spatiotemporal variations in the vegetation cover and hydrology of district Nowshera
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research seeks to validate climate change in the district of Nowshera, as well as its impact on NDVI (vegetation) and hydrological events such as monsoon rains. Modified Mann-Kendall and Sen's statistics were used to examine climate parameters. Using climate factors and MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, regression analysis was used to study a 20-year (2001-2020) spatiotemporal climate-vegetation relationship. Landsat 5 and 7 NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) data, as well as SRTM DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data, were used to map extreme weather events such as floods caused by climate change. For mapping and data processing, ArcGIS and R tools were used. The findings revealed significant trends in climate parameters, which has led to climate change in the area, affecting NDVI and water cycles. The NDVI showed a generally good trend, however some places were damaged. Monsoon rain patterns and rates have been substantially disrupted, resulting in flash and fluvial floods. The risk of future floods owing to the Kabul and Indus rivers was shown through watershed delineation, which is compounded by climate change and anthropogenic activities. It is advised that government officials and policymakers establish climate change mitigation plans for regional sustainable development and vegetation restoration.

TI  - Simulation of forest carbon fluxes by integrating remote sensing data into biome-BGC model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate quantification and monitoring of intra- and inter-annual variability of long-term forest carbon fluxes are imperative to understand the changes in the forest ecosystems in response to the changing climate. The present study aims to simulate forest carbon fluxes in two major plant functional types (PFTs) of northwest Himalayan (NWH) foothills of India by integrating time-series remote sensing (RS) data into BiomeBiogeochemical Cycle (Biome-BGC), a process-based model, and to study the spatio-temporal variability of carbon fluxes. The parameterization of the Biome-BGC model was carried out using the data from two Eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites located in the NWH foothills of India. An analysis was carried out to identify the sensitive parameters and their calibration was performed. The calibrated Biome-BGC model with a higher coefficient of determination (R2) and%RMSE for moist deciduous (R2 = 0.80, %RMSE = 13.24) and dry deciduous (R2 = 0.79, %RMSE =13.85) PFTs was used to estimate the gross primary productivity (GPP) from 2001 to 2018. However, the range of model-simulated leaf area index (LAI) was found to be lower than the field observed LAI. Integrating satellite-based Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI into the Biome-BGC model led to substantial improvement in GPP estimates of moist deciduous (R2 = 0.87, %RMSE = 11.12) and dry deciduous PFTs (R2 = 0.86, %RMSE = 10.38) when compared to EC tower-based GPP for the year 2018. Based upon the accuracy, GLASS LAI integrated Biome-BGC model was used to map the spatio-temporal variability of forest carbon fluxes. The study highlighted that integration of RS data into calibrated process-based model increased the accuracy of model-simulated forest carbon fluxes.

TI  - Ecological landscape pattern changes and security from 1990 to 2021 in Ebinur Lake Wetland Reserve, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing contradiction between humanity's growing demand for natural resources and relatively limited supplements. Thus, ecological security has received widespread attention, making it a research hotspot in the global environment and an important topic in construction of ecological civilization. Ebinur Lake Wetland is a typical arid wetland area considered as a fragile and sensitive ecosystem. Quantitative monitoring of the ecological security and landscape patterns of the Ebinur Lake wetland ecosystem is of great significance for environmental protection. To clarify the relationship between ecological landscape indices and land use/cover, this study used Landsat TM/OLI data from 1990, 1998, 2011 and 2021, aimed to analyze the correlated spatio-temporal changes of Ebinur Lake Wetland Reserve, China over past 32 years, in addition to quantitatively evaluating changes in ecological security. The results showed that(1) During 1990-1998, forest and paddy areas increased, while the transformation between paddy fields and wetlands was frequent, and from 1998 to 2011, land use/land cover (LULC) changes gradually stabilized, vegetation recovery was halted, and the water area obviously decreased. Since 2012, Ebinur Lake area decreased by 3.88 % per year, while 44.8 km(2) of the subsoils became extremely severe salinized. (2) The variability of ecological landscape in spatial structure and time dynamics is enhanced, landscape scalability declined, resulting in the intensification of fragmentation. CONTAG (Contagion index) decreased annually with the decline in Gobi area; whereas landscape diversity of wetlands increased with growing light and heavy saline-alkali areas. (3) Overall ecological security gradually increased from 0.56 to 0.65, and the unsafe areas first decreased, before increasing slightly. The total saline-alkaline land area continued to increase, indicating that desertification cannot be curbed. Ecological security had the highest sensitivity to landscape separation, and the value range and its safety levels of ecological security (ES) were accurately delimited based on uncertainty calculation and frequency statistics. The results can provide reasonable and practical suggestions for the government and local communities on how to strengthen the ecological environment construction of Ebinur Lake Wetland Reserve. The government should several water-saving measures, in addition to an inter-basin water transfer project can be implemented to help diminish the consequences of insufficient water resources, and planting salt-absorbing vegetation to slow the salinization process.

TI  - Ultrasonography and clinicopathological features of breast cancer in predicting axillary lymph node metastases
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Early identification of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in breast cancer (BC) is still a clinical difficulty. There is still no good method to replace sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The purpose of our study was to develop and validate a nomogram to predict the probability of ALNM preoperatively based on ultrasonography (US) and clinicopathological features of primary tumors. Methods From September 2019 to April 2022, the preoperative US) and clinicopathological data of 1076 T1-T2 BC patients underwent surgical treatment were collected. Patients were divided into a training set (875 patients from September 2019 to October 2021) and a validation set (201 patients from November 2021 to April 2022). Patients were divided into positive and negative axillary lymph node (ALN) group according pathology of axillary surgery. Compared the US and clinicopathological features between the two groups. The risk factors for ALNM were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed. AUC and calibration were used to assess its performance. Results By univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (p = 0.009), histologic grades (p = 0.000), molecular subtypes (p = 0.000), tumor location (p = 0.000), maximum diameter (p = 0.000), spiculated margin (p = 0.000) and distance from the skin (p = 0.000) were independent risk factors of ALNM. Then a nomogram was developed. The model was good discriminating with an AUC of 0.705 and 0.745 for the training and validation set, respectively. And the calibration curves demonstrated high agreement. However, in further predicting a heavy nodal disease burden (> 2 nodes), none of the variables were significant. Conclusion This nomogram based on the US and clinicopathological data can predict the presence of ALNM good in T1-T2 BC patients. But it cannot effectively predict a heavy nodal disease burden (> 2 nodes).

TI  - Capturing Secchi disk depth by using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery in Jiaozhou Bay, China from 2017 to 2021
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity is a key parameter for assessing changes of aquatic environment. Coastal waters are complex and variable, remote sensing of water clarity for it is often limited by low spatial resolution. The Sentinel-2 Multi -Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery with a resolution of up to 10 m are employed to solve the problem from 2017 to 2021. Distribution and characteristics of Secchi disk depth (SDD) in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) are analyzed. Subtle changes in localized small areas are discovered, and main factors affecting the changes are explored. Among natural factors, precipitation and wind play dominant roles in variation in SDD. Human activities have a sig-nificant influence on transparency, among which fishery farming has the greatest impact. This is clearly evi-denced by the significant improvement of SDD in JZB due to the sharp decrease in human activities caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

TI  - Mapping contiguous XCO2 by machine learning and analyzing the spatio-temporal variation in China from 2003 to 2019
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As China is the world's largest CO2 emitter, it is important to understand the spatio-temporal variation of atmospheric CO2 to reduce carbon emissions. Satellite remote sensing for carbon monitoring has been widely used and studied be-cause of its long-term and large-scale characteristics. However, the satellite data results are very sparse with significant gaps due to narrow swath and other factors on CO2 retrieval. The simple interpolation methods ignore the influential factors of CO2 and loss the spatial resolution, which leads to the inability to quantify the spatio-temporal variation well. This study developed a machine learning method that considers carbon emissions, vegetation, and meteorology. Using the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) data of SCIAMACHY, GOSAT, and OCO-2, we derived monthly-scale contiguous XCO2 data across China from 2003 to 2019 with 0.25 degrees resolution. The results showed a good agreement with the satellite measurements, with the bias and standard deviation of 0.11 and 1.38 ppmv for the validation dataset, respectively. Moreover, the results were consistent with the model simulation and in-situ sites, indicating the ability to reflect long-term spatio-temporal variation with a finer texture. We analyzed the spatial distribution, seasonal variation, and long-term trends of XCO2 in China, revealing that the machine learning method has comparable performance to model simulations. The results showed that XCO2 is dominated by anthropogenic emissions spatially and has a clear seasonal cycle, with a larger amplitude the further north. The long-term trend shows the XCO2 increased by an average rate of 2.17 ppmv per year from 2003 to 2019 in China, which is consistent with the global. The method and data can further study the carbon cycle and climate change.

TI  - Machine learning algorithm for estimating karst rocky desertification in a peak-cluster depression basin in southwest Guangxi, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst rocky desertification (KRD) has become one of the most serious ecological and environmental problems in karst areas. At present, mapping KRD with a high accuracy and on a large scale is still a difficult problem in the control of KRD. In this study, a random forest (RF) based on maximum information coefficient and correlation coefficient feature selection is proposed to predict KRD. Nine predictors stood out as feature factors to estimate KRD. Rock exposure was the most important predictor, followed by fractional vegetation cover for the prediction of KRD processes. The kappa and classification accuracy indexes were to evaluate the performance of the model. We recorded overall accuracy rate and kappa index values of 94.7% and 0.92 for the testing datasets respectively. The RF model was then used to predict the KRD in 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2020, and it was found that the KRD in the study area has exhibited a positive trend of improvement. Therefore, the use of multisource remote sensing data combined with the RF model can obtain better prediction results of KRD, thereby providing a new idea for large-scale estimation of the KRD in peak-cluster depression.

TI  - Developing seagrass index for long term monitoring of<i> Zostera</i><i> japonica</i> seagrass bed: A case study in Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass beds offer unique and vital ecological services as an important blue carbon ecosystem in coastal wet-lands. Zostera japonica is an intertidal seagrass species native to eastern Asia and is one of the most widely distributed seagrass species in China. However, little is known on the long-term variations of Z. japonica extents. Automatic mapping method for Z. japonica seagrass beds is in urgent need to fill this knowledge gap. In this study, we proposed a new SeaGrass Index (SGI) for automatic and rapid mapping of Z. japonica based on time -series Landsat satellite imagery, aiming to alleviate the influence of tidal inundation and enhance the separability from other coastal cover types. The SGI considers both spectral and phenological characteristics of Z. japonica, as well as the spatial location of Z. japonica. We took the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China as our study area, where Z. japonica was first discovered and reported in 2015. Based on SGI, Z. japonica extents during 1985-2018 were extracted using multi-Otsu thresholding algorithm. Accuracy assessments based on field investigations and high -resolution imagery showed that SGI successfully separated seagrass beds from other cover types, especially intertidal salt marshes, with overall accuracies > 95%, producer's accuracies > 90% and user's accuracies > 94%. Our study provides the first long-term maps of seagrass beds in YRD. The area of Z. japonica showed large variations during 1985-2018, ranging from 149 ha in 2005-2006 to 1302.9 ha in 2011-2012. The spatial dis-tribution of Z. japonica varied with the morphological change of the estuary caused by river channel shifts. Since 2011, Z. japonica seagrass beds have undergone area degradation due to the invasion of S. alterniflora. The area was only 332.3 ha in 2017-2018. Coastal erosion and extreme climate events such as drought and typhoon might also explain degradation of seagrass beds in YRD. We expect that the SGI will advance automatic and rapid mapping methods for intertidal seagrass beds, and the Z. japonica maps will provide a baseline data for resto-ration and management of seagrasses at regional scale.

TI  - A Model Incorporating Axillary Tail Position on Mammography for Preoperative Prediction of Non- sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Initial cN plus Breast Cancer after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: This study aimed to develop a model incorporating axillary tail position on mammography (AT) for the predic-tion of non-sentinel Lymph Node (NSLN) metastasis in patients with initial clinical node positivity (cN+).Methods and Materials: The study reviewed a total of 257 patients with cN+ breast cancer who underwent both sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). A logistic regression model was developed based on these factors and the results of post-NAC AT and axillary ultrasound (AUS).Results: Four clinical factors with p<0.1 in the univariate analysis, including ycT0(odds ratio [OR]: 4.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.13-11.91, p<0.001), clinical stage before NAC (OR: 2.68, 95%CI: 1.15-6.58, p=0.025), estrogen receptor (ER) expression (OR: 3.29, 95%CI: 1.39-8.39, p=0.009), and HER2 status (OR: 0.21, 95%CI: 0.08-0.50, p=0.001), were independent predictors of NSLN metastases. The clin-ical model based on the above four factors resulted in the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82(95%CI: 0.76-0.88) in the training set and 0.83(95% CI: 0.74-0.92) in the validation set. The results of post-NAC AUS and AT were added to the clinical model to construct a clinical imaging model for the prediction of NSLN metastasis with AUC of 0.87(95%CI: 0.81-0.93) in the training set and 0.89(95%CI: 0.82-0.96) in the validation set.Conclusions: The study incorporated the results of post-NAC AT and AUS with other clinal factors to develop a model to predict NSLN metastasis in patients with initial cN+ before surgery. This model performed excellently, allowing physicians to select patients for whom unnecessary ALND could be avoided after NAC.(c) 2022 The Association of University Radiologists.

TI  - The importance of the functional mixed entropy for the explanation of residential and transport CO2 emissions in the urban center of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of urban spatial form on the environment is complex and lengthy. The spatial analysis for the urban form and residential-related CO2 emissions at the city scale is challenging due to the lack of extensive urban form data and fine-grain CO2 emission maps. This research uses remote sensing data and downscaling interpolation to generate residential and transport (RTCE) maps in 130 m spatial resolution of urban center regions from 31 major cities in China, then investigates the relationship between 3 types of urban form indicators (Internal characteristics, external morphology, and development intensity) and RTCE through Geographical Weighted Regression method. The results reveal that urban form indicators could explain about 45.9% of RTCE. The 2D building shape indicator has the second greatest positive impact as the external morphology indicator, which complicates the influence. The internal characteristics indicators have relatively strong influences than the development intensity indicators. For instance, the influence of functional mixed entropy (FME) is the greatest positive influence and decreases exponentially with FME increases. Therefore, cities with the FME lower than the threshold (0.28) should increase it appropriately, while cities with the FME around and larger than 0.28 should maintain and probably reduce it.

TI  - PM<sub>10</sub> aerosol enhancement in the anticyclonic anomalies caused by the East Asian spring warming of 2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the PM10 aerosol enhancement caused by East Asian atmospheric warming during trans -boundary transport in March of 2021. It was found to be cooled near the north polar area and to have shifted the polar vortices northward over the East Asian region in the mid-troposphere. The Siberian high was weakened and the East Asian region was characterized by a positive air temperature anomaly and negative zonal wind speeds. The increasing rate of air temperature anomalies at 2 m was higher in the high latitude areas over 40N in Mongolia and northeastern China, causing a decrease in zonal wind speeds at 10 m over eastern China and Korea. The anomalous variations of the MODIS-induced aerosol optical depth (AOD) were found to be positive with the highest value of +0.93 in the area ranging from northeastern China to Korea, despite the recent decreasing trends. The positive anomalous region of the MODIS-induced AOD was correlated with positive air temperatures and negative zonal wind speeds, causing enhanced formations of secondary aerosols in the atmosphere. As cold northerly winds were suppressed in the East Asian region, anomalous high pressures (anticyclonic anomalies) developed frequently in eastern China and moved to Korea. The Weather Research and Forecasting model to which meteorological and climate data were applied coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations on in-creases in the PM10 enhancement ratio, indicating enhanced formation amounts, during transboundary transport for the period of March 13-15, 2021. An air mass near the high terrain surface over eastern China under the backward side of an anticyclone warmed and moved toward the relatively low terrain of the Yellow Sea and Korea in keeping with the height. Air temperature inversion developed in the anomalous warmer center in the mid-troposphere, reaching the surface of the Yellow Sea and Korea. High PM10 concentrations were constrained near the shallow inversion layer. Furthermore, the PM10 enhancement ratio showed a positive level over the Yellow Sea with nearly zero anthropogenic emissions on the surface, gradually increasing at a rate of approximately 60% in Korea. The hourly contribution by the warming-induced PM10 enhancement (PM10 CbWIE) was calculated and found to be at the highest level of 70% in Seoul, Korea. Among PM10 secondary inorganic aerosols, nitrate formations were enhanced during transboundary transport in the warming-induced anticyclone with reactions rich in ammonium. While the sulfate enhancement ratio reached a positive level over the Yellow Sea, the gradual decrease during transboundary transport may be reflected by the decreased emissions of sulfur dioxide in eastern China.

TI  - High prevalence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins detected among clinical isolates from sentinel healthcare facilities in Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE AND INFECTION CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacterial pathogens is a worldwide concern that demands immediate attention. Most information on AMR originates from high-income countries and little is known about the burden in Africa, particularly Nigeria. Using four sentinel sites (General hospitals) in Lagos State, this study sought to estimate the burden of AMR. Methods This is a hospital-based surveillance using secondary health care centres. Four sites were randomly selected and included in the study. Clinical isolates were collected over a period of 6 months for each site from August 2020 to March 2021. All isolates were characterised and analysed for resistance to 15 antibiotics using the Kirby-Baur method. Multiplex PCR assay was used for the detection of Extended spectrum beta lactamase genes. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 27.0. Results Four hundred and ninety-nine (499) patients consented and participated in this study, consisting of 412 (82.6%) females and 87 (17.4%) males. The mean age +/- SD of the participants was 33.9 +/- 13.8 with a range of 1-89 years. The majority (90.8%) of the participants were outpatients. Two hundred and thirty-two (232) isolates were obtained from 219 samples, comprising of 120 (51.7%) Gram positive and 112 (48.3%) Gram negative organisms. Key bacterial pathogens isolated from this study included Staphylococcus aureus (22.8%), Escherichia coli (16.4%), Staphylococcus spp. (15.9%), Enterococcus spp. (7.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.5%). There was high prevalence of multi-drug resistance (79.3%) among the isolates with 73.6% of Staphylococcus aureus phenotypically resistant to methicillin and 70% possessed the MecA gene. 76.5% of Enterococcus spp. isolated were Vancomycin resistant. Overall, resistance to Cephalosporins was most frequently/commonly observed (Cefotaxime 87.5%). Conclusion A high incidence of AMR was identified in clinical bacteria isolates from selected general hospitals in Lagos State, highlighting the necessity for the implementation of national action plans to limit the prevalence of AMR. Surveillance via collection of isolates has a lot of promise, especially in resource-limited environments.

TI  - Investigating the usefulness of satellite-retrieved land surface temperature (LST) in pre- and post-fire spatial analysis
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this paper, we analyse the applicability and effectiveness of satellite-retrieved Land Surface Temperature (LST) for monitoring and spatial analysis of forest fires using pre- and post-fire Landsat 8 and Aster satellite images. Firstly, LST was used for pre-fire analysis, along with other meteorological parameters to evaluate fire risk, and the results showed that the LST was highly correlated with all parameters. Besides, Google Earth Engine platform was used to evaluate forest-fire susceptibility in the region. For post-fire analysis, LST was used to monitor, analyse, and map post-fire disturbances using different image spectral transformations, and correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the strength of relationships between the parameters. High correlation coefficients were obtained between LST and selected spectral indices; and the highest correlation (0.90) was found between Difference Land Surface Temperature (dLST) - Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Spatial analysis done for dLST and slope showed that the post-fire LST increased in areas with a slope range of 42-55%. Then, spatial relation analysis between dLST and other indices was performed and a high correlation was found between dLST - dNBR, dLST - DI (Disturbance Index), and dLST - NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index). Finally, for 4 categorical variables (namely CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map, dLST, Burn severity and Slope), the areal extent of burnt forest areas was calculated and most burnt areas were found to be related a certain degree with each category (i.e. coniferous forest class, -2 and 0.5 degrees C, medium-low burning intensity, 29-42% slope range, respectively).

TI  - Changes in land use and cover and their consequences on the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration and climatic elements in southwest Piaui, MATOPIBA
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advance of agriculture in Brazil, the occurrence of environmental disturbances that can reach different levels, such as the change of use and land cover, is perceived. In the southwest of Piaui, it is noticeable the large portion of Cerrado that has been replaced by crops and pastures, resulting in several impacts, such as changes in evapotranspiration. In the literature there are several methods to estimate it, among them the remote sensing techniques stand out. Therefore, the objective of this work was to quantify agricultural expansion and understand its consequences on real evapotranspiration and on the configuration of meteorological elements in the mu-nicipality of Baixa Grande do Ribeiro, through the products of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) accessed through Google Earth. Engine. Platform (GEE), between 2000 and 2020. The real evapotranspiration (ETa) and leaf area index (LAI) data come from the MODIS sensor products. The meteorological data were ob-tained from the website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA POWER). The maps were made in QGIS 3.18.1 software from data processed on the GEE platform. The evolution of forest and agricultural areas and images of land use and cover were obtained using the MapBiomas platform. It was observed that between 2000 and 2020, about 27% of the area of native vegetation was replaced, and soybean cultivation grew by approximately 2618%. In addition, the removal of native vegetation for the establishment of pastures and agricultural crops has contributed to the reduction of evapo-transpiration and the leaf area index, in addition, it may be associated with the increase in surface and air temperatures and reduction of the relative humidity of the air. This implies the need to create and implement public policies aimed at controlling deforestation in the region, as well as greater inspection in the sphere of environmental crimes.

TI  - Recent cover crop adoption is associated with small maize and soybean yield losses in the United States
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops are gaining traction in many agricultural regions, partly driven by increased public subsidies and by private markets for ecosystem services. These payments are motivated by environmental benefits, including improved soil health, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic carbon. However, previous work based on experimental plots or crop modeling indicates cover crops may reduce crop yields. It remains unclear, though, how recent cover crop adoption has affected productivity in commercial agricultural systems. Here we perform the first large-scale, field-level analysis of observed yield impacts from cover cropping as implemented across the US Corn Belt. We use validated satellite data products at sub-field scales to analyze maize and soybean yield outcomes for over 90,000 fields in 2019-2020. Because we lack data on cover crop species or timing, we seek to quantify the yield impacts of cover cropping as currently practiced in aggregate. Using causal forests analysis, we estimate an average maize yield loss of 5.5% on fields where cover crops were used for 3 or more years, compared with fields that did not adopt cover cropping. Maize yield losses were larger on fields with better soil ratings, cooler mid-season temperatures, and lower spring rainfall. For soybeans, average yield losses were 3.5%, with larger impacts on fields with warmer June temperatures, lower spring and late-season rainfall, and, to a lesser extent, better soils. Estimated impacts are consistent with multiple mechanisms indicated by experimental and simulation-based studies, including the effects of cover crops on nitrogen dynamics, water consumption, and soil oxygen depletion. Our results suggest a need to improve cover crop management to reduce yield penalties, and a potential need to target subsidies based on likely yield impacts. Ultimately, avoiding substantial yield penalties is important for realizing widespread adoption and associated benefits for water quality, erosion, soil carbon, and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Spatial distribution model of terrestrial radiation imbalance measured by means of orbiting radiometers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatial distribution model was applied to net radiation levels in central Colombia obtained from remote sensing data; this model was based on the use of spatial interpolation geostatistical techniques and consists of three essential phases: an evaluation of the quality of the spectral scenes, the application of spatial interpolation techniques and the statistical evaluation of the model. These procedures allowed a more accurate analysis of the variables that influence the spa-tial patterns of terrestrial radiation imbalance (T.R.I) in specific areas of the country. The input data used in this model are called FlashFlux Time Integrated and Spatially Averaged (TISA) and come from observations of the Terra and Aqua satellites of the CERES (Clouds and the Earths Ra-diant Energy System) and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) projects. In summary, the way in which this research was carried out was initially with an evaluation of the image quality, to analyse the potential and statistical characteristics of the FlashFlux TISA data; subsequently, a kriging interpolation method was applied adapting the radiometric data for a cor-rect analysis and the patterns of terrestrial radiation imbalance in the centre of the country were analysed, trying to explore variables that influence these spatial dynamics. Finally, an evaluation of the spatial distribution model of terrestrial radiation imbalance was established, where the virtues, relevance and limitations of the techniques used in it were validated. This research was able to implement statistical methods of spatial interpolation, specifically the Ordinary Kriging technique, allowing the modelling of the recent situation of terrestrial radiation imbalance in central Colombia, identifying some processes and factors that are closely related to this atmos-pheric phenomenon responsible for the effects of regional warming.

TI  - Redefining the clinical axillary lymph node staging using SPECT/CT in early breast cancer during SLNB
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: SPECT/CT imaging can provide information on axillary nodal morphology, number, and status of axillary levels, along with information on primary tumor morphology, mediastinum, and lungs that assesses nodal status beyond localization. The current study aims to evaluate the feasibility of SLNB with SPECT/CT for reporting nodal information in terms of morphology, number, and axillary levels that assess nodal staging. Ninety consecutive patients with early breast cancer were included. Thirty-seven MBq (1 mCi) of Tc99m nanocolloid was used. SPECT/CT followed PS. Nodal morphology, number, and axillary levels of sentinel and non-SLNs were reported along with their localization through a gamma probe.Results: The mean population age was 54.5 +/- 3 years. PS visualized 152 SLNs in 79 patients (success rate of 88%), and SPECT/CT showed 178 SLNs in 84 patients (93% success rate). SPECT/CT showed 90% of SLNs localized at axillary levels I & II, with 10% at the rest of the nodal areas. Out of total surgically excised, 103/706 nodes were tumor positive, and 603/706 nodes were histopathologically tumor-free. Out of 178 hot nodules, 40 showed morphologically abnormal nodes, including a few with more than one abnormal feature. The average scores in the characterization of nodal morphology for the two observers were 2.4 +/- 0.71 and 2.53 +/- 0.52, respectively, with a substantial agreement (k = 0.76).Conclusions: Hybrid imaging with SPECT/CT defines axillary lymph nodes' level and morphological features. This additional information directs the surgeon to nodes not seen by planar imaging during SLNB and can help redefine the clinical axillary lymph node staging.

TI  - A deep learning framework based on generative adversarial networks and vision transformer for complex wetland classification using limited training samples
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands have long been recognized among the most critical ecosystems globally, yet their numbers quickly diminish due to human activities and climate change. Thus, large-scale wetland monitoring is essential to provide efficient spatial and temporal insights for resource management and conservation plans. However, the main challenge is the lack of enough reference data for accurate large-scale wetland mapping. As such, the main objective of this study was to investigate the efficient deep-learning models for generating high-resolution and temporally rich training datasets for wetland mapping. The Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites from the Euro-pean Copernicus program deliver radar and optical data at a high temporal and spatial resolution. These Earth observations provide a unique source of information for more precise wetland mapping from space. The second objective was to investigate the efficiency of vision transformers for complex landscape mapping. As such, we proposed a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D GAN) to best achieve these two objectives of synthesizing training data and a Vision Transformer model for large-scale wetland classification. The proposed approach was tested in three different study areas of Saint John, Sussex, and Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. The results showed the ability of the 3D GAN to stimulate and increase the number of training data and, as a result, increase the accuracy of wetland classification. The quantitative results also demonstrated the capability of jointly using data augmentation, 3D GAN, and Vision Transformer models with overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa index of 75.61%, 73.4%, and 71.87%, respectively, using a disjoint data sampling strategy. Therefore, the proposed deep learning method opens a new window for large-scale remote sensing wetland classification.

T2  - UKRAINIAN MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - For a number sequence Y = {y(i)}(i-p+1), (the numbers P,Q is an element of Z are fixed and P < Q), we consider the mean-arithmetic oscillationswhere sigma(Y; [p, q]) = 1/q-p Sigma(q)(i=p+1) y(i) is the arithmetic mean of the sequence Y on the segment [p, q] and P <= p < q <= Q are arbitrary numbers. These oscillations coincide with the mean-integral oscillations of the function f(Y) = Sigma(Q)(i-P+1) y(i)X(i-1,i) (x(E) is the characteristic function of the set E) :Omega(f(Y); [p,q]) - 1/q-p integral[f(Y)(x) - sigma(F-Y; [p,q])]dx, sigma)f(Y); [p,q]) - 1 / q- p integral f(Y)(x)dx,which is true for any monotone sequence Y. In this case, the main point is the fact that the maximum on the right-hand side is taken only over all integer numbers r. This equality turns into a well-known equality if we take a function fy instead of the sequence Y, replace the mean -arithmetic oscillations by the mean -integral oscillations and, in addition, assume that the number r on the right-hand side is not necessarily integer.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Spatio-temporal variations in vegetation fire patterns and burning trends in the Indo-Gangetic Region (IGR) were quantified using (MODIS) active fire, burn area and land cover data from 2002 to 2021. The k-means clustering was used to map the vegetation fire patterns by combining nine variables (fire incidence, intensity, inter-annual variability, seasonality and vegetation type) for two time periods: 2002-2007 and 2008-2021. Results showed that the burning pattern is changing from forest and shrubland to cropland area. Time-series analysis showed 2.6 times increase in the fire count from 2002 to 2021; however, monthly trend analysis showed a bimodal burning pattern in which high fire activity mainly occurs during May-June and October-November of the years from 2002 to 2021. There was a 10-15 days shift in burning season during October-November period from 2007 to 2008. Among IGR, the states of Punjab and Haryana (India) are intensely affected by the shifting of the burning season.

TI  - Vegetation clumping modulates global photosynthesis through adjusting canopy light environment
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial dispersion of photoelements within a vegetation canopy, quantified by the clumping index (CI), directly regulates the within-canopy light environment and photosynthesis rate, but is not commonly implemented in terrestrial biosphere models to estimate the ecosystem carbon cycle. A few global CI products have been developed recently with remote sensing measurements, making it possible to examine the global impacts of CI. This study deployed CI in the radiative transfer scheme of the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) and used the revised CLM5 to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which CI can affect canopy absorbed radiation and gross primary production (GPP), and for the first time, considering the uncertainty and seasonal variation of CI with multiple remote sensing products. Compared to the results without considering the CI impact, the revised CLM5 estimated that sunlit canopy absorbed up to 9%-15% and 23%-34% less direct and diffuse radiation, respectively, while shaded canopy absorbed 3%-18% more diffuse radiation across different biome types. The CI impacts on canopy light conditions included changes in canopy light absorption, and sunlit-shaded leaf area fraction related to nitrogen distribution and thus the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylase activity (V-cmax), which together decreased photosynthesis in sunlit canopy by 5.9-7.2 PgC year(-1) while enhanced photosynthesis by 6.9-8.2 PgC year(-1) in shaded canopy. With higher light use efficiency of shaded leaves, shaded canopy increased photosynthesis compensated and exceeded the lost photosynthesis in sunlit canopy, resulting in 1.0 +/- 0.12 PgC year(-1) net increase in GPP. The uncertainty of GPP due to the different input CI datasets was much larger than that caused by CI seasonal variations, and was up to 50% of the magnitude of GPP interannual variations in the tropical regions. This study highlights the necessity of considering the impacts of CI and its uncertainty in terrestrial biosphere models.

TI  - Crop type mapping using time-series Sentinel-2 imagery and U-Net in early growth periods in the Hetao irrigation district in China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The information on spatial distribution pattern and area of different crops is particularly useful for monitoring and managing the sustainability of agricultural resources. However, there are still challenges in timely mapping of crop types and planting areas to support production during the present growing season. Here, we proposed to use time-series Sentinel-2 imagery and a deep learning method for major crop mapping (wheat, maize, sun-flower, and squash) in the agricultural production areas in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID), Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. A feature selection method that combines the global separability index and feature recursive elimination was proposed to optimize the band features of Sentinel-2 imagery. The Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, U-Net and deeplabv3+ algorithms were then used for image classification with all spectral bands and the selected band features, respectively. The selected bands and best method were used to determine the key time window for the early identification of four major crops. Integrate all image datasets in the early window period, and build mapping models suitable for images at different times in the window period by combining the selected bands and best method. The results showed that the proposed feature selection method effectively removed redundant features and improved the classification efficiency. The U-Net algorithm was more suitable for the classification of major crops in HID with a higher accuracy whether using all band features or the selected features. The key periods for early recognition of wheat, maize, sunflower, and squash in HID were mid-May, late June, early July, and late June, respectively. The constructed models for crop type mapping in the early period were tested in 2020 and 2021 in the HID, and the F1-score, the mean intersection-over-union and overall accuracy were 86.71 %, 84.66 %, and 98.89 %, respectively. The proposed feature selection method, U-Net classification algorithm, and screening of the early mapping window period in this study provide an efficient, accurate and timely crop mapping tool in HID. Future research can further verify the applicability of the early identification time window proposed in this study to support other agricultural management activities in the areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal coastline variations in the Pearl River Estuary and the relationship with multiple human disturbances
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastlines and estuaries as one of the most dynamic systems in the marine environment are influenced by not only natural factors but also various anthropogenic activities, but there have been limited comprehensive studies on the relationship between coastline variation and anthropogenic activities at the watershed and local scales. The Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in China has experienced remarkable coastline variation along with rapid economic development and urbanization. In this study, the coastline of the PRE was extracted using Landsat images during 1987-2017, and the impacts of multiple factors on coastline variation were explored with correlation analysis and regression analysis. Results suggested coastlines of the PRE demonstrated a clear expanding trend over recent decades, and the coastline length had increased by 74.81 km and the land area had increased by 679.25 km(2) by 2017, and results also showed rapid coastline variation during 1987-2004 and relatively slow variation during 2004-2017. Artificial coastlines accounted for 80.90% of the total coastline length in 2017, while natural coastlines accounted for only 19.10%. In addition, reduction in the sand content caused by construction of reservoirs and river dredging in upstream areas played a dominant role in affecting natural coastline variation in the PRE, especially on the west coast. Moreover, the artificial coastline in the study area expanded quickly due to the influence of various human activities, among which the urbanization and land reclamation for aquaculture played a dominant role in affecting the artificial coastline variation on the east and west coasts, respectively. Results of this study have important value for understanding the individual and joint effects of various human activities on coastline variation and can provide important reference information for the sustainable management of the PRE as well as other estuaries.

TI  - How to optimize the 2D/3D urban thermal environment: Insights derived from UAV LiDAR/multispectral data and multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The systematical exploration of how two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) features of urban land-scapes influence land surface temperature (LST) is still limited. Therefore, we investigated the influence of three main urban landscapes-urban green space, impervious land, and water bodies on LST, with a particular focus on the 3D vegetation metrics of green volume (GV) and leaf area index (LAI). We used Yinchuan City, China, as a case study. We quantified the impacts of various 2D/3D metrics of the three landscape types on LST using a random forest analysis with multiple sources, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and remote sensing images. We then generated a Bayesian Network (BN) model to identify the optimal configurations for each landscape type. We found that using 11 of the 31 metrics considered, our model could explain 81.8% of the observed variance in LST of Yinchuan City. Among those, water body metrics were the most important, followed by vegetation abundance, impervious land metrics, and landscape pattern of urban green space. The mean classification error of the BN model was only 22.9%. We suggest that this makes the BN model a promising support tool for urban planning with a view to urban heat island mitigation. Our findings also stress the importance of considering both 2D and 3D features when considering urban cooling strategies.

TI  - Saturn's atmospheric response to the large influx of ring material inferred from Cassini INMS measurements
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the Grand Finale stage of the Cassini mission, organic-rich ring material was discovered to be flowing into Saturn's equatorial upper atmosphere at a surprisingly large rate. Through a series of photochemical models, we have examined the consequences of this ring material on the chemistry of Saturn's neutral and ionized atmosphere. We find that if a substantial fraction of this material enters the atmosphere as vapor or becomes vaporized as the solid ring particles ablate upon atmospheric entry, then the ring-derived vapor would strongly affect the composition of Saturn's ionosphere and neutral stratosphere. Our surveys of Cassini infrared and ultraviolet remote-sensing data from the final few years of the mission, however, reveal none of these predicted chemical consequences. We therefore conclude that either (1) the inferred ring influx represents an anomalous, transient situation that was triggered by some recent dynamical event in the ring system that occurred a few months to a few tens of years before the 2017 end of the Cassini mission, or (2) a large fraction of the incoming material must have been entering the atmosphere as small dust particles less than similar to 100 nm in radius, rather than as vapor or as large particles that are likely to ablate. Future observations or upper limits for stratospheric neutral species such as HC3N, HCN, and CO2 at infrared wavelengths could shed light on the origin, timing, magnitude, and nature of a possible vapor-rich ring-inflow event.

TI  - Contrasting Norway spruce disturbance dynamics in managed forests and strict forest reserves in Slovakia
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances are intensifying globally, yet regional drivers of these dynamics remain poorly understood. We investigated recent disturbance intensities in Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forests in Slovakia (Central Europe) with different management objectives in 2000-2017 based on Landsat imagery. We focused on 122 strict reserves without any management, their actively managed surroundings (500 m and 2000 m buffers), and managed production forests beyond the buffer areas. We used generalized additive mixed models to test for differences in temporal trends of disturbance intensity among these management categories. We found that disturbance intensity was increasing in all management categories during the studied period. The increase was more pronounced in the managed forests (compound annual disturbance rate 1.76% year(-1)) and the 2000 m buffer (2.21% year(-1)) than in the strict reserves (0.58% year(-1)). The predicted cumulative disturbance during the 18-year period was 9.9% in the reserves and 30.5% in the 2000 m buffer. We found that forests in nature reserves can be more resistant to disturbances than forests managed for timber production, despite management efforts to control disturbances in managed forests. Our findings can help reconcile the different perceptions of natural disturbances and their management in Central Europe and support climate-adapted management strategies that consider natural disturbances as an indispensable component of ecosystem dynamics.

TI  - From Georges Sorel to Peter Costello: Peter Coleman and the Making of Australian Liberal Conservatism
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Peter Coleman was the most significant intellectual advocate of a liberal-conservative politics in Australia from the mid-twentieth century well into the early twenty-first century. His worldview drew upon John Anderson, Michael Oakeshott, and Georges Sorel rather than Edmund Burke or John Stuart Mill. Coleman's work demonstrates that Australian liberal-conservatism is not a coalition but a fusion in which liberal and conservative concepts were translated into a programme for political action. Coleman argued that neoconservatism, in particular the examples of Irving Kristol and Edward Shils, best represented this fusion, but Coleman was also drawn to the traditionalist conservatism of James McAuley. This article applies a morphological approach, as pioneered by Michael Freeden, to the analysis of Coleman's ideological position and focuses on his understandings of liberty, order, and progress. It not only draws upon Coleman's Masters' dissertation upon Sorel, his published writings, parliamentary speeches, but also considers his performance as a government minister and Liberal Party leader in New South Wales and his influence upon Peter Costello.

TI  - Water Resources in Africa: The Role of Earth Observation Data and Hydrodynamic Modeling to Derive River Discharge
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than a century, river discharge has been measured indirectly through observations of water level and flow velocity, but recently the number of gauging stations worldwide has decreased and the situation is particularly serious in African countries that suffer more than others from discontinuous and incomplete monitoring. As one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to extreme weather events and global warming, African countries need adequate and reliable monitoring. Decades of available Earth Observations data represent a tool complementary to the hydro-monitoring network and, in recent decades, they have demonstrated their potential, especially for data-poor regions. In this paper, a review of methods for hydrological and hydraulic modeling and for estimating river discharge by the use of satellite data, specifically radar altimetry and optical sensors, is provided, with particular focus on their role in the climate changes monitoring. More emphasis is placed on their relevance on African basins highlighting limits and advantages.

TI  - 1-km soil moisture retrieval using multi-temporal dual-channel SAR data from Sentinel-1 A/B satellites in a semi-arid watershed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable in agricultural and hydrological applications. Sentinel-1 (A/B) satellite provides high-resolution (similar to 10 m) synthetic aperture radar data, and its high revisit capability (6 days at the equator) with multi-track data provides great potential for global soil moisture monitoring. In this study, an algorithm was proposed for soil moisture retrieval using the Multi-Temporal Dual-Channel (MTDC) Sentinel-1 data. The MTDC algorithm first conducted an incidence angle normalization method based on time series data to normalize backscattering coefficients from multiple tracks. Subsequently, using the vegetation water content obtained through a vegetation index climatology, soil roughness and soil unfrozen water content could be estimated for the freezing period (unfrozen water content in the soil is assumed to be stable for January and December). The changes in total backscatter between successive observations were expressed as a function of the two-way vegetation transmissivity multiplied by the difference between soil backscatter, which was directly related to the changes in soil moisture. Considering the retrieved soil roughness as a constant for the entire year, and the average unfrozen water content as the initial soil moisture, the changes in and absolute values of soil moisture for each observation can be estimated by minimizing a cost function between the modeled and observed changes in total backscatter. Retrieval results were validated against the soil moisture network in a semi-arid watershed of Shandian River with an unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) of 0.06 cm(3).cm(-3), and a bias of-0.04 cm(3).cm(-3). With the initial soil moisture from in-situ measurements, a higher accuracy was achieved for the MTDC algorithm (ubRMSE = 0.06 cm(3).cm(-3); bias =-0.01 cm(3).cm(-3)). Further, comparisons with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced products further verified the efficacy of the proposed algorithm (ubRMSE = 0.03 cm(3).cm(-3); bias =-0.004 cm(3).cm(-3)), and demonstrated the feasibility of operational soil moisture products using the Sentinel-1 radar dataset.

TI  - Global mapping of the landside clustering of aquaculture ponds from dense time-series 10 m Sentinel-2 images on Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution information offers a valuable resource for the growing research on evaluating and managing aquaculture and the mechanism of its interaction with the environment, especially concerning landside clustering aquaculture ponds (LCAP). However, studies aimed at obtaining data on global LCAP distribution remains limited. This study combined edge detection and the morphology implemented on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to produce the first global spatial distribution data of LCAP using 4,015,054 tiles of the 10-m Sentinel-2 time-series images collected throughout 2020. The study findings showed a total area of global LCAP of 55,337.03 km2. Asia, led by China, had the highest distribution area of LCAP, accounting for 89.12 % of global LCAP. The main LCAP distribution area was the landside 30-km buffer region of coastline, accounting for 75.57 % of global LCAP. Meanwhile, the greatest proportion of LCAP (69.63 %) was located in China. Accuracy verification revealed that the precision and recall error of the results were 83.91 % and 92.49 % respectively, and F1 score was 0.88. A comparison of China, Vietnam, and India, based on data drawn from most of the existing local studies that used remote sensing methods, showed that these countries' aquaculture area differs by less than 10 %. Despite some variation from FAO statistics or official national statistics, the results of our remote sensingbased method show promise in such aspects as global coverage and temporal coherency when compared with the classical statistical method.

TI  - In-season crop type identification using optimal feature knowledge graph
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early or in-season crop type mapping using remote sensing data is important for crop managements to maximize crop yield. Existing remote sensing-based approaches in the literature rely mainly on the timing and temporal frequency of satellite data acquisition during a growing season to obtain optimal identification feature (OIF) to complete crop mapping. At present, the optimal features for mapping crop types are commonly generated by using different feature selection methods, and thereby are not generic in nature. In this paper, a novel approach based on the OIF knowledge graph is proposed for identification of crop types within the crop growing season. The concept of OIF was proposed based on the one-class classification and optimization theory, which relates a specific crop type to its OIF. The OIF knowledge graph can be created to describe the seasonal trend of OIF in a season. Eventually, the OIF knowledge graphs can be incorporated into the moment-preserving segmentation method to automatically identify crop types within the growing season. To evaluate the performance of the new method, crop mapping was conducted using 2019 Sentinel-2 data in Heilongjiang province, China, and Illinois, USA, respectively. Results demonstrate that integrating the OIF knowledge graph and moment-preserving thresholding method is effective in identifying crop types without ground-truth data. The overall accuracy higher than 90 % (Kappa coefficient greater than 0.90), and the producer's accuracies for corn, soybean, and rice are generally greater than 93 % in Heilongjiang province. The proposed approach has the advantage of simplifying crop identification process while maintaining a satisfactory identification accuracy in shorter time than conventional methods.

TI  - Designing augmentative and alternative communication systems with Aboriginal Australians: vocabulary representation, layout, and access
T2  - AUGMENTATIVE AND ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu (Aboriginal Australians of northeast Arnhem Land) are interested in developing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems in their own languages to support communication opportunities and participation for their family members living with Machado-Joseph disease. Designing AAC systems in Aboriginal languages requires consideration of unique linguistic and cultural elements. Participatory action research in strength-based communication contexts was carried out by YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu and Balanda (the YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu word for non-Aboriginal people) researchers working together through a collaborative intercultural process. Culturally responsive literacy, language, and AAC activities were used to develop four prototype YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu AAC sytems for YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu with varied literacy skills. Data were coded using gerunds to identify and focus on action in the data. Reflective and analytical collaborative, oral group discussions were used to identify key considerations and, ultimately, a YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu metaphor for the research. YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu language, culture and worldview impacted all aspects of prototype design and decision making. Salient considerations related to representation, organization, layout, and access, are presented. Clinical implications and future research considerations are outlined.

TI  - Assessment of interferometric coherence contribution to corn and soybean mapping with Sentinel-1 data time series
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This work aims to evaluate the added value of interferometric coherence to backscatter information of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems for soybean and corn mapping. First, SAR response to crop growth, and then accuracies for the classification using a combination of SAR variables were evaluated for scenarios that employ in-season or the entire season time series. Results showed that: i) using a single feature, the backscatter at vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization would be the most suitable variable; ii) the complementarity of coherence to single backscatter at vertical-vertical (VV) polarization was demonstrated, adding a significant contribution to late sown corns differentiation and iii) the combination of VV and VH backscatter would be the preferable variables for the proposed classification. In this case, the adding of coherence did not show a significant accuracy improvement, while a high computational cost is required. Finally, high general accuracies (until 90%) for early-season maps were achieved.

TI  - Characterizing the climate-phenology-hydrology associations in a subtropical forested watershed, central Taiwan
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Upstream forested watersheds supply critical ecosystem services through providing clean freshwater and maintaining stable hydrological conditions. Responses of vegetation phenology to climatic variations have vital implications for hydrological regimes that are region-specific, but the associations of climate-phenology-hydrology have rarely been examined especially in tropical/subtropical regions. In this study, we utilized 46-year (1975-2020) hydroclimate records in forested watershed at central Taiwan, and showed that precipita-tion and streamflow anomalies and incidences of meteorological and hydrological droughts are becoming prominent after 2001. We further investigated the effects of monthly temperature and precipitation on vege-tation growth using monthly EVI (enhanced vegetation index) of a watershed derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and explored the effects of seasonal precipitation on the variations of vegetation phenological and subsequent watershed streamflow between 2001 and 2020. The EVI and temper-ature showed a linear relationship without time-lag effect (R2 = 0.50, p < 0.001), whereas EVI and precipitation exhibited a log-linear relationship with 2-month lag (R2 = 0.40, p < 0.001), indicating the accumulation of rainfall during relatively dry period was crucial for vegetation growth. Structural equation modeling revealed that earlier start of growing season (SOS) caused by relatively high spring rainfall (February-March) led to longer growing season (LOS) and higher P-Q deficit (precipitation minus runoff) during the growing season. Never-theless, the large amount of precipitation during growing season has no effect on the end of growing season (EOS), LOS and P-Q deficit. Neither EOS has influence on LOS and P-Q deficit. Understanding the vegetation responses to climatic variations is required for future hydrologic regime projections, especially under changing climate.

TI  - Direct and indirect effects of management and landscape on biological pest control and crop pest infestation in apple orchards
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological pest control, relying on naturally occurring predator-prey dynamics, is considered a key element to achieve more sustainable farming systems. However, the combined effects of local management and landscape factors on communities of natural enemies as well as the cascading effects on pest infestations are rarely addressed, especially in perennial crops. Here, we used Piecewise Structural Equation Modelling (PSEM) to test direct and indirect effects of landscape composition, landscape configuration and local management practices on natural enemy communities, the pest control services they provide and ultimately on pest infestation and pest-related yield damage in apple crops. To this end, we surveyed 12 organic and 12 Integrated Pest Management (IPM) orchards during three consecutive years, and we also established a semi-natural benchmark to quantify the extent to which predator communities in the orchards were degraded. Natural enemies had a different community composition and were more abundant in organic orchards compared with IPM orchards. This had a small and positive effect on sentinel egg predation rates in organic orchards, but overall had very little impact on actual apple pest infestation. On the contrary, apple pest infestation levels were directly and positively affected by organic management practices and by increasing semi-natural habitat cover and landscape edge density. Compared with a semi-natural benchmark, both agricultural management systems showed degraded predator communities, which translated into an impaired delivery of biological control services. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that organic management and habitat conservation can enhance natural enemies and stimulate pest control, but also show that these factors can enhance pest infestations and can even lead to an overall increase in pest-related crop damage. Our study thus highlights the complex interplay of ecosystem services and disservices provided by biodiversity, which should be taken into account when advising farmers, policy makers and land managers on effective and sustainable strategies to control pest species and safeguard crop production.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Water stored in mountain snowpacks (i.e., snow water equivalent, SWE) represents an important but poorly characterized component of the terrestrial water cycle. The Western United States snow reanalysis (WUS-SR) dataset is novel in its combination of spatial resolution (similar to 500 m), spatial extent (31 degrees-49 degrees N; 102 degrees-125 degrees W), and temporal continuity (daily over 1985-2021). WUS-SR is generated using a Bayesian framework with model-based snow estimates updated through the assimilation of cloud-free Landsat fractional snow-covered area observations. Over the WUS, the peak SWE verification with independent in situ measurements show correlation coefficient, mean difference (MD), and root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 0.77, -0.15 m, and 0.28 m, respectively. The effects of forest cover and Landsat image availability on peak SWE are assessed. WUS-SR peak SWE is well correlated (ranging from 0.75 to 0.91) against independent lidar-derived SWE taken near April 1st, with MD <0.15 m and RMSD <0.38 m. The dataset is useful for characterizing WUS mountain snow storage, and ultimately for improving snow-derived water resources management.

TI  - Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron Model for Solar Radiation Prediction
T2  - COGNITIVE COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urgent transition from the dependence on fossil fuels towards renewable energies requires more solar photovoltaic power to be connected to the electricity grids, with reliable supply through accurate solar radiation forecasting systems. This study proposes an innovative hybrid method that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to generate global solar radiation (GSR) forecasts. The CMLP model first extracts optimal topological and structural features embedded in predictive variables through a CNN-based feature extraction stage followed by an MLP-based predictive model to generate the GSR forecasts. Predictive variables from observed data and global climate models (GCM) are used to predict GSR at six solar farms in Queensland, Australia. A hybrid-wrapper feature selection method using a random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) scheme is used to eradicate redundant predictor features to improve the proposed CMLP model efficiency. The CMLP model has been compared and bench-marked against seven artificial intelligence-based and seven temperature-based deterministic models, showing excellent performance at all solar energy study sites tested over daily, monthly, and seasonal scales. The proposed hybrid CMLP model should be explored as a viable modelling tool for solar energy monitoring and forecasting in real-time energy management systems.

AB  - Purpose Profit shifting is a matter of great concern for governments internationally. It leads to the loss of tax revenues and puts multinational corporations (MNCs) in a disparate position. Lately, due to the aggressive stance of the Indian taxman, several Indian MNCs are planning to minimise their tax outflows. This paper aims to study profit-shifting drawing from the institutional theory for the Indian MNCs. Design/methodology/approach The sample comprises 679 MNCs listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange or the National Stock Exchange with either Indian parents with foreign subsidiaries (553) or Indian subsidiaries of a foreign parent (126) for FY 2013-14 to FY 2018-19. A fixed-effect panel regression technique was invoked to examine tax rate differential motivated profit-shifting undertaken by MNCs with the moderating effect of international presence and patents. Findings The results suggest that MNCs shift their profits to take advantage of differences in global tax rates when they have an international presence in at least five tax countries. Further, profit shifting is likely towards no-tax compared to low-tax countries, with the presence of patents in an MNC group having no significant impact. Originality/value Losses to the government revenue due to profit shifting by MNCs are rather severe in emerging economies. The study provides the first empirical evidence of the direction of profit shifting with the moderating effect of the extent of global presence and group patents, which would interest scholars in the field. The findings provide valuable insights to the policymakers, highlighting the urgent need to operationalise the general anti-avoidance taxation rules.

TI  - Traversing Trauma: Resilient Women's Religious and Spiritual Stories of Hope and Strength
T2  - PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Public Significance Statement To adaptively cope following severe life events, Christian, Islamic, and Jewish women reported their reliance on religious and spiritual beliefs. Their beliefs in a Supreme Being were powerful, stabilizing, and beneficial forces. Because many women who experience trauma rely on their religious and spiritual beliefs, mental health professionals need to consider coping strategies that incorporate culturally sensitive religious and spiritual beliefs.For many individuals, religious and spiritual (R/S) beliefs are a central part of their worldview and provide substantial support when adapting to and coping with life's challenges. As mental health professionals provide supportive services, they must carefully consider ways to incorporate clients' R/S beliefs into culturally sensitive and responsive interventions. To gain insight into clients' adaptive coping when relying on R/S beliefs, this research explored the experiences of 39 women from Christian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions. Each of these individuals accessed their R/S beliefs to adaptively cope following a severe life event. Individual interviews (90-120 min) were conducted with each participant. Employing interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), a systematic review of interview transcripts revealed four common themes of reliance on R/S coping: (a) engaging in important relationships with others who also shared a strong R/S core belief system (CBS), (b) integrating R/S practices with psychological strategies, (c) experiencing and acknowledging divine intervention, and (d) reframing experiences through the use of R/S-oriented thoughts and beliefs. Regardless of religious denomination, participants reported similar R/S coping processes. Participants' reliance on R/S coping and a strong CBS in a Supreme Being were powerful, stabilizing, and beneficial forces. These findings suggest the importance of mental health professionals understanding, validating, and drawing upon clients' R/S beliefs, practices, and experiences. This article emphasizes the critical need to better prepare mental health professionals, who may feel insufficiently prepared, to incorporate R/S issues in therapy.

TI  - Clinical translational barriers against nanoparticle-based imaging agents
T2  - ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Nanoparticle based imaging agents (NIAs) have been intensively explored in bench studies. Unfortunately, only a few cases have made their ways to clinical translation. In this review, clinical trials of NIAs were investigated for understanding possible barriers behind that. First, the complexity of mul-tifunctional NIAs is considered a main barrier because it brings uncertainty to batch-to-batch fabrication, and results in sophisticated in vivo behaviors. Second, inadequate biosafety studies slow down the trans-lational work. Third, NIA uptake at disease sites is highly heterogeneous, and often exhibits poor targeting efficiency. Focusing on the aforementioned problems, key design parameters were analyzed including NIAs' size, composition, surface characteristics, dosage, administration route, toxicity, whole-body distri-bution and clearance in clinical trials. Possible strategies were suggested to overcome these barriers. Besides, regulatory guidelines as well as scale-up and reproducibility during manufacturing process were covered as they are also key factors to consider during clinical translation of NIAs.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Automated mapping of glacial lakes using multisource remote sensing data and deep convolutional neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of glacial lakes are a precursor to glacier retreat, ice mass loss, velocity, and potential risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF). The current state of the art for glacial lake mapping, especially in a high mountainous region, is limited to manual or semi-automated threshold-based methods. Here, we propose a fully automated novel approach for glacial lake mapping using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and remote sensing data originating from various sources. A combination of these multisource remote sensing data (i. e., multispectral, thermal, microwave, and a Digital Elevation Model) is fed to the fully connected DCNN. The DCNN architecture, namely GLNet, is designed by choosing an optimum number and size of convolutional layers, filters, and other hyperparameters. Our proposed GLNet is trained on 660 images covering twelve sites spread across diverse climatic and topographic regions of the Himalaya. The robustness of the model is tested over three sites in the Eastern Himalaya and one site in the Western Himalaya. The classification results outperform the existing state-of-the-art datasets by achieving 0.98 accuracy, 0.95 precision, 0.95 recall, and 0.95 F- score over the test data. The results over test sites (F-score test site1: 0.91, test site 2: 0.80, test site3: 0.97, and test site4: 0.70) showed promising results and spatiotemporal transferability of the proposed method. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between GLNet predicted lake boundaries and reference lake boundaries exhibits excellent results (0.90). The study provides proof of concept for automated glacial mapping for large geographical regions via integrated capabilities of deep convolutional neural networks and multisource remote sensing data.

TI  - Effects of auxiliary and ancillary data on LULC classification in a heterogeneous environment using optimized random forest algorithm
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) maps, providing crucial information for monitoring the Earth's surface, are one of the most essential products for numerous studies. Using only the spectral information in the classification process might cause poor performances in the areas with heterogeneous landscape characteristics. To overcome this problem, auxiliary and ancillary data are usually employed to improve classification accuracy. The objective of this study is to integrate auxiliary data (topographic and climatic features) and ancillary data (spectral indices and texture measures) into spectral bands of Sentinel-2A imagery and evaluate the performances of advanced feature selection methods. In this context, genetic algorithm-based random forest (GA-RF), HSIC-Lasso, and Relief-F feature selection approaches were utilized to determine the most informative features for the classification process from a high-dimensional dataset consisting of 102 features. Whilst the GA-RF algorithm selected 65 features, HSIC-Lasso chose 38 features, and Relief-F determined 51 features as ideal subsets. These feature subsets together with the whole data were inputted into a supervised classification process using the random forest (RF) classifier, whose parameters were optimized using random search algorithm. The highest overall accuracy of the produced thematic maps was estimated as 91.05% for the subset determined by the HSIC-Lasso algorithm, which was also the fastest algorithm (5.71 s). McNemar's statistical significance test confirmed the superiority of the HSIC-Lasso method over the GA-RF and Relief-F algorithms. SHapley Additive exPlanations method was also applied to analyze the relative importance of a feature according to the model output.

TI  - Identification and analysis of long-term changes in river deltas and riparian zones using time-series multispectral data
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Today's remote sensing data and technologies offer the capability to effectively monitor diverse and challenging environments around the world, such as coastal river and riparian zones. Coastal riparian zones and river deltas usually demonstrate extreme coastline changes in terms of the extent of water coverage of inland territories due to flood events, low and high tides, the climate, specific environmental characteristics, etc. In this paper, we exploit freely available multispectral time series data for previous decades, utilizing Landsat missions in order to develop an open-source-based image processing pipeline for the extraction of the actual yearly average coastline status of riparian river delta areas. The latter present significant temporal coastline changes between years, semesters, and months. Average mean maps are generated and then compared to several temporal levels in order to distinguish long-term significant changes and ecosystem threats. Additionally, a custom long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is deployed to forecast the evolution of the coastline by exploiting the average value for each pixel across all available images as a training sample and producing a forecast output for the next period. The network achieves accuracy scores of 89.77% over 'non-water' depicting pixels and 84.26% over 'water' depicting pixels, for regions that present frequent changes between land and water coverage over time. The predicted map presents high statistical agreement with the respective average map generated in two different validation approaches, with kappa coefficients of 85.9% and 91.4%, respectively.

TI  - Estimating the burden of foodborne gastroenteritis due to nontyphoidal <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, <i>Shigella</i> and <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> in China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - To estimate the incidence of foodborne gastroenteritis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in China, population surveys and sentinel hospital surveillance were implemented in six provinces from July 2010 to July 2011, and a multiplier calculation model for the burden of disease was constructed. The multiplier for salmonellosis and V. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis was estimated at 4,137 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2,320-5,663], and for shigellosis at 4,356 (95% CI 2,443-5,963). Annual incidence per 100,000 population was estimated as 245 (95% CI 138-336), 67 (95% CI 38-92), and 806 (95% CI 452-1,103) for foodborne salmonellosis, shigellosis, and V. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis, respectively, indicating that foodborne infection caused by these three pathogens constitutes an important burden to the Chinese healthcare system. Continuous implementation of active surveillance of foodborne diseases, combined with multiplier models to estimate disease burden, makes it possible for us to better understand food safety status in China.

TI  - Extraction of rocky desertification information in karst area by using different multispectral sensor data and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis method
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a typical form of land degradation, karst rocky desertification seriously restricts the development of the regional social economy and seriously threatens the living environment of residents. Fractional vegetation cover (f(VC)) and bare rock fraction (f(BR)) are important indicators to identify and evaluate rocky desertification. However, it is a great challenge to obtain f(VC) and f(BR) due to the complex terrain and fragmentation of karst rocky desertification areas. In this study, comparisons between Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (Sentinel-2), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (Landsat-8), and GF-6 Wide Field View (GF-6) sensors for retrieving f(VC) and f(BR) are presented. The multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) and measured spectral dates were used to overcome the limitations of Spectral mixture analysis (SMA). Subsequently, f(VC) and f(BR) were validated using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R (2)). The results showed that: 1) Sentinel-2 performed best in estimating f(VC) and obtained the highest accuracy (R (2) = 0.6259, root mean square error = 0.1568, mean absolute error = 0.1215), followed by GF-6 and Landsat 8; in the extraction of the f(BR), the performance was relatively the same, and the implementation of Sentinel-2 was also the best (R2 = 0.4911, root mean square error = 0.0714, mean absolute error = 0.0539), followed by GF-6 and Landsat 8. 2) Sentinel-2 images have higher resolution, the narrowest band range, and the most significant number of bands, which can better extract information about f(VC) and f(BR) in rocky desertification areas. 3) For the three optical sensors, the spatial resolution of the images is more important to extract the information of f(VC) and f(BR) in the rocky desertification areas. 4) In general, the extraction accuracy of f(BR) is not as good as that of f(VC). The complicated ecological and geological environment of decertified areas has more influence on the effect of extraction of the f(BR). 5) The Sentinel-2 achieves high accuracy for both f(VC) and f(BR) under different-level application scenarios. It thus has great potential for application in rocky desertification information extraction.

TI  - Detection of marine oil spills from radar satellite images for the coastal risk assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems offer substantial support and space for the sustainable development of human society, and hence the ecological risk evaluation of coastal ecosystems is of great significance. In this article, we propose an innovative framework for evaluating coastal ecological risk by considering oil spill risk information and envi-ronmental vulnerability information. Specifically, a deep learning based marine oil spill monitoring method is presented to obtain the oil spill risk information from Sentinel-1 polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. The environmental vulnerability information is then obtained from biological sample data and habitat information. Finally, a weighted probability model is introduced to utilize the oil spill risk and environmental vulnerability information, to evaluate the coastal ecological risk. In the experimental part, the proposed oil spill monitoring method shows its reliability in global ocean areas, and the proposed model is adopted to evaluate the ecological risk in Jiaozhou Bay, China. The results show that the ecological situation of more than half of the areas in Jiaozhou Bay is unstable, and the areas with high risk are mainly concentrated in the ports, shipping channels, and those areas with high biodiversity. This study provides some new perspectives on ecological risk assessment for coastal ecosystems, facilitating the planning process and the actions to be taken in response to the accidents that occur in the ocean, especially oil spill accidents.

TI  - Conservative axillary surgery is emerging in the surgical management of breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been the standard axillary treatment for breast cancer for a long time. However, ALND is associated with postoperative morbidities, including local sensory dysfunction, reduced shoulder mobility and most notably arm lymphedema. Recently, ALND can be avoided not only in clinically node-negative (cN0) patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), but also in patients with less than 3 positive SLNs receiving breast radiation, axillary radiation, or a combination of the two. Moreover, SLN biopsy has been adopted for use in clinically node-positive (cN +) patients presenting as cN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC); ALND may be avoided in cN + patients who convert to SLN-negative following NAC. Patients who undergo SLN biopsy alone have less postsurgical morbidities than those who undergo ALND. Nevertheless, ALND is still required in a select group of patients. A variety of conservative approaches to ALND have been developed to spare arm lymphatics to minimize arm lymphedema. These conservative procedures seem to decrease the incidence of lymphedema without increasing axillary recurrence. In the era of effective multimodality therapy, full conventional ALND removing all microscopic axillary disease may now be unnecessary in both cN0 patients and cN + patients. Regardless, emerging procedures for ALND should still be considered as investigational approaches, as further studies with longer follow-up are necessary to determine the safety of conservative ALND to spare arm lymphatics.

TI  - Oil palm trees detection and counting on Microsoft Bing Maps Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) data using image processing thresholding approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Palm oil is one of the highest producing vegetable oil crops globally, with production increasing rapidly over the last 40 years from 5 million tonnes in 1980 to 74.5 million tonnes in 2019. This increase in production is in line with the high demand for vegetable oils worldwide. The accurate monitoring and statistics of oil palm plantation data are essential to support effective and efficient decision-making. However, the most commonly adopted data collection still uses conventional methods, i.e., field surveys, which are highly dependent on the massive amount of human resources, cost, processing time, and difficulty reaching remote areas. Remote sensing using satellite and UAV imagery can be an alternative in data collection due to its distinct advantages with a more efficient labor force, affordable cost, shorter time updates, and covering areas that are difficult to reach. In this work, we investigate the utilization of remote sensing data from Microsoft Bing Maps Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data using the image processing thresholding method for detecting and counting oil palm trees. The combination of Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) conversion, the Otsu seg-mentation thresholding, and contours detection and counting methods are used in our approach to enhance the accuracy of captured features of oil palm trees. The detection results are further categorized into best-case, average-case, and worst-case detection to comprehend the challenging real-world situation, based on the qual-ity of captured imageries and model prediction results. Our proposed approach achieves better and more promising results when using UAV image data. This is indicated by an average true-positive rate (TPR) of 88 to 97% in best-case data input, 70 to 81% in average-case data input, 30 to 53% in worst-case data input, and 10% in estimation error. Meanwhile, Bing image data provides an average true-positive rate (TPR) of 9 to 13% in the best-case data input, 5 to 6% in the average-case data input, and 1 to 3% in the worst-case data input, with an average estimation error up to 78%. Overall, our proposed approach can perform the oil palm trees detection and counting. We also suggest that higher resolution imagery than Microsoft Bing maps or single utilization of UAV data can be considered input for better results. Our study could further be beneficial in providing more scalable and accurate plantation statistics.

TI  - Importance of color for artificial clay caterpillars as sentinel prey in maize, soybean, and prairie
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of artificial clay caterpillars to measure predation pressure under real field conditions is one method that has garnered recent support for quantifying ecosystem services that beneficial insects provide. Here, we focus on color and ask whether it is an important variable that should be considered in studies using clay caterpillars as sentinel prey. We deployed a total of 1920 brown, cream, green, gray, terracotta, and white clay caterpillars onto maize, soybean, and prairie plants to test if lighter colored caterpillars will be attacked and retrieved more than caterpillars with darker colors. As hypothesized, color was a significant predictor with green and terracotta caterpillars performing best, whereas brown and gray caterpillars performed the worst. Interestingly, clay caterpillars were also attacked proportionally to the number of insects in the surrounding habitat. Combined, we suggest artificial clay caterpillars could be useful for rapid ecosystem function assessments, but only when their color is considered.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Huangtai algal blooms are key indicators of eutrophication and lake-ecosystem damage. Understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of their growth is critical for preserving the ecological environment. The dimidiate pixel model is commonly used to estimate vegetation coverage; however, indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index have not been specifically constructed for the Huangtai algae spectrum and thus are not specific or sufficiently precise for use as indicators. Therefore, we propose a new dimidiate pixel model based on a novel additive vegetation index to calculate the Huangtai algal coverage for each pixel using Landsat multispectral satellite images with 30-m resolution. The results showed that the additive vegetation index with R-2 = 0.994 is a better indicator than the normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetative index, and ratio vegetative index, with the accuracy of the new model reaching 86.61%. Monthly Landsat images from 2006 to 2016 were used to calculate the Huangtai algal coverage. Analysis of the inter-monthly variation indicated increased coverage from May to July, with an annual maximum and minimum of 14.43% and 0.33% in 2008 and 2013, respectively. This study provides a new reference map of Huangtai algal cover, which is important for monitoring and protecting the Lake Ulansuhai environment.

TI  - Optical classification of an urbanized estuary using hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical water classification based on remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(.)) data can provide insight into water components driving optical variability and inform the development and application of bio-optical algorithms in complex aquatic systems. In this study, we use an in situ dataset consisting of hyperspectral Rrs(.) and other biogeochemical and optical parameters collected over nearly five years across a heavily urbanized estuary, the Long Island Sound (LIS), east of New York City, USA, to optically classify LIS waters based on Rrs(.) spectral shape. We investigate the similarities and differences of discrete groupings (k-means clustering) and continuous spectral indexing using the Apparent Visible Wavelength (AVW) in relation to system biogeochemistry and water properties. Our Rrs(.) dataset in LIS was best described by three spectral clusters, the first two accounting for the majority (89%) of Rrs(.) observations and primarily driven by phytoplankton dynamics, with the third confined to measurements in river and river plume waters. We found AVW effective at tracking subtle changes in Rrs(.) spectral shape and fine-scale water quality features along river-to-ocean gradients. The recently developed Quality Water Index Polynomial (QWIP) was applied to evaluate three different atmospheric correction approaches for satellite-derived Rrs(.) from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensor in LIS, finding Polymer to be the preferred approach. Our results suggest that integrative, continuous indices such as AVW can be effective indicators to assess nearshore biogeochemical variability and evaluate the quality of both in situ and satellite bio-optical datasets, as needed for improved ecosystem and water resource management in LIS and similar regions.

TI  - Clinical management of melanocytic tumours of uncertain malignant potential (MelTUMPs), including melanocytomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Little guidance is currently available for managing patients with melanocytic tumours of uncertain or low malignant potential (MelTUMPs, including melanocytomas), in particular the optimal excision margins and whether to offer sentinel node biopsy (SNB). The objective of this review was to evaluate excision margins and the prognostic utility of SNB by systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched to October 2021 for studies of patients with MelTUMPs reporting excision margins and/or SNB-positivity. Meta-analysis was performed on the SNB-positivity rate using a random effects model, followed by sensitivity analyses on subgroups. 111 primary studies reported excision margins and/or SNB data for 1962 patients. Follow-up was available for 1649 patients: 1561 (94.7%) were alive without disease at last review, 53 (3.2%) had developed further disease, 29 (1.8%) had died of metastatic disease (melanoma) and six (0.4%) died of unrelated causes. SNB was performed in 837 patients. The pooled positivity rate on meta-analysis was 32% (95% CI: 23-44%). Clinical outcome could be correlated with excision margin in only 171 patients (60% of those with known follow up) and was therefore not analysed further. Evidence indicating the ideal excision margins for MelTUMPs was lacking. SNB had a high positivity rate despite very low rates of recurrence or melanoma-related death. Consequently, SNB should not be offered routinely for MelTUMPs (including melanocytomas), due to its lack of prognostic utility for this tumour type (high certainty of evidence).

TI  - A revision of NASA SeaDAS atmospheric correction algorithm over turbid waters with artificial Neural Networks estimated remote-sensing reflectance in the near-infrared br
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For atmospheric correction over turbid waters, due to non-negligible water-leaving radiance (Lw) in the near -infrared (NIR), measurements in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) are usually required to achieve reliable remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). But several ocean color satellite sensors, such as the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of -view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and other small satellites, have no bands in the SWIR domain. We here present an at-mospheric correction algorithm (termed as ACANIR-NN) based on NASA SeaDAS (version 7.5.3), which can achieve atmospheric correction seamlessly over clear and turbid waters, even for sensors having no spectral bands in SWIR. Specifically, ACANIR-NN uses estimated Rrs(NIR) from available Rrs in the visible bands with a specifically designed artificial Neural Networks to carry out atmospheric correction, and the performance of ACANIR-NN is evaluated over eight coastal locations having ground measurements by the Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) system. It is found that the Mean Absolute Percent Difference (MAPD) of Rrs retrievals by ACANIR-NN for this dataset is smaller by a factor of two or more than that by the standard SeaDAS algorithm (termed as ACANIR-bio) for each band, especially for Rrs(412) and Rrs(443), which is 7.5% and 7.7%, respectively, from ACANIR-NN, but they are 44.0% and 27.5% from ACANIR-bio. We further demonstrated the applicability of ACANIR-NN to SeaWiFS measurements over turbid waters, where consistent Rrs products were also obtained compared to that generated from the same-day MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) measurements using SWIR bands. These results indicate that ACANIR-NN can generate reliable Rrs over turbid coastal areas, as well as clear ocean waters, for sensors having no SWIR bands.

TI  - Multiple traces of monkeypox detected in non-sewered wastewater with sparse sampling from a densely populated metropolitan area in Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The monkeypox virus is excreted in the feces of infected individuals. Therefore, there is an interest in using viral load detection in wastewater for sentinel early surveillance at a community level and as a complementary approach to syndromic surveillance. We collected wastewater from 63 sewered and non-sewered locations in Bangkok city center between May and August 2022. Monkeypox viral DNA copy numbers were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed positive by Sanger sequencing. Monkeypox viral DNA was first detected in waste-water from the second week of June 2022, with a mean copy number of 16.4 copies/ml (n = 3). From the first week of July, the number of viral DNA copies increased to a mean copy number of 45.92 copies/ml. Positive samples were Sanger sequenced and confirmed the presence of the monkeypox virus. Our study is the first to detect monkeypox viral DNA in wastewater from various locations within Thailand. Results suggest that this could be a complementary source for detecting viral DNA and predicting upcoming outbreaks.

TI  - Bayesian atmospheric correction over land: Sentinel-2/MSI and Landsat 8/OLI
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigating the impact of atmospheric effects on optical remote sensing data is critical for monitoring intrinsic land processes and developing Analysis Ready Data (ARD). This work develops an approach to this for the NERC NCEO medium resolution ARD Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel 2 (S2) products, called Sensor Invariant Atmospheric Correction (SIAC). The contribution of the work is to phrase and solve that problem within a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework for medium resolution multispectral sensors S2/MSI and L8/OLI and to provide per-pixel uncertainty estimates traceable from assumed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurement uncertainty, making progress towards an important aspect of CEOS ARD target requirements.A set of observational and a priori constraints are developed in SIAC to constrain an estimate of coarse resolution (500 m) aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and total column water vapour (TCWV), along with associated uncertainty. This is then used to estimate the medium resolution (10-60 m) surface reflectance and uncertainty, given an assumed uncertainty of 5% in TOA reflectance. The coarse resolution a priori constraints used are the MODIS MCD43 BRDF/Albedo product, giving a constraint on 500m surface reflectance, and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) operational forecasts of AOT and TCWV, providing estimates of atmospheric state at core 40 km spatial resolution, with an associated 500m resolution spatial correlation model. The mapping in spatial scale between medium resolution observations and the coarser resolution constraints is achieved using a calibrated effective point spread function for MCD43. Efficient approximations (emulators) to the outputs of the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer code are used to estimate the state parameters in the atmospheric correction stage.SIAC is demonstrated for a set of global S2 and L8 images covering AERONET and RadCalNet sites. AOT retrievals show a very high correlation to AERONET estimates (correlation coefficient around 0.86, RMSE of 0.07 for both sensors), although with a small bias in AOT. TCWV is accurately retrieved from both sensors (correlation coefficient over 0.96, RMSE < 0.32 g cm(-2)). Comparisons with in situ surface reflectance measurements from the RadCalNet network show that SIAC provides accurate estimates of surface reflectance across the entire spectrum, with RMSE mismatches with the reference data between 0.01 and 0.02 in units of reflectance for both S2 and L8. For near-simultaneous S2 and L8 acquisitions, there is a very tight relationship (correlation coefficient over 0.95 for all common bands) between surface reflectance from both sensors, with negligible biases. Uncertainty estimates are assessed through discrepancy analysis and are found to provide viable estimates for AOT and TCWV. For surface reflectance, they give conservative estimates of uncertainty, suggesting that a lower estimate of TOA reflectance uncertainty might be appropriate.

TI  - Photothermoelastic survey with memory-dependent response for a rotating solid cylinder under varying heat flux via dual phase lag model
T2  - PRAMANA-JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the effects of plasma and heat on semiconductor structures involves simulating a complex system using simultaneous analysis of heat waves, carrier densities and elastic wave equations. Despite the paramount importance of this subject, it still lacks further research and investigation due to the paucity of research work that has been conducted. This paper investigates plasma-photothermoelastic interactions in isotropic and homogeneous semiconductor solids using a novel generalised thermoelasticity model. The model is constructed on the basis of the concept of memory-dependent derivative (MDD) dual-phase lag thermoelasticity and coupled plasma-thermal wave equation. By employing the proposed model, the transient response of a semiconducting solid cylinder rotating axially in an applied magnetic field and subjected to time-dependent heat flux was investigated. The Laplace transform technique was used to solve the derived system of equations and to obtain the different domains, and the numerical results were graphically displayed. The effects of time delay, kernel function and rotation were examined. The obtained numerical results were also compared with different models of thermoelasticity with MDD.

TI  - An Integrated Approach of Soil-Erosion Modeling for Soil and Water Conservation Planning in a Degraded Semi-Arid Environment of Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopian Highlands
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion by water is a severe problem in the Sub-Saharan African countries (e.g., Ethiopia) due to poor soil and water conservation (SWC) planning and implementation. Through the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Soil Loss Tolerance (SLT) index supported with remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) and expert knowledge, we investigated the net mean annual soil loss (NSL) and SLT for planning SWC along different agro-climatic zones, and geomorphic features in Seharti-Samre district, Tigray-northern Ethiopian Highlands. Satellite and ground observed data sets, such as Digital Elevation Model, Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI), soil, and climate were collected and processed using geo-spatial softwares. The findings revealed that the estimated mean NSL and SLT in the study area are 86.8 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 6.8 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Besides, the study found that the NSL and SLT rates for lowland, midland and highland areas are 178.4 and 3.5 t ha(-1) y(-1); 72.8 and 7.4 t ha(-1) y(-1); and 44.1 and 7.5 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. The statistical relationship between NSL and SLT at pixel level in the study area is negative (r = - 0.038) at p < 0.001. The quantitative analysis and modeling of NSL and SLT have a paramount significance at district or watershed level to implement better SWC practices for reducing soil erosion and maximizing land productivity in a degraded semi-arid environment.

TI  - The Symbolic Boundary Work of Incels: Subcultural Negotiation of Meaning and Identity Online
T2  - DEVIANT BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the boundary work of incels (involuntary celibates), to counter negative media coverage and online ridicule. Attempting to claim rational status, incels have created alternative information channels that reframe their situation of involuntary celibacy as a legitimate life circumstance. I examine the symbolic boundaries within the incel subculture, using the Incel Wikipedia page as a specialized encyclopedia for their online milieu. After describing the incel worldview and subcultural identity, I analyze how incels engage in boundary work to differentiate and solidify their status - categorizing themselves and other people. The article draws on theories of narrative and cultural criminology to present how incels negotiate their identity by establishing symbolic boundaries that exclude out-groups such as women, sexually successful men, and mainstream society. It concludes by considering how boundaries within the in-group are based on degrees of inceldom, gender, and violent actors. As a site of resistance, the boundary work of the incel wiki reveals how the social incel identity is formed and given meaning by contrast to symbolic others. I argue that narrative and cultural criminology can help us unravel the online ecosystem by analyzing the negotiation of external and internal subcultural boundaries.

TI  - Study on the relationship between welding force and defects in bobbin tool friction stir welding
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the characteristics of traverse force (Fx), lateral force (Fy), and axial force (Fz) in bobbin tool friction stir welding (BTFSW) and their relationship with welding defects were studied. Fx, Fy, and Fz showed periodic oscillations and had sinusoidal waveforms in defect-free joints. Defect formation strongly influenced the variation of welding force, and Fy increased most noticeably in defective joints. The average value of Fy determined whether defects occurred in the weld. The material flow behavior during defect formation was analyzed and it was demonstrated that an increase in Fy was due to severe material deposition on the retreating side (RS), which significantly increased the extrusion force between the pin and the workpiece. Due to the good correlation between welding force and defects, a decision tree model based on the force features in the time and frequency domain was built to predict the welding defects. The accuracy of this model in predicting defects reached 95.3 %. Furthermore, the prediction results showed that Fy was the most sensitive force to the generation of defects, and the average value of Fy was the key feature in predicting whether defects occurred.

M3  - Article
AB  - For Terry Wood, the personal and professional were seamlessly connected. In her "House with the Blue Door" graduate students and visiting scholars lived; people gathered for conversations and music; the community reflected and found connections between important ideas. This chapter sets the stage for the special issue by contextualizing Terry's personal and professional life with anecdotes shared during the May 2021 Terry Wood Memorial Event. We see how she conceptualized knowledge development as a collective enterprise, putting into practice this worldview as a basis for life and for advancing the field of mathematics education. This reflexive relationship between theory and practice informed a body of powerful scholarship that continues to shape the field. Less recognized-and perhaps more importantly-these stories, and the subsequent chapters, reveal how Terry's investment in teachers, graduate students and colleagues resulted in the growth and development of scholars and teachers across multiple countries and continents.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics, etiology and hemagglutinin (HA) gene characteristics of prevalent strains in Shandong Province from 2021 to 2022. Methods: The sentinel surveillance data of influenza-like illness (ILI) were collected in Shandong Province from 2021 to 2022. ILI specimens were detected with Real-Time PCR and virus isolation to explore the distribution of influenza viruses in different months. Three virus strains of each city were selected for gene sequencing, and the HA phylogenetic analysis was carried out. Results: In the surveillance-year from 2021 to 2022, 528 263 ILI cases were totally reported in 54 sentinel hospitals for influenza surveillance in Shandong Province. ILI visiting ratio (ILI%) was 4.07%, with the largest number in 0-4 age group (45.86%). The highly frequent season for ILI was in winter and spring, with a peak in the 52nd week, 2021 (6.62%). Totally, nucleic acid was detected in 26 754 specimens, with a positive rate of 27.10%, all of which were type B Victoria influenza. The positive rate reached a peak in the 49th week, 2021 (63.78%). A total of 295 outbreaks of ILI had been reported, in which 269 were positive for influenza virus. Most of outbreaks occurred in the primary school, with a peak in December. Gene evolution analysis showed that the HA gene in Shandong possessed high homology, 98.6% to 99.5%, with the recommended vaccine strains in 2020-2023, which was divided into two branches, V1A.3a.1 and V1A.3a.2. Conclusion: In the surveillance-year of 2021-2022, influenza is prevalent in December in Shandong Province, with a single circulating strain type. The positive rate of influenza virus and outbreak are higher than those in the previous surveillance-year. The circulating strain possesses high HA gene homology with those of the WHO vaccine recommended strains. However, the overall immune barrier of influenza virus is weak.
AB  - 目的： 分析20212022年度山东省流感流行分布特征、流行毒株病原学及其血凝素（HA）基因特性。 方法： 收集20212022年度山东省流感样病例（ILI）哨点监测数据，进行描述性分析；采用荧光定量PCR核酸检测、病毒分离方法对采集的ILI标本开展检测，分析不同时间流感病毒的分布，按每市选取3株病毒进行基因测序，进行HA基因进化分析。 结果： 20212022年度，山东省54所流感监测哨点医院共报告ILI 528 263例，ILI就诊比例为4.07%，0~4岁ILI最多，为45.86%；呈冬春季流行高峰，最高峰为2021年第52周（6.62%）。共对26 754份标本开展了核酸检测，阳性率27.10%，均为B型Victoria系流感病毒，PCR阳性率高峰为2021年第49周（63.78%）；共报告ILI聚集性或暴发疫情295起，经实验室确诊269起为流感病毒阳性，以小学发生的疫情为主，2021年12月份报告疫情数最多。基因进化分析显示：HA基因与20202023年度推荐的疫苗株遗传距离均较近，介于98.6%~99.5%，且分成2个分支（V1A.3a.1，V1A.3a.2）。 结论： 20212022年度，山东省流感流行高峰在12月，毒株型别单一，流感病毒阳性率和暴发疫情报告数均较高，毒株与WHO疫苗推荐株HA基因同源性较好，但整体上流感病毒群体免疫屏障较弱。.

TI  - Monthly geographically weighted regression between climate and vegetation in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa: Clustering pattern shifts and biome-dependent accuracies
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides cost-effective and unbiased data and thus is ideal for assessing climate-vegetation relationships. Such relationships can be quantified using geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to account for variations of the relationships across space. This approach was applied in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa that is rich in biodiversity hosting 10 of the country's 11 biomes. The study aimed to determine if the GWR accuracy for relating Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) with rainfall and Land Sur-face Temperature (LST) shows an optimal pattern with time and space. and to explore if the correlation of EVI with rainfall and LST varies with biome type. Monthly data cover-ing February 20 0 0 to December 2017 were used for the three variables. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was greater than 0.5 for 75% of the locations, with month-to-month change of R 2 exceeding 25% for many locations. Optimized Hot Spot Analysis returned well-defined broad clusters of high and low R 2 values separated by clusters of randomly distributed R 2 values. These clusters shifted with month, further stressing the benefit of modelling at the monthly scale. Assessment of R 2 by biome showed the importance of biomes in characterizing GWR of climate and vegetation, with better correlations found in low biodiversity (Succulent Karoo and Nama-Karoo biomes) than in higher biodiversity (Forest and Indian Ocean Coastal Belt biomes) zones. Further, the estimation residuals of the Forest Biome varied significantly from 3 to 5 other biomes across the year indicating the complex interaction of this biome with rainfall and LST. The study encourages further research by using high temporal resolution data for detailed monitoring within the GWR framework.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Modelling and Assessing the Spatiotemporal Changes to Future Land Use Change Scenarios Using Remote Sensing and CA-Markov Model in the Mellegue Catchment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The watershed of Mellegue, which covers 10,500 km(2), is a common area for Algeria and Tunisia. The catchment was chosen to evaluate land use/land cover changes (LULC) from 2002 to 2021, and to predict future LULC changes. Landsat images (ETM + and OLI-TIRS) and other ancillary data were used for the analysis and mapping of the LULC changes. Supervised classified maps were used later as inputs for the CA-Markov model to predict future LULC changes. Five LULC classes were identified: waterbody, bare ground, farmland, urban area and forest. Many changes have occurred in the study area where LULC changes have been influenced by many factors like agricultural expansion, population growth, shifting cultivation and other anthropogenic events (fire risk, industrial and urban development). Generally, substantial LULC changes still happen in the future. Hence, the land use prediction plan is substantial to sustain the resources of the Mellegue catchment and to halt land conservation.

TI  - Reconstruction of the depletion process of lake water resources in semi -arid areas under strong human activities Taking Lake Daihai as an example
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous loss of lake water resources has become one of the main problems affecting the economic and social development in semi-arid areas. However, due to the lack of long-term continuous monitoring data of lake dynamics, the process of lake water resources loss and its relationship with climate change and economic and social development in this area have not been evaluated in detail. To solve this problem, this paper takes Lake Daihai, which is located in a semi-arid area, as the research object, using the improved normalized difference water body index to extract the boundary of lake water body from 258 Landsat remote sensing images from 1986 to 2020, and reconstructs the dynamic change process of water resources in Lake Daihai for last 60 years by integrating lake water level data. The results show that from 1961 to 2019, the Lake Daihai shrank sharply, and the lake water volume decreased by 9.88x10(8) m(3). At the same time, the fitting results of the piecewise function of the water volume change trend show that the water volume change of Lake Daihai can be divided into three stages: from 1961 to 1978, the slow loss stage with the water loss rate of 0.726x10(7) m(3)/a; from 1979 to 2004, the rapid loss stage with the water loss rate of 2.10x10(7) m(3)/a; from 2005 to 2019, the accelerated loss stage with the water loss rate of 3.39x10(7) m(3)/a. Correlation analysis shows that the loss of water volume of Lake Daihai is closely related to the economic and social development of the river basin. Among them, the increase in the scale and intensity of agricultural development and utilization in the watershed after the reform and opening-up is the main reason for the loss of water volume of the Lake Daihai; the rise of the industrial economy after the implementation of the " Western Development" strategy accelerated the loss of water volume of the Lake Daihai. Accordingly, this study suggests that the economic and social development of lake basins in arid and semi-arid regions should be coordinated with their water resource carrying capacity.

TI  - The succession of submerged vegetation in the northern part of Lake Fuxian and its ecological indication significance(1987-2020)
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Fuxian has nearly 21 billion cubic meters of high-quality freshwater resources which has important strategic value, but the water quality has been degraded in recent years. Submerged vegetation is an important biological category for the function maintenance of the lake ecosystem, and its succession can reflect and influence the changes of the whole ecosystem. At present, there is a lack of long-term continuous observation records of submerged vegetation in Lake Fuxian. Based on Landsat remote sensing data, this paper analyzes the dynamic changes of submerged vegetation in the northern part of Lake Fuxian. Integrating climate change and water quality hydrological elements, submerged vegetation in the northern part of Lake Fuxian showed a decrease followed by an increase from 1987 to 2020. From 1987 to 1995, the distribution area of submerged vegetation accounted for about 1.64% of the northern lake area. From 1996 to 2010, the submerged vegetation in the northern lake area reduced, and the lake was in a state of high water level and low nutrients. The rise of the water level was the main reason for the reduction of submerged vegetation area during this period. From 2011 to 2020, the water level decreased and nutrients increased, and the combined effect of nutrients and water level led to a significant increase in the area of submerged vegetation in the northern lake area of Lake Fuxian. The change in submerged vegetation coverage was accompanied by a shift in submerged vegetation from Vallisneria 'Tatum as the dominant population to Myriophyllum spicatum as the dominant population, and the structure of submerged vegetation turns into more pollution-tolerant species. In this study, the analysis of the relationship between the development of submerged vegetation and the driving factors such as nutrients and water level in the north of Lake Fuxian suggests that at this stage, it is necessary to strictly restrict the discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake, strengthen the long-term dynamic monitoring of aquatic vegetation, build an integrated monitoring system for water quantity, quality and ecology, and carry out simulation and prediction of the Lake Fuxian ecosystem change to prevent Lake Fuxian ecosystem from regime shifts and maintain its functional diversity Lake Fuxian.

TI  - SENECA: Change detection in optical imagery using Siamese networks with Active-Transfer Learning
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change Detection (CD) aims to distinguish surface changes based on bi-temporal remote sensing images. In recent years, deep neural models have made a breakthrough in CD processes. However, training a deep neural model requires a large volume of labelled training samples that are time-consuming and labour-intensive to acquire. With the aim of learning an accurate CD model with limited labelled data, we propose SENECA: a method based on a CD Siamese network, which takes advantage of both Transfer Learning (TL) and Active Learning (AL) to handle the constraint of limited supervision. More precisely, we jointly use AL and TL to adapt a CD model trained on a labelled source domain to a (related) target domain featured by restricted access to labelled data. We report results from an experimental evaluation involving five pairs of images acquired via Sentinel-2 satellites between 2015 and 2018 in various locations picked all over Asia and USA. The results show the beneficial effects of the proposed AL and TL strategies on the accuracy of the decisions made by the CD Siamese network and depict the merit of the proposed approach over competing CD baselines.

TI  - Investigation on cloud vertical structures based on Ka-band cloud radar observations at Wuhan in Central China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on vertically pointing observations of Ka-band frequency-modulated continuous millimeter wave cloud radar (MMCR) in 2020, we investigate cloud vertical structures at Wuhan in central China. Case comparison indicates that the cloud top locations in the MMCR observation are largely consistent with those in satellite data. The precipitation has the occurrence frequency of 9.5% over the year, with the maximum value of 16.3% in July and the submaximal value of 14.7% in January, showing the significant influences of monsoons on precipitation at Wuhan. As the humid, cloudy and rainy climate, the probability of precipitation and non-precipitation clouds increases gradually from 53.9% in January to a large value of 71.5% in July. The non-precipitation clouds have the probability of 44.5% in the year, with two prominent peaks at the reflectivities of-35 to-30 dBZ around 12 km in summer and -37--32 dBZ around 10 km in spring. The cloud top can reach the heights of 14.49, 16.62, 13.38 and 11.73 km from spring to winter, respectively. The monthly mean cloud layer thickness is the largest (2.18 km) in May and September, and the smallest (1.36 km) in November. The seasonally averaged base and top heights and thickness of clouds have small diurnal variations. The high cloud is predominant in the warm months from May to September, and in the other cool months, the middle cloud has the most fraction. The quantitative investigation of clouds is helpful in improving the cloud parameterization in climate models.

TI  - Agro-meteorological drought risk assessment in the groundnut basin of Senegal: the case of the municipalities of Djilor, Diossong, Keur Samba Gueye and Toubacouta
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture drought is a recurrent phenomenon that affects most parts of Sahel regions. With the advent of various satellite data, drought risk assessment has become more accessible, but the challenge lies in choosing a well-defined time scale. This study aims to contribute to agricultural drought monitoring, based on the calculation of composite indices using the MODIS sensor in the Senegalese Groundnut basin. The approach is based upon vegetation condition and health (VCI, VHI) and temperature (TCI) indices. Subsequently, those indices were evaluated based upon crop yield data, and a Holt-Winter forecasting was performed to determine the driest month in 2020-2021. Here we show that all investigated communes are sensitive to drought, especially Keur-Samba Gueye (in July, September, and October). Based on its significant correlation with VCI and TCI (R-2>0.57), VHI was proven to be a reliable water stress indicator. Our approach demonstrates the Groundnut basin's vulnerability to climate change.

TI  - Improved Hourly and long-term PM2.5 Prediction Modeling Based on MODIS in Bangkok
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used an innovative combination of ground-based, satellite, climate variables (tempera-ture (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS)), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and Height of the Planetary Boundary Layer (HPBL) data at the site for generating PM2.5 model. Interestingly, a new parameter called "ventilation rate (VRA)" was utilized in the model. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) data were obtained from the MODIS satellite data. Monthly and daily data were combined for filling non-retrieval days. The linear mixed effect model (LMEM) was applied as a tool for prediction. Validation of the PM2.5 model is handled by comparing ground based PM2.5 concentrations at monitoring sites. The funding shows that the optimal sub-set LMEM model with the other factors can substantially enhance the precision of predicting ground based hourly PM2.5 concentrations. The coefficient (R2) rises from 0.64 to 0.87, and the root mean square error (RMSE) reduces from 10 to 6 mu g/m3. The optimal subset LMEM were gen-erated for all seasons. The hourly R2 values were above 0.65, with a high value of R2 in the sum-mer season (R2 = 0.78) and a low value of R2 in rainy (R2 = 0.65). PM2.5 patterns between ob-served and predicted show a similar representative and are a slight increase from 2018 to 2022. Therefore, our study provides MODIS AODs data with a potentially helpful estimation of PM2.5 concentrations, giving more information for urban scale studies.

TI  - Evaluation of seven atmospheric correction algorithms for OLCI images over the coastal waters of Qinhuangdao in Bohai Sea
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction (AC) over coastal waters is always critical in ocean color remote sensing. The performance of the AC algorithms determines the reliability of the retrieval of the water-leaving radiance and subsequent bio-optical parameters. In this study, the seven AC algorithms for the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) were evaluated with an in situ dataset over the coastal waters of Qinhuangdao in the Bohai Sea, China: the Baseline Atmospheric Correction (BAC), the Case 2 Regional Coast Color Atmospheric Correction (C2RCC) and its alternative version (C2RCC-AltNets), the Management Unit Mathematical Models (MUMM), the polynomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS (POLYMER), the image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR), and ACOLITE for Dark Spectrum Fitting (ACOLITE-DSF). For OLCI-derived remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), where lambda is light wavelength, on the respective match-ups, all algorithms except ACOLITE-DSF had higher accuracy in the wavelength range from 490 nm to 560 nm, with the absolute percentage difference (APD) < 43%. On the common match-ups of all algorithms, the performance of seven AC algorithms was better than that of the respective match-ups. POLYMER obtained the best performance in visible bands, with APD less than 24.04% and 17.13% for respective and common match-ups, respectively. In terms of blue/green band ratios, R-rs(490)/R-rs(560) obtained by all algorithms except C2RCC performed better than R-rs(442)/R-rs(560). POLYMER performed best in blue/green band ratios, with the APD of 10.38% and 5.51% for R-rs(442)/R-rs(560) and R-rs(490)/R-rs(560), respectively. Using a scoring scheme based on all statistical parameters, POLYMER scored the highest. ACOLITE-DSF represented the worst accuracy for all evaluations over our in situ dataset. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Wild birds-the sentinel of antibiotic resistance for urban river: Study on egrets and Jinjiang river in Chengdu, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Antibiotic resistance has become a comprehensive and complicated environmental problem. It is of great importance to effectively determine the abundance of various antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the envi-ronment. Here, we attempted to find a practical method for monitoring environmental antibiotic resistance. The results of culture-based analysis of antibiotic resistance and metagenomic sequencing indicate that egrets inhabiting along the urban river (Jinjiang River) can be used as the sentinel of environmental antibiotic resis-tance. The antibiotic resistance in the environment fluctuated with time, while that in the wild bird was rela-tively stable. The network analysis based on metagenomic sequencing data gave the co-occurrence pattern of ARGs. The overall situation of the antibiotic resistance in the river was determined by quantifying several module hub genes of the co-occurrence network in river sediments. The temporal and spatial distribution of ARGs in Jinjiang River is highly correlated with that of human gut-specific bacteriophage (crAssphage), which indicates that one main source of the antibiotic resistance in the river is likely to be municipal sewage. The mobility potential of ARGs varying among different niches suggests the transmission direction of antibiotic resistance in the environment.

TI  - Supraglacial debris thickness and supply rate in High-Mountain Asia
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial debris strongly modulates glacier melt rates and can be decisive for ice dynamics and mountain hydrology. It is ubiquitous in High-Mountain Asia, yet because its thickness and supply rate from local topography are poorly known, our ability to forecast regional glacier change and streamflow is limited. Here we combined remote sensing and numerical modelling to resolve supraglacial debris thickness by altitude for 4689 glaciers in High-Mountain Asia, and debris-supply rate to 4141 of those glaciers. Our results reveal extensively thin supraglacial debris and high spatial variability in both debris thickness and supply rate. Debris-supply rate increases with the temperature and slope of debris-supply slopes regionally, and debris thickness increases as ice flow decreases locally. Our centennial-scale estimates of debris-supply rate are typically an order of magnitude or more lower than millennial-scale estimates of headwall-erosion rate from Beryllium-10 cosmogenic nuclides, potentially reflecting episodic debris supply to the region's glaciers.Supraglacial debris in High-Mountain Asia is extensively thin and its supply rate from local topography increases with the temperature and slope of debris-supply slopes, according to analyses of remote sensing data from over 4600 glaciers.

TI  - Indications and results of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in breast cancer: changes observed in 2018 compared to 2012
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: Over the last 15 years, breast cancer (BC) treatment has undergone numerous changes, which have also affected the indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as well as the procedures depending on its outcome. The aim of this study is to compare the results of the SLNB carried out at our center during 2012, when we stopped performing an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after the finding of a micrometastasis, with those conducted in 2018, when we started applying Z011 criteria.Materials and methods: We have performed a comparative retrospective observational study, including cN0 BC patients that underwent a SLNB in 2012 versus those that underwent this procedure in 2018.Results: A total of 174 patients from 2012 and 165 from 2018 were studied. We found significant differences between the 2 groups: in 2018 there were fewer lobular invasive cancers (14 vs. 28) (P < 0.05), a smaller mean pathological size(P < 0.001), a higher proportion of HER2 and triple negative tumors (28 vs. 49; P < 0.01) and, finally, an increase in use of neoadjuvant treatments (42.0 vs. 6.7%). Regarding axillary involvement, we observed a decrease in both the presence of a positive sentinel node (24.1% in 2018 vs. 42.4% in 2012; P < 0.0001) as well as in the proportion of ALND performed (12.6% in 2018 vs. 21.2% in 2012) and the presence of positive non sentinel nodes after a ALND (59.1% vs. 74.3%; P = ns).Conclusion: Although the 2018 cohort that underwent SLNB had more aggressive tumors, there were fewer positive SN and ALND performed. This is probably due to a more accurate radiological diagnosis with ultrasound, that enables to detect cN1 cases before surgery, and to the increasing use of neoadjuvant treatments that may downstage the axilla.(c) 2021 Sociedad Espan tilde ola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, the procedure of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been introduced in low-risk endo-metrial cancer, being optional in intermediate-and high-risk cancer. However, until the last year, there was no consensus regarding the group of patients to whom to apply it, the best tracer to use or the site of injection. In this paper, we present in a multidisciplinary view the most controversial issues about the sentinel lymph node procedure in endometrial cancer, emphasizing the pros and cons of the different tracers available: radiotracers, hybrid tracers and indocyanine green.

TI  - Mapping cashew monocultures in the Western Ghats using optical and radar imagery in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by the expansion of agricultural commodity produc-tion. Mapping commodity crops is an important step towards monitoring commodity-driven de-forestation. Advances in remote sensing technology, such as the availability of high-resolution imagery and the combination of optical and radar imagery have enabled the detection of the tree-like crops which are difficult to distinguish from forest cover. Cashew is an example of a tree-like crop that grows in areas with high forest cover and biodiversity. Cashew is reported to occupy similar to 7.1 million ha globally yet mapping it has been constrained by unclear boundaries due to spatial mixing with forests, an indistinct spectral signature, and structural composition that resembles forests. We employed optical, radar, and a combination of the two imagery types to detect and map cashew monocultures in south Maharashtra, India for 2020. We performed a land cover clas-sification on Google Earth Engine using Random Forest, Classification And Regression Trees and Support Vector Machine algorithms. The combination of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery using Random Forest algorithm yielded the highest unbiased overall accuracy (83%) and unbi-ased producer's and user's accuracies of 71% and 86% respectively for cashew land cover and was considered the best approach. According to our best approach, monoculture cashew plantations occupy 53,350.37 ha of total land area in the Sawantwadi-Dodamarg landscape in India. This study shows that a combination of optical and radar imagery can be used for cashew land cover classification in the Western Ghats, and future studies could modify these methods for cashew mapping in other landscapes. This study contributes to a growing body of literature supporting the use of both optical and radar imagery for detecting tree-like crop cover.

TI  - Detection of unfavourable urban areas with higher temperatures and lack of green spaces using satellite imagery in sixteen Spanish cities
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper seeks to identify the most unfavourable areas of a city in terms of high temperatures and the absence of green infrastructure. An automatic methodology based on remote sensing and data analysis has been devel-oped and applied in sixteen Spanish cities with different characteristics. Landsat-8 satellite images were selected for each city from the July-August period of 2019 and 2020 to calculate the spatial variation of land surface temperature (LST). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to determine the abundance of vegetation across the city. Based on the NDVI and LST maps created, a k-means unsupervised classification clustering was performed to automatically identify the different clusters according to how favourable these areas were in terms of temperature and presence of vegetation. A Disadvantaged Area Index (DAI), combining both variables, was developed to produce a map showing the most unfavourable areas for each city. Overall, the percentage of the area susceptible to improvement with more vegetation in the cities studied ranged from 13 % in Huesca to 64-65 % in Bilbao and Valencia. The influence of several factors, such as the presence of water bodies or large buildings, is discussed. Detecting unfavourable areas is a very interesting tool for defining future planning strategy for green spaces.

TI  - Using remote sensing to evaluate coastal erosion and accretion to guide conservation of turtle nesting sites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Using a remote sensing approach, we examined changing patterns in currents, waves, and tides and their impacts on coastal erosion and accretion at Jeen Womom Turtle Nesting Coastal Park (JWTNCP) in West Papua, Indonesia. This area is part of one of the most diverse marine ecosystems in the world and is used by four species of sea turtles. We quantified rates of coastline changes and oceanographic dynamics between 2012 and 2018 using remote sensing interpretation methods with data compiled from Landsat 8 and two oceanographic data providers: Indonesia Geospatial Information Agency and Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. We found evidence that coastlines were both eroding and accreting with high variation among years. In general, we found that areas with evidence of accretion were those near river deltas where sedimentation from rivers counteracted erosion from waves. In all other areas, coastlines were dominated by erosion due to increased wave strength at high tides and related to sea-level rise. We suggest that turtle nesting conservation should prioritize efforts near river outlets where beaches are likely to persist for a longer duration than other areas.

TI  - Empathic Flow: Dutch Humanist Chaplains' Experiences with Professional Empathy and Its Challenges
T2  - PASTORAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Empathy is considered a key component of chaplaincy care, but little is known about the daily practice of empathy and the empathy barriers that chaplains encounter. This study investigates the factors that encourage or discourage empathy and provides insight into what chaplains actually do to achieve empathy and to overcome empathy challenges. Semistructured interviews were used to collect data from twenty humanist chaplains in the Netherlands. A grounded theory approach was applied to analyze the data. The core concept of empathic flow emerged from the analysis. This refers to the stream of empathic experiences that arises within the relational, dynamic exchange between chaplain and client. Based on the analysis, three types of empathic flow were distinguished: (1) uncomplicated empathy, which flows smoothly and easily; (2) challenged empathy, which fluctuates between flow and temporal stagnation or disruption; and (3) failed empathy, in which the flow of empathy is blocked. Professional empathy emerged as a second core category from the interview data. This refers to those chaplains' activities that aim to establish or enhance empathic flow, particularly in the face of challenges. Professional empathy relies on several underlying key components: critical self-reflection, self-care, professional standards, and the chaplain's humanistic worldview and values. The qualitative analysis yielded 10 themes of professional empathy. Our findings suggest that empathy is a rich and complex practice to which both chaplain and client contribute. As professional caregivers, chaplains consider themselves ultimately responsible for establishing empathy and overcoming challenges.

TI  - Existential threat and responses to emotional displays of ingroup and outgroup members
T2  - GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present research investigates how emotional displays shape reactions to ingroup and outgroup members when people are reminded of death. We hypothesized that under mortality salience, emotions that signal social distance promote worldview defense (i.e., increased ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation), whereas emotions that signal affiliation promote affiliation need (i.e., reduced ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation). In three studies, participants viewed emotional displays of ingroup and/or outgroup members after a mortality salience or control manipulation. Results revealed that under mortality salience, anger increased ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation (Study 1), enhanced perceived overlap with the ingroup (Study 3), and increased positive facial behavior to ingroup displays-measured via the Facial Action Coding System (Studies 1 and 2) and electromyography of the zygomaticus major muscle (Study 3). In contrast, happiness decreased ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation (Study 2), and increased positive facial behavior towards outgroup members (Study 3). The findings suggest that, in times of threat, emotional displays can determine whether people move away from unfamiliar others or try to form as many friendly relations as possible.

TI  - Modeling cloud properties over the 79 N Glacier (Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, NE Greenland) for an intense summer melt period in 2019
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long believed to be insignificant, melt activity on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) has increased in recent years. Summertime Arctic clouds have the potential to strongly affect surface melt processes by regulating the amount of radiation received at the surface. However, the cloud effect over Greenland is spatially and temporally variable and high-resolution information on the northeast is absent. This study aims at exploring the potential of a high-resolution configuration of the polar-optimized Weather Research & Forecasting Model (PWRF) in simulating cloud properties in the area of the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier (79 N Glacier). Subsequently, the model simulations are employed to investigate the impact of Arctic clouds on the surface energy budget and on surface melting during the extensive melt event at the end of July 2019. Compared to automatic weather station (AWS) measurements and remote-sensing data (Sentinel-2A and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS), PWRF simulates cloud properties with sufficient accuracy. It appears that peak melt was caused by an increase in solar radiation and sensible heat flux (SHF) in response to a blocking anticyclone and foehn winds in the absence of clouds. Cloud warming over high-albedo surfaces helped to precondition the surface and prolonged the melting as the anticyclone abated. The results are sensitive to the surface albedo and suggest spatiotemporal differences in the cloud effect as snow and ice properties change over the course of the melting season. This demonstrates the importance of including high-resolution information on clouds in analyses of ice sheet dynamics.

TI  - The assessment for selection and correction of RS-based DEMs and 1D and 2D HEC-RAS models for flood mapping in different river types
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) act as an essential input to hydraulic models for the simulation of flood hazard maps. Coarser resolution DEMs are subject to higher levels of uncertainty, particularly in capturing river-bed bathymetry. The principal aim of the present study was to assess the potential use of freely available DEMs and the 1D and 2D HEC-RAS modeling approaches for flood mapping in four different types of river morphology. The DEM created from direct river survey (Surveyed DEM) was used as a benchmark to assess three remote sensing-based DEMs (i.e., ALOS, SRTM, and ASTER). The results indicated that ALOS is more accurate. However, the regeneration of main-channel bathymetry was poor for floodplain-meandering and braided river reaches. The DEMs were then corrected by optimizing the number and layout of representative sections. A total of 144 tests were carried out. The results indicated that the flood-mapping index F of ALOS increased from 86% to 91%. The flood mapping with a 1D model was sufficient in straight reaches (F-index 84%). In floodplain-meandering rivers, a 2D model had to be used to reach an F-index up to 81%. The responses of both 1D and 2D models were almost identical in the case of wide-braided rivers.

TI  - Innovative Analysis Ready Data (ARD) product and process requirements, software system design, algorithms and implementation at the midstream as necessary-but-not-sufficient precondition of the downstream in a new notion of Space Economy 4.0-Part 1: Problem background in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the convergence between Earth observation (EO) Big Data and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this two-part paper identifies an innovative, but realistic EO optical sensory image-derived semantics-enriched Analysis Ready Data (ARD) product-pair and process gold standard as linchpin for success of a new notion of Space Economy 4.0. To be implemented in operational mode at the space segment and/or midstream segment by both public and private EO big data providers, it is regarded as necessary-but-not-sufficient "horizontal" (enabling) precondition for: (I) Transforming existing EO big raster-based data cubes at the midstream segment, typically affected by the so-called data-rich information-poor syndrome, into a new generation of semantics-enabled EO big raster-based numerical data and vector-based categorical (symbolic, semi-symbolic or subsymbolic) information cube management systems, eligible for semantic content-based image retrieval and semantics-enabled information/knowledge discovery. (II) Boosting the downstream segment in the development of an ever-increasing ensemble of "vertical" (deep and narrow, user-specific and domain-dependent) value-adding information products and services, suitable for a potentially huge worldwide market of institutional and private end-users of space technology. For the sake of readability, this paper consists of two parts. In the present Part 1, first, background notions in the remote sensing metascience domain are critically revised for harmonization across the multi-disciplinary domain of cognitive science. In short, keyword "information" is disambiguated into the two complementary notions of quantitative/unequivocal information-as-thing and qualitative/equivocal/inherently ill-posed information-as-data-interpretation. Moreover, buzzword "artificial intelligence" is disambiguated into the two better-constrained notions of Artificial Narrow Intelligence as part-without-inheritance-of AGI. Second, based on a better-defined and better-understood vocabulary of multidisciplinary terms, existing EO optical sensory image-derived Level 2/ARD products and processes are investigated at the Marr five levels of understanding of an information processing system. To overcome their drawbacks, an innovative, but realistic EO optical sensory image-derived semantics-enriched ARD product-pair and process gold standard is proposed in the subsequent Part 2.

TI  - Completion Lymph Node Dissection for Melanoma Before and After the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-II in the United States
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-II (MSLT-II) revealed completion lymph node dissection (CLND) after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) did not improve melanoma-specific survival compared with surveillance. Given these findings and the morbidity associated with CLND, this study investigated trends in rates and predictors of CLND after MSLT-II. Methods Analysis of the National Cancer Database was performed for all patients aged >= 18 years with melanoma and a positive SLNB for 2012-2019. Rates of CLND before and after publication of MSLT-II were identified and logistic regression used to identify factors associated with CLND. Results Patients undergoing CLND declined from 55.9% pre-MSLT-II (n = 9725) to 19.5% post-MSLT-II (n = 9419) (odds ratio [OR] 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.35). CLND was less likely in females (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.78-0.89), older patients (vs. 18-39 yr; 40-64 yr OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65-0.98; 65-79 yr OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.84; >80 yr OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.30-0.49), sicker patients (Deyo category >= 2 OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.99), thinner primary lesions (vs. 0.01-0.79 mm; 1.01-4.00 mm OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33; >= 4.01 mm OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.59), patients from metro areas (Rural OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.00-1.70; Urban OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.29), and those treated at lower-volume centers (vs. lowest-volume; highest-volume OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.14-1.50; high-volume OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.57). Conclusions MSLT-II has impacted clinical care; however, male gender, thicker lesions, rural/urban residence, younger age, fewer comorbidities, and treatment at higher-volume centers confer a greater likelihood of undergoing CLND. Further investigations should focus on whether these populations benefit from more aggressive surgical care.

TI  - NDVI/NDRE prediction from standard RGB aerial imagery using deep learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The growth of precision agriculture has allowed farmers access to more data and greater efficiency for their farms. With consistently tight profit margins, farmers need ways to take advantage of the advancement of technology to lower their costs or increase their revenue. One area where these advancements can prove beneficial are in the measurement of vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE). Color maps representing these vegetation indices can be used to identify problem areas, plant health, or even places where spot applications are needed. These color maps help farmers to visualize these areas. Currently, a multi-thousand dollar multispectral camera, typically attached to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) during flight, is required for measuring these indices. This makes obtaining NDVI and NDRE somewhat cost prohibitive for most farmers. This work demonstrates a solution to this cost issue. The solution involves the use of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network known as Pix2Pix. By using Pix2Pix along with training data from UAV flights of corn, soybeans, and cotton, this paper highlights the potential for predicting comparable NDVI and NDRE with a low-cost Red-Green-Blue (RGB) camera. This paper proposes and assesses a cost-efficient method that can comparably predict these vegetation indices, resulting in cost-savings in the range of $5000 per UAV system.

TI  - Comparison of common classification strategies for large-scale vegetation mapping over the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation resources have an essential role in sustainable development due to their close relationship with natural resource management and environmental protection. The monitoring of land use and cover is key for a more sustainable management of these resources, and Earth Observation satellites have provided an increasingly powerful platform for performing this task. To date, numerous classification algorithms have been developed for vegetation mapping, but a comparative evaluation of the strategies commonly used in large-scale applications (50000 km2 and above) is lacking. We developed a classification framework based on random forests and Sentinel data within the Google Earth Engine platform to assess the performance of various strategies over a complex landscape with a wide range of vegetation classes, plot configurations, and agricultural practices. These strategies differed in key aspects related to the characteristics of the classifier and the sample, and were evaluated by class-specific and general accuracy metrics. We found that the use of pixel time series features from fusion data, class-balanced labels, and multi-season time frames enhanced overall performance by 1.3%-14.1% over alternative approaches, but in some cases also generated tradeoffs of 1.6%-8.5% between recall and precision. In general, suboptimal strategies were particularly ineffective for the detection of infrequent classes. Finally, the different parameter values used in the random forests did not have a significant influence over the results. Our results demonstrate the importance of algorithm design in the effective classification of multiple vegetation classes, corroborate the usefulness of Sentinel data to generate mapping products of high resolution and accuracy, and highlight the importance of cloud computing tools for the development of vegetation mapping tools in large-scale applications. These findings provide general guidelines for the design of future classification frameworks, which are necessary for facilitating a sustainable management of natural resources worldwide.

TI  - On the DInSAR technique for the structural monitoring of modern existing bridges
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-BRIDGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The setting up of efficient strategies for safety assessments and maintenance of modern existing bridges is a crucial research challenge in structural engineering. In Italy, this topic has recently been addressed in guidelines issued by the Ministry of Infrastructures and Transport in 2020. The guidelines outline procedures and tools for safety assessments and maintenance interventions: a mandatory step is the analysis of original documents (concerning the design, the construction process and the maintenance interventions) in order to acquire robust knowledge of the structure. As noted in recent works in the literature, non-invasive structural monitoring approaches play a crucial role in the safety assessment of existing bridges. One such approach is multi-temporal differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR). This paper presents a cross-disciplinary process for the structural monitoring of modern existing bridges, based on integration of DInSAR measurements, exploiting Cosmo-SkyMed measurements collected during the period 2011-2019, and accurate knowledge of the structures derived from analysis of original documents conserved in historical archives. The procedure is applied to two reinforced concrete Gerber bridges in Rome, designed in the 1930s.

TI  - Mapping of small water bodies with integrated spatial information for time series images of optical remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small water bodies and their temporal changes are, especially in urban areas, closely related to people's daily life and they have an impact on the living environment. For small water bodies mapping with optical remote sensing images, it is challenging to establish a balance between reducing incorrect water detection and increasing the integrity of water extraction. For time-series application, the temporal variability of the spectral information is also challenging for the widely used threshold methods, which are frequently solely based on spectral analysis. In this work we propose a spatial information-integrated small water bodies mapping (SWM) method to achieve a complete and accurate extraction and temporal change monitoring of small water bodies in complex urban environments. Our strategy is to make use of the spatial contextual information to account for the indistin-guishability of small water bodies in spectral information. The roughness of the water index is calculated to enhance the contrast between water bodies and other thematic classes eventually present in the imagery. The proposed SWM was applied to different water indexes with an automatic threshold determination. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using Landsat and Sentinel-2 multispectral data from three different urban environments (Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan in China) which include a variety of river courses and lakes. Nantan Lake of China is selected as a representative experimental area to test the SWM method by generating the inter-and intra-year water results. Overall accuracy (OA), F1 score (F1), producer's accuracy (PA), and user's accuracy (UA) were used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. Compared with the four state-of-the-art water detection methods (supervised random forest classification, hierarchical clustering, multi-band threshold, and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI)), the proposed SWM algorithm achieves better water extraction performance. Small water bodies are found to be extracted more completely and incorrect water extractions are alleviated. The overall accuracy of the SWM algorithm achieves an average of approx. 97% (OA) and 0.95 (F1). The long-time sequence (from 2007 to 2021) and the short-time interval (monthly results of the year 2020) of the water extraction results by the SWM agree well with the ground truth data. The mean absolute area deviations between the water body extraction results of the SWM algorithm and ground truth is significantly smaller than that of the Global Surface Water dataset developed by the Euro-pean Commission's Joint Research Centre (3.5% vs 49.0% for annual results and 6.0% vs 35.0% for monthly results).

TI  - Impact of land use land cover changes on flow uncertainty in Siliana watershed of northwestern Tunisia
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely admitted that changes in land use land cover (LULC) influence the hydrology of the catchment. However, how these changes affect hydrological model prediction uncertainty is still a raising question. In this paper we addressed this question by investigating the impacts of the rapid change in LULC in the Siliana catchment in Tunisia on monthly flow and magnitude of flow extremes using the SWAT hydrological model while quantifying the contribution of LULC to the model parameter and prediction uncertainty. At a first step, the SWAT model parameter and prediction uncertainty were estimated using the GLUE method and acceptable parameter sets were identified. Subsequently, the SWAT model was fed with historical LULC as derived from Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images for the years 1990, 2000, 2013 and 2019, and run with the acceptable parameter sets. The results show that the increase in olive plantations (+380 %), urban area (+200 %), and irrigated lands (+309 %) from 1990 to 2019, has LULC decreased monthly flow, high flows magnitude but did not impact low flows in particular over the previous two decades. The findings also suggest that model prediction uncertainty can mask LULC effects, suggesting that model results can be misleading without explicit consideration of uncertainty when assessing the hydrological impacts of changes in LULC.

TI  - Benefits of global earth observation missions for disaggregation of exposure data and earthquake loss modeling: evidence from Santiago de Chile
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure is an essential component of risk models and describes elements that are endangered by a hazard and susceptible to damage. The associated vulnerability characterizes the likelihood of experiencing damage (which can translate into losses) at a certain level of hazard intensity. Frequently, the compilation of exposure information is the costliest component (in terms of time and labor) of risk assessment procedures. Existing models often describe exposure in an aggregated manner, e.g., by relying on statistical/census data for given administrative entities. Nowadays, earth observation techniques allow the collection of spatially continuous information for large geographic areas while enabling a high geometric and temporal resolution. Consequently, we exploit measurements from the earth observation missions TanDEM-X and Sentinel-2, which collect data on a global scale, to characterize the built environment in terms of constituting morphologic properties, namely built-up density and height. Subsequently, we use this information to constrain existing exposure data in a spatial disaggregation approach. Thereby, we establish dasymetric methods for disaggregation. The results are presented for the city of Santiago de Chile, which is prone to natural hazards such as earthquakes. We present loss estimations due to seismic ground shaking and corresponding sensitivity as a function of the resolution properties of the exposure data used in the model. The experimental results underline the benefits of deploying modern earth observation technologies for refined exposure mapping and related earthquake loss estimation with enhanced accuracy properties.

TI  - The influence of groundwater levels on land subsidence in Karaman (Turkey) using the PS-InSAR technique
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth and increased agricultural activities in Karaman and its surrounding region, located in the southwest of the Konya Closed Basin, have led to increasing water demand in recent years. Karaman's drinking and irrigation water needs are also almost entirely met from groundwater. Accordingly, excessive groundwater extraction deepens the water level inside the aquifers, resulting in land subsidence. In this study, the spatio-temporal evolution of surface deformation in and around the city of Karaman was investigated using Sentinel-1/A SAR data, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and groundwater levels over a period from 2016 to 2021. Sentinel-1 images obtained from ascending satellite orbits were evaluated using the persistent scatter interferometry (PS-InSAR) approach. Mean velocity maps and line-of-sight displacement time series were obtained and compared with GNSS data and groundwater levels. In all three datasets, a significant level of subsidence was obtained in the study region. The land subsidence values were found to be 25 mm/yr in the city center of Karaman and reached values of 50 mm/yr toward the northern part of the province. According to the results, there is a strong correlation between subsidence rates and groundwater levels over the analyzed period, indicating that subsidence in the area is most likely driven by excessive groundwater withdrawal.

TI  - Evaluation of the temporal reconstruction methods for MODIS-based continuous daily actual evapotranspiration estimation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring continuous daily actual evapotranspiration (ET) is very useful for managing regional water resources and understanding vegetation water consumption and water use efficiency. However, the research on remote sensing-based temporal reconstruction methods for mapping continuous daily ET is still limited, lacking comparative evaluations and mechanism discussions. In the study, four reconstruction methods, including two interpolation methods (the reference evaporative fraction (ETrF) and evaporative fraction (EF) method) and two calibration methods (the advection-aridity (AA) and modified Katerji-Perrier (KP) method), were systematically evaluated to reconstruct continuous daily ET from discrete daily ET based on MODIS products and atmospheric data. Meanwhile, an additional test using in situ measurements as a perfect proxy for the retrievals on satellite overpass dates was added as a baseline case that is independent of remotely sensed ET error. The internal coupling mechanism between each model's simulations and the underlying surface physical and atmospheric driving factors were also analyzed using the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methods. The results demon-strated that the interpolation methods performed better and had a higher potential for improvement as the quality of remote sensing ET inputs improved. Although the underestimation errors in the remote sensing-based ET estimates propagated to subsequent reconstructions and caused underestimation to a certain extent, the four methods could still effectively simulate continuous daily ET. Among them, the EF method with a simple calculation process, which used reference quantity directly related to solar radiation, had the best performance based on in situ with an R2 of 0.8233 and an NRMSE of 0.0889. Given remote sensing estimates, the AA method was the best due to the compensation effects, with an R2 of 0.7267 and an NRMSE of 0.1442. As all methods showed high sensitivity to ET of satellite overpass days, its accuracy should be a top priority for continuous daily ET reconstruction work.

TI  - Comparison of iCOR and Rayleigh atmospheric correction methods on Sentinel-3 OLCI images for a shallow eutrophic reservoir
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of inland waters is challenging, but also important, due to the need to monitor the ever-increasing harmful algal blooms (HABs), which have serious effects on water quality. The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) of the Sentinel-3 satellites program is capable of providing images for the monitoring of such waters. Atmospheric correction is a necessary process in order to retrieve the desired surface-leaving radiance signal and several atmospheric correction methods have been developed through the years. However, many of these correction methods require programming language skills, or function as commercial software plugins, limiting their possibility of use by end users. Accordingly, in this study, the free SNAP software provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to evaluate the possible differences between a partial atmospheric correction method accounting for Rayleigh scattering and a full atmospheric correction method (iCOR), applied on Sentinel-3 OLCI images of a shallow, highly eutrophic water reservoir. For the complete evaluation of the two methods, in addition to the comparison of the band reflectance values, chlorophyll (CHL) and cyanobacteria (CI) indices were also calculated and their values were intercompared. The results showed, that although the absolute values between the two correction methods did not coincide, there was a very good correlation between the two methods for both bands' reflectance (r > 0.73) and the CHL and CI indices values (r > 0.95). Therefore, since iCOR correction image processing time is 25 times longer than Rayleigh correction, it is proposed that the Rayleigh partial correction method may be alternatively used for seasonal water monitoring, especially in cases of long time-series, enhancing time and resources use efficiency. Further comparisons of the two methods in other inland water bodies and evaluation with in situ chlorophyll and cyanobacteria measurements will enhance the applicability of the methodology.

TI  - Dynamic of population growth and its effect on land use/land cover of bahraich district in Uttar Pradesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the dynamics of land use and land cover change (LULC) is essential to the formulation of land-use policy. This study describes the spatial-temporal changes in land use and land cover (LULC) in the Bahraich district and the underlying mechanisms behind these changes. To detect the land transformation, satellite images for over 30 years (1991-2021) have been used. Five major LULC classes (agriculture, forest, water bodies, built-up area, and sand) have been taken into consideration for analyzing the land transformation. The aim of the study is to find out the level at which the LULC changes have taken place and their correlation with the population dynamism. It has been found that the population growth in the Bahraich district has a very strong correlation with LULC classes defined in this study which includes both natural and anthropogenic features. In these 30 years, natural features like waterbody (-74.01%), fallow land (- 72.89%), forest (- 26.20%), and sand (- 38%) have seen a major loss in the area coverage due to extensive anthropogenic activities. These classes are strongly correlated with human population growth with Rho values of - .963, - .947,- .983, and - .830, respectively. Other classes such as built-up and agriculture have shown a strong positive correlation with the expension of human population. The Rho values of built-up and agriculture are noted to be .982 and .986, respectively, whereas the increase in the area of land surface cover is found to be 394.57% and 43.04% respectively. This signifies that the geometrical progression in the human population has amplified anthropogenic activities vastly, resulting in the loss of areal extent of natural classes such as water bodies, forest, fallow land, and sand and increment in the area extent of human-induced activities such as agriculture and built-up. For the abovementioned analysis, Landsat 4-5 TM images for the year 1991 and 2007 and Landsat 8 OLI images for the year 2021 have been used. The results have shown that although the study area is rich in biodiversity, yet it has been facing escalating environmental issues due to acute land surface transformation resulting majorly due to human-induced activities. The majority of the transitions are reversible. The research area's LULC change processes are primarily influenced by socioeconomic, demographic, and proximity variables. The findings will be useful in modelling future LULC situations as a direction for land management policies.

TI  - Inguinofemoral sentinel lymph node biopsy by scar injection in vulvar cancer: an assessment of feasibility and long-term outcomes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPerforming inguinofemoral sentinel lymph node biopsy for vulvar cancer following a previous vulvar excision, often referred to as 'scar injection', is debated. ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy following scar injection and the long-term outcomes in patients undergoing this procedure. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients with vulvar cancer. We assessed detection rates and outcomes in patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy by scar injection and compared them with patients who had injection around a visible tumor and with patients who had an inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy following previous vulvar excision. Sentinel node detection rates are described per patient and per groin and are compared using X-2 analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association of recurrence and survival with surgical technique and recognized pathological variables. ResultsData were analyzed for 173 groins in 97 patients. At least one sentinel lymph node was detected in 162 (94%) groins examined, and detection rate did not differ whether the groin was assessed following tumor injection (n=122, 94%) or scar injection (n=40, 93%; p=0.85). Patients in the scar-injection group had less frequent lymph node metastases (p<0.02), smaller tumors (p<0.001), and more superficial invasion (p<0.02). Median follow-up was 34.7 months (range 0-108). Scar injection was not independently associated with recurrence or death on multivariable analysis, and depth of invasion was the only independent predictor of disease recurrence (hazards ratio (HR)=1.14, p=0.03). Recurrence and survival were also comparable for patients who had a sentinel lymph node biopsy or inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy following previous vulvar excision (log rank p=0.30; p=0.67). ConclusionsSentinel lymph node biopsy by scar injection is feasible and demonstrates similar long-term outcomes in patients having scar or tumor injections, and in patients following previous tumor excision undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Modeling spatio-temporal assessment of land use land cover of Lahore and its impact on land surface temperature using multi-spectral remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl, also widely known as urbanization, is one of the significant problems in the world. This research aims to assess and predict the urban growth and impact on land surface temperature (LST) of Lahore as well as land use and land cover (LULC) with a cellular automata Markov chain (CA-Markov chain). LULC and LST distributions were mapped using Landsat (5, 7, and 8) data from 1990, 2004, and 2018. Long-term changes to the landscape were simulated using a CA-Markov model at 14-year intervals from 2018 to 2046. Results indicate that the built-up area was increased from 342.54 (18.41%) to 720.31 (38.71%) km(2). Meanwhile, barren land, water, and vegetation area was decreased from 728.63 (39.16%) to 544.83 (29.28%) km(2), from 64.85 (3.49%) to 34.78 (1.87%) km(2), and from 724.53 (38.94%) to 560.63 (30.13%) km(2), respectively. In addition, urban index, a non-vegetation index, accurately predicted LST, showing the maximum correlation R-2 = 0.87 with respect to retrieved LST. According to CA-Markov chain analysis, we can predict the growth of built-up area from 830.22 to 955.53 km(2) between 2032 and 2046, based on the development from 1990 to 2018. As urban index as the predictor anticipated that the LST 20-23 degrees C and 24-27 degrees C, regions would all decline in coverage from 5.30 to 4.79% and 15.79 to 13.77% in 2032 and 2046, while the temperature 36-39 degrees C regions would all grow in coverage from 15.60 to 17.21% of the city. Our results indicate severe conditions, and the authorities should consider some strategies to mitigate this problem. These findings are significant for the planning and development division to ensure the long-term usage of land resources for urbanization expansion projects in the future.

T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal variability of vegetation fires is essential for understanding changes in the climate and ecosystem in mountainous regions. MODIS Collection 6 active fire products indicate that the area burned by vegetation fires declined globally from over 4.27 million km(2) to less than 3.52 million km(2) annually during 2001-2021. In contrast, global high mountains higher than 3000 m have experienced an overall increase in their burned area and suffered record-breaking wildfires from August to December 2020. Although high mountains accounted for less than 0.03% of the global burned area during 2001-2021, this proportion had more than tripled by 2020. This unprecedented wildfire record in 2020 could be mainly caused by favorable fire weather conditions such as low relative humidity, low soil water and high temperature.

TI  - A spatio-temporal prediction model theory based on deep learning to evaluate the ecological changes of the largest reservoir in North China from 1985 to 2021
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Miyun Reservoir, located in the Miyun District, Beijing, China, is the largest comprehensive water conservancy project and is an important ecological protection area in the North China region. Changes within the basin are the driving factors affecting the ecosystem in the watershed; therefore, it is important to analyze the changes in the ecological environment of Miyun Reservoir. For the analysis of a long time series of image data remotely sensed by satellite, the outliers caused by atmospheric, lighting, and sensor measurement errors are significant, and it is difficult for traditional algorithms to effectively recover the true image value. To address this, this paper proposes a theoretical model for predicting spatio-temporal variation based on deep learning to identify and correct invalid and anomalous values in extended time series data. This study corrected and analyzed the results of Remote Sensing based Ecological Index inversion of Landsat data of the Miyun Reservoir watershed from 1985 to 2021. The findings and conclusions of this study are important for the analysis of long time series image data from satellite remote sensing and for improving regional ecological evaluation and sustainable development planning.

TI  - Marine environmental monitoring with unmanned vehicle platforms: Present applications and future prospects
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Basic monitoring of the marine environment is crucial for the early warning and assessment of marine hydrometeoro-logical conditions, climate change, and ecosystem disasters. In recent years, many marine environmental monitoring platforms have been established, such as offshore platforms, ships, or sensors placed on specially designed buoys or submerged marine structures. These platforms typically use a variety of sensors to provide high-quality observations, while they are limited by low spatial resolution and high cost during data acquisition. Satellite remote sensing allows monitoring over a larger ocean area; however, it is susceptible to cloud contamination and atmospheric effects that subject the results to large uncertainties. Unmanned vehicles have become more widely used as platforms in marine science and ocean engineering in recent years due to their ease of deployment, mobility, and the low cost involved in data acquisition. Researchers can acquire data according to their schedules and convenience, offering significant im-provements over those obtained by traditional platforms. This study presents the state-of-the-art research on available unmanned vehicle observation platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), underwater gliders (UGs), un-manned surface vehicles (USVs), and unmanned ships (USs), for marine environmental monitoring, and compares them with satellite remote sensing. The recent applications in marine environments have focused on marine biochem-ical and ecosystem features, marine physical features, marine pollution, and marine aerosols monitoring, and their in-tegration with other products are also analysed. Additionally, the prospects of future ocean observation systems combining unmanned vehicle platforms (UVPs), global and regional autonomous platform networks, and remote sens-ing data are discussed.

TI  - Extraction of macrophyte community spatial variation allows to adapt the macrophyte biological index for rivers to the conditions of the middle Dnipro river
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aquatic macrophytes are widely used to indicate the trophic status of water bodies. For Ukrainian water bodies, which represent a wide ecological diversity, the indicator scales of the trophicity regime have not been developed. The purpose of the research is to develop an approach to adapt the Macrophyte Biological Index for Rivers (MBIR) for the conditions of the middle course of the Dnipro River. The difficulty in solving the problem is that the effect of eutrophication occurs against the variability of a complex of environmental factors and pro-cesses of natural and anthropogenic origin. The extraction of the eutrophication gradient is a prerequisite for assessing the response of plants to this factor and for constructing adequate indicator scales. The influence of natural factors on aquatic macrophyte communities is assumed to be spatially structured due to the long-term coevolution of the environment and biota. The pure plant response to the effects of eutrophication was assessed after extracting the spatial component of plant community variation. The pure response of aquatic macrophytes to the eutrophication factor provided an opportunity to construct an adequate scale for indicating the trophic status of water bodies, which correlates strongly with the scores of the MBIR. The studies were carried out within the Dnipro-Orilskiy Nature Reserve in the waters of the Dnipro reservoir, which was created on the Dnipro River. The aquatic macrophyte surveys were conducted at 76 locations. Studies were conducted in 50-100 m long plots along the shoreline. The remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 satellite was used to estimate the indexes of the eutrophication, turbidity, and transparency of the water. The distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps were produced from the geographic coordinates of the sampling points to be used as the spatial variables. Three versions of the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) were performed: 1) the CCA with the environmental factors and spatial variables as constrained predictors; 2) the CCA with the spatial variables as constrained predictors; 3) the CCA with the environmental factors as constrained predictors and the spatial variables as conditional predictors. The species scores on the corresponding ordinate axes were considered to estimate the species optimum. The variations of the species scores on the corresponding ordinate axes were considered to estimate the species tolerance. Species scores were converted into the CSd indicator values, and tolerance was converted into the Ed coefficients of ecological amplitude. The indicator values and environmental amplitude coefficients obtained for the ordination accounting for spatial effects had no statistically significant correlation coefficients with other indicator scales. The CSd indicator values that were obtained for community ordination accounting for pure environmental effects were statistically significantly correlated with the MBIR and other of the indicator scales. The coefficient of environmental amplitude Ed was negatively correlated with the E. The MBIR revealed that the level of eutrophication in 102 locations (67.1%) was estimated as Bad, in 37 locations (24.3%) it was estimated as Poor, and in 13 locations (8.6%) it was estimated as Moderate. The extraction of the spatial component of macrophyte community variation resulted in the evaluation of indicator scales that correlated statistically significantly with the original MBIR scale.

TI  - Mixed primary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast: a case report and literature review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (MCA) mainly occurs in the ovary, pancreas, and appendix, whereas the breast is a rare primary site of occurrence. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common breast malignancy. Only 31 cases of the breast MCA have been reported in the English literature, and the coexistence of MCA and IDC in the breast are rare.Case Description: Here, we describe a 61-year-old postmenopausal woman with no family history of breast cancer or other breast-related diseases, who presented with a palpable mass in her left breast lasting for 2 months. On ultrasonography examination, the tumor was a cystic-solid lesion with clear boundary. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass with low signal intensity on T1 weighted imaging and high signal intensity on T2 weighted imaging. Intraoperative frozen sections revealed metastatic tumor cells in one sentinel lymph node (1/4). She then underwent left modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection. The post-operative pathological examination showed the tumor consisted mostly of MCA (60%), with a small proportion of intermediate-grade IDC. The MCA had a well-demarcated cystic structure with papillary projections and abundant mucoid material. The epithelium lining cystic spaces was tall columnar, with mucin-producing cells that had basally located nuclei. The degree of cytological atypia varied considerably. Axillary lymph nodes were normal (0/15). The MCA was triple-negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, and positive for CK7 but negative for CK20. Through next generation sequencing, no mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified in our case, which was not highlighted in prior cases. After surgery, the patient underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy, and she has been disease-free during the 10-month follow-up. In addition to detailing this instance of mixed MCA and IDC of the breast, we reviewed relevant literature and compare our findings with other patients who had breast MCAs.Conclusions: Our results improved the understanding of mixed MCA and IDC, especially MCA, and provided a basis for its diagnosis and differential diagnosis from other metastatic diseases.

TI  - Development of Merkel Cell Carcinoma in a Patient Receiving Rituximab
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, rapidly growing, and aggressive dermatological neoplasm. It is commonly reported in Caucasian ethnicities, and almost 50% of the patients have a concomitant malignancy and are on immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Here, we present a 79-year-old woman with a history of relapsed Stage II, grade III follicular lymphoma, receiving maintenance rituximab infusions. She presented with a raised erythematous papule on her left cheek. An excisional biopsy of the lesion confirmed a diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. After which, she underwent a wider excision with 1-2 cm margins. PET scan did not reveal any FDG-avid uptake lesions that would be concerning for metastatic disease. However, she underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy which was also negative. Thus, the diagnosis was finalized as Stage I (T1 N0 M0) MCC. There are only two reported cases in literature about the significant progression of Merkel cell carcinoma in patients who coincidentally were receiving rituximab as a part of treatment for another disease. This raises questions for future investigation and research on whether there is a direct association between rituximab use specifically and the rapid growth of MCC.

TI  - Observational imprints of our lost twin anti-universe
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider observational consequences of the entanglement between our universe and a hypothetical twin anti-universe in the third quantization scheme of the canonical quantum gravity in order to make such a scenario falsifiable. Based on our recent and unique investigations we select some special form of the interuniversal interaction which allows the entanglement entropy of the pair of universes to diverge at the critical points of their classical evolution where the specific behaviour of the Hubble parameter plays the key role. We find that the modification of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum due to the entanglement with our twin anti-universe for such models is enlarged for small modes k and small multipole numbers l. Our specific form of the interaction is then constrained by the Planck satellite data giving the interaction coupling constant bound to be lambda(0) less than or similar to O(10(-56)) s(-3) which is small, but not negligible compared to the inflationary contribution. Some other coupling functions which allow more critical points are also briefly commented on in the context of their observational effect on CMB and other prospective observational data.

TI  - Large-scale demonstration of machine learning for the detection of volcanic deformation in Sentinel-1 satellite imagery
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar (SAR) satellites systematically acquire imagery that can be used for volcano monitoring, characterising magmatic systems and potentially forecasting eruptions on a global scale. However, exploiting the large dataset is limited by the need for manual inspection, meaning timely dissemination of information is challenging. Here we automatically process similar to 600,000 images of > 1000 volcanoes acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite in a 5-year period (2015-2020) and use the dataset to demonstrate the applicability and limitations of machine learning for detecting deformation signals. Of the 16 volcanoes flagged most often, 5 experienced eruptions, 6 showed slow deformation, 2 had non-volcanic deformation and 3 had atmospheric artefacts. The detection threshold for the whole dataset is 5.9 cm, equivalent to a rate of 1.2 cm/year over the 5-year study period. We then use the large testing dataset to explore the effects of atmospheric conditions, land cover and signal characteristics on detectability and find that the performance of the machine learning algorithm is primarily limited by the quality of the available data, with poor coherence and slow signals being particularly challenging. The expanding dataset of systematically acquired, processed and flagged images will enable the quantitative analysis of volcanic monitoring signals on an unprecedented scale, but tailored processing will be needed for routine monitoring applications.

TI  - Optimizing WorldView-2,-3 cloud masking using machine learning approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of clouds is one of the first steps in the pre-processing of remotely sensed data. At coarse spatial resolution (> 100 m), clouds are bright and generally distinguishable from other landscape surfaces. At very high-resolution (< 3 m), detecting clouds becomes a significant challenge due to the presence of smaller features, with spectral characteristics similar to other land cover types, and thin (partially transparent) cloud forms. Furthermore, at this resolution, clouds can cover many thousands of pixels, making both the center and boundaries of the clouds prone to pixel contamination and variations in the spectral intensity. Techniques that rely solely on the spectral information of clouds underperform in these situations. In this study, we propose a multi-regional and multi-sensor deep learning approach for the detection of clouds in very high-resolution WorldView satellite imagery. A modified UNet-like convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the task of semantic segmentation in the regions of Vietnam, Senegal, and Ethiopia strictly using RGB + NIR spectral bands. In addition, we demonstrate the superiority of CNNs cloud predicted mapping accuracy of 81-91%, over traditional methods such as Random Forest algorithms of 57-88%. The best performing UNet model has an overall accuracy of 95% in all regions, while the Random Forest has an overall accuracy of 89%. We conclude with promising future research directions of the proposed methods for a global cloud cover implementation.

TI  - Feasibility and early toxicity of intraoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer using the papillon plus system: First results
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose: Breast intra operative radiation therapy has been evaluated with different systems delivering 20-21 Gy with treatment times around 30 min. Papillon + (TM) Contact X-ray machine was designed to produce a 50 kVp beam with a high dose rate >= 15 Gy/minute. A pilot study with the first prototype was conducted in Nice.Materials and methods: The inclusion criteria were age >= 60 years, unifocal ductal breast adenocarcinoma <= 2.5 cm, grade 1-2. Surgical local excision with sentinel node dissection was performed and the applicator was placed in the tumor bed after excision with a prescribed dose of 20 Gy. The main end point of the study was the doses measured with the Gafchromic films; two were located at the skin surface and two in the excision cavity. Secondary endpoints were early toxicity and relapse free survival.Results: Between 10/2018 and 09/2019, 26 patients were included. Mean Gafchromic doses were 18.8 Gy +/- 2 Gy at the south pole, 15.6 Gy +/- 2.81 Gy at the equator and 2.5 Gy +/- 1.67 Gy at the skin. With a median follow-up time of 12 months, no skin or subcutaneous toxicity > grade 2, no local relapse and no metastasis were observed. Conclusion: This is the first phase II study testing the Papillon + tm system for breast IORT with in vivo dosimetry measurements and reassuring clinical data.

TI  - The Worldview Genogram: A Process Model for Enhancing Diversity Responsiveness and Competence in Education, Training, and Clinical Supervision
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Diversity responsiveness and competence is an imperative in current graduate psychology training and few, if any, will debate this. However, what has been and still remains frustrating to most practicum and internship clinical supervisors and graduate school instructors is a dearth of safe and practical tools to enhance this process, particularly in terms of the awareness domain. The authors of this article present a process model, the Worldview Genogram (WVG), that has been developed and implemented in clinical field placements and classroom settings over the last 22 years with significant success. The WVG, anchored by a three-generational family-of-origin genogram, is a depiction of individual and cultural diversity constructs that impact a person's identity formation. A rationale for the model and specific, practical steps in implementing it in academic and clinical settings are described. The model's uniqueness lies in the fact that it is nonpathologizing, strengths-based, trainee driven, and predicated on instructor or supervisor modeling.Impact Statement The Worldview Genogram model presented here is a vital practical tool for assisting supervisors, supervisees, and instructors in clinical and academic settings to train as well as model integrating diversity conversations in their work. We argue that doing so allows for culturally responsive supervision, clinical work, and general training. The model's versatility allows for broad implementation across settings and situations including public mental health centers, academia, and other clinical settings

TI  - A data-driven high spatial resolution model of biomass accumulation and crop yield: Application to a fragmented desert-oasis agroecosystem
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on crop yield is important for food security, in particular under the conditions of climate change and growing population worldwide. We developed a new fully distributed, high spatial resolution, model of biomass accumulation and crop yield applicable to a highly heterogeneous desert-oasis agroecosystem. The bulk of required input data is obtained by retrieving pixel-wise biogeophysical variables from a suite of very diverse satellite data. Both temperature and water stress conditions at field-scale are given full consideration, while the model was designed to strike a balance between model applicability and satisfactory characterization of the heterogeneous desert-oasis system to estimate field-scale yield. The development of this model relies on three main innovations. First, the start and end of the growing season were estimated for each pixel by calibrating the high spatial and temporal resolution observations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by Sentinal-2 (S2) MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument) against limited local phenological information. Second, to monitor crop water stress, account taken of irrigation, a process-based water and energy balance model was applied to esti -mate the actual evapotranspiration (ET). This requires knowledge of soil water availability, which is charac-terized by downscaling the ASCAT (Advanced SCATterrometer) soil moisture data product. To capture the dominant features of the eco-hydrological conditions in the desert and oasis agroecosystem, ET was further downscaled from the 1 km resolution. Third, likewise the water stress indicator, the air temperature stress in-dicator was mapped after characterizing the thermal contrast and heterogeneity of the desert-oasis system, by generating time series of air temperature at 1 km spatial resolution using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data product. In the temporal dimension, gaps were mitigated by applying time series analysis techniques to reconstruct cloud-free time series of LST, NDVI, fAPAR and albedo. These innovations add up to a high resolution characterization of crop response to the geospatial variability of weather and climate forcing in the desert-oasis agroecosystem. The model was applied to the dominant crops, i.e., spring wheat, maize, sunflower, and melon, in the oases of the Shiyang River Basin (northwestern China) characterized by a rather fragmented land use. The high resolution of pixel-wise ecohy-drological parameters, i.e., crop phenology, temperature stress and water stress factors successfully reflect dif-ferences of crops with different phenology and location in the oases. The relative errors for wheat and maize yields compared to the census data are less than 5% at district level. At the county level, the relative errors of wheat yields of Liangzhou, Minqin, Gulang, Jinchuan, and Yongchang equal to 0.87%, 24.2%, 9.7%, 12.5%, and 7.2%. For maize, the dominant crop, the error on estimated yields was less than 5%, except in Gulang. The relative error on estimated yield for sunflower was less than 10% compared to agricultural census data. The relative error on estimated melon yield was 16%. This performance highlights the applicability of the model to estimate field-scale yields in agroecosystems characterized by fragmented land use.

TI  - Study on the spatiotemporal dynamic of ground-level ozone concentrations on multiple scales across China during the blue sky protection campaign
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface ozone (O3), one of the harmful air pollutants, generated significantly negative effects on human health and plants. Existing O3 datasets with coarse spatiotemporal resolution and limited coverage, and the un-certainties of O3 influential factors seriously restrain related epidemiology and air pollution studies. To tackle above issues, we proposed a novel scheme to estimate daily O3 concentrations on a fine grid scale (1 km x 1 km) from 2018 to 2020 across China based on machine learning methods using hourly observed ground-level pollutant concentrations data, meteorological data, satellite data, and auxiliary data including digital eleva-tion model (DEM), land use data (LUD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population (POP), and nighttime light images (NTL), and to identify the difference of influential factors of O3 on diverse urbanization and topography conditions. Some findings were achieved. The correlation coefficients (R2) between O3 con-centrations and surface net solar radiation (SNSR), boundary layer height (BLH), 2 m temperature (T2M), 10 m v -component (MVW), and NDVI were 0.80, 0.40, 0.35, 0.30, and 0.20, respectively. The random forest (RF) demonstrated the highest validation R2 (0.86) and lowest validation RMSE (13.74 mu g/m3) in estimating O3 concentrations, followed by support vector machine (SVM) (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 18.39 mu g/m3), backpropagation neural network (BP) (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 19.26 mu g/m3), and multiple linear regression (MLR) (R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 25.99 mu g/m3). Our China High-Resolution O3 Dataset (CHROD) exhibited an acceptable accuracy at different spatial-temporal scales. Additionally, O3 concentrations showed decreasing trend and represented obviously spatiotemporal heterogeneity across China from 2018 to 2020. Overall, O3 was mainly affected by human ac-tivities in higher urbanization regions, while O3 was mainly controlled by meteorological factors, vegetation coverage, and elevation in lower urbanization regions. The scheme of this study is useful and valuable in un-derstanding the mechanism of O3 formation and improving the quality of the O3 dataset.

TI  - Inverse modelling of Chinese NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions using deep learning: integrating in situ observations with a satellite-based chemical reanalysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column density measurements from satellites have been widely used in constraining emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2). However, the utility of these measurements is impacted by reduced observational coverage due to cloud cover and their reduced sensitivity toward the surface. Combining the information from satellites with surface observations of NO2 will provide greater constraints on emission estimates of NOx. We have developed a deep-learning (DL) model to integrate satellite data and in situ observations of surface NO2 to estimate NO, emissions in China. A priori information for the DL model was obtained from satellite-derived emissions from the Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis (TCR-2). A two-stage training strategy was used to integrate in situ measurements from the China Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) observation network with the TCR-2 data. The DL model is trained from 2005 to 2018 and evaluated for 2019 and 2020. The DL model estimated a source of 19.4 Tg NO for total Chinese NOx emissions in 2019, which is consistent with the TCR-2 estimate of 18.5 +/- 3.9 Tg NO and the 20.9 Tg NO suggested by the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC). Combining the MEE data with TCR-2, the DL model suggested higher NOx emissions in some of the less-densely populated provinces, such as Shaanxi and Sichuan, where the MEE data indicated higher surface NO2 concentrations than TCR-2. The DL model also suggested a faster recovery of NOx emissions than TCR-2 after the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday in 2019, with a recovery time scale that is consistent with Baidu "Qianxi" mobility data. In 2020, the DL-based analysis estimated about a 30 % reduction in NOx emissions in eastern China during the COVID-19 lockdown period, relative to pre-lockdown levels. In particular, the maximum emission reductions were 42 % and 30 % for the Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) mega-regions, respectively. Our results illustrate the potential utility of the DL model as a complementary tool for conventional data-assimilation approaches for air quality applications.

AB  - In many cases, the Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are obtained with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or stereo matching. As an active method, LiDAR is very accurate but expensive, thus often limiting its use in small-scale acquisition. Stereo matching is suitable for large-scale acquisition of terrain information as the increase of satellite stereo sensors. However, underperformance of stereo matching easily occurs in textureless areas. Accordingly, this study proposed a Shading Aware DSM GEneration Method (SADGE) with high resolution multi-view satellite images. Considering the complementarity of stereo matching and Shape from Shading (SfS), SADGE combines the advantage of stereo matching and SfS technique. First, an improved Semi-Global Matching (SGM) technique is used to generate an initial surface expressed by a DSM; then, it is refined by optimizing the objective function which modeled the imaging process with the illumination, surface albedo, and normal object surface. Different from the existing shading-based DEM refinement or generation method, no information about the illumination or the viewing angle is needed while concave/convex ambiguity can be avoided as multi-view images are utilized. Experiments with ZiYuan-3 and GaoFen-7 images show that the proposed method can generate higher accuracy DSM (12.5-56.3% improvement) with sound overall shape and temporarily detailed surface compared with a software solution (SURE) for multi-view stereo.

TI  - <i>Umunthu,</i> Covid-19 and mental health in Malawi
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the centrality of Umunthu in mental health conception and treatment in Malawi. Umunthu is an African philosophical worldview which stresses that an individual is human as they relate to others, as in the saying I am because we are. Its communitarian approach contrasts with a predominantly western individualistic worldview; I think therefore I am. There are spelling variations of the word across Bantu languages, including bomoto (Congo), gimuntu (Angola); umunthu (Malawi); vumutu (Mozambique); vumuntu, vhutu (South Africa); humhunu/ubuthosi (Zimbabwe); bumuntu (Tanzania); and umuntu (Uganda). Literature shows that if embraced and advocated for, Umunthu plays a positive and influential role in mainstreaming and dealing with mental health issues in communitarian societies where the Umunthu ideals are part of the social fabric. However, in the case of Covid-19 and mental health in Malawi, the paper argues that Covid-19 preventive measures, particularly self -isolation when Covid-19 positive; maintaining social distance at all times; and reducing the number of people gathered at funerals, challenge Umunthu ideals, which have in the past been crucial in reducing stress, trauma and anxiety. This original paper bases its arguments on empirical data collected in a study conducted in Mangochi, Blantyre, Karonga and Lilongwe. Based on the study's findings, the paper highlights that although Covid-19 preventative measures have been globally embraced, it is also a limiting factor in the quest for mental health in societies with communitarian value systems.

TI  - Where are we going with sentinel nodes mapping in ovarian cancer?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node involvement is a major predictive indicator in early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). There is presently no effective way to determine lymph node involvement other than surgical staging. As a result, traditional ovarian cancer surgery still includes pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. However, it might be linked to higher blood loss, lengthier operations, and longer hospital stays. The creation of a technique for accurately predicting nodal status without significant lymphadenectomy is thus the subject of ongoing research. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) mapping is a routine procedure in oncological surgery and has been proven to be effective and safe in cervical, vulvar, and uterine cancer. On the other hand, SLN mapping is not yet widely accepted and recognized in EOC. A thorough search of the literature was conducted between January 1995 to March 2022, using PubMed and Embase. This review included studies on lymphatic outflow of the ovaries and the sentinel lymph node method. A total of 13 studies involving 212 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node mapping for ovaries were included. Both open and laparoscopic approach are used. The most popular injection site is the ovarian ligaments, and a variety of agents are utilized, although the main markers were, technetium-99m radiocolloid (Tc-99m) or indocyanine green, either alone or in combination. Overall detection rate for SLN in ovaries is 84.5% (interquartile range: 27-100%). We suggest a standardized method for sentinel lymph node mapping in ovarian cancer. The detection rates, characterization and true positive rates of the approach in investigations support further study. The use of ultra-staging is essential for lower-volume metastasis and reproducibility. To ascertain the clinical utility of sentinel node in early ovarian cancer, larger collaborative prospective clinical trials are necessary.

TI  - Crested Guineafowl and samango monkey associations
T2  - AFRICAN ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Associations between animals of different species have been observed for a large variety of taxa. These polyspecific groups are thought to provide advantages to at least one of the species involved, especially foraging benefits or reduced predation risk. In the case of primate-bird associations, both foraging benefits and reduced predation risk have been suggested. We investigated whether flocks of Crested Guineafowl (Guttera edouardi) join groups of samango monkeys (Cercopithecus albogularis schwarzi) and examined benefits to the birds. Using behavioural data, we tested (1) whether Crested Guineafowl associate with samango monkeys for a longer period of time than can be expected by chance, using a movement simulation model, and (2) whether Crested Guineafowl show differences in foraging and predation risk behaviour and habitat selection in relation to vegetation cover in the presence of samango monkeys. Observations were done in the Soutpansberg Mountain Range, South Africa. We found that (1) Crested Guineafowl join samango monkeys for a longer period of time than expected by chance, and (2) Crested Guineafowl show significantly less sentinel behaviour with samango monkeys present. These findings suggest that the birds experience reduced predation risk in the presence of the monkeys. Our study is the first to report association between Crested Guineafowl and samango monkeys and contributes to understanding why birds and primates associate.

TI  - Spectral changing during a massive bloom event of<i> Dinophysis</i> cf.<i> accuminata</i> in south Brazil
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are deleterious ecological phenomena that can severely impact coastal ecosystems, fisheries resources, and public health worldwide. Different HABs species have distinct spectral characteristics due to the specific absorption of their accessory pigments, allowing us to monitor them through remote sensing. In June 2016, a massive Dinophysis cf. acuminata bloom hit the southern Brazilian coast causing damage to the local mariculture along its trajectory. In order to observe its passage and evolution, we performed weekly sampling cruises in the coastal waters of Parana, Brazil. Remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data were performed with FieldSpec ASD, along with oceanographic variables (water temperature, salinity, Secchi depths, chlorophyll fluorescence, and particulate matter concentration). Satellite images from MODIS and OLI were used to quantify the magnitude of the HAB. During its peak, the bloom reached an area of 201 km2 along the Parana coast with abundances of 6.85 x 106 cells.L-1, the highest cell density ever recorded for this species. The event was associated with low salinity and temperature from a high chlorophyll plume from the La Plata River. The in situ Rrs were grouped by hierarchical clustering, separating the spectral signature of the Dinophysis bloom through principal component analysis. The same spectral shape was observed in the K-means clustering of both MODIS and OLI images, attesting to the method's suitability. We address the first characterization of a Dinophysis bloom, and the results can contribute to a better understanding of the spectral response of this toxic dinoflagellate and optimize the satellite algorithms for the detection of HABs.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Gender influences molecular and histological biomarkers in mature oysters<i> Crassostrea</i><i> gasar</i> (Adanson, 1757) after pyrene exposure
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oysters are frequently used as sentinel organisms for monitoring effects of contaminants due to their sessile, filtering habits and bioaccumulation capacity. These animals can show elevated body burden of contaminants, such as pyrene (PYR). PYR can be toxic at a molecular level until the whole oyster, which can show reproductive and behavioral changes. Considering that biologic parameters, such as gender or reproductive stage can interfere in the toxic effects elicited by contaminants uptake, the aim of this study was to evaluate some molecular and histological responses in females and males of oyster Crassostrea gasar exposed to PYR (0.25 and 0.5 mu M) for 24 h at the pre-spawning stage. PYR concentrations were analyzed in water and in tissues of female and male oysters. Gene transcripts related to biotransformation (CYP3475C, CYP2-like, CYP2AU1, CYP356A, GSTO-like, GSTM-like, SULT-like), stress (HSP70), and reproduction (Vitellogenin, Glycoprotein) were quantified in gills. In addition, histological analysis and histo-localization of CYP2AU1 mRNA transcripts in gills, mantle and digestive diver-ticulum were carried out. Females and males in pre-spawning stage bioconcentrated PYR in their tissues. Males were more sensitive to PYR exposure. CYP2AU1 transcripts were higher in males (p < 0.05), as well as tubular atrophy was observed only in males exposed to PYR (p < 0.05). As expected, vitellogenin transcripts were lower in males (p < 0.05). Given these results, it is suggested that levels of CYP2AU1 be a good biomarker of exposure to PYR in oyster C. gasar and that it is important to consider the gender for the interpretation of biomarker responses.

TI  - Lithology mapping with satellite images, fieldwork-based spectral data, and machine learning algorithms: The case study of Beiras Group (Central Portugal)
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological remote sensing has been an invaluable means to obtain data to perform geological mapping objectively and with high accuracy. However, there is a significant gap in geological cartography information at 1:50 000 scale throughout the territory in mainland Portugal. The lack of geological mapping is reflected in the geological resources and land management information. This investigation's main objective was to assess the viability of using remote sensing, machine learning and geochemical techniques as proof of concept for the Portuguese context using the Beiras Group (mainland Portugal) as a case study area of 341 km2. Multispectral analysis was carried out in two Landsat-8 images of 2015, one in the winter and the other in the summer. Hyperspectral data were obtained using a 400-1000 nm spectroradiometer applied to 23 rock samples collected in two field campaigns - the first in January and the second in April 2019. Spectral differences were found distinguishing the two main lithological units, where the granites (Granito de Coentral and Granito de Vila Nova) had an increasing wavelength spectra shape throughout the whole VNIR measurements. Geochemical data was carried out using X-ray Fluorescence, where the average quantity of major elements such as Na2O [2.15 %] and CaO [0.41 %] was higher in granites than metasediments: 0.38 % and 0.11 %, respectively. The J48 machine learning algorithm was performed using as input Landsat-8 reflectance data which showed a high success rate in both confusion matrixes (83,72 % and 94,08 %).

TI  - Variability index of solar resource based on data from surface and satellite
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing solar resource variability is paramount for its thermal and photovoltaic applications. Cloudiness is the main parameter that modulates both the intensity and frequency of variations in solar irradiance on the ground surface. This work introduces an objective index to quantify the temporal variability of the incoming solar irradiance on the surface, defined as Cloudless Percentage Days (CPD). This index accounts for the number of days classified as clear and stable (i.e., high clearness coefficient and decreased frequency of ramps of incoming solar irradiance). Two methods were developed to quantify CPD, the first based on ground measurements and the other based on satellite data. This work compares the results achieved with the two methods to understand their consistency. Monthly and annual maps were drawn for the Brazilian territory characterizing solar resource variability.

TI  - Impacts of burn severity on short-term postfire vegetation recovery, surface albedo, and land surface temperature in California ecoregions
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire burn severity has important implications for postfire vegetation recovery and boundary-layer climate. We used a collection of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets to investigate the impact of burn severity (relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio, RdNBR) on vegetation recovery (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI), albedo change, and land surface temperature in seven California ecoregions, including: Southern California Mountains (SCM), Southern California Coast (SCC), Central California Foothills (CCF), Klamath (K), Cascades (C), Eastern Cascades (EC), and Sierra Nevada (SN). A statewide MODIS-derived RdNBR dataset was used to analyze the impact of burn severity on the five-year postfire early-summer averages of each biophysical variable between the years 2003-2020. We found that prefire EVI values were largest, and prefire albedo and temperature were lowest in the K, C, EC, and SN ecoregions. Furthermore, the largest changes between prefire and first-year postfire biophysical response tended to occur in the moderate and high burn severity classes across all ecoregions. First-year postfire albedo decreased in the K, C, EC, and SN but increased in the SCM, SCC, and CCF ecoregions. The greatest decreases, but most rapid recovery, of EVI occurred after high severity fires in all ecoregions. After five-years post-fire, EVI and land surface temperature did not return to prefire levels in any burn severity class in any ecoregion.

TI  - Sentinel responses of Arctic freshwater systems to climate: linkages, evidence, and a roadmap for future research
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - While the sentinel nature of freshwater systems is now well recognized, widespread integration of freshwater processes and patterns into our understanding of broader climate-driven Arctic terrestrial ecosystem change has been slow. We review the current understanding across Arctic freshwater systems of key sentinel responses to climate, which are attributes of these systems with demonstrated and sensitive responses to climate forcing. These include ice regimes, temperature and thermal structure, river baseflow, lake area and water level, permafrost-derived dissolved ions and nutrients, carbon mobilization (dissolved organic carbon, greenhouse gases, and radiocarbon), dissolved oxygen concentrations, lake trophic state, various aquatic organisms and their traits, and invasive species. For each sentinel, our objectives are to clarify linkages to climate, describe key insights already gained, and provide suggestions for future research based on current knowledge gaps. We suggest that tracking key responses in Arctic freshwater systems will expand understanding of the breadth and depth of climate-driven Arctic ecosystem changes, provide early indicators of looming, broader changes across the landscape, and improve protection of freshwater biodiversity and resources.

TI  - Landslide identification using machine learning techniques: Review, motivation, and future prospects
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The WHO (World Health Organization) study reports that, between 1998-2017, 4.8 million people have been affected by landslides with more than 18000 deaths. The prevailing climate change and erratic high intensity rainfall are expected to trigger more landslides, which can increase the death rates per year in future. Therefore, evolving successful mechanisms to identify and predict landslides is critical in risk reduction and post-disaster management activities. With the applications of Machine Learning , the success rates of landslide identification have been improved significantly. This review paper presents the results of data analysis on the papers published for the last three decades on varying degrees of reliability and success rate on the theme "Machine Learning for landslide identification, mitigation, and prediction". The analyses show how the reliability and accuracy of the landslide prediction model have improved considerably with the tools available in Machine Learning. Though many conventional tools such as statistical packages are available, the Machine Learning algorithms gave a robust dimension for a reliable landslide risk analysis, modeling prediction tools and post-disaster damage identification, This paper recommends a multi-modal framework for characterising landslides in all aspects using Machine Learning techniques that could outperform single modal approaches. Open research problems and future research dimensions by integrating landsat data and Machine Learning for landslide studies are also discussed in this work which would be beneficial for researchers in this field and also to the community at large across the globe.

TI  - Vaccine Effectiveness Against Influenza A(H3N2)-Associated Hospitalized Illness: United States, 2022
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 2021-2022 US influenza season, circulating A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically different than the vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalized illness was 26% (95% CI: -14-52%) for adults 18-64-years and -3% (95% CI: -54-31) for adults >= 65-years.Background The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with historically low influenza circulation during the 2020-2021 season, followed by an increase in influenza circulation during the 2021-2022 US season. The 2a.2 subgroup of the influenza A(H3N2) 3C.2a1b subclade that predominated was antigenically different from the vaccine strain. Methods To understand the effectiveness of the 2021-2022 vaccine against hospitalized influenza illness, a multistate sentinel surveillance network enrolled adults aged >= 18 years hospitalized with acute respiratory illness and tested for influenza by a molecular assay. Using the test-negative design, vaccine effectiveness (VE) was measured by comparing the odds of current-season influenza vaccination in influenza-positive case-patients and influenza-negative, SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, adjusting for confounders. A separate analysis was performed to illustrate bias introduced by including SARS-CoV-2-positive controls. Results A total of 2334 patients, including 295 influenza cases (47% vaccinated), 1175 influenza- and SARS-CoV-2-negative controls (53% vaccinated), and 864 influenza-negative and SARS-CoV-2-positive controls (49% vaccinated), were analyzed. Influenza VE was 26% (95% CI: -14% to 52%) among adults aged 18-64 years, -3% (-54% to 31%) among adults aged >= 65 years, and 50% (15-71%) among adults aged 18-64 years without immunocompromising conditions. Estimated VE decreased with inclusion of SARS-CoV-2-positive controls. Conclusions During a season where influenza A(H3N2) was antigenically different from the vaccine virus, vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of influenza hospitalization in younger immunocompetent adults. However, vaccination did not provide protection in adults >= 65 years of age. Improvements in vaccines, antivirals, and prevention strategies are warranted.

To fill this knowledge gap, we use time-series satellite images to map annual greenspace distribution across eight host cities of the Summer Olympics between 1988 and 2016, and quantify changes in greenspace coverage, exposure, and landscape before and after the games. By further applying a difference-in-differences model, we unravel the underlying causal impacts of Olympic Games on urban greening. Results show that Olympic Games not only promote overall in-creases in greenspace coverage but also enhance people's ambient exposure to greenspace, of which the influ-encing magnitude is more evident nearby Olympic venues and the associated buffers. We also find urban greenspace landscape generally becomes more irregular and disaggregated after the Games. Statistically, Olympic-associated urban modifications directly contribute to a 3.41 % increment in greenspace coverage within the urban extent (p < 0.01). Our findings indicate the widespread Olympic effects on reshaping urban green -spaces, which provide new insights on maintaining Olympic sustainability and facilitating green city development.

TI  - Can urban green space water planes be quantified? A new way of thinking about landscape planning and design
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water bodies in urban green spaces are important parts of urban landscapes, and their planar shapes are an important factor governing the creation of waterfront landscapes. To improve the aesthetics and functionality of water bodies, this paper takes Nanjing as an example for analysis to investigate whether it is possible to scientifically quantify the planar shape of urban green space water bodies. First, water bodies meeting the conditions within the municipal area were selected as the study objects for classification. Second, in view of the lack of theoretical and innovative problems in previous studies, the use of fractal theory was proposed to improve the scientificity. Finally, remote sensing data images were used to extract water body planes, and the fractal dimensions were calculated and quantitatively evaluated by coupling the box dimension method with fractal theory. The results show that the fractal dimension could be used as a quantitative parameter to determine the planar morphology of water bodies in urban green spaces, and the fractal dimension value is positively correlated with the complexity of the water body, which can be used for both quantitative assessment of the landscape aesthetics of existing water bodies in urban green spaces and theoretical support for the future design of water planar morphology.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water-salt and its topographic gradient effects on Alpine area over the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water-salt variations at different spatiotemporal scales and their influencing factors are essential for regional vegetation restoration and management. However, the study of soil water-salt of the alpine area has not taken into account the effect of topography, especially in the long time series. This work investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of water and salt in topsoil from 2000 to 2021, using regression analysis of on-site data and MODIS products. The heterogeneity and trends of soil water-salt in various topographic factors (elevation, slope, and aspect) were also explored by selecting the maximum area of each gradient factor as the constrained condition with the help of ArcGIS software. The results revealed that 1) the models applied to SWC (soil water content), EC (electrical conductivity), and pH utilizing vegetation indices were suitable for estimating the spatiotemporal variations of soil water-salt. 2) Soil water-salt exhibited local aggregation characteristics with an upward trend in SWC and a downward trend in EC and pH as a whole. 3) Mean annual SWC peaked at 3,400-3,800 m with increasing elevation and trended downward with increasing slope. The aspect of mean annual SWC was characterized by lower values in the southwest and south and higher values in the north, while the results for pH were reversed. The slope had a greater influence on EC than on SWC and pH. 4) The trend change of SWC, EC, and pH fluctuated at 2000-2,400 m and >4,600 m with a clear inflection point at 4 degrees-8 degrees and 20 degrees-24 degrees, respectively. In summary, the effects of topography responded to the distribution and trends of soil water-salt. The results have significant implications for implementing ecological improvements in regions with complicated topography and can serve as a reference for formulating future ecological policies.

TI  - Effective delineation of rare metal-bearing granites from remote sensing data using machine learning methods: A case study from the Umm Naggat Area, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Albitized granite (ABG) is considered as one of the most significant hosts of rare metals (RMs). Consequently, adequate recognition of ABG through proper lithological discrimination highly increases the targeting of rare metal resources. In order to delineate outcrops of ABG from satellite data, our study integrates eight image enhancement techniques, including optimum index factor, false color composites, band rationing, relative band depth, independent component analysis, principal component analysis, decorrelation stretch, minimum noise fraction transform, and spectral indices ratios, for the interpretation of ASTER and Sentinel-2 (S2) datasets. This integrated approach allows the effective discrimination of AGB outcrops in the Umm Naggat area, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt. The interpretation maps derived from these integrated image processing techniques were systematically verified in the field and formed the base for the feature selection process (i.e., training and testing data delineation) of different lithologies supported by the support vector machine algorithm (SVM). In order produce a high-quality lithological interpretation map, SVM was applied to Sentinel-2, ASTER, and combined ASTER-S2 datasets. The fused ASTER-S2 classification properly delineates ABG, as verified by our field vestigations and confirmed by previous geological maps. Furthermore, comprehensive structural analysis (lin-eaments extraction and their density map) and hydrothermal alteration detection were performed to check the spatial association between the distribution of ABG, higher density zones, and highly altered areas, that in turn, could shed light on new potentially mineralized zones and proposed exploration targets. Our study reveals new ABG occurrences mainly situated in the southern and southwestern parts of the study area, and it confirms the location of known mineralized zones in the northern part of the Umm Naggat region. The distribution of ABG and its spatial correlation with alteration and high structural density zones suggest that rare-metal mineralization mostly structurally controlled (NW, NNW, NNE, and N-S), demonstrating the higher possibility of metasomatic enrichment of rare-metals within the study area. Our study provides an updated geological map of the study area based on the SVM-supported interpretation of ASTER-S2 data. Importantly, the results reveal a high exploration potential for rare-metal mineralization at Umm Naggat and defining new anomalies for follow-up work geochemical soil surveys.

TI  - Angiosarcoma of the breast with hypofibrinogenemia: A rare case report and review of the literature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundBreast angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor, accounting for approximately 0.04% of all breast malignancies. Angiosarcoma of the breast with hypofibrinogenemia is even rarer and has not been described in man. Breast angiosarcoma is associated with high metastatic potential and poor prognosis, and there is no specific manifestation in imaging. At present, surgery is considered to be the only effective treatment. There is no unified standard for postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Case PresentationA 30-year-old female patient underwent left breast mass resection under local anesthesia on May 22, 2014. Postoperative pathology showed a vasogenic tumor. On November 10, 2017, she visited us again due to left breast swelling and pain during lactation, and underwent breast mass puncture. She was diagnosed with breast hematoma and fibrinogen reduction. On November 14, 2017, mastectomy was performed under tracheal intubation and general anesthesia, and the fibrinogen gradually returned to normal after surgery. Pathological examination showed a hemangiosarcoma with hematoma formation in the left breast. According to the pathological findings and after comprehensive evaluation, the patient underwent modified radical mastectomy for left breast cancer and right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy on December 5, 2017. The patient died on January 28, 2018 due to rupture and hemorrhage of liver cancer and hemorrhagic shock. ConclusionBreast angiosarcoma with hypofibrinogenemia is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy. Clinicians should be familiar with its clinicopathological features and diagnostic criteria. Multidisciplinary approach is recommended to benefit the patients.

TI  - The Relationship Between Psychosocial Interventions and Child Wellbeing in Zambia
T2  - CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychosocial factors contribute to persistence of poverty, but are rarely addressed in poverty reduction reduction programs. We use mixed methods to investigate the relationship between a psychosocial behaviour change approach-empowered worldview (EWV), and investment decisions in children wellbeing among smallholder farmers in Zambia. Three years after exposure to EWV, logistic regression model results suggest that exposure to EWV was associated with an increased probability of parents providing basic needs of children including school fees, clothes, and food. This probability increased with more trainings. Using a matched sample, the average treatment effect on the treated of EWV is positive and statistically significant. Qualitative results reveal EWV enhanced participant agency, spouses' propensity to work together and with others in the community, and aspirations for themselves and their children. These results point to the prevalence of psychosocial constraints and the need for interventions to sustainably address them to support human development.

TI  - Analysis of the effect of seasonal changes on sensitive parameters of LAI-based Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration model based on particle swarm algorithm
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing researches for leaf area index (LAI)-based Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration (ET) model (PML) are mostly carried out at yearly scale and the analysis of effects of seasonal change and different underlying surface conditions on model parameters is scarce. This study emphasizes on the influences of seasonal change and diverse land surface conditions on ET by optimizing the sensitive parameters, namely soil evaporation coefficient f and maximum stomatal conductance g(sx), with particle swarm algorithm. This analysis is based on the observations of eight flux stations in China. The model performance is reasonable with a best Pearson r of 0.87. The seasonal calibration results indicate parameters change evidently in different seasons and have obvious spatial heterogeneity. The seasonal calibration method has an obvious effect on improving the ET accuracy in spring, which is mostly influenced by regional temperature and relative humidity. This study further demonstrates the need to dynamically adjust model parameters over time with PML model for evapotranspiration simulations, rather than simply setting these parameters to constants depended on subsurface conditions such as land use type.

TI  - Radar reflector guided axillary surgery in node positive breast cancer patients
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction In patients with non-palpable breast cancer, the availability of wireless localization techniques facilitates removal of the target lesion. One such technique uses a radar reflector for localization (RRL). This study evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of RRL to guide excision of axillary lymph nodes in patients with node-positive breast cancer. Methods Our Breast Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with breast cancer, between 5/2017 and 10/2021, who underwent preoperative placement of a radar reflector into a biopsy proven axillary lymph node. Clinicopathologic data were reported using descriptive statistics. Results Twenty patients underwent preoperative placement of a radar reflector into the axilla. Intraoperatively, the clip and radar reflector were successfully removed in all patients. Among the 10 patients treated with NAC, 5 patients achieved an axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) and were spared a complete axillary lymph node dissection (cALND). Among the entire cohort, RRL resulted in a 53% reduction in the number of lymph nodes removed. Conclusions Wireless localization of axillary lymph nodes is safe and feasible. The technique ensures excision of biopsy proven positive axillary lymph nodes and enables a targeted approach to assessing the axilla, both in the setting of NAC and upfront surgery.

TI  - Assessment of land use-land cover changes using GIS, remote sensing, and CA-Markov model: a case study of Algiers, Algeria
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes the spatio-temporal change of land use and the regression of agricultural and forest areas in the capital of Algeria "Algiers." A methodology based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and remote sensing to process and analyze a series of satellite images from 1987 to 2018 was used to categorize the soil into urban, agricultural, forestry, and water areas. In addition, a spatio-temporal simulation was performed to predict and assess changes in each land use class by 2040. These approaches were supported by a field survey of the entire study area to determine the price and availability of buildable land. Results indicated an increase in urban areas at the expense of agricultural and forest areas. This expansion is randomly driven by poor management and the need to meet increasing housing demand. Also, land prices are lower on the periphery than in the center, while the population is increasing remarkably from year to year and requires both public (roads, schools, hospitals) and private (housing, investments) facilities. The prediction model revealed a 69% urbanization of the study area by 2040 and an abusive consumption of agricultural and forest areas in urban zones. In short, this rate threatens the remaining agricultural and forest areas in the study area. These predicted results are only valid if the studied variables used in this research (demographic evolution, development of infrastructures, and socio-economic facilities) remain unchanged over the next 20 years, since the scenario considered in this research is based on a linear logic linked to past trends.

TI  - FCD-R2U-net: Forest change detection in bi-temporal satellite images using the recurrent residual-based U-net
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest changes caused by fires, clear-cuts, and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes have negatively affected the climate, wildlife, and global ecosystem. By monitoring the forest changes, managers and planners can make appropriate decisions to preserve these natural areas. In this regard, this paper presents a novel deep learning-based forest change detection method including two main steps: (1) producing a new difference image enabling a more efficient distinction of changed and unchanged areas, and (2) generating a reliable forest change map by applying the recurrent residual-based U-Net deep neural network (R2U-Net) on the difference image. The recently introduced forest fused difference image (FFDI) is first improved by modifying its weighted angular operator as well as applying the fast local laplacian filter (FLLF) to generate an enhanced forest fused difference image (EFFDI). R2U-Net is subsequently used to segment the EFFDI into the changed and unchanged regions because it preserves their geometric shapes more effectively than other U-net variants. To assess the efficacy of the presented method, experimental results were conducted on four bi-temporal images acquired by the Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 satellite sensors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed EFFDI in reflecting the true forest changes from the background. Moreover, compared with the other conventional U-Net-based models, including U-Net, ResU-Net, and U-Net ++, forest changes and their geometrical details were better preserved by R2U-Net. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperformed the other state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised change detection methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative results, demonstrating its high potential for forest change detection applications.

TI  - A web-based system for satellite-based high-resolution global soil moisture maps
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, a wide range of applications require near-real-time Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) data at high spatial resolution. However, operational passive microwave systems like SMOS and SMAP can only acquire such information at a relatively coarser resolution. Therefore, several downscaling algorithms have been developed to address this issue and provide SSM maps at a finer spatial scale. Users may, however, find it difficult to implement the downscaling algorithm due to the complexity of integrating various data sources. Disaggregation based on Physical and Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) is one of the algorithms that is widely accepted to downscale passive microwave SSM observations. But the complexity of modeling, the variety of data sources and formats of input data make it very difficult for users to implement the algorithm. Thus, we developed a Satellitebased Hydrological Monitoring System (SHMS), which facilitates this gap through the implementation of the DisPATCh algorithm to generate large-scale SSM maps with high resolution, which is achieved by combining SMAP and MODIS products. The System Usability Scale (SUS) method was used to evaluate the system's strengths and weaknesses. The SUS evaluation results show that 74.75% of SHMS users are satisfied with the system's performance.

TI  - Sentinel node restoration by vascularized lymph node transfer in mice
T2  - MICROSURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Recent reports have indicated that vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) may improve the impaired immunity in lymphedema but there has been no report concerning anti-cancer immunity. In the early tumor immune response, dendritic cells (DCs) participate in tumor recognition and antigen presentation in local lymphatics. Here, we investigated the impact of VLNT on DC dynamics against cancer in mouse models. Methods Forty-seven 8-week-old C57BL/6 N male mice were divided into three surgical groups: a VLNT model in which a vascularized inguinal lymph node (LN) flap was transferred into the ipsilateral fossa after a popliteal LN was removed; a LN dissection (LND) model in which the popliteal LN was dissected; and a control model in which a skin incision was made at the popliteal fossa and an ipsilateral inguinal LN was removed. Postoperative lymphatic flows were observed by indocyanine green lymphography and B16-F10-luc2 mouse melanoma were implanted into the ipsilateral footpad. The proportion of DCs in the transplanted nodes was measured by CD11c immunohistochemistry using digital imaging analysis 4 days after cancer implantation. Metastases to the lungs and LNs were quantitatively evaluated by luciferase assay 4 weeks after cancer implantation. Results After VLNT, lymphatic reconnection was observed in 59.2% of mice. The proportion of DCs was significantly higher in the VLNT group with lymphatic reconnection (8.6% +/- 1.0%) than in the naive LN (4.3% +/- 0.4%) (p < .001). The tumor burden of lung metastases was significantly less in the VLNT group with lymphatic reconnection compared with the LND group (p = .049). Conclusions Metastasis decreased in mice with reconnected lymphatics after VLNT. A possible explanation was that lymphatic restoration may have contributed to the tumor immune response by allowing DC migration to LNs.

TI  - A low-cost active reflector and a passive corner reflector network for assisting landslide monitoring using multi-temporal InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A C-band Low-cost Active Reflector (AR) has been tested in a real experimental campaign aimed at monitoring through multi-temporal InSAR an area threatened by a landslide that occurred in 2019. To monitor and characterize the movement, a network of eight Passive Corner Reflectors and one Active Reflector were installed along a forested slope. A set of 285 interferograms obtained combining 60 Sentinel-1 SAR images were processed to evaluate the stability of the area. The AR, installed in a stable location close to the landslide, was used to provide a reference point in this low coherence area. Despite the high sensitivity of the phase response of such devices to temperature changes, the device operates with a stability of +/- 2 mm in deformation retrieval, a value acceptable for monitoring purposes, with a moderate range of temperature values.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with endometrial hyperplasia: A practice to preserve or abandon?
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To compare outcomes of patients with premalignant endometrial pathology undergoing hysterec-tomy with or without sentinel lymph node (SLN) removal. Outcomes of interest included surgical adverse events (AEs), cancer status on final pathology, postoperative treatment, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular risk profiles.Methods. We retrospectively identified patients with premalignant pathology on preoperative endometrial biopsy who underwent hysterectomy with or without SLN mapping/excision at our institution from 01/01/ 2017-12/31/2021. Clinical, pathologic, surgical, and TCGA profiling data were abstracted. Appropriate statistical tests were used.Results. Of 221 patients identified, 161 (73%) underwent hysterectomy with SLN excision and 60 (27%) un-derwent hysterectomy without SLN excision. Median age and body mass index were similar between groups. Median operative time was 130 min for those who underwent SLN mapping/excision versus 136 min for those who did not (p = 0.6). Thirty-day postoperative AE rates were 9% (n =15/161) and 13% (n = 8/60), respectively (p = 0.9). Ninety-eight (44%) of 221 patients had grade 1-2 endometrioid endometrial cancer on final pathology (4 [4%] were stage IB or higher). Ten (10%) of 98 patients, all within the SLN group, received adjuvant treatment. Among all patients, of 33 (15%) with TCGA molecular classification data, 27 (82%) had copy number-low, 3 (9%) microsatellite instability-high, 2 (6%) POLE-ultramutated, and 1 (3%) copy number-high disease.Conclusions. SLN assessment appears safe, detects a small number of occult nodal metastases for those upstaged, and provides additional staging information that can guide adjuvant treatment. SLN mapping should be discussed in preoperative counseling and offered using a shared decision-making approach.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on the Clinical Features of Pediatric Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Japan
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The accumulation of susceptible children resulted in a resurgence of RSV, but the increase in hospitalized patients aged >= 2 years was modest. Our results suggest that the majority of primary RSV infections after infancy do not lead to severe symptoms.Background Mitigation measures implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remarkably reduced the incidence of infectious diseases among children. However, a re-emergence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was observed in 2021 in Japan. We compared the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with RSV infection before and during COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively enrolled children aged <6 years who were hospitalized with RSV infection in 18 hospitals and compared their clinical characteristics before (January 2019 to April 2020, 1675 patients) and during COVID-19 (September 2020 to December 2021, 1297 patients). Results The mean age of patients with RSV infection was significantly higher during COVID-19 than before (17.4 vs 13.7 months, P < .001). Compared with before COVID-19, a 2.6-fold increase in RSV cases in the 2-5 years age group was observed from sentinel surveillance during COVID-19, whereas a 1.2-fold increase was noted in the same age group among hospitalized patients. On average for all patients, consolidation shadows obtained on radiography were less frequently observed (26.1 vs 29.6%, P = .04), and reduced respiratory assistance (42.2% vs 48.7%, P < .001) and hospitalization stay (5.7 vs 6.0 days, P < .001) was required in patients with RSV infection during COVID-19. Conclusions Coronavirus disease 2019 and social activity restriction caused epidemiological changes in pediatric RSV infections, and a majority of patients with RSV infection aged >= 2 years did not develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. The RSV symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak were equivalent to or milder than in the previous seasons.

TI  - Integrated modeling to assess the impact of climate change on the groundwater and surface water in the South Aral Sea area
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recession of the South Aral Sea over the last few decades has become a great environmental challenge in Central Asia. Due to declining inflow and irrigation exhaustion, the Amu Darya River vanishes before reaching the South Aral Sea. Therefore, groundwater (GW) has become the vital water source for the South Aral Sea surface water and the local ecosystem. To develop feasible adaptation strategies for water resource management, it is necessary to quantify the GW flux into the South Aral Sea under ongoing climate change. Based on numerical models (MODFLOW and SWAT) and with the support of observed data, remote sensing data, reanalysis data, and the output of Global Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), the hydraulic connection between a shallow aquifer and the lake was investigated and projected for future change. The GW model was calibrated by one in-situ GW well and six Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived GW heads. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GW flow field simulation (MODFLOW) was lower than 0.21 m from 2005 to 2016. Under three shared socioeconomic pathways (sustainable pathway, medium pathway, and fossil-fueled development), the GCMs indicate that the evapotranspiration (ET) experiences the greatest change, and will potentially rise to 602.6 mm/yr by 2100 in fossil-fueled development. While the precipitation and the runoff of the Amu Darya River will both rise slightly, and with the range of 146.4-163.3 mm/yr and 107.8-118.4 m(3)/s from 2021 to 2100 separately, and the increase is mainly during winter. With climate change signals forcing on the historical hydrometeorological data, the simulation result revealed that the GW contributes to more than 78 % of the total influx of water into the lake during 2021-2100, and the predicted GW flux into the lake will slightly rise over time. However, the ET will also increase due to rising temperatures and may gradually outpace the recharge growth. The simulation results indicate that the South Aral Sea may maintain a surface area of 4.47 x 10(3)km(2) in fossil-fueled development, which means it will continue to shrink if there is no human intervention. Therefore, a set of sustainable water resource management methods is urgently needed to preserve the ecological environment of the South Aral Sea and prevent ecological disasters.

TI  - Spatio-temporal drought susceptibility assessment of Ken River Basin, Central India, and its evaluation through river's morphometry
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular monitoring of drought events, watershed characterization, management, and development efforts is crucial for future disaster predictions and mitigation strategies. The drought susceptibility investigation has been carried out in the Ken River Basin of Bundelkhand region, one of the most drought-prone areas in India. Proxies used in the present study are long-term climatological data (rainfall, standardized precipitation index, and aridity index), satellite data (slope, drainage density [DD], distance to river, and normalized difference vegetation index), lithology, lineament density, and groundwater depth. By the analytical hierarchy process, weightage of each factor is assigned according to its importance. Study shows that nearly 48% of the area of the basin experiences moderate to severe drought conditions. In the last five decades, there have been 22 years of extreme drought, with the most extended period being 1972-1974 and the driest year being 2006-2007. Sensitivity analysis reveals that lithology, slope, and DD are the most significant parameters in the susceptibility analysis. Model validation through an artificial neural network demonstrates the model's high accuracy (0.9) and sensitivity with minor errors. An integrated study of drought susceptibility and morphometry is useful for identifying the drought risk hotspots in the basin. The investigation will be helpful in river basin management and disaster management strategies.

TI  - Putin's psychology and nuclear weapons: The fundamentalist mindset
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent threats to use nuclear weapons are grounded in a psychology that is paranoid and also millennialist - that is, focused on an imagined future that will come only after the "good" have vanquished the evil "others." This is a fundamentalist mindset that is not restricted to religious attitudes and is exemplified by past leaders such as Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden. In Putin's worldview, the profound humiliation that he believes the West has inflicted on his sense of self, both as an individual and as a member of the Russian people, is an intolerable injury that must be avenged. In this mindset, violence is a moral imperative. The fundamentalist mindset makes it difficult for a leader like Putin to retreat from a field of battle that has assumed apocalyptic meaning. And because Putin possesses nuclear weapons and has signaled that he might use them if cornered, it is difficult to envision a scenario in which he would agree to a conventional surrender or compromise. Russia must feel it has preserved a respected role in any final settlement, including the shared need to preserve human civilization.

TI  - Changing land surface temperature in response to land use changes in Kashmir valley of northwestern Himalayas
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - LST variability in a region is significantly impacted by changes in LULC. The current study makes use of satellite data to examine the historical link between LULC and LST in Kashmir Valley. Using the Mono-window algorithm method, the study area has seen substantial changes in LST owing to the conversion of various LULC classes. Results reveal that in LULC agriculture has been transformed to horticulture and built up area with around 80% of the area of Kashmir valley seeing a consequent shift in LST patterns from low category of LST to medium and high category LST. These rapid changes can mainly be attributed to changing economic structure, population growth, the resultant increase in settlements and infrastructure activities, and vegetation dynamics. Strong policy measures are needed to mitigate the impacts of rapid land system changes on the environment keeping in view the sensitivity of the mountainous Kashmir Himalayan region.

TI  - Contemporary (1984-2020) fire history metrics for the conterminous United States and ecoregional differences by land ownership
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Remotely sensed burned area products are critical to support fire modelling, policy, and management but often require further processing before use. Aim. We calculated fire history metrics from the Landsat Burned Area Product (1984-2020) across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) including (1) fire frequency, (2) time since last burn (TSLB), (3) year of last burn, (4) longest fire-free interval, (5) average fire interval length, and (6) contemporary fire return interval (cFRI). Methods. Metrics were summarised by ecoregion and land ownership, and related to historical and cheatgrass datasets to demonstrate further applications of the products. Key results. The proportion burned ranged from 0.7% in the Northeast Mixed Woods to 74.1% in the Kansas Flint Hills. The Flint Hills and Temperate Prairies showed the highest burn frequency, while the Flint Hills and the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains showed the shortest TSLB. Compared to private, public land had greater burned area (19 of 31 ecoregions) and shorter cFRI (25 of 31 ecoregions). Conclusions. Contemporary fire history metrics can help characterise recent fire regimes across CONUS. Implications. In regions with frequent fire, comparison of contemporary with target fire regimes or invasive species datasets enables the efficient incorporation of burned area data into decision-making.

TI  - Landscape metrics regularly outperform other traditionally-used ancillary datasets in dasymetric mapping of population
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Population downscaling and interpolation methods are required to produce data which correspond to spatial units used in urban planning, demography, and environmental modeling. Population data are typically aggre-gated at census enumeration units, which can have arbitrary, temporally-evolving boundaries. Previous ap-proaches to imperviousness-based dasymetric mapping ignore cell-level patterning of imperviousness within a spatial unit of prediction, which potentially serve as a strong indicator of population. Landscape metrics derived from imperviousness data offer a promising approach to capture these patterns. In this study, we incorporate landscape metrics derived from impervious cover percentage maps into intelligent dasymetric mapping to downscale population from census tracts to block groups in four states with varying population densities: Connecticut, South Carolina, West Virginia, and New Mexico. We compare the performance of the landscape metrics-based models against two baseline models in all four states across three different time periods. The re -sults show that intelligent dasymetric mapping using landscape metrics generally outperforms the two baseline models. We further compare the performance of landscape metrics as an ancillary source of information for dasymetric mapping against other traditionally-used datasets (e.g., land use, roads, nighttime lights data) in three states (Connecticut, South Carolina, and New Mexico) in 2000. We find that class area, landscape shape index, and number of patches consistently achieve lower error rates than other ancillary datasets in all the three states.

TI  - Assessment of ecological quality in Northwest China (2000-2020) using the Google Earth Engine platform: Climate factors and land use/land cover contribute to ecological quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological quality of inland areas is an important aspect of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The ecological environment of Northwest China is vulnerable to changes in climate and land use/land cover, and the changes in ecological quality in this arid region over the last two decades are not well understood. This makes it more difficult to advance the UN SDGs and develop appropriate measures at the regional level. In this study, we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products to generate remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to examine the relationship between ecological quality and environment in Xinjiang during the last two decades (from 2000 to 2020). We analyzed a 21-year time series of the trends and spatial characteristics of ecological quality. We further assessed the importance of different environmental factors affecting ecological quality through the random forest algorithm using data from statistical yearbooks and land use products. Our results show that the RSEI constructed using the GEE platform can accurately reflect the ecological quality information in Xinjiang because the contribution of the first principal component was higher than 90.00%. The ecological quality in Xinjiang has increased significantly over the last two decades, with the northern part of this region having a better ecological quality than the southern part. The areas with slightly improved ecological quality accounted for 31.26% of the total land area of Xinjiang, whereas only 3.55% of the land area was classified as having a slightly worsen (3.16%) or worsen (0.39%) ecological quality. The vast majority of the deterioration in ecological quality mainly occurred in the barren areas Temperature, precipitation, closed shrublands, grasslands and savannas were the top five environmental factors affecting the changes in RSEI. Environmental factors were allocated different weights for different RSEI categories. In general, the recovery of ecological quality in Xinjiang has been controlled by climate and land use/land cover during the last two decades and policy-driven ecological restoration is therefore crucial. Rapid monitoring of inland ecological quality using the GEE platform is projected to aid in the advancement of the comprehensive assessment of the UN SDGs.

TI  - Estimating the long-term deformation and permanent loss of aquifer in the southern Junggar Basin, China, using InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is the main water source for agricultural irrigation in arid/semi-arid agricultural region. Over -exploitation of groundwater inevitably leads to permanent loss of aquifer and ground subsidence. The oasis agricultural area in the southern Junggar basin (JSOAA) is one of the largest oasis agricultural areas in western China. In this study, we, for the first time, recover the regional-scale ground displacements time-series of JSOAA, using all ALOS-1/PALSAR (2007-2010) and Sentinel-1 (2015-2020) data. The results show that there are multiple subsidence areas related to groundwater overexploitation. From 2007 to 2010, the area with a subsi-dence rate greater than 10 mm/yr is about 5876.2 km2, accounting for 13.2 % of the total area of JSOAA. From 2015 to 2020, these values are about 16146.7 km2 and 36.3 %. In the areas with concentrated groundwater exploitation, the small separate subsidence areas grew larger and became connected, and finally developed into giant subsidence clusters. The maximum cumulative deformation of JSOAA exceeded 400 mm from 2007 to 2010, and 500 mm from 2015 to 2020. We modeled the surface subsidence caused by the permanent aquifer loss, and estimated the volume strain of aquifer in JSOAA. The total volume strain of the aquifer is 2.73 km3 between 2007 and 2020. Moreover, we estimated the aquifer storage coefficient and the net groundwater deficit of JSOAA. The results of this study will serve for JSOAA aquifer health detection, ecological environment stability assessment, and sustainable development of the agricultural economy.

TI  - LST variability and population growth in district of Rawalpindi, Pakistan during 1993-2018: A regional climate model based bias correction approach for LST
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Variability of satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) due to variations in vegetation cover is analyzed using the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite data in district of Rawalpindi, Pakistan during the period of 1993-2018. Analysis was performed over two Tehsils (subdistricts) of district Rawalpindi: Taxila and Rawalpindi. Trends and variability in LST are examined using the probability density functions (PDFs). The 10th and 90th percentile (P10 and P90) of PDFs were computed to assess the lower and upper LST percentile differences for both Tehsils. It is noted that DP90(2 018-1993) > DP10(2018-1993), implying more warming in higher temperatures as compared to that in lower temperatures during the study period for Tehsil Taxila only. The applicability of a regional climate model (RCM) for bias correction of LST is discussed. A mean and variance-based bias correction was performed by using a RCM Providing REgional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS). Before correction, the LST overestimation approaches to -6.48 degrees C for all years for district Rawalpindi except for the year 1993, however bias corrected overestimation reduces to -4.40 degrees C. Relationship of census data with LST over Tehsil Rawalpindi is somewhat stronger using PRECIS based bias correction. The correlation between LST and Green Vegetation Fraction (GVF) is -0.55; the negative sign indicates a decrease in vegetation cover resulting in an increase of LST.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

AB  - It is imperative to quantitatively analyze the long-term temporal and spatial characteristics of the urban heat island (UHI) effect on cities for applications, such as urban expansion and environmental protection. Owing to the high spatial resolution and availability of long time-series data, remote sensing images from Landsat satellites are widely used for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval. However, limited by the satellite revisit cycle and image quality, the use of multisource Landsat images in a long-term study of the UI II effect is inevitable. Nonetheless, owing to the differences among multisource sensors, such as Landsat-7 and Landsat-8, them may be apparent deviations in the 1ST results retrieved from different sensor data, which are obtained from the same area and under similar circumstances. Consequently, it is necessary to build a relationship between the 1ST results generated from multisource Landsat sensors for future research on the UHI effect.In this study, Shenzhen city was studied to explore the fitting relationship between the corresponding LST products from Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 images obtained from adjacent dates with similar climatic conditions. Furthermore, factors affecting the fitting models, such as land cover types, seasonal and inter-annual differences, were analyzed. The constructed fitting model had a strong relationship with land cover types but a relatively weak relationship with seasonal and inter-annual differences; this indicates that a pseudo Landsat-8-based LST product can be generated from a Landsat-7-based LST product using a model fitted by a Landsat-7/8 pair obtained from adjacent years (or different seasons). Finally, by considering the consistency between LST products from multisource Landsat images, the spatiotemporal variations in the UHI effect in Shenzhen can be accurately explored using long time-series data.

TI  - An R package of maximum entropy production model to estimate 41 years of global evapotranspiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is vital for understanding the global hydrological cycle. However, large uncertainties in the present global ET products originate from the distinct model structures, assumptions, and inputs. The maximum entropy production (MEP) model provides a novel method for modeling ET based on parsimonious inputs and energy conservation. In this study, an R package for MEP (RMEP) was presented to facilitate MEP model implementation. Based on RMEP, a global ET analysis was conducted using inputs from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products during 1978-2018, and the Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen's methods were employed to detect the ET trends. The MEP-estimated average annual global land ET was 517 mm yr(-1) during 1978-2018, and showed a close agreement with eddy-covariance (EC) measurements from 475 flux sites, with a correlation coefficient of 0.74 and root-mean-square error of 26.99 mm mon(-1). The overall performance of MEP was evaluated across various land covers, and a higher ET accuracy was revealed for forestlands, wetlands, and cropland land covers. The MEP-derived ET trend corresponded well with the EC-observed ET trend, and the results indicated that the global land ET declined continuously during 1999-2018. Overall, the MEP model provided an accurate ET estimate with parsimonious inputs, which outperformed the GLDAS-Noah ET product and can serve as a global analytical method for the hydrological cycle and climate change.

TI  - Impact of urban morphology on the microclimatic regulation of water bodies on waterfront in summer: A case study of Wuhan
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban water bodies reduce urban heat through evaporation and transfer of sensible heat. However, today's highly intense urban construction patterns cause poor urban air mobility and excessive residual heat accumulation, and weaken water bodies' regulating effects. This study examines the relationship between urban morphology and water bodies' microclimatic regulation during summer in the water-network city, Wuhan, using remote sensing data and the weather research and forecasting (WRF). This study found (1) on the waterfront, the key impact indicators for microclimate in the waterfront are building density (BD) and floor area ratio (FAR), both of which can lead to higher temperatures and lower humidity, (2) BD significantly warmed the waterfront on the large lakes, while FAR impacted the urban main windway areas, (3) urban development with high FAR significantly suppressed the water's cooling ability in the downtown and main windway areas, with the cooling intensity decreased by 28.7% and 20.6%, respectively, and the cooling distance decreased by 13.5% and 15%. These findings provide insights for the practice of climate adaptive planning and design on the water networkrelated urban areas of Wuhan and other places with similar environments.

TI  - Satellite-Based Discrimination of Urban Dynamics-Induced Local Bias from Day/Night Temperature Trends across the Nile Delta, Egypt: A Basis for Climate Change Impacts Assessment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nile Delta is the most vital region of the desert-dominated country of Egypt. Due to its prominent level of vulnerability to climate change's negative impacts and its low capacity for adaptation and mitigation, the current study aims to provide accurate quantification of temperature change across the Nile Delta as an integral basis for sustainability and climate change impacts assessment studies. This was achieved through monitoring urban dynamics and detecting LST trends in 91 cities and their rural surroundings. The relevant local urban bias was discriminated from regional/background changes present in diurnal/nocturnal temperature records. The temperature records were then corrected/adjusted by removing this urban bias. Owing to the insufficiency of ground-based meteorological observatories, the investigation utilized moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperatures (LSTs) and Landsat-based datasets (2000-2021). The widely used Mann-Kendall test (MKT) and Theil-Sen estimator (TSE) were employed to assess trends in urban sprawl, LST time series, and the implied association. The analysis revealed that the region has experienced dramatic urbanization, where the total urban expansion was greater than two-thirds (69.1%) of the original urban area in 2000. This was accompanied by a notable warming trend in the day/night and urban/rural LST records. The nocturnal LST exhibited a warming tendency (0.072 degrees C year(-1)) larger than the diurnal equivalent (0.065 degrees C year(-1)). The urban dynamics were positively correlated with LST trends, whereas the Mediterranean Sea appeared as a significant anti-urbanization moderator, in addition to the Nile River and the prevailing northerly/northwesterly winds. The urban-rural comparison approach disclosed that the urbanization process caused a warming bias in the nighttime LST trend by 0.017 degrees C year(-1) (21.8%) and a cooling bias in the daytime by -0.002 degrees C year(-1) (4.4%). All results were statistically significant at a confidence level of 99%. It is recommended that studies of climate-related sustainability and climate change impact assessment in the Nile Delta should apply a distinction of urban-induced local effect when quantifying the actual regional temperature change.

TI  - Ground Surface Displacement After a Forest Fire Near Mayya, Eastern Siberia, Using InSAR: Observation and Implication for Geophysical Modeling
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires significantly impact permafrost degradation in the subarctic regions. However, interannual and seasonal variations in surface deformation due to permafrost thawing in burned areas were poorly understood. Measuring the ground surface displacement in fire scars helps us understand the freeze-thaw dynamics of near-surface ground and predict the future state, particularly in ice-rich permafrost regions. This study used the L- and C-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique to reveal interannual subsidence and seasonal thaw settlement/frost heave in a fire scar near Mayya, Sakha Republic in Eastern Siberia burned in 2013. We found that the cumulative subsidence was up to 7 cm between 2014 and 2020, most of which had occurred by 2016. The magnitude of seasonal thaw settlement and frost heave varied each year from 2017 to 2020 after the fire, but the interannual change in frost heave corresponded to the temporal variation in precipitation during the thawing season from 2017 to 2020. This suggests that the precipitation amount during the thawing season is related to the magnitude of segregation-ice formation in the sediments, which determines the frost heave amount. The observed seasonal displacements could not be quantitatively explained by models inferred from the Stefan's equation and volume changes associated with ice-water phase change. This implies that other models associated with segregated ice (ice lens) formation/thaw are required to explain the observed seasonal displacement.Plain Language Summary Forest fires in permafrost regions significantly affect regional landscape changes and ecosystems through permafrost degradation and subsequent ground deformation. However, the number of observations of post forest fire surface displacement is extremely limited. We calculated surface displacement in a fire scar in Eastern Siberia from spaceborne radar images captured using interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Our observed data will help us understand permafrost degradation processes in forest fire scars.

TI  - Dynamics of land use/land cover: implications on environmental resources and human livelihoods in the Middle Awash Valley of Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the recent LULC changes and associated impacts on pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihood systems is important since the effects of LULC changes on environmental resources and human livelihood are not fully understood in our study area. This paper analysed the trend of land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics and its implications on natural resources and human livelihood in the Middle Awash Valley, Central Ethiopian Rift Valley. For the purpose, Landsat imageries of thematic mapper (1987), enhanced thematic mapper (2002) and operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor (2016) were employed and analysed using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) software and techniques, and qualitative data analysis had been performed as well. The results showed that cultivated land expanded at a rate of 2.6% year(-1), whereas forestland and grassland shrunk at a rate of 1.2% year(-1) and 2.4% year(-1), respectively. The invasive Prosopis juliflora has been expanded from 3.7% in 1987 to 37.9% in 2016 at a rate of 1.2% year(-1). The introduction of both small- and large-scale commercial irrigation farming and the implementation of villagization programme focused on transforming pastoralists into sedentary lifestyles. Consequently, irrigation farming, launching of villagization, climate variability as in series of droughts, construction of water dam and the rapid expansion of Prosopis juliflora were the major drivers of LULC changes in the study area. Although we found some positive developments such as improvement on infrastructural and social services (e.g. school and domestic water supply), income diversification and ecological benefits from Prosopis juliflora (e.g. saline soil treatment, carbon sequestration and soil erosion control), there were a range of negative impacts resulting from LULC changes in the study area. LULC changes reduced quality of rangeland resources as the ecologically and economically valuable indigenous tree and grass varieties were significantly degraded. As a result, the traditional pastoral livelihood system has been much vulnerable with the LULC dynamism of the study area. Furthermore, the implementation of the villagization programme has brought socioeconomic impacts on the community and challenges on the ecology, e.g. changing productive rangeland to irrigation crop farms. Our research results, thus, suggest the urgent need for relevant policy interventions in support of the pastoral livelihoods and landscapes with the modification in the implementation of villagization as well as irrigation farming programmes and its better management and controlling Prosopis juliflora expansion in the study area.

TI  - Dynamics of Vegetation Productivity in Relation to Surface Meteorological Factors in the Altay Mountains in Northwest China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation productivity, as the basis of the material cycle and energy flow in an ecosystem, directly reflects the information of vegetation change. At the ecosystem level, the gross primary productivity (GPP) refers to the amount of organic carbon fixed by plant bodies. How to accurately estimate the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation productivity of the forest ecosystem in the Altay Mountains in northwest China has become a critical issue to be addressed. The Altay Mountains, with rich forest resources, are located in a semi-arid climate zone and are sensitive to global climate changes, which will inevitably have serious impacts on the function and structure of forest ecosystems in northwest China. In this paper, to reveal the variation trends of vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) and its response to surface meteorological factors in the Altay Mountains in northwest China, daily temperature and precipitation data from the period of 2000-2017 were collected from seven meteorological stations in Altay prefecture and its surrounding areas; the data were analyzed by using the MODIS GPP model, moving average trend analysis, linear regression analysis and the climate tendency rate method. The results show that: (1) The spatial distribution pattern of GPP in the whole year was almost the same as that in the growing season of vegetation in the Altay Mountains. In the whole mountain range, the proportion of the area which had a GPP value of 400-600 g c/m(2) had the highest value; the proportion of the annual and growing season of this area was 41.10% and 40.88%, respectively, which was mainly distributed in the middle and west alpine areas of the Altay Mountains. (2) There was a big gap in the GPP value in the different stages of the vegetation growing season (April to September), which reached the highest value in July, the area with a GPP of 100-150 g c/m(2) was the highest, with 36.15%. (3) The GPP of the Altay Mountains showed an overall increasing trend, but the annual fluctuation was relatively large. In 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2014, the GPP showed lower values, which were 385.18 g c/m(2), 384.90 g c/m(2), 384.49 g c/m(2) and 393.10 g c/m(2), respectively. In 2007, 2011 and 2016, the GPP showed higher values, which were 428.49 g c/m(2), 428.18 g c/m(2) and 446.61 g c/m(2). (4) In 64.85% of the area of the Altay Mountains, the GPP was positively correlated with annual average temperature, and in 36.56% of the area, the correlation coefficient between temperature and GPP ranged from -0.2 to 0. In 71.61% of the area of the Altay Mountains, the GPP was positively correlated with annual accumulated precipitation, and in 28.39% of the area, the GPP was negatively correlated with annual accumulated precipitation. Under the scenario of global climate change, our study has quantitatively analyzed the long-term dynamics of vegetation GPP and its responses to meteorological factors in the Altay Mountains, which would be helpful for evaluating and estimating the variation trends of forest ecosystems in China, and has important guiding significance for policy formulation to protect forest resources and improve the local ecological environment.

TI  - Machine Learning and Hyperparameters Algorithms for Identifying Groundwater Aflaj Potential Mapping in Semi-Arid Ecosystems Using LiDAR, Sentinel-2, GIS Data, and Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aflaj (plural of falaj) are tunnels or trenches built to deliver groundwater from its source to the point of consumption. Support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) machine learning models were used to predict groundwater aflaj potential in the Nizwa watershed in the Sultanate of Oman (Oman). Nizwa city is a focal point of aflaj that underlies the historical relationship between ecology, economic dynamics, agricultural systems, and human settlements. Three hyperparameter algorithms, grid search (GS), random search (RS), and Bayesian optimisation, were used to optimise the parameters of the XGB model. Sentinel-2 and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data via geographical information systems (GIS) were employed to derive variables of land use/land cover, and hydrological, topographical, and geological factors. The groundwater aflaj potential maps were categorised into five classes: deficient, low, moderate, high, and very high. Based on the evaluation of accuracy in the training stage, the following models showed a high level of accuracy based on the area under the curve: Bayesian-XGB (0.99), GS-XGB (0.97), RS-XGB (0.96), SVM (0.96), and XGB (0.93). The validation results showed that the Bayesian hyperparameter algorithm significantly increased XGB model efficiency in modelling groundwater aflaj potential. The highest percentages of groundwater potential in the very high class were the XGB (10%), SVM (8%), GS-XGB (6%), RS-XGB (6%), and Bayesian-XGB (6%) models. Most of these areas were located in the central and northeast parts of the case study area. The study concluded that evaluating existing groundwater datasets, facilities, current, and future spatial datasets is critical in order to design systems capable of mapping groundwater aflaj based on geospatial and ML techniques. In turn, groundwater protection service projects and integrated water source management (IWSM) programs will be able to protect the aflaj irrigation system from threats by implementing timely preventative measures.

TI  - The Role of Irrigation Expansion on Historical Climate Change: Insights From CMIP6
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - To produce food for a growing world population, irrigated areas have increased from approximately 0.63 million km(2) of land in 1900 to 3.1 million km(2) of land in 2005. Despite this massive expansion, irrigation is still overlooked in most state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) involved in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). To our knowledge, only three CMIP6 models represent irrigation activities: CESM2, GISS-E2-1-G, and NorESM2-LM. Here, we investigate the role of irrigation on historical climate at global and regional scales by analyzing trends of key surface climate variables in CMIP6 simulations during 1900-2014. The three models including irrigation show distinct behavior from the 15 models without irrigation over intensively irrigated areas (i.e., >50% of grid cell area is equipped by irrigation): both annual (months that correspond to monthly air temperature higher than 274 K) mean latent heat flux (LHF) and soil moisture increase over time, in contrast to the models without irrigation that show no trend or even a negative trend. The positive LHF trend over intensively irrigated areas in the irrigation-on models is consistent with three satellite-based LHF products. While annual (considering the warmest month in a year) warming trends are found in these regions for most of the no-irrigation models, the increase in LHF induces a cooling trend for the models with irrigation, which was not confirmed by observational air temperature data sets. These findings, supported by satellite data, indicate the importance of improved representation of land management in the next generation of ESM.

TI  - Novel Index for Hydrological Drought Monitoring Using Remote Sensing Approach: Standardized Water Surface Index (SWSI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the drought indices designed for hydrological drought monitoring use location-specific data, while there are only a handful of indices designed for hydrological drought monitoring using remote sensing data. This study revealed a novel drought index, Standardized Water Surface Index (SWSI), developed for hydrological drought monitoring. The water surface areas required to calculate the SWSI can be extracted from remote sensing data entirely using both the optical (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) and SAR (Sentinel-1). Furthermore, the developed index was applied to five major reservoirs/tanks; Iranamadu, Mahavilachchiya, Kantale, Senanayaka Samudhraya, and Udawalawa, located in Sri Lanka to monitor respective hydrological drought status for the period from 2000 to 2020. Cloud computing platform such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a good basement to use this index effectively, as it can extract long-term water surface area covering a large geographical area efficiently and accurately. The surface water area extraction from satellite data of those tanks shows an accuracy of more than 95%, and in the event of a severe hydrological drought, the water surface area of the tanks is less than 25% of the total and lasts for more than three to four months. It was also determined that in some years, the surface water area of tanks dropped to as low as 7%. The strong correlation observed between the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and SWSI is indicated by the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.58 to 0.67, while the correlation between the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and SWSI ranges from 0.75 to 0.81. Timely drought monitoring over large geographical areas can be more accurately performed with the SWSI index compared to existing hydrological drought monitoring indices. The SWSI could be more useful for areas that do not have measurable field data.

TI  - Flash Flood Hazard Mapping Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques in Southwestern Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash flooding is one of the most significant natural disasters in arid/hyperarid regions and causes vast property damage and a large number of deaths. For mitigating and reducing flood risks, data from several remote sensing satellite images-Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-were prepared and combined through a GIS-based multicriteria decision-making technique to test and delineate the flash flood vulnerable areas of Wadi Hali in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Several flash flood thematic layers representing topographic, geomorphic, climatic, and hydrological conditions were prepared, normalized, and combined through a GIS- based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique to obtain flash flood hazard zones (FFHs). This method successfully presented a satisfactory output map that revealed six zones of flood risk, and areas of extreme hazard covered about 13% of the entire basin. Landsat 8 band composite 7, 5, and 3 and field data validated the FFHs. This map considered a key requirement for sustaining safe settlements downstream of Wadi Hali. Overall, the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques revealed significant areas of flash flood zones in an arid region.

TI  - Routine Processing and Automatic Detection of Volcanic Ground Deformation Using Sentinel-1 InSAR Data: Insights from African Volcanoes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the launch of Sentinel-1 mission, automated processing systems have been developed for near real-time monitoring of ground deformation signals. Here, we perform a regional analysis of 5 years over 64 volcanic centres located along the East African Rift System (EARS). We show that the correction of atmospheric signals for the arid and low-elevation EARS volcanoes is less important than for other volcanic environments. We find that the amplitude of the cumulative displacements exceeds three times the temporal noise of the time series (3 sigma) for 16 of the 64 volcanoes, which includes previously reported deformation signals, and two new ones at Paka and Silali volcanoes. From a 5-year times series, uncertainties in rates of deformation are similar to 0.1 cm/yr, whereas uncertainties associated with the choice of reference pixel are typically 0.3-0.6 cm/yr. We fit the time series using simple functional forms and classify seven of the volcano time series as 'linear', six as 'sigmoidal' and three as 'hybrid', enabling us to discriminate between steady deformation and short-term pulses of deformation. This study provides a framework for routine volcano monitoring using InSAR on a continental scale. Here, we focus on Sentinel-1 data from the EARS, but the framework could be expanded to include other satellite systems or global coverage.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: In breast cancer (BC) patients, the involvement of four or more lymph nodes (LN) is an indication of regional irradiation. The optimal treatment strategy remains unclear when fewer nodes are involved and lymphadenectomy is not performed. We designed a clinical trial to show the non -inferiority of Incidental (INC) compared to intentional (INT) irradiation of axillary nodes in patients with early-stage BC and low burden LN involvement.Materials and methods: BC patients, cN0 (n = 487) undergoing breast conservation surgery and sentinel node biopsy, with total tumor load assessed by OSNA (One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) of 250- 15,000 copies mRNA CK19/lL in sentinel LN were randomized to receive INC or INT nodal irradiation. The primary endpoint was 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints were locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant recurrence (DR), and acute and chronic toxicity (CT).Results: Five-years DFS were 93.7% (INC) and 93.8% (INT) (difference 0.1% [one-sided 95% CI < 5.7%]; non -inferiority p = 0.075). Cumulative Incidences of LRR were 3.5% (INC) and 3.4% (INT) (difference of 0.1% [< 4.8%]; p = 0.021), and 5% (INC) and 3.5% (INT) (difference 1.4% [< 6.0%]; non-inferiority p = 0.101) for DR. CT was more Incident with INT (26.9%) than with INC (19.2%), though the difference was not statis-tically significant (HR 1.39 [95% CI: 0.92, 2.10]; p = 0.11).Conclusion: Intentional does not outperform incidental irradiation by more than 5.7% in terms of 5-year DFS, 4.8% for LRR, and 6% for DR.Registration Number: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02335957.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover Classification in Semi-Arid Areas from Medium-Resolution Remote-Sensing Imagery: A Deep Learning Approach
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) information is of pivotal importance in, e.g., urban/rural planning, disaster management, and climate change adaptation. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a paradigm shift for LULC classification. To date, little research has focused on using DL methods for LULC mapping in semi-arid regions, and none that we are aware of have compared the use of different Sentinel-2 image band combinations for mapping LULC in semi-arid landscapes with deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Sentinel-2 multispectral image bands have varying spatial resolutions, and there is often high spectral similarity of different LULC features in semi-arid regions; therefore, selection of suitable Sentinel-2 bands could be an important factor for LULC mapping in these areas. Our study contributes to the remote sensing literature by testing different Sentinel-2 bands, as well as the transferability of well-optimized CNNs, for semi-arid LULC classification in semi-arid regions. We first trained a CNN model in one semi-arid study site (Gujranwala city, Gujranwala Saddar and Wazirabadtownships, Pakistan), and then applied the pre-trained model to map LULC in two additional semi-arid study sites (Lahore and Faisalabad city, Pakistan). Two different composite images were compared: (i) a four-band composite with 10 m spatial resolution image bands (Near-Infrared (NIR), green, blue, and red bands), and (ii) a ten-band composite made by adding two Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands and four vegetation red-edge bands to the four-band composite. Experimental results corroborate the validity of the proposed CNN architecture. Notably, the four-band CNN model has shown robustness in semi-arid regions, where spatially and spectrally confusing land-covers are present.

TI  - Glacier Changes in India's Dhauliganga Catchment over the Past Two Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid melting of glaciers has led to severe glacial-hydrological hazards in the Himalayas. An extreme example occurred on 7 February 2021, when a catastrophic mass flow descended from the Ronti glacier at Chamoli, Indian Himalaya, causing widespread devastation, with more than 200 people killed or missing, as well as severe damage to four hydropower projects. To disclose what happened to the Ronti glacier over the past several decades, here, we focused on glacier changes in the Dhauliganga catchment in Uttarakhand, India, over the past two decades. Another five glaciers in the catchment were also studied to map the regional detailed glacier changes. Our achievements are summarized as follows. (1) Based on Landsat images, we constructed two glacier inventories for the catchment in 2001 and 2020. We mapped nearly 413 debris-free glaciers in the catchment between 2001 and 2020 and analyzed the glacier area change at basin and altitude levels. (2) Debris-free glacier area decreased from 477.48 +/- 35.23 km(2) in 2001 to 418.52 +/- 36.18 km(2) in 2020, with a reduction of 58.95 km(2) or 12.35% over the past two decades. (3) The geodetic mass balance was -0.27 +/- 0.10 m w.e.a(-1), with a glacier mass change of -0.12 Gt. a(-1) from 2000 to 2013. Based on the surface elevation difference between the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) footprints (acquired from 2018 to 2021) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) DEM from 2000 to 2021, the average glacier geodetic mass balance was -0.22 +/- 0.005 m w.e.a(-1), and glacier mass change was -0.10 Gt a(-1). (4) Our results were cross verified by available published elevation difference datasets covering multiple temporal periods, where mass balance was by -0.22 +/- 0.002 m w.e.a(-1) from 1975 to 2000 and -0.28 +/- 0.0001 w.e.a(-1) from 2000 to 2020. (5) Glacier 1 and Glacier 2, the two largest glaciers in the catchment, experienced a decreasing melt rate from 2000 to 2020, while Glacier 3, Glacier 4, and Glacier 5 demonstrated an increasing melt rate. However, Glacier 6, also known as the collapsed Ronti glacier, had a negative mass balance of -0.04 m w.e.a(-1) from 2000 to 2005 and turned positive from 2005 onward with 0.06 m w.e.a(-1) from 2005 to 2010, 0.19 m w.e.a(-1) from 2010 to 2015, and 0.32 m w.e.a(-1) from 2015 to 2020. We postulate that the Ronti glacier collapsed solely because of the significant mass accumulation observed between 3700 to 5500 m a.s.l. Our study helps to understand the collapsed glacier's mass changes over the past two decades and highlights the necessity to monitor mass-gaining glaciers from space to forecast the risks of disasters.

TI  - Hyperspectral PRISMA and Sentinel-2 Preliminary Assessment Comparison in Alba Fucens and Sinuessa Archaeological Sites (Italy)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decades, remote sensing techniques have contributed to supporting cultural heritage studies and management, including archaeological sites as well as their territorial context and geographical surroundings. This paper aims to investigate the capabilities and limitations of the new hyperspectral sensor PRISMA (Precursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), still little applied to archaeological studies. The PRISMA sensor was tested on Italian terrestrial (Alba Fucens, Massa D'Albe, L'Aquila) and marine (Sinuessa, Mondragone, Caserta) archaeological sites. A comparison between PRISMA hyperspectral imagery and the well-known Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) was performed in order to better understand features and outputs useful to investigate the aforementioned areas. At first, bad bands analysis and noise removal were performed, in order to delete the numerically corrupted bands. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to highlight invisible details in the original image; then, spectral signatures of representative areas were extracted and compared to Sentinel-2 data. At last, a classification analysis (ML and SAM) was performed both on PRISMA and Sentinel-2 imagery. The results showed a full agreement between Sentinel and PRISMA data, enhancing the capability of PRISMA in extrapolating more spectral information and providing a better reliability in the extraction of the features.

TI  - Remote sensing technique and ICONA based-GIS mapping for assessing the risk of soil erosion: A case of the Rudbar Basin, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a major environmental concern because of its devastating effects on agriculture and food production worldwide. In our research, we developed a sophisticated and effective model to predict soil erosion risk and developed a risk map to aid decision making to address earth surface degradation as a means to preserve soil. We describe the modeling process adopting the ICONA (Instituto Nacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza) model, in conjunction with an Analytic Hierarchy Process referred to as the AHP, together with the application of a geodatabase and remote sensing data for the Rudbar basin, Guilan Province, Iran. The basin is highly sensitive to soil erosion. With advances in remote sensing and GIS, challenges of conventional methods can be overcome such as the time-consuming and data-intensive identification of soil erosion-prone areas. The land slope, the lithofacies, land-use/cover, vegetation cover, and a digital elevation model (DEM) were our key layer inputs for the model. The ASTER DEM data were used to extract the land slope layers while the land-use/cover layers were prepared using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from a Landsat 7 ETM + image of the year 2017. Land slope and lithofacies data were used to create soil erodibility map, whereas land-use/-cover, vegetation cover and the DEM were used to create a soil map for soil protection. The erodibility and the soil protection map were then overlapped to create a risk map for soil erosion. Zones of high to very high risk of erosion were identified in a quarter of our study area. We discussed the practical application of the results as a guideline to planning and implementation of effective regional land and water management strategies.

TI  - Presenting the Spatio-Temporal Model for Predicting and Determining Permissible Land Use Changes Based on Drinking Water Quality Standards: A Case Study of Northern Iran
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the effect of non-point source pollution from different land use types (e.g., agricultural lands, pastures, orchards, and urban areas) on stream water quality is critical in determining the extent and type of land use. The relationship between surface water quality as the primary source of drinking water and land use patterns in suburban areas with an accelerated pace of industrial development and progressive growth of population has drawn much attention recently. This study aims to determine the type and portion of the land use changes over three-time intervals from 2000 to 2015 in the Jajrood River Catchment (Tehran metropolis, north of Iran). We used satellite images of Landsat TM and ETM for 2005, 2010, and 2015 to analyze land use changes as a spatiotemporal model. According to the image processing and analysis, we classified the land uses of the study area into irrigated farming, orchards, pastures, and residential areas. In addition, we used temporal data from sampling stations to identify the relationship between land use and water quality based on a multivariate regression model. The analysis shows a significant correlation between the type and extent of land use and water quality parameters, including pH, Na+, Ca+, Mg+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, and TDS. Pastures and residential areas had the highest impact on water quality parameters among all land use types. Besides, we have used the regression analysis results to determine the maximum permissible areas of each land use type. Consequently, effective management strategies such as land use optimization in catchment scale for this catchment and similar areas will help to consciously protect and manage the quality of drinking water resources.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of Dust Sources on Urban Physical Growth and Vegetation Status: A Case Study of Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, dust has created many problems, including negative effects on health, and environmental and economic costs, for people who live both near to and far from sources of dust. The aim of this study is to evaluate and quantify the impact of dust sources located inside Saudi Arabia on the physical growth and vegetation status of cities. In order to do so, satellite data sets, simulated surface data, and soil data for Saudi Arabia from 2000 to 2021 were used. In the first step, a dust sources map of the study area was generated using multi-criteria decision analysis. Land surface temperature (LST), vegetation cover, soil moisture, precipitation, air humidity, wind speed, and soil erodibility factors were considered as effective criteria in identifying dust sources. In the second step, built-up land and vegetation status maps of major cities located at different distances from dust sources were generated for different years based on spectral indicators. Then, the spatiaotemporal change of built-up land and vegetation status of the study area and major cities were extracted. Finally, impacts of major dust sources on urban physical growth and vegetation were quantified. The importance degrees of soil erodibility, wind speed, soil moisture, vegetation cover, LST, air humidity, and precipitation to identify dust sources were 0.22, 0.20, 0.16, 0.15, 0.14, 0.07, and 0.05, respectively. Thirteen major dust sources (with at least 8 years of repetition) were identified in the study area based on the overlap of the effective criteria. The identified major dust sources had about 300 days with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values greater than 0.85, which indicates that these dust sources are active. The location of the nine major dust sources identified in this study corresponds to the location of the dust sources identified in previous studies. The physical growth rates of cities located 400 km from a major dust source (DMDS) are 46.2% and 95.4%, respectively. The reduction rates of average annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in these sub-regions are 0.006 and 0.002, respectively. The reduction rate of the intensity of vegetation cover in the sub-region close to dust sources is three times higher than that of the sub-region farther from dust sources. The coefficients of determination (R-2) between the DMDS and urban growth rate and the NDVI change rate are 0.52 and 0.73, respectively, which indicates that dust sources have a significant impact on the physical growth of cities and their vegetation status.

TI  - Predictive Modeling of Above-Ground Biomass in Brachiaria Pastures from Satellite and UAV Imagery Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland pastures are crucial for the global food supply through their milk and meat production; hence, forage species monitoring is essential for cattle feed. Therefore, knowledge of pasture above-ground canopy features help understand the crop status. This paper finds how to construct machine learning models to predict above-ground canopy features in Brachiaria pasture from ground truth data (GTD) and remote sensing at larger (satellite data on the cloud) and smaller (unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)) scales. First, we used above-ground biomass (AGB) data obtained from Brachiaria to evaluate the relationship between vegetation indices (VIs) with the dry matter (DM). Next, the performance of machine learning algorithms was used for predicting AGB based on VIs obtained from ground truth and satellite and UAV imagery. When comparing more than twenty-five machine learning models using an Auto Machine Learning Python API, the results show that the best algorithms were the Huber with R-2 = 0.60, Linear with R-2 = 0.54, and Extra Trees with R-2 = 0.45 to large scales using satellite. On the other hand, short-scale best regressions are K Neighbors with an R-2 of 0.76, Extra Trees with an R-2 of 0.75, and Bayesian Ridge with an R-2 of 0.70, demonstrating a high potential to predict AGB and DM. This study is the first prediction model approach that assesses the rotational grazing system and pasture above-ground canopy features to predict the quality and quantity of cattle feed to support pasture management in Colombia.

TI  - Clues of Ongoing Deep Magma Inflation at Campi Flegrei Caldera (Italy) from Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis of SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the characteristics of a volcanic system is always important and becomes crucial when the volcano is in pluri-decadal unrest and located in a densely populated area, such as Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy. Ground deformation is a powerful source of information for studying the activity of magmatic sources and hydrothermal systems, even when difficult to detect otherwise. Here, we use ground displacement from ERS-ENVISAT and Sentinel-1A SAR images to investigate the 1993-2000 subsidence and part (2015-2022) of the present unrest. For each of the two time periods, we combine the line-of-sight displacements to obtain vertical and eastward displacements, and apply the empirical orthogonal function analysis to these latter time series-treated as a single data set-to decompose space-time fields into separated modes, consisting of uncorrelated spatial patterns and associated temporal evolutions. We only retain the first mode, since it captures the main deformation during both investigated periods, is the sole mode related to long-lasting (years) processes, and is less affected by noise than original data. Our analyses: (i) Confirm that most of the deformation is related to the activity of a 3-4 km deep sill-like source, which is inflated by magma and/or magmatic fluids during periods of unrest and deflates during periods of subsidence; (ii) Evidence ongoing deformation linked to local fluid migration in the Solfatara area; (iii) Identify persistent deformation features where peculiar fluid migration processes occurred during the 1982-1984 unrest; (iv) Most importantly, provide direct evidence of deep magma inflation at least since 2015, thus giving a strong warning of increasing risk at Campi Flegrei. Results demonstrate the capability of our approach to disclose hardly detectable processes and suggest a tool to monitor the activity of the deep magmatic source. Our approach can be useful also in other volcanic systems.

TI  - Quantification of Above-Ground Biomass over the Cross-River State, Nigeria, Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher-resolution wall-to-wall carbon monitoring in tropical Africa across a range of woodland types is necessary in reducing uncertainty in the global carbon budget and improving accounting for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation Plus (REDD+). This study uses Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery combined with climatic and edaphic variables to estimate the regional distribution of aboveground biomass (AGB) for the year 2020 over the Cross River State, a tropical forest region in Nigeria, using random forest (RF) machine learning. Forest inventory plots were collected over the whole state for training and testing of the RF algorithm, and spread over undisturbed and disturbed tropical forests, and woodlands in croplands and plantations. The maximum AGB plot was estimated to be 588 t/ha with an average of 121.98 t/ha across the entire Cross River State. AGB estimated using random forest yielded an R-2 of 0.88, RMSE of 40.9 t/ha, a relRMSE of 30%, bias of +7.5 t/ha and a total woody regional AGB of 0.246 Pg for the Cross River State. These results compare favorably to previous tropical AGB products; with total AGB of 0.290, 0.253, 0.330 and 0.124 Pg, relRMSE of 49.69, 57.09, 24.06 and 56.24% and -41, -48, -17 and -50 t/ha bias over the Cross River State for the Saatchi, Baccini, Avitabile and ESA CCI maps, respectively. These are all compared to the current REDD+ estimate of total AGB over the Cross River State of 0.268 Pg. This study shows that obtaining independent reference plot datasets, from a variety of woodland cover types, can reduce uncertainties in local to regional AGB estimation compared with those products which have limited tropical African and Nigerian woodland reference plots. Though REDD+ biomass in the region is relatively larger than the estimates of this study, REDD+ provided only regional biomass rather than pixel-based biomass and used estimated tree height rather than the actual tree height measurement in the field. These may cast doubt on the accuracy of the estimated biomass by REDD+. These give the biomass map of this current study a comparative advantage over others. The 20 m wall-to-wall biomass map of this study could be used as a baseline for REDD+ monitoring, evaluation, and reporting for equitable distribution of payment for carbon protection benefits and its management.

TI  - Multisensor Assessment of Leaf Area Index across Ecoregions of Ardabil Province, Northwestern Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI), one of the most crucial vegetation biophysical variables, is required to evaluate the structural characteristic of plant communities. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate the LAI of ecoregions in Iran obtained using Sentinel-2B, Landsat 8 (OLI), MODIS, and AVHRR data in June and July 2020. A field survey was performed in different ecoregions throughout Ardabil Province during June and July 2020 under the satellite image dates. A Laipen LP 100 (LP 100) field-portable device was used to measure the LAI in 822 samples with different plant functional types (PFTs) of shrubs, bushes, and trees. The LAI was estimated using the SNAPv7.0.4 (Sentinel Application Platform) software for Sentinel-2B data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) system-based EVI for Landsat 8. At the same time, for MODIS and AVHRR, the LAI products of GEE were considered. The results of all satellite-based methods verified the LAI variations in space and time for every PFT. Based on Sentinel-2B, Landsat 8, MODIS, and AVHRR application, the minimum and maximum LAIs were respectively obtained at 0.14-1.78, 0.09-3.74, 0.82-4.69, and 0.35-2.73 for shrubs; 0.17-5.17, 0.3-2.3, 0.59-3.84, and 0.63-3.47 for bushes; and 0.3-4.4, 0.3-4.5, 0.7-4.3, and 0.5-3.3 for trees. These estimated values were lower than the LAI values of LP 100 (i.e., 0.4-4.10 for shrubs, 1.6-7.7 for bushes, and 3.1-6.8 for trees). A significant correlation (p < 0.05) for almost all studied PFTs between LP 100-LAI and estimated LAI from sensors was also observed in Sentinel-2B (|r| > 0.63 and R-2 > 0.89), Landsat 8 (|r| > 0.50 and R-2 > 0.72), MODIS (|r| > 0.65 and R-2 > 0.88), and AVHRR (|r| > 0.59 and R-2 > 0.68). Due to its high spatial resolution and relatively significant correlation with terrestrial data, Sentinel-2B was more suitable for calculating the LAI. The results obtained from this study can be used in future studies on sustainable rangeland management and conservation.

TI  - Quality Control of CyGNSS Reflectivity for Robust Spatiotemporal Detection of Tropical Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a robust methodology for evaluating the spatiotemporal dynamics of the inundation status in tropical wetlands with the currently available Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) data by proposing a new quality control technique called the "precision index". The methodology was applied over the Mekong Delta, one of the most important rice-production systems comprising aquaculture areas and natural wetlands (e.g., mangrove forests, peatlands). Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CyGNSS) constellation data (August 2018-December 2021) were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the reflectivity Gamma over the delta. First, the reflectivity Gamma, shape and size of each specular footprint and the precision index were calibrated at each specular point and reprojected to a 0.0045 degrees resolution (approximately equivalent to 500 m) grid at a daily temporal resolution (Lv. 2 product); then, the results were obtained considering bias-causing factors (e.g., the velocity/effective scattering area/incidence angle). The Lv. 2 product was temporally integrated every 15 days with a Kalman smoother (+/- 14 days temporal localization with Gaussian kernel: 1 sigma = 5 days). By applying the smoother, the regional-annual dynamics over the delta could be clearly visualized. The behaviors of the GNSS-R reflectivity and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased-Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 quadruple polarimetric scatter signals were compared and found to be nonlinearly correlated due to the influence of the incidence angle and the effective scattering area.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characterization and Analysis of River Morphology Using Long-Term Landsat Imagery and Stream Power
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Meandering rivers are among the most dynamic Earth-surface systems, which generally appear in fertile valleys, the most valuable lands for agriculture and human settlement. Landsat time series and morphological parameters are complementary tools for exploring river dynamics. Karun River is the most effluent and largest meandering river in Iran, which keeps the Karun's basin economy, agriculture, and industrial sections alive; hence, investigating morphological changes in this river is essential. The morphological characteristics of Karun have undergone considerable changes over time due to several tectonic, hydrological, hydraulic, and anthropogenic factors. This study has identified and analyzed morphological changes in Karun River using a time series of Landsat imagery from 1985-2015. On that basis, morphological dynamics, including the river's active channel width, meander's neck length, water flow length, sinuosity index, and Cornice central angle, were quantitatively investigated. Additionally, the correlation between the stream power and morphological factors was explored using the data adopted from the hydrometric stations. The results show that the dominant pattern of the Karun River, due to the sinuosity coefficient, is meandering, and the majority of the river falls in the category of developed meander rivers. Moreover, the number of arteries reduced in an anabranch pattern, and the river has been migrating towards the downstream and eastern sides since 1985. This phenomenon disposes a change in the future that can be hazardous to the croplands and demands specific considerations for catchment management.

TI  - Assessment of L-Band SAOCOM InSAR Coherence and Its Comparison with C-Band: A Case Study over Managed Forests in Argentina
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work is to analyze the behavior of short temporal baseline interferometric coherence in forested areas for L-band spaceborne SAR data. Hence, an exploratory assessment of the impacts of temporal and spatial baselines on coherence, with emphasis on how these effects vary between SAOCOM-1 L-band and Sentinel-1 C-band data is presented. The interferometric coherence is analyzed according to different imaging parameters. In the case of SAOCOM-1, the impacts of the variation of the incidence angle and the ascending and descending orbits over forested areas are also assessed. Finally, short-term 8-day interferometric coherence maps derived from SAOCOM-1 are especially addressed, since this is the first L-band spaceborne mission that allows us to acquire SAR images with such a short temporal span. The analysis is reported over two forest-production areas in Argentina, one of which is part of the most important region in terms of forest plantations at the national level. In the case of SAOCOM, interferometric configurations are characterized by a lack of control on the spatial baseline, so a zero-baseline orbital tube cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, this spatial baseline variability is crucial to exploit volume decorrelation for forest monitoring. The results from this exploratory analysis demonstrates that SAOCOM-1 short temporal baseline interferograms, 8 to 16 days, must be considered in order to mitigate temporal decorrelation effects and to be able to experiment with different spatial baseline configurations, in order to allow appropriate forest monitoring.

TI  - Wheat yield prediction based on Sentinel-2, regression, and machine learning models in Hamedan, Iran
T2  - SCIENTIA IRANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate forecast of wheat yield prior to harvest is of great importance to ensure the sustainability of food production. The primary objective of this study is to determine the best remote sensing features and regression model for wheat yield prediction in Hamedan, Iran. In this regard, the effects of different time windows on different regression models were verified. For this purpose, several Vegetation Indices (VIs) and reflectance values obtained from Sentinel-2, as the input to regression models, were used in different time windows. As a result, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Random Forest (RF) represented the top two best methods, and the best results were achieved for the GPR model using the SAVI, NDVI, EVI2, WDRVI, SR, GNDVI, and GCVI indices corresponding to the image captured at the end of May. The best model yielded Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.228 t/ha and coefficient of determination R-2 = 0:73. Moreover, different regression methods regarding the number of training data were compared. Further, Neural Network (NN) and linear regression were the most affected by the number of training samples while stepwise regression was affected the least. The experimental results obtained in this study provided a technical reference for estimating large-scale wheat yield. (c) 2022 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of Land Use and Land Cover Changes on Land Surface Temperature over Cachar Region, Northeast India-A Case Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The promptness of industrialisation and expanding urbanisation to achieve targets of economics are resulting in the transfiguration of permeable surfaces into impervious ones through LULC adaptation, leaving a herculean footprint on the ecosystem. The LULC escalates land surface temperature (LST), which further stimulates urban heat islands (UHIs), ultimately remaining in tune with high levels of air pollution, energy use, and corresponding health hazards. The present evaluation first used Landsat TM/OLI satellite data to identify the labyrinth of the LULC rotation and, secondly, gauged its effects on the LST in the Cachar district of Assam, India, for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. It embraces Cellular Automata (CA) and GIS methodologies to pull out the urbanization pattern and its ramifications in various LULC brackets of Cachar, India. It also embraces spatiotemporal LULC monitoring (1990-2020) and urban growth modelling (2030-2040). From the period 1990 to 2020, satellite-based LULC showed a net urban expansion of 269.43 km(2) (7.13% increase). Some correlations were developed to show the relationship between spatial indices such as NDVI, NDBI, and NDWI with Land Surface Temperature (LST). Resultantly, a positive relation exists between LST and NDBI, but a negative correlation prevails between LST and NDVI, as well as NDWI. This evaluation will be of service to urban and environmental planners, providing them with detailed knowledge on how land cover is changing uniquely in northeast India.

TI  - The driving forces of wetland degradation in Bure and Wonberma <i>Woredas</i>, Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the land use/land cover (LULC) of inland wetlands has been dynamic over the last 100 years, the extent of their LULC dynamics and its driving forces are poorly understood particularly in Ethiopia. Thus, this study analyzed spatiotemporal dynamics of four (Alefa, Chakun, Denbun, Kotilan) wetlands LULC and its driving forces in the Bure and Wonmbera Woredas, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia for the period from 1985 to 2020. The Landsat images downloaded from Google Earth Engine were used to analyze the LULC of four wetland watersheds. These images were classified into 7 classes by using the maximum likelihood algorithm in ArcGIS 4. Besides, a survey of 347 households, 4 focus group discussions, and 12 key informant interviews and transect walks were used to generate the data on the drivers of wetland changes. The LULC analysis showed that the four wetlands area in 1985, 2002, and 2020 occupied 6027 ha, 5203 ha, and 4348 ha, respectively, which indicated that the areas of wetlands have declined by 1679 ha or 27.9% in the past 35 years, with an average annual decrease rate of 48.4 hectares. Wetlands were lost at a higher rate (16.4%) from 2002 to 2020. The cultivated land expansion has taken a substantial share (67.9%) of wetlands' decline. The expansion of cultivated land due to an increase of rural households along with a lack of alternative livelihoods resulted in the conversion of wetlands to cultivated land. Gully erosion and sediment deposits due to wetlands buffer degradation, overgrazing, and change in crop production driven by market opportunities have exacerbated the wetlands loss. Thus, interventions such as the promotion of alternative livelihood activities, stall livestock feeding or zero-grazing, and non-conventional livestock feeds are needed to curb wetland degradation. Delineation of buffer zone and protection of shrubland or woodlands found in buffer areas of the wetlands are needed as well for the sustainability of wetlands.

TI  - Deep-Learning-Based Feature Extraction Approach for Significant Wave Height Prediction in SAR Mode Altimeter Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting sea wave parameters such as significant wave height (SWH) has recently been identified as a critical requirement for maritime security and economy. Earth observation satellite missions have resulted in a massive rise in marine data volume and dimensionality. Deep learning technologies have proven their capabilities to process large amounts of data, draw useful insights, and assist in environmental decision making. In this study, a new deep-learning-based hybrid feature selection approach is proposed for SWH prediction using satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode altimeter data. The introduced approach integrates the power of autoencoder deep neural networks in mapping input features into representative latent-space features with the feature selection power of the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm to create significant features from altimeter observations. Several hybrid feature sets were generated using the proposed approach and utilized for modeling SWH using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Neural Network Regression (NNR). SAR mode altimeter data from the Sentinel-3A mission calibrated by in situ buoy data was used for training and evaluating the SWH models. The significance of the autoencoder-based feature sets in improving the prediction performance of SWH models is investigated against original, traditionally selected, and hybrid features. The autoencoder-PCA hybrid feature set generated by the proposed approach recorded the lowest average RMSE values of 0.11069 for GPR models, which outperforms the state-of-the-art results. The findings of this study reveal the superiority of the autoencoder deep learning network in generating latent features that aid in improving the prediction performance of SWH models over traditional feature extraction methods.

TI  - Impact of Smoke Plumes Transport on Air Quality in Sydney during Extensive Bushfires (2019) in New South Wales, Australia Using Remote Sensing and Ground Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke aerosol dispersion and transport have a significant impact on air quality levels and can be examined by environmental monitoring and modelling techniques. The purpose of this study is to determine the characteristics of the smoke aerosols and the level of air quality during November and December 2019 under the influence of extensive bushfires in the Sydney area, New South Wales (NSW), Australia. To achieve this goal, air quality and meteorological data were analysed in combination with remote sensing satellite measurements. Meteorological and air quality data were obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) and Environmental Protection Agency monitoring sites in NSW. In Richmond the daily maximum average hourly concentration of particulate matter (PM10) was 848.9 mu g/m(3) at 07:00 UTC on 26 November 2019 and 785 mu g/m(3) at 07:00 UTC on 12 December 2019. On 10 December 2019, the highest PM10 recorded in the Sydney region was 961.5 mu g/m(3) in St Marys at 01:00 UTC, while the highest PM2.5 concentration was 714.6 mu g/m(3) in Oakdale in southwest Sydney at 18:00 UTC. These values all decreased again to the standard level (<50 mu g/m(3)) in a few days. The potential sources of smoke aerosols originated from bushfires to the northwest of Sydney (Blue Mountains) as well as from southwest and northwest NSW. The smoke plumes were revealed by the combined AOD values from Aqua and Terra sensors on the MODIS satellite. In each case, the smoke travelled towards the east coast of Australia and out over the Pacific Ocean. The NAAPS model displays the existence of smoke at ground level, while the CALIPSO satellite data showed that the plumes extended 14 km up into the stratosphere layer. Backward trajectories obtained from the HYSPLIT model agree well with the movement of smoke plumes observed in the MODIS satellite images.

TI  - Reservoir sedimentation and spatiotemporal land use changes in their watersheds: the case of two sub-catchments of the White Volta Basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir storage is compromised by sedimentation for which reason it has become an important matter in reservoir operation and management. While many studies have investigated sediment deposition rate in reservoirs, few have analyzed reservoir sedimentation from their catchment's land use change perspective. Based on bathymetric survey conducted on two reservoirs in the White Volta Basin in 2020 and analysis of four Landsat satellite imagery (1986, 1996, 2006, and 2020) within their watersheds, this study assessed the land cover change within the watersheds to draw inferences on the rate of sedimentation of the reservoirs located downstream of their catchments. The results revealed rapid sedimentation in the small-sized reservoir (Vea), with an annual sedimentation rate of 0.304% and a nominal sedimentation rate of 0.17% for the mid-sized reservoir (Tono). Furthermore, the savannah forest within the Vea catchment declined drastically from 29.4% (1985) to 9.9% (2020) influenced by the rapid expansion of farmlands from 18.7% to 47.9% within the same period, respectively. On the other hand, the savannah forest within the Tono catchment declined from 34.7% (1985) to 21.6% (2020) due to farmland expansion from 19.2% to 39% within the same period, respectively. The higher sedimentation rate observed in the small-sized reservoir was observed to be worsened by extensive tree cover removal in its catchment. Therefore, land cover characteristics within a watershed have a significant bearing on the rate of sedimentation in the reservoirs located downstream of their catchment. Hence, adopting a multi-sectorial approach to dealing with land use management is necessary to sustain reservoirs' storage.

TI  - On the Utility of Remotely Sensed Actual ET and LAI in Hydrologic Model Calibration
T2  - TEKNIK DERGI
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological model parameters are usually calibrated based on the performance of the daily river discharge data recorded at the basin outlet. In the unconvetional approach, satellite-based remote sensing data, which is open to everyone, is utilized in addition to the discharge data. The latter approach is aslo called spatial calibration in hydrology. The objective of this study is to assess the utility of remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (AET) and monthly leaf area index (LAI) maps on the calibration of the hydrological model. For this, six different calibration cases (scenarios) are designed using a physically-based hydrologic model for the Vienne basin in France. It should be noted that LAI is used to estimate interception and correct the PET in the model i.e. both affecting the simulated AET. The daily discharge simulation performance of the model is assessed using KGE and the spatial performance of the model is assessed using SPAEF i.e. between mHM's long-term (2002-2014) monthly average AET raster output maps and reference MODIS-AET maps. According to the results, the KGE for scenario 1 (single AGI) was 0.91, SPAEF was below zero; for scenario 2 (with 4 AGI), the KGE was 0.37 while the SPAEF was positive; for scenario 3 (Single AGI and MODIS-AET), the KGE was 0.90 while the SPAEF were similar to 0.70; For the 4th scenario (MODIS-AET only), the KGE was -0.24, SPAEF was around 0.60, for scenario 5 (12 flow data and MODIS-AET) the KGE was 0.67, SPAEF was around 0.75; for scenario 6 (one-year daily flow and MODIS-AET) KGE 0.72 and SPAEF was around 0.75. Our results are promising even for poorly gaged basins as we could reach reasonable performance with satellite based AET and only 12 discharge measurements.

TI  - Assessment of Land Deformation and the Associated Causes along a Rapidly Developing Himalayan Foothill Region Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 SAR Datasets
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land deformation has become a crucial threat in recent decades, caused by various natural and anthropogenic activities in the environment. The seismic land dynamics, landslides activities, heavy rainfall resulting in flood events, and subsurface aquifer shrinkage due to the excessive extraction of groundwater are among the major reasons for land deformation, which may cause serious damage to the overall land surface, civil infrastructure, underground tunnels, and pipelines, etc. This study focuses on preparing a framework for estimating land deformation and analyzing the causes associated with land deformation. A time-series SAR Interferometry-based technique called PsInSAR was used to measure land deformation, using Sentinel-1 datasets from 2015 to 2021 by estimating land deformation velocities for this region. The obtained PSInSAR deformation velocity results ranged between -4 mm to +2 mm per year. Further, land use land cover (LULC) changes in the area were analyzed as an essential indicator and probable cause of land deformation. LULC products were first generated using Landsat-8 images for two time periods (2015, 2021), which were then evaluated in accordance with the deformation analysis. The results indicated an increase in the built-up areas and agricultural cover in the region at the cost of shrinkage in the vegetated lands, which are highly correlated with the land subsidence in the region, probably due to the over-extraction of groundwater. Further, the outer region of the study area consisting of undulating terrain and steep slopes also coincides with the estimated high subsidence zones, which could be related to higher instances of landslides identified in those areas from various primary and secondary information collected. One of the causes of landslides and soil erosion in the region is identified to be high-level precipitation events that loosen the surface soil that flows through the steep slopes. Furthermore, the study region lying in a high seismic zone with characteristic unstable slopes are more susceptible to land deformation due to high seismic activities. The approach developed in the study could be an useful tool for constant monitoring and estimation of land deformation and analysis of the associated causes which can be easily applied to any other region.

TI  - Can seasonal fire management reduce the risk of carbon loss from wildfires in a protected Guinea savanna?
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is fundamental to the functioning of tropical savannas and routinely used as a management tool. Shifting prescribed burning from later to earlier in the growing season has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, large uncertainties surround the impact of seasonal burning on longer term plant and soil carbon sequestration. In this study, we quantify ecosystem carbon storage across burn seasons and histories in a wet-to-mesic Guinea tropical savanna in Mole National Park, Ghana. Aboveground (plant and litter) and belowground (soil plus roots) carbon storage was quantified across four burning seasons and histories: recent (<3 years) early-season burns, recent late-season burns, old (>4 years) late-season burns, and long-unburned (>15 years) sites. We found that recent late-season burns significantly lowered belowground carbon storage to a depth of 17 cm compared with all other burn seasons and histories. Belowground carbon was 1.2 kg C m(-2), or 27% lower, for recent late-season burns compared with prescribed early-season burns. However, in older late-season burns sites, belowground carbon "recovered" after 4-13 burn years to comparable storage as long-unburned and early-season burn sites. For most aboveground carbon pools, there was no significant difference in carbon storage across burn seasons and histories, except higher aboveground tree carbon in long-unburned sites. We suggest that observed changes in belowground carbon are likely due to the turnover and production of root carbon. Prescribed early-season burning is promoted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our findings affirm that early-season burning has limited impact on plant and soil carbon stocks compared with long-unburned sites. While early-season burning regimes will have some patches that become late-season wildfires, our results suggest on balance early-season burning regimes are a low-risk land management practice in reducing plant and soil carbon storage losses and sustaining a patch-mosaicked landscape with multiple other ecosystem service benefits for savannas.

TI  - A Joint Bayesian Optimization for the Classification of Fine Spatial Resolution Remotely Sensed Imagery Using Object-Based Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, deep learning-based image classification has become widespread, especially in remote sensing applications, due to its automatic and strong feature extraction capability. However, as deep learning methods operate on rectangular-shaped image patches, they cannot accurately extract objects' boundaries, especially in complex urban settings. As a result, combining deep learning and object-based image analysis (OBIA) has become a new avenue in remote sensing studies. This paper presents a novel approach for combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) with OBIA based on joint optimization of segmentation parameters and deep feature extraction. A Bayesian technique was used to find the best parameters for the multiresolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm while the CNN model learns the image features at different layers, achieving joint optimization. The proposed classification model achieved the best accuracy, with 0.96 OA, 0.95 Kappa, and 0.96 mIoU in the training area and 0.97 OA, 0.96 Kappa, and 0.97 mIoU in the test area, outperforming several benchmark methods including Patch CNN, Center OCNN, Random OCNN, and Decision Fusion. The analysis of CNN variants within the proposed classification workflow showed that the HybridSN model achieved the best results compared to 2D and 3D CNNs. The 3D CNN layers and combining 3D and 2D CNN layers (HybridSN) yielded slightly better accuracies than the 2D CNN layers regarding geometric fidelity, object boundary extraction, and separation of adjacent objects. The Bayesian optimization could find comparable optimal MRS parameters for the training and test areas, with excellent quality measured by AFI (0.046, -0.037) and QR (0.945, 0.932). In the proposed model, higher accuracies could be obtained with larger patch sizes (e.g., 9 x 9 compared to 3 x 3). Moreover, the proposed model is computationally efficient, with the longest training being fewer than 25 s considering all the subprocesses and a single training epoch. As a result, the proposed model can be used for urban and environmental applications that rely on VHR satellite images and require information about land use.

TI  - Spatio-temporal landslide inventory and susceptibility assessment using Sentinel-2 in the Himalayan mountainous region of Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2005 Kashmir earthquake has triggered widespread landslides in the Himalayan mountains in northern Pakistan and surrounding areas, some of which are active and are still posing a significant risk. Landslides triggered by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake are extensively studied; nevertheless, spatio-temporal landslide susceptibility assessment is lacking. This can be partially attributed to the limited availability of high temporal resolution remote sensing data. We present a semi-automated technique to use the Sentinel-2 MSI data for co-seismic landslide detection, landslide activities monitoring, spatio-temporal change detection, and spatio-temporal susceptibility mapping. Time series Sentinel-2 MSI images for the period of 2016-2021 and ALOS PALSAR DEM are used for semi-automated landslide inventory map development and temporal change analysis. Spectral information combined with topographical, contextual, textural, and morphological characteristics of the landslide in Sentinel-2 images is applied for landslide detection. Subsequently, spatio-temporal landslide susceptibility maps are developed utilizing the weight of evidence statistical modeling with seven causative factors, i.e., elevation, slope, geology, aspect, distance to fault, distance to roads, and distance to streams. The results reveal that landslide occurrence increased from 2016 to 2021 and that the coverage of areas of relatively high susceptibility has increased in the study area.

ENSO and IOD are climate variability that affects water conditions seasonally and inter-annually, including Makassar Strait, Indonesia. Research on the effect of ENSO and IOD variations on water fertility in Makassar Strait requires updating every year. This study aimed to analyze the impact of ENSO and IOD on the variability of oceanography (SST and SSC) and dynamics of the Scad (Decapterus spp.) production in Makassar Strait. This study used Nino3.4 Index and Dipole Mode Index data from NOAA, while SST and SSC data were obtained from the Aqua-MODIS satellite imagery from January 2015 to December 2019. For the study, data were processed using SeaDAS, ArcGIS, and RStudio software. The results indicated that the Nino3.4 Index for SST and SSC was strong, and the Dipole Mode Index for SST and SSC was low. The time -series graph showed that the El Nino event was strong, and the IOD+ was quite strong in 2015-2016, affecting the negative SST anomaly and the positive SSC anomaly. Cross-correlation analysis of the effect of the Nino3.4 Index with the SST anomaly of-0.62 and the low SSC anomaly of 0.18. The result of IOD on the SST anomaly was quite strong at-0.51, and the SSC anomaly was low at 0.07. Strong El Nino and IOD+ events were found to highly affect SST and SSC as well as influence the variation or fluctuation of Scad catch production, especially from 2015 to 2016 in the study area of Makassar Strait, Indonesia.

TI  - A Meta-Analysis of Remote Sensing Technologies and Methodologies for Crop Characterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate change and population growth risk the world's food supply. Annual crop yield production is one of the most crucial components of the global food supply. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed global food security, production, and supply chains. Using biomass estimation as a reliable yield indicator, space-based monitoring of crops can assist in mitigating these stresses by providing reliable product information. Research has been conducted to estimate crop biophysical parameters by destructive and non-destructive approaches. In particular, researchers have investigated the potential of various analytical methods to determine a range of crop parameters using remote sensing data and methods. To this end, they have investigated diverse sources of Earth observations, including radar and optical images with various spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper reviews and analyzes publications from the past 30 years to identify trends in crop monitoring research using remote sensing data and tools. This analysis is accomplished through a systematic review of 277 papers and documents the methods, challenges, and opportunities frequently cited in the scientific literature. The results revealed that research in this field had increased dramatically over this study period. In addition, the analyses confirmed that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) had been the most studied vegetation index to estimate crop parameters. Moreover, this analysis showed that wheat and corn were the most studied crops, globally.

TI  - Increased Mass Loss of Glaciers in the Sawir Mountains of Central Asia between 1959 and 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier mass balance can be regarded as a major direct index of climate variations. In this paper, a geodetic method was used to evaluate the mass balance of Sawir glaciers based on topographic map DEM (Digital Elevation Model), SRTM 30 m DEM, ASTER 30 m DEM, and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar 10 m DEM between 1959-2021, in order to explore the response to climatic alterations. In the case of Muz Taw glacier, the first comprehensive dataset concerning mass-balance readings for the 2014-2021 period was provided based on the eight-year consecutive field measurements. The glaciological average mass balance reached -883.4 +/- 130 mm a(-1) during this period. The geodetic mass balance for all glaciers of the Sawir Mountain range was -0.43 +/- 0.12 m w. e. a(-1) between 1959 and 2000, and accelerated to -0.56 +/- 0.13 m w. e. a(-1) between 2000 and 2021. A comparison of field measurements and remote-sensing approaches for determining the Muz Taw glacier's mass balance between 2014-2021 proves the feasibility of the remote-sensing approach, which involves mass-balance monitoring based on DEMdata. In addition, our findings support the contention that air temperature is the dominant factor for accelerated glacier mass loss and surface elevation change.

TI  - Influence of Seasonal Air-Sea Interaction on the Interannual Variation of the NPP of Terrestrial Natural Vegetation in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data, meteorological observation data, multisource atmospheric circulation, and sea surface temperature (SST) data from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, we estimated the net primary productivity (NPP) of terrestrial natural vegetation in China according to the CASA model and analyzed the linear trend and interannual fluctuation of NPP, as well as the spatial distribution characteristics of the annual NPP response to climatic factors. The obtained results revealed the impact of air-sea interaction on interannual NPP variability in key climatic areas. In China, the annual NPP of natural vegetation, linear NPP trend, and interannual NPP fluctuation showed significant regional characteristics. The annual NPP exhibited a significant increasing trend and interannual fluctuation in North China and Northeast China, with spatially consistent responses from NPP to precipitation and temperature. On the seasonal time scale, NPP in the key climatic area (105 similar to 135 degrees E, 35 similar to 55 degrees N) exhibited a strong response to both summer precipitation and mean temperature. In the summer atmospheric circulation, the circulation anomaly area is mainly distributed in the northeast cold vortex area in the middle- and high-latitude westerlies in East Asia and in the Sea of Okhotsk with dipole circulation. In the SST of the preceding winter and spring, the key SST anomaly area was the Kuroshio region, with an impact of the Kuroshio SST anomaly on the interannual variation in annual NPP in the key climatic area. The cold vortex in Northeast China played a pivotal role in the influence of the SST anomaly in the Kuroshio region on atmospheric circulation anomalies, resulting in abnormal summer precipitation in the key climatic region and affecting the annual accumulation of NPP of natural vegetation.

TI  - Shaping Pro-Environmental Attitudes through Higher Education-A Preliminary Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several authors argue that some types of academic education not focused on sustainability can also shape-at least some-competencies relevant to sustainability and turn students into more engaged individuals. The main goal of this article was to check this possibility based on the results of an e-questionnaire from 66 fresh graduates of a business-oriented university based in Poland. We found that respondents rated highly both the competencies that the university taught in the general sphere related to sustainable development and those important for their professional life and wanted further development of both groups of these competencies. Through regression analysis, we also found that the perceived development of SD competencies does not predict respondents' ecological worldview. Of the studied predictors for ecological worldview, only female gender and mission- or socially-driven dream job remained in the regression model, accounting for approximately 18.6% of the variation in ecological worldview.

TI  - Multidimensional architecture using a massive and heterogeneous data: Application to drought monitoring
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in the number of Earth Observation (EO) systems generates a massive amount of heterogeneous data. It has raised big issues in collecting, preprocessing, storing, and the visualization these data. However, traditional techniques are facing serious challenges when dealing with big EO data dimensions (i.e., Volume, Veracity, Variety, and Velocity), especially in natural hazards management. Therefore, big data techniques and tools attract more attention. In this paper we propose a multidimensional model framework for Big EO data warehousing. This framework includes 3 parts: (1) Data collection and preprocessing, being responsible for collecting data and improving their quality; (2) Data loading and storage, performing the ingestion task which consists of transferring the data from external resources to the Big data platform for storage; and (3) Visualization and interpretation, aiming to provide spatio-temporal analysis. This framework could be useful for decision-makers in monitoring the effects of drought disasters and, consequently, planning the mitigation and remediation measures. Experiments are carried out on drought monitoring in China along the period 2000-2020. The input data include remote sensing data, biophysical data, and climatological data. The results reveal that the proposed framework has a higher retrieval speed and a greater elasticity with different kinds (i.e. spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal) of requests compared to traditional frameworks, indicating its superiority.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rice Leaf Chlorophyll Content Estimation Using UAV-Based Spectral Images in Different Regions
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of crop biophysical and biochemical characteristics is the key element for crop growth monitoring with remote sensing. With the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as a remote sensing platform worldwide, it has become important to develop general estimation models, which can interpret remote sensing data of crops by different sensors and in different agroclimatic regions into comprehensible agronomy parameters. Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), which can be measured as a soil plant analysis development (SPAD) value using a SPAD-502 Chlorophyll Meter, is one of the important parameters that are closely related to plant production. This study compared the estimation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) LCC in two different regions (Ningxia and Shanghai) using UAV-based spectral images. For Ningxia, images of rice plots with different nitrogen and biochar application rates were acquired by a 125-band hyperspectral camera from 2016 to 2017, and a total of 180 samples of rice LCC were recorded. For Shanghai, images of rice plots with different nitrogen application rates, straw returning, and crop rotation systems were acquired by a 5-band multispectral camera from 2017 to 2018, and a total of 228 samples of rice LCC were recorded. The spectral features of LCC in each study area were analyzed and the results showed that the rice LCC in both regions had significant correlations with the reflectance at the green, red, and red-edge bands and 8 vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The estimation models of LCC were built using the partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods. The PLSR models tended to be more stable and accurate than the SVR and ANN models when applied in different regions with R-2 values higher than 0.7 through different validations. The results demonstrated that the rice canopy LCC in different regions, cultivars, and different types of sensor-based data shared similar spectral features and could be estimated by general models. The general models can be implied to a wider geographic extent to accurately quantify rice LCC, which is helpful for growth assessment and production forecasts.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Multi-Scale Analysis of Landscape Ecological Risk in Minjiang River Basin Based on Adaptive Cycle
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape ecological security is an environmental requirement for social and economic development. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms of landscape change and the associated ecological risks in regional socioecological systems is necessary for promoting regional sustainable development. Using the Minjiang River Basin as the research area, the Google Earth Engine platform, random forest (RF) model, and FLUS model were employed for land use classification and future multi-scenario prediction. Multisource remote sensing data were used to establish a three-dimensional evaluation index system for an adaptive cycle. Additionally, the "potential-connection-resilience" framework was adopted to explore the spatial and temporal variations in landscape ecological risk in the basin from 2001 to 2035 under different administrative scales and development scenarios. The results showed that from 2001 to 2020, the building and forest areas increased significantly, whereas grassland and plowland areas decreased significantly. Moreover, the spatial fragmentation of the watershed improved significantly with the transformation of large amounts of grassland into forests. The construction area continued to expand in 2035 under different scenarios. Under the economic development scenario, the grassland and plowland areas decreased considerably, but the forest area increased slowly. Under the ecological protection scenario, the expansion of land use was restrained, and the reduction rate of grassland and cultivated land was moderated. From 2001 to 2020, the overall ecological risk was at a medium-low level and showed a decreasing trend, and the fragmentation degree of the forest had a significant impact on ecological risk. By 2035, landscape ecological risks increased under different development scenarios, and construction land expansion had become the dominant factor affecting the risk level. By evaluating the distribution and development trend of ecologically high-risk areas in the Minjiang River Basin, the results of this study provide basic support for the rational planning of land resources in the basin and decision making for future sustainable development efforts.

TI  - Pixel-Based Long-Term (2001-2020) Estimations of Forest Fire Emissions over the Himalaya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest/wildfires have been one of the most notable severe catastrophes in recent decades across the globe, and their intensity is expected to rise with global warming. Forest fire contributes significantly to particulate and gaseous pollution in the atmosphere. This study has estimated the pixel-based emissions (CO, CO2, CH4, NOx, SO2, NH3, PM2.5, PM10, OC, and BC) from forest fires over the Himalaya (including India, Nepal, and Bhutan). The MODIS-based burned area (MCD64A1), Land Use Land Cover (LULC; MCD12A1), NDVI (MOD13A2), percentage tree cover (MOD44A6), gridded biomass, and species-wise emissions factors were used to estimate the monthly emissions from forest fires over the last two decades (2001-2020). A bottom-up approach was adopted to retrieve the emissions. A substantial inter-annual variation of forest burn area was found over the western, central (Nepal), and eastern Himalaya (including Bhutan). The eastern Himalaya exhibited the highest average annual CO2 emission, i.e., 20.37 Tg, followed by Nepal, 15.52 Tg, and the western Himalaya, 4.92 Tg. Spatially, the higher CO2 (0.01-0.02 Tg year(-1)/km(2)) and CO (0.007-0.002 Tg year(-1)/km(2)) emissions were detected along the south-eastern parts of the eastern Himalaya, southern regions of Nepal, and south-eastern parts of the western Himalaya. The trend of forest fire emissions in 2001-2010 was significantly positive, while in the next decade (2011-2020) a negative trend was recorded. The estimated pixel-based emission and Global Fire Emission Dataset (GFEDv4.1s) data demonstrated a promising association with a correlation coefficient (r) between 0.80 and 0.93. An inventory of forest fire emissions over long-term periods can be helpful for policymakers. In addition, it helps to set guidelines for air quality and atmospheric transport modelling and to better understand atmospheric pollution over the Himalayan and associated regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: In recent years, an opioid-associated amnestic syndrome (OAS) was identified in Massachusetts through elicited reporting by health care providers (traditional surveillance, TS). Whether OAS occurs more frequently and with a wider spatiotemporal distribution in Massachusetts remains unclear. We compared the frequency and spatiotemporal characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits for possible OAS (pOAS) using a pre-existing syndromic surveillance system (SyS) with OAS cases captured through TS.Methods: SyS was queried for Massachusetts ED visits in 15- to 55-year-olds with a chief complaint text and discharge codes for memory loss in association with codes for opioid use (pOAS). SyS data were extracted for 2016-2020, whereas TS was conducted for 2012-2018. Cases identified by SyS and TS were stratified by demographic and spatiotemporal variables.Results: TS ascertained 22 reported cases of OAS (18 males) between 2012 and 2018, ranging from 0 to 5 annually. No identified OAS patients presented between January and March or in western Massachusetts. Between 2016 and 2020, SyS identified 82 ED visits (49 males) with pOAS, ranging from 13 to 22 per year. Over the 5-year period, at least 2 ED visits for pOAS occurred during each month of the year (24 total during January, February, or March) and at least 1 visit occurred in each county except 2, with the second largest number (11) in Berkshire County (at the western border of Massachusetts), where no cases were ascertained through TS.Conclusions: Although OAS is a relatively rare condition, use of SyS in Massachusetts suggests a broader and more frequent spatiotemporal distribution than previously indicated from TS.

TI  - High-Resolution Drone Images Show That the Distribution of Mussels Depends on Microhabitat Features of Intertidal Rocky Shores
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used orthomosaics and a digital surface model (DSM) generated from drone surveys to (1) characterize the distribution of mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) aggregations at high resolution (centimeters), and (2) evaluate the role of topographic features, intertidal height, slope, and orientation angle in determining mussel distribution on two rocky shores oriented differently on both sides of a beach on the French Brittany coast. We first developed and tested a mussel visualization index (MVI) for mapping mussel aggregations from drone images. Then, we analyzed mussel distribution on the two shores. The results showed a contrasted total mussel-occupied area between the two rocky shores, with a higher occupation rate and a clear pattern of distribution depending on topographic features on the rocky shore oriented to the west. Intertidal height, and its associated immersion time, was the main factor determining mussel distribution. An optimum intertidal height was found in the center of the distribution height range, at c.a. 4.5 m above the lowest astronomical tide (LAT), where individuals are under immersion phase on average 43% of the time. Within this optimum, the occupation rate of the mussels was significantly higher in microhabitats facing south and west, particularly at intermediate slope angles. These results demonstrate the role of microhabitat topographic features on the development of intertidal mussels and their final distribution. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of mesoscale structures of habitats (e.g., 100 m), which seem to be responsible for the differences we observed between the two shores. Our methodological approach highlights the main advantage of using high-resolution drone images to address ecological processes in intertidal ecosystems. Indeed, drone imagery offers the possibility to assess small-scale interactions between individuals and habitat conditions over a wide area, which is technically infeasible from fieldwork approaches or by using satellite remote sensing due to their lower resolution. Scale integration and methodological complementarity are powerful approaches to correctly represent the processes governing the ecology of intertidal ecosystems. We suggest using this methodology to monitor long-term changes of sentinel sessile species.

TI  - Ionospheric and surface thermal parameters during three high magnitude earthquakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth prepares itself and thus various anomalous signals in nature, prior to earthquakes, are often observed. Comprehensive study of these anomalous signals helps in understanding the mechanisms and prediction of the earthquakes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to understand the coupling processes between lithosphere - atmosphere and the ionosphere. Still lots of work needs to be done to understand its real physical mechanism. In the present work, surface thermal parameters, surface latent heat flux (SLHF), ionospheric parameters, ion density (Ni) and ion temperature (T-i), have been investigated for 3 high magnitude (M>7.5) strong earthquake events. The ground parameters - SLHF (Surface Latent Heat Flux) have been retrieved from NCEP/NCAR Re-analysis, whereas the ionospheric ion density (total ion density - Ni) and ion composition (O+, H+ and He+) measurements, have been obtained from ROCSAT satellite at similar to 600 km altitude. The study indicates that there is anomalous change in SLHF during seismic affected period. The study of ionospheric ion density suggests decrease in Ni and O+, however the lighter ions - H+ and He+ increase during seismic affected time. Ion temperature (Ti) doesn't show any significant change during seismically affected period.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Breast Cancer Patients Through Fluorescent Imaging Using Indocyanine Green The INFLUENCE Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim was to compare the (sentinel) lymph node detection rate of indocyanine green (ICG)-fluorescent imaging versus standard-of-care Tc-99m-nanocoilloid for sentinel lymph node (SLN)-mapping. Background: The current gold standard for axillary staging in patients with breast cancer is sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using radio-guided surgery using radioisotope technetium (Tc-99m), sometimes combined with blue dye. A promising alternative is fluorescent imaging using ICG. Methods: In this noninferiority trial, we enrolled 102 consecutive patients with invasive early-stage, clinically node-negative breast cancer. Patients were planned for breast conserving surgery and SLNB between August 2020 and June 2021. The day or morning before surgery, patients were injected with Tc-99m-nanocolloid. In each patient, SLNB was first performed using ICG-fluorescent imaging, after which excised lymph nodes were tested with the gamma-probe for Tc-99m-uptake ex vivo, and the axilla was checked for residual Tc-99m-activity. The detection rate was defined as the proportion of patients in whom at least 1 (S)LN was detected with either tracer. Results: In total, 103 SLNBs were analyzed. The detection rate of ICG-fluorescence was 96.1% [95% confidence interval (95% CI)=90.4%-98.9%] versus 86.4% (95% CI=78.3%-92.4%) for Tc-99m-nanocoilloid. The detection rate for pathological lymph nodes was 86.7% (95% CI=59.5%-98.3%) for both ICG and Tc-99m-nanocoilloid. A median of 2 lymph nodes were removed. ICG-fluorescent imaging did not increase detection time. No adverse events were observed. Conclusions: ICG-fluorescence showed a higher (S)LN detection rate than Tc-99m-nanocoilloid, and equal detection rate for pathological (S)LNs. ICG-fluorescence may be used as a safe and effective alternative to Tc-99m-nanocoilloid for SLNB in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - The theology of education and religious education in schools
T2  - THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a recent article in Theology (Vol. 125, no. 1, pp. 3-11), Professors Trevor Cooling and Robert A. Bowie discussed the Final Report of the Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) and identified two ways in which Christian theology can become a 'conversation partner' with a worldview approach to religious education: first, through theological interaction with the concept of worldview; and second, by showing the potential of biblical hermeneutics to teaching about a Christian worldview. It is argued that the concept of a worldview finds its origins outside Christian theology and fails to capture the nature of Christianity and that the highly abstract, philosophical character of the concept of worldview makes it an unsuitable vehicle for religious education in schools. It is accepted, however, that biblical hermeneutics has a contribution to make to religious education, albeit as a component within the broader subject of (general) hermeneutics, although this positive contribution is not supported or anticipated by CoRE, but rather expresses the views of Cooling and Bowie, who are contributing to a long-running debate on the role and form of hermeneutics in religious education.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in Lanalhue Lake Using Sentinel-2 MSI Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland water is fundamental for the conservation of flora and fauna and is a source of drinking water for humans; therefore, monitoring its quality and ascertaining its status is essential for making decisions in water resources management. As traditional measuring methods present limitations in monitoring with high spatial and temporal coverage, using satellite images to have greater control over lake observation can be a handy tool and have satisfactory results. The study of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) has been widely used to ascertain the quality of the inland aquatic environment using remote sensing, but in general, it depends on the local conditions of the water body. In this study, the suitability of the Sentinel-2 MSI sensor for Chl-a estimation in a lake in south-central Chile is tested. An empirical approach is proposed, applying multiple linear regressions, comparing the efficiency and performance with L1C and L2A products, separating the equations constructed with spring-summer and fall-winter data, and restricting Chl-a ranges to those measured in the field to generate these regressions. The algorithms combining spectral bans proved to have a good correlation with Chl-a measured in the field, generally resulting in R-2 greater than 0.87 and RMSE and MAE with errors less than 6 mu g L-1. The spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations at the study site was obtained based on the proposed equations.

TI  - Green Space Exposure and Obesity in the Mexican Adult Population
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Green space or natural vegetation may reduce obesity risk by increasing opportunities for physical activity or reducing stress and exposure to other pollutants. Obesity prevalence in Mexico is ranked among the highest in the world. However, research on the association between green space and obesity in Mexico is lacking. We used data from the National Nutrition Survey in Mexico (2018-2019), a nationally representative sample of Mexican adults. The analytical sample included participants between 20-59 years of age (n = 12,631). We assessed exposure to green space using a 30 m resolution Landsat satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 2018. Linear regression models examined associations between NDVI and body mass index (BMI), adjusting for confounders. The mean age of the study sample was 38 (SD 0.19) years. Participants living in areas with the highest green space exposure had the lowest education level (53.51%) and socioeconomic status (28.38%) and were located in central (33.01%), south (30.37%), and rural areas (21.05%). Higher residential exposure to green space was associated with a mean decrease in BMI of -1.1 kg/m(2) (95% CI: -1.59, -0.68). This is one of the first studies in Latin America to suggest a protective association between green space and obesity among Mexican adults.

TI  - Detecting Irrigation Events over Semi-Arid and Temperate Climatic Areas Using Sentinel-1 Data: Case of Several Summer Crops
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation monitoring is of great importance in agricultural water management to guarantee better water use efficiency, especially under changing climatic conditions and water scarcity. This study presents a detailed assessment of the potential of the Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect irrigation events at the plot scale. The potential of the S1 data to detect the irrigation events was carried out using the Irrigation Event Detection Model (IEDM) over semi-arid and temperate oceanic climates in five study sites in south Europe and the Middle East. The IEDM is a decision tree model initially developed to detect irrigation events using the change detection algorithm applied to the S1 time series data. For each study site and at each agricultural plot, all available S1 images during the period of irrigation were used to construct an S1 time series and apply the IEDM. Different types of major summer irrigated crops were analyzed in this study, including Maize, Soybean, Sorghum and Potato, mainly with the sprinkler irrigation technique. The irrigation detection accuracy was evaluated using S1 images and the IEDM against the climatic condition of the studied area, the vegetation development (by means of the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and the revisit time of the S1 sensor. The main results showed generally good overall accuracy for irrigation detection using the S1 data, reaching 67% for all studied sites together. This accuracy varied according to the climatic conditions of the studied area, with the highest accuracy for semi-arid areas and lowest for temperate areas. The analysis of the irrigation detection as a function of the crop type showed that the accuracy of irrigation detection decreases as the vegetation becomes well developed. The main findings demonstrated that the density of the available S1 images in the S1 time series over a given area affects the irrigation detection accuracy, especially for temperate areas. In temperate areas the irrigation detection accuracy decreased from 70% when 15 to 20 S1 images were available per month to reach less than 56% when less than 10 S1 images per month were available over the study sites.

TI  - Performance of Indocyanine Green Compared to 99mTc-Nanocolloids for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Early Vulvar Cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of indocyanine green (ICG) compared to that of the gold standard 99mtechnetium (99mTc-nanocolloids) in detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in early vulvar cancer. Material and Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study comparing SLN detection by 99mTc-nanocolloids and ICG was performed in patients presenting early vulvar cancer (T1/2), with clinically negative nodes. All SLN showing a radioactive and/or fluorescent signal were resected. The primary endpoints were the sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and false negative (FN) rate of ICG in detecting SLN compared to 99mTc-nanocolloids. Results: Thirty patients were included and 99 SLN were identified in 43 groins. Compared to 99mTc-nanocolloids, ICG had a sensitivity of 80.8% (95% CI [72.6; 88.6%]), a PPV of 96.2% (95% CI [91.8; 100%]) and a FN rate of 19.1% in detecting SLN. Seventeen (17.1%) infiltrated (positive) SLN were identified out of the 99 SLN detected. Compared to 99mTc-nanocolloids, ICG showed a sensitivity of 82.3% (95% CI [73.1; 91.5%]), a PPV of 100% and a FN rate of 17.6% (3/17) in detecting infiltrated SLN. Conclusion: Despite its many advantages, ICG cannot be used as the sole tracer for the detection of SLN in early vulvar cancer and should be employed in conjunction with 99mTc-nanocolloids.

TI  - Connecting Discretionary Spaces to Mathematics Teaching Practices and Systemic Violence of Historically Excluded Learners
T2  - TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a significant body of research in mathematics education suggesting that historically excluded learners (Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and poor) experience devaluation, inequities, exclusion, and violence (Berry, 2008; Gutierrez, 2002; Gutstein, 2003; Martin, 2015; McGee & Martin, 2011). Research, policies, and reforms in education "[have] been violent to marginalized peoples who are represented by perspectives that are neither kind to their cultural worldview nor accurate regarding their priorities" (Leonardo, 2013, p. 603). This commentary unpacks how the four articles in this special issue prioritize historically excluded learners' cultural worldviews. Specifically, this commentary focuses on practices across the four articles that respond to historically excluded learners' mathematical, social, and cultural needs.

TI  - Indications for selective lymphadenectomy and systematic axillary, inguinal and iliac lymph node dissection
T2  - CHIRURGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphadenectomy is a surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are surgically resected. It is usually carried out for oncological surgical treatment of various malignant diseases. These include carcinomas of the breast, penis, vulva and anus as well as malignant melanomas and the broad field of sarcomas. A distinction is made between the removal of regional lymph nodes, the sentinel lymph node and the radical removal of lymph nodes in a body region. Cervical, axillary, inguinal and iliac lymph nodes are clinically relevant. The strategy of sentinel lymph node dissection, in which the first lymph node in the drainage system is resected and histopathologically examined for malignant tissue, has brought decisive advantages for the patients, as radical lymphadenectomy with its severe morbidities is utilized in fewer cases. This can improve the patient's quality of life by sparing the lymphatic drainage pathways and reducing lymphedema, inflammation and wound healing disorders. In addition, a lymphadenectomy may be indicated as part of palliative interventions. Another form of lymph node removal is the vascularized lymph node transplantation, which is used for reconstructive purposes in lymphedema. Therefore lymph node grafts are transferred to the site where lymph nodes were previously removed. This review presents the current status of lymphadenectomy in accordance with the German guidelines, anatomical knowledge and specific indications for axillary, inguinal and iliac lymphadenectomy. In addition, an overview of vascularized lymph node transfer is given.

TI  - Assessment of Urbanization-Induced Land-Use Change and Its Impact on Temperature, Evaporation, and Humidity in Central Vietnam
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present day, the acceleration of urban surface heat impacts resulting from urbanization and industrialization is critical for citizens and municipal governments in developing-country cities. The previous key findings have indicated the association between urban surface heat and the following areas: forests, mixed agricultural land, built-up area, and water bodies. This study was motivated by a lack of knowledge regarding the variation of temperature, evaporation, and humidity in Central Vietnam's major region. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, and Landsat image analysis were employed to determine the trend and statistical significance of the variables across the 42-year study period for Da Nang city and Quang Nam province. Our results show that Da Nang city has a consistent trend with a high correlation between temperature, evaporation, and relative humidity, whereas Quang Nam province showed an inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity since the beginning of the regional urbanization. The maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures have increased by at least 0.29 degrees C in Quang Nam province and 0.71 degrees C in Da Nang city since 2000. Between 1979 and 2021, the frequency of days with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees C has increased by two and seven days during the past decade at the meteorological stations in Da Nang and Tam Ky, respectively. The temperature in Da Nang city varied from 31.80 degrees C to 32.82 degrees C with high temperatures concentrated in urbanized regions with less coverage of small trees, plants, and water bodies. Thus, the results of this study will serve as a scientific basis for decision-makers and regional officials for land-use management and to increase community awareness of sustainable planning, particularly in Da Nang city and Quang Nam province in Central Vietnam.

M3  - Article
AB  - Anisotropic reflectance correction (ARC) of satellite imagery is required to remove multi-scale topographic effects in imagery. Commonly utilized ARC approaches have not effectively accounted for atmosphere-topographic coupling. Furthermore, it is not clear which topographic effects need to be formally accounted for. Consequently, we simulate the direct and diffuse-skylight irradiance components and formally account for multi-scale topographic effects. A sensitivity analysis was used to determine if characterization schemes can account for a collective treatment of effects, using our parameterization scheme as a basis for comparison. We found that commonly used assumptions could not account for topographic modulation in our simulations. We also found that the use of isotropic diffuse irradiance and a topographic shielding parameter also failed to characterize topographic modulation. Our results reveal that topographic effects govern irradiance variations in a synergistic way, and that issues of ARC need to be formally addressed given atmosphere-topography coupling. Collectively, our results suggest that empirical ARC methods cannot be used to effectively address topographic effects, given inadequate parameterization schemes. Characterizing and removing spectral variation from multispectral imagery will most likely require numerical modeling efforts. More research is warranted to develop/evaluate parameterization schemes that better characterize the anisotropic nature of atmosphere-topography coupling.

TI  - Study of Anomalous Biogenic Pollution of the Marmara Sea Based on Satellite Data
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Peculiarities and negative consequences of an anomalous algal bloom that occurred in the Sea of Marmara in the spring-summer period of 2021 were estimated based on a long time series of satellite data. It was found that the area of extensive accumulations of jelly-like aggregates of organic substances (sea slime) was 973 km(2). The most intense biogenic pollutions were found in the coastal waters off the provinces of canakkale, Bursa, and Yalova/Kocaeli (Turkey). The set of factors that could contribute to the formation of conditions for such an anomalously intense biogenic pollution has been analyzed. It was shown that the most likely causes of its development are the increase in the temperature of the marine environment (monthly averages were 17% higher than the climatic norm) and the level of photosynthetically active radiation (the excess of the climatic norm by 27%) accompanied by atypical variability of surface wind fields in the region.

TI  - High-Resolution Monitoring of the Snow Cover on the Moroccan Atlas through the Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Landsat and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping seasonal snow cover dynamics provides essential information to predict snowmelt during spring and early summer. Such information is vital for water supply management and regulation by national stakeholders. Recent advances in remote sensing have made it possible to reliably estimate and quantify the spatial and temporal variability of snow cover at different scales. However, because of technological constraints, there is a compromise between the temporal, spectral, and spatial resolutions of available satellites. In addition, atmospheric conditions and cloud contamination may increase the number of missing satellite observations. Therefore, data from a single satellite is insufficient to accurately capture snow dynamics, especially in semi-arid areas where snowfall is extremely variable in both time and space. Considering these limitations, the combined use of the next generation of multispectral sensor data from the Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2), with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 30 m, provides unprecedented opportunities to enhance snow cover mapping. Hence, the purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the combined use of optical sensors through image fusion techniques for capturing snow dynamics and producing detailed and dense normalized difference snow index (NDSI) time series within a semi-arid context. Three different models include the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), the flexible spatio-temporal data fusion model (FSDAF), and the pre-classification flexible spatio-temporal data fusion model (pre-classification FSDAF) were tested and compared to merge L8 and S2 data. The results showed that the pre-classification FSDAF model generates the most accurate precise fused NDSI images and retains spatial detail compared to the other models, with the root mean square error (RMSE = 0.12) and the correlation coefficient (R = 0.96). Our results reveal that, the pre-classification FSDAF model provides a high-resolution merged snow time series and can compensate the lack of ground-based snow cover data.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Cutaneous Melanoma, a Clinical Point of View
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a surgical procedure that has been used in patients with cutaneous melanoma for nearly 30 years. It is used for both staging and regional disease control with minimum morbidity, as proven by numerous worldwide prospective studies. It has been incorporated in the recommendations of national and professional guidelines. In this article, we provide a summary of the general information on SLNB in the clinical guidelines for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma (American Association of Dermatology, European Society of Medical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and Cancer Council Australia) and review the most relevant literature to provide an update on the existing recommendations for SLNB.

TI  - The tree that called my name: on the significance of encountering the constellated symbol in the natural, other-than-human, world
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper I explore what it means to encounter the symbol as a meaningful object, or process, within the environment of the other-than-human. Using Jung's account in 'The spirit mercurius' of an enlisted Indigenous soldier who attempts to desert his barracks on hearing a native Oji tree calling him, I compare the evolving stages of consciousness theorised by Jung to explain this phenomenon with the progression discussed by him in his commentary on Dorn's coniunctio. My aim is to clarify Jung's understanding of the symbolically constellated and 'undifferentiated' worldview of what Jung calls the 'primitive'. I also draw on the work of Spitzform, Searles, Roszak, Fisher, Chalquist, Prentice and Rust in relation to the emerging field of ecopsychology, where consideration of a fundamental link between psychological and material existence - between psyche and ecos - has been proposed as an essential component of psychological theory, and in which our alienation from our natural surroundings has been identified as pathological. I include observations from my own experience of working therapeutically with clients in outdoor settings and I ask how a more ecosystemically integrated sense of self might be sought for a psyche that encounters symbolic material within its containing environment.

TI  - The Association Between Rainfall, Temperature, and Reported Drinking Water Source: A Multi-Country Analysis
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change may alter access to safe drinking water, with important implications for health. We assessed the relationship between temperature and rainfall and utilization of basic drinking water (BDW) in The Gambia, Mozambique, Pakistan, and Kenya. The outcomes of interest were (a) whether the reported drinking water source used in the past 2 weeks met the World Health Organization definition of BDW and (b) use of a BDW source that was always available. Temperature and precipitation data were compiled from weather stations and satellite data and summarized to account for long- and short-term weather patterns and lags. We utilized random forests and logistic regression to identify key weather variables that predicted outcomes by site and the association between important weather variables and BDW use. Higher temperatures were associated with decreased BDW use at three of four sites and decreased use of BDW that is always available at all four sites. Increasing rainfall, both in the long- and short-term, was associated with increased BDW use in three sites. We found evidence for interactions between household wealth and weather variables at two sites, suggesting lower wealth populations may be more sensitive to weather-driven changes in water access. Changes in temperature and precipitation can alter safe water use in low-resource settings-investigating drivers for these relationships can inform efforts to build climate resilience.

TI  - Examination of maternal near-miss experiences in the hospital setting among Black women in the United States
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The high rate of maternal mortality among Black women in the United States continues to gain attention; yet research has not yet fully illuminated the precursors to these events, most impactful among them being "maternal near misses." A maternal near miss occurs when a woman nearly dies but survives a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy. Researchers have focused on reviewing patient medical records after sentinel maternal events to help determine major contributors to them; however, qualitative studies with near-miss survivors, especially among Black women, may be a more useful approach. Methods: Using a qualitative methodology, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 Black women to explore how they perceived the care provided to them during their near-miss experiences. Our study also employed a phenomenology framework to understand the lived experience of Black women who had a maternal near miss in the context of a hospital setting. Results: We interviewed 12 women between October 2020 and March 2021. All participants had a maternal near miss between the years 2010 and 2020 and were aged between 19 and 41 years when they had their near-miss experience. These women identified communication, patient-provider relationship, skills/competency of staff, provider discrimination, systems issues, and emotional distress as major contributors to their experiences. Conclusion: Maternal near misses serve as a precursor to maternal mortality events. By listening to patients and their families recount their perspectives on what leads up to these near misses, we can unearth valuable lessons that can aid in the development of strategies and interventions to decrease the numbers of pregnancy-related deaths; especially among Black women who suffer disproportionately from maternal morbidity and mortality. Based on these findings, we recommend that hospitals and OB-GYN practices consider the unique predispositions of their Black patients; account for their own personal biases, revisit the near-miss experiences of past patients to keep patients central to care and build rapport between patients and hospital birthing support staff; and center discussions about improvements in care around racist structures and systems.

TI  - Quantifying Irrigated Winter Wheat LAI in Argentina Using Multiple Sentinel-1 Incidence Angles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provides an appealing opportunity for all-weather day or night Earth surface monitoring. The European constellation Sentinel-1 (S1) consisting of S1-A and S1-B satellites offers a suitable revisit time and spatial resolution for the observation of croplands from space. The C-band radar backscatter is sensitive to vegetation structure changes and phenology as well as soil moisture and roughness. It also varies depending on the local incidence angle (LIA) of the SAR acquisition's geometry. The LIA backscatter dependency could therefore be exploited to improve the retrieval of the crop biophysical variables. The availability of S1 radar time-series data at distinct observation angles holds the feasibility to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) evolution considering spatiotemporal coverage of intensively cultivated areas. Accordingly, this research presents a workflow merging multi-date S1 smoothed data acquired at distinct LIA with a Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and a cross-validation (CV) strategy to estimate cropland LAI of irrigated winter wheat. The GPR-S1-LAI model was tested against in situ data of the 2020 winter wheat campaign in the irrigated valley of Colorador river, South of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. We achieved adequate validation results for LAI with R-CV(2) = 0.67 and RMSECV = 0.88 m(2) m(-2). The trained model was further applied to a series of S1 stacked images, generating temporal LAI maps that well reflect the crop growth cycle. The robustness of the retrieval workflow is supported by the associated uncertainties along with the obtained maps. We found that processing S1 smoothed imagery with distinct acquisition geometries permits accurate radar-based LAI modeling throughout large irrigated areas and in consequence can support agricultural management practices in cloud-prone agri-environments.

TI  - Exploring Natura 2000 habitats by satellite image segmentation combined with phytosociological data: a case study from the Cierny Balog area (Central Slovakia)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natura 2000 is a network of protected areas covering Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats. Recently, biota belonging to these networks have been threatened by both climate change and various human impacts. Regular monitoring is needed to ensure effective protection and proper management measures in these sites and habitats, but conventional field approaches are often time-consuming and inaccurate. New approaches and studies with different focuses and results are being developed. Our approach includes point data from field research and phytosociological databases as starting points for automatic segmentation, which has been developed just recently as a novel method that could help to connect ground-based and remote sensing data. Our case study is located in Central Slovakia, in the mountains around the village of Cierny Balog. The main aim of our case study is to apply advanced remote sensing techniques to map the area and condition of vegetation units. We focus on forest habitats belonging mainly to the Natura 2000 network. We concentrated on the verification of the possibilities of differentiation of various habitats using only multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite data. Our software NaturaSat created by our team was used to reach our objectives. After collecting data in the field using phytosociological approach and segmenting the explored areas in the program NaturaSat, spectral characteristics were calculated within identified habitats using software tools, which were subsequently processed and tested statistically. We obtained significant differences between forest habitat types. Also, segmentation accuracy was tested by comparing closed planar curves of ground based filed data and software results. This provided promising results and validation of the methods used. The results of this study have the potential to be used in a wider area to map the occurrence and quality of Natura 2000 habitats.

TI  - HY-1C Coastal Zone Imager observations of the suspended sediment content distribution details in the sea area near Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge in China
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HKZMB) on suspended sediment content (SSC) were analysed in the Zhujiang River Estuary based on data from HY-1C, which was launched in September 2018 in China, carrying Coastal Zone Imager (CZI) and Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner on it. A new SSC inversion model was established based on the relationship between in-situ SSC and the remote sensing reflectance in red and near-infrared bands of CZI image. HY-1C satellite data obtained from October to December 2019 were applied to retrieve SSC in the Zhujiang River Estuary. The results show that SSC around the HKZMB is ranging from 20 mg/L to 95 mg/L. SSC change obviously on two sides of the bridge. During flooding and ebbing period, SSC increases obviously downstream of the bridge. SSC difference between upstream and downstream is ranging from 5 mg/L to 20 mg/L. Currents flowing across the HKZMB, the change trend of SSC in most places upstream and downstream is almost the same that SSC downstream of the bridge is higher than SSC upstream. The tidal currents interact with bridge piers, inducing vortexes downstream, leading the sediment to re-suspend downstream of the bridge piers. Other factors, including seafloor topography and wind, can also contribute to the distribution of SSC in the Zhujiang River Estuary.

TI  - Self-Supervised Encoders Are Better Transfer Learners in Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Transfer learning has been shown to be an effective method for achieving high-performance models when applying deep learning to remote sensing data. Recent research has demonstrated that representations learned through self-supervision transfer better than representations learned on supervised classification tasks. However, little research has focused explicitly on applying self-supervised encoders to remote sensing tasks. Using three diverse remote sensing datasets, we compared the performance of encoders pre-trained through both supervision and self-supervision on ImageNet, then fine-tuned on a final remote sensing task. Furthermore, we explored whether performance benefited from further pre-training on remote sensing data. Our experiments used SwAV due to its comparably lower computational requirements, as this method would prove most easily replicable by practitioners. We show that an encoder pre-trained on ImageNet using self-supervision transfers better than one pre-trained using supervision on three diverse remote sensing applications. Moreover, self-supervision on the target data alone as a pre-training step seldom boosts performance beyond this transferred encoder. We attribute this inefficacy to the lower diversity and size of remote sensing datasets, compared to ImageNet. In conclusion, we recommend that researchers use self-supervised representations for transfer learning on remote sensing data and that future research should focus on ways to increase performance further using self-supervision.

TI  - miRNA probe integrated biosensor platform using bimetallic nanostars for amplification-free multiplexed detection of circulating colorectal cancer biomarkers in clinical samples
T2  - BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a critical need for sensitive and rapid detection technologies utilizing molecular biotargets such as microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate gene expression and are a promising class of diagnostic biomarkers for disease detection. Here, we present the development and fabrication of a highly reproducible and robust plas-monic bimetallic nanostar biosensing platform to detect miRNA targets using surfaced-enhanced Raman scat-tering (SERS)-based gene probes called the inverse Molecular Sentinel (iMS). We investigated and optimized the integration of iMS gene probes onto this SERS substrate, achieving ultra-sensitive detection with limits of detection of 6.8 and 16.7 zmol within the sensing region for two miRNA sequences of interest. Finally, we demonstrated the biomedical usefulness of this nanobiosensor platform with the multiplexed detection of upregulated miRNA targets, miR21 and miR221, from colorectal cancer patient plasma. The resulting SERS data are in excellent agreement with PCR data obtained from patient samples and can distinguish between healthy and cancerous patient samples. These results underline the potential of the iMS-integrated substrate nano-biosensing platform for rapid and sensitive diagnostics of cancer biomarkers for point-of-care applications.

TI  - The Identification and Driving Factor Analysis of Ecological-Economi Spatial Conflict in Nanjing Metropolitan Area Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid socio-economic development of the metropolitan area has led to the continuous deterioration of the ecological environment. This leads to intense competition and conflict between different spatial use types. Spatial conflict research is essential to achieve ecological-economic coordination and high-quality development. However, existing studies lack comprehensive and direct ecological-economic spatial conflicts, especially those on the spatial-temporal evolution and potential drivers of spatial conflict. In this study, we identified the ecological-economic spatial conflicts in the Nanjing metropolitan area in 2010, 2015, and 2020. This study used the random forest to analyze the factors that influenced the change of spatial conflict. Results show that: (1) From 2010 to 2020, the ecological-economic spatial conflict in the Nanjing metropolitan area changed significantly. (2) Land use change has an important effect on spatial conflicts, which are easily triggered by uncontrolled urban expansion, but ecological land can mitigate spatial conflicts. (3) Relevant driving factors of spatial conflicts show multi-level features, so the development of conflict reconciliation countermeasures needs to be tailored to local conditions. This study provides a significant foundation for the high-quality development of the Nanjing metropolitan area and provides a reference for the planning and management of the territorial space.

TI  - Detection and Identification of Mesoscale Eddies in the South China Sea Based on an Artificial Neural Network Model-YOLOF and Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale eddies are typical mesoscale ocean phenomena that exist widely in all oceans and marginal seas around the world, playing important roles in ocean circulation and material transport. They also have important impacts on the safe navigation of ships and underwater acoustic communications. Traditional mesoscale eddy identification methods are subjective and usually depend on parameters that must be pre-defined or adjusted by experts, meaning that their accuracy cannot be guaranteed. With the rise of deep learning, the "you only look once" (YOLO) series target recognition models have been shown to present certain advantages in eddy detection and recognition. Based on sea level anomaly (SLA) data provided over the past 30 years by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS), as well as deep transfer learning, we propose a method for oceanic mesoscale eddy detection and identification based on the "you only look once level feature" (YOLOF) model. Using the proposed model, the mesoscale eddies in the South China Sea from 1993 to 2021 were detected and identified. Compared with traditional recognition methods, the proposed model had a better recognition effect (with an accuracy of 91%) and avoided the bias associated with subjectively set thresholds; to a certain extent, the model also improved the detection of and the identification speed for mesoscale eddies. The method proposed in this paper not only promotes the development of deep learning in the field of oceanic mesoscale eddy detection and identification, but also provides an effective technical method for the study of mesoscale eddy detection using sea surface height data.

AB  - Invasive species are one of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide, and the Galapagos Islands are no exception. With the need to control many invasive plant species, accurate distribution maps of invasive plant species are crucial for cost-effective management actions. To guide the selection of appropriate multispectral satellite imagery for this, we evaluated the effects that spatial resolution has on the mapping accuracy of the most invasive plant species in Galapagos with different "growth forms": (1) tall tree: Cuban cedar (Cedrela odorata), (2) medium tree: guava (Psidium guajava), and (3) shrub: blackberry (Rubus niveus). We developed a mapping methodology based on very high resolution (VHR, WorldView-2) imagery and visual interpretation from orthophotos obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles for training and validation. We then compared our VHR mapping results with medium resolution (MR, Landsat) mapping results and calculated the overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa from confusion matrices for each target species and resolution based on the visual interpretation of Google Earth imagery. The results showed that the OA of the maps produced with VHR was significantly higher than the ones produced with MR. The OA was higher for the tall tree growth form, followed by the shrub and the medium tree growth form. Kappa estimates of <0.5 for MR for the medium tree and shrub growth forms demonstrated its unsuitability for accurate mapping. While MR may be sufficient for mapping the tall tree growth form, we concluded that VHR is indispensable for mapping the medium tree and shrub growth forms.

TI  - Design of a Forest Fire Early Alert System through a Deep 3D-CNN Structure and a WRF-CNN Bias Correction
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the years, wildfires have negatively impacted ecological systems and urban areas. Hence, reinforcing territorial risk management strategies against wildfires is essential. In this study, we built an early alert system (EAS) with two different Machine Learning (ML) techniques to calculate the meteorological conditions of two Colombian areas: (i) A 3D convolutional neural net capable of learning from satellite data and (ii) a convolutional network to bias-correct the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output. The results were used to quantify the daily Fire Weather Index and were coupled with the outcomes from a land cover analysis conducted through a Naive-Bayes classifier to estimate the probability of wildfire occurrence. These results, combined with an assessment of global vulnerability in both locations, allow the construction of daily risk maps in both areas. On the other hand, a set of short-term preventive and corrective measures were suggested to public authorities to implement, after an early alert prediction of a possible future wildfire. Finally, Soil Management Practices are proposed to tackle the medium- and long-term causes of wildfire development, with the aim of reducing vulnerability and promoting soil protection. In conclusion, this paper creates an EAS for wildfires, based on novel ML techniques and risk maps.

TI  - Soil Moisture Prediction from Remote Sensing Images Coupled with Climate, Soil Texture and Topography via Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important biophysical parameter by which to evaluate water resource potential, especially for agricultural activities under the pressure of global warming. The recent advancements in different types of satellite imagery coupled with deep learning-based frameworks have opened the door for large-scale SM estimation. In this research, high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter data and high temporal resolution soil moisture active passive (SMAP) SM data were combined to create short-term SM predictions that can accommodate agricultural activities in the field scale. We created a deep learning model to forecast the daily SM values by using time series of climate and radar satellite data along with the soil type and topographic data. The model was trained with static and dynamic features that influence SM retrieval. Although the topography and soil texture data were taken as stationary, SMAP SM data and Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter coefficients, including their ratios, and climate data were fed to the model as dynamic features. As a target data to train the model, we used in situ measurements acquired from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). We employed a deep learning framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture with two hidden layers that have 32 unit sizes and a fully connected layer. The accuracy of the optimized LSTM model was found to be effective for SM prediction with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.87, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.046, unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.045, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.033. The model's performance was also evaluated concerning above-ground biomass, land cover classes, soil texture variations, and climate classes. The model prediction ability was lower in areas with high normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values. Moreover, the model can better predict in dry climate areas, such as arid and semi-arid climates, where precipitation is relatively low. The daily prediction of SM values based on microwave remote sensing data and geophysical features was successfully achieved by using an LSTM framework to assist various studies, such as hydrology and agriculture.

TI  - Extracting Urban Water Bodies from Landsat Imagery Based on mNDWI and HSV Transformation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban water bodies are critical for sustainable urban ecological and social development. However, the complex compositions of urban land cover and small water bodies pose considerable challenges to urban water surface delineation. Here, we propose a novel urban water extraction algorithm (UWEA) that is efficient in distinguishing water and other low-reflective objects by combining the modified normalized difference water index (mNDWI) and HSV transformation. The spectral properties of urban land covers were analyzed and the separability of objects in different color spaces was compared before applying the HSV transformation. The accuracy and robustness of the UWEA were validated in six highly urbanized subregions of Beijing, Tokyo, and New York, and compared with the mNDWI and HIS methods. The results show that the UWEA had the fewest total errors (sum of omission and commission errors) for all the validation sites, which was approximately 3% fewer errors than those of the mNDWI and 17% fewer errors than those of the HIS method. The UWEA performed best because it was good at identifying small water bodies and suppressing reflective surfaces. The UWEA is effective in urban water monitoring and its thresholds are also robust in various situations. The resulting highly accurate water map could support water-related analyses. This method is also useful for scientists, managers, and planners in water resource management, urban hydrological applications, and sustainable urban development.

TI  - Reconstruction of Near-Surface Air Temperature over the Greenland Ice Sheet Based on MODIS Data and Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial and temporal resolution products of near-surface air temperature (T2m) over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) are required as baseline information in a variety of research disciplines. Due to the sparse network of in situ data on the GrIS, remote sensing data and machine learning methods provide great advantages, due to their capacity and accessibility. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) at 780 m resolution from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and T2m observation from 25 Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) are used to establish a relationship over the GrIS by comparing multiple machine learning approaches. Four machine learning methods-neural network (NN), gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)-are used to reconstruct the T2m at daily and monthly scales. We develop a reliable T2m reconstruction model based on key meteorological parameters, such as albedo, wind speed, and specific humidity. The reconstructions daily and monthly products are generated on a 780 m x 780 m spatial grid spanning from 2007 to 2019. When compared with in situ observations, the NN method presents the highest accuracy, with R of 0.96, RMSE of 2.67 degrees C, and BIAS of -0.36 degrees C. Similar to the regional climate model (RACMO2.3p2), the reconstructed T2m can better reflect the spatial pattern in term of latitude, longitude, and altitude effects.

TI  - MODIS Evapotranspiration Downscaling Using a Deep Neural Network Trained Using Landsat 8 Reflectance and Temperature Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODIS 8-day composite evapotranspiration (ET) product (MOD16A2) is widely used to study large-scale hydrological cycle and energy budgets. However, the MOD16A2 spatial resolution (500 m) is too coarse for local and regional water resource management in agricultural applications. In this study, we propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based MOD16A2 downscaling approach to generate 30 m ET using Landsat 8 surface reflectance and temperature and AgERA5 meteorological variables. The model was trained at a 500 m resolution using the MOD16A2 ET as reference and applied to the Landsat 8 30 m resolution. The approach was tested on 15 Landsat 8 images over three agricultural study sites in the United States and compared with the classical random forest regression model that has been often used for ET downscaling. All evaluation sample sets applied to the DNN regression model had higher R2 and lower root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) and relative RMSD (rRMSD) (the average values: 0.67, 2.63 mm/8d and 14.25%, respectively) than the random forest model (0.64, 2.76 mm/8d and 14.92%, respectively). Spatial improvement was visually evident both in the DNN and the random forest downscaled 30 m ET maps compared with the 500 m MOD16A2, while the DNN-downscaled ET appeared more consistent with land surface cover variations. Comparison with the in situ ET measurements (AmeriFlux) showed that the DNN-downscaled ET had better accuracy, with R2 of 0.73, RMSD of 5.99 mm/8d and rRMSD of 48.65%, than the MOD16A2 ET (0.65, 7.18 and 50.42%, respectively).

TI  - Use of a Carbon Nanoparticle Tracer to Detect Sentinel Lymph Nodes for the Precise Treatment of Endometrial Carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of a carbon nanoparticle (CNP) tracer for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for the precise treatment of endometrial carcinoma (EC). Among patients who presented at First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, and Xiangshan First People's Hospital Medical and Health Group between February 2019 and February 2022, we selected 90 patients who required surgical treatment for EC. During the operation, CNP was injected into the cervix by the two-point method, and black-stained LNs were identified as SLNs and resected. Then, statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate SLN occurrence area, CNP traceability, SLN detection rate, as well as diagnostic data such as false negative rate (FNR), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV), and accuracy (ACC). CNP tracing detected SLN mainly at the external iliac (45.09%) and obturator (36.36%) regions. CNP tracing of SLNs was successfulin 80 patients, with an SLN detection rate of 88.89%. Eight cases (10.00%) IP: 2038 10920 On: Fri, 31 Mar 2023 08:02:50 were positive for SLNs, with an FNR of 12.50%. The SEN, SPE, PPV, NV, and ACC values for CNP detection of SLNs Copyrigh : American Sc entif c Publishers were 87.50%, 98.78%, 87.50%, 98.78%, and 97.78%, respectively. Our results indicate that CNP is an effective tracer Delivered by Ingenta for SLNs. When operating on EC patients, CNP tracing of SLNs can help to judge lymph node metastasis and regional distribution, providing a reliable basis for the determination of surgical scope.

TI  - Mapping Forest Aboveground Biomass with MODIS and Fengyun-3C VIRR Imageries in Yunnan Province, Southwest China Using Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aboveground biomass (AGB) of a forest is an important indicator of the forest's terrestrial carbon storage and its relation to climate change. Due to the advantage of extensive spatial coverage and low cost, coarse-resolution remote sensing data is the main data source for wall-to-wall mapping of forest AGB at the regional scale. Despite this, improving the accuracy and efficiency of forest AGB estimation is a major challenge. In this study, two optical imageries, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500 m imagery and Fengyun-3C Visible and Infrared Radiometer (FY-3C VIRR) 1000 m imagery, were used and compared for forest AGB estimation in Yunnan Province, southwest China. One parametric approach, multiple linear regression (MLR), and two nonparametric approaches, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF), were applied for the two imagery datasets, respectively. We evaluated the performance of the combination of remote sensing data and modeling approaches by comparing the accuracies and also explored the potential of FY-3C imagery data in forest AGB estimation at the regional scale as it was used for this purpose for the first time. We found that the machine learning models KNN and RF provided better results than MLR. From the three approaches for both MODIS and FY-3C imagery, RF performed best with R-2 values of 0.84 and 0.81 and RMSE of 23.18 and 23.43, respectively. Estimation of forest AGB based on MODIS was marginally better than the estimation based on FY-3C. FY-3C imagery could therefore be an additional optical remote sensing data source of coarse spatial resolution, comparable to MODIS data which has been widely used for regional forest AGB estimation. Indices related to forest canopy moisture levels from both types of imagery were sensitive to forest AGB. The RF model and MODIS imagery were then applied to map the spatial variation of forest AGB of Yunnan Province. As a result of our study, we determined that Yunnan Province has a total forest AGB of 2123.22 Mt, with a mean value of 58.05 t/ha for forestland in 2016.

TI  - Multi-Scale Validation and Uncertainty Analysis of GEOV3 and MuSyQ FVC Products: A Case Study of an Alpine Grassland Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) products provide essential data support for ecological environmental monitoring and simulation studies. However, the lack of validation efforts of FVC products limits their applications. Based on Sentinel-2 data and intensive multi-scale measured FVC data, the accuracies of two FVC products (GEOV3 and MuSyQ) in alpine grassland ecosystems were validated through direct validation and multi-scale validation. Based on the heterogeneity of the underlying surface (HUS) of the monitoring plots, the impact of the HUS of the monitoring plots on the product validation was analyzed. The results showed that: (1) the measured data directly validated that the GEOV3 FVC product performed better than the MuSyQ FVC product; (2) the multi-scale validation method based on high-resolution reference FVC map of Sentienl-2 satellite images validated the accuracy of these two FVC products, which was higher than the accuracy directly validated by FVC measured data, leading to overestimation of the validation results; and (3) the HUS of the monitored plots has a significant impact on the FVC product validation. By quantifying the HUS of the monitored plots and removing the heterogeneous monitoring plots, the uncertainty of the validation results can be reduced. It is necessary to consider the impact of validation methods and the HUS on the validation results in future product validation.

TI  - Fine vertical structures of cloud from a ground-based cloud radar over the western Tianshan mountains
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the grounded-based Ka-band millimetre-wave cloud radar (MMCR) is used to analyse the cloud characteristics over the western Tianshan mountains. The cloud top height (CTH) obtained by MMCR is verified by comparing it with the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) observations. Overall, the MMCR-obtained CTHs are attenuated and lower than the FY-4A-obtained CTHs under precipitation conditions. Thus, the FY-4A data is used to complement MMCR data when there is rainfall. The diurnal, seasonal variation and vertical structures of the cloud are further examined using the combination of MMCR and FY-4A. The result indicates that the CTH and cloud base height (CBH) are highest in summer and lowest in winter. Also, clouds tend to form frequently at night in spring, summer, and winter. Although in autumn, clouds tend to form most frequently in the morning. This may be related to the diurnal variation of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. Moreover, the CTHs occur most frequently at heights of 8-9 km in spring and autumn, 9-10 km in summer, and 7-8 km in winter. The high CTHs caused by the strong convective activities in summer may be related to sufficient water vapour transport. These corrected CTH data are also used to classify cloud types, the results indicate that the proportion of high clouds is highest in summer, while the proportion of medium clouds is lower than in the other three seasons. Also, the average CTH of the low, medium, and high clouds is highest in summer and lowest in winter.

TI  - Remote Sensing of the Seasonal and Interannual Variability of Surface Chlorophyll-a Concentration in the Northwest Pacific over the Past 23 Years (1997-2020)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton in the northwest Pacific plays an important role in absorbing atmospheric CO2 and promoting the ocean carbon cycle. However, our knowledge on the long-term interannual variabilities of the phytoplankton biomass in this region is quite limited. In this study, based on the Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) time series observed from ocean color satellites of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the period of 1997-2020, we investigated the variabilities of Chl-a on both seasonal and interannual scales, as well as the long-term trends. The phytoplankton Chl-a showed large spatial dynamics with a general decreasing pattern poleward. The seasonal phytoplankton blooms dominated the seasonal characteristics of Chl-a, with spring and fall blooms identified in subpolar waters and single spring blooms in subtropical seas. On interannual scales, we found a Chl-a increasing belt in the subpolar oceans from the marginal sea toward the northeast open ocean waters, with positive trends (similar to 0.02 mg m(-3) yr(-1), on average) in Chl-a at significant levels (p < 0.05). In the subtropical gyre, Chl-a showed slight but significant negative trends (i.e., <-0.0006 mg m(-3) yr(-1), at p < 0.05). The negative Chl-a trends in the subtropical waters tended to be driven by the surface warming, which could inhibit nutrient supplies from the subsurface and thus limit phytoplankton growth. For the subpolar waters, although the surface warming also prevailed over the study period, the in situ surface nitrate reservoir somehow showed significant increases in the targeted spots, indicating potential external nitrate supplies into the surface layer. We did not find significant connections between the Chl-a interannual variabilities and the climate indices in the study area. Environmental data with finer spatial and temporal resolutions will further constrain the findings.

TI  - Spectral Discrimination of Pumice Rafts in Optical MSI Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pumice rafts are considered to be a long-range drifting agent that promotes material exchange and the dispersal of marine species. Large ones can also interfere with vessel navigation and have a negative impact on the social economy and marine ecosystems. Synoptic observations from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2, with a spatial resolution of up to 10 m, provide an excellent means to monitor and track pumice rafts. In this study, the use of a Spectral-Feature-Based Extraction (SFBE) algorithm to automatically discriminate and extract pumice on the ocean surface from submarine volcano eruptions was proposed. Specifically, a Pumice Raft Index (PRI) was developed based on the spectral signatures of pumice in MSI imagery to identify potential pumice features. After pre-processing, the PRI image was then subjected to a series of per-pixel and object-based processes to rule out false-positive detections, including shallow water, striped edges, mudflats, and cloud edges. The SFBE algorithm showed excellent performance in extracting pumice rafts and was successfully applied to extract pumice rafts near the Fiji Yasawa islands in 2019 and Hunga Tonga island in 2022, with an overall pumice extraction accuracy of 95.5% and a proportion of pixels mis-extracted as pumice of <3%. The robustness of the algorithm has also been tested and proved through applying it to data and comparing its output to results from previous studies. The timely and accurate detection of pumice using the algorithm proposed here is expected to provide important information to aid in response actions and ecological assessments, and will lead to a better understanding of the fate of pumice.

TI  - Incidence Angle Normalization of Dual-Polarized Sentinel-1 Backscatter Data on Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The backscatter coefficients of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images that observe the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) are incidence angle dependent, which impedes subsequent applications, such as monitoring its surface melting. Therefore, backscatter intensities with varying incidence angles should be normalized. This study proposes an incidence angle normalization method for dual-polarized Sentinel-1 images for GrIS. A multiple linear regression model is trained using the ratio between the backscatter coefficient differences and the incidence angle differences of quasi-simultaneously observed ascending and descending image pairs. Regression factors include the geographical position and elevation. The precision evaluation to the ascending and descending images suggests better normalization results than the widely used cosine-square correction method for horizontal transmit and horizontal receive (HH) images and a slight improvement for horizontal transmit and vertical receive (HV) images. Another dataset of GrIS Sentinel-1 mosaics in four 6-day repeating periods in 2020 is also tested to evaluate the proposed method and yields similar results. For HH images, the proposed method performs better than the cosine-square method, reducing 0.34 dB RMSE on average. The overall accuracy of our proposed method is 0.77 and 0.75 dB for HH and HV images, respectively. The proposed incidence angle normalization method can benefit the application of wide-swath SAR images to the study of large-scale and long-period observation on GrIS.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification with Self-Supervised Learning Based on Partially Unlabeled Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, supervised learning, represented by deep learning, has shown good performance in remote sensing image scene classification with its powerful feature learning ability. However, this method requires large-scale and high-quality handcrafted labeled datasets, which leads to a high cost of obtaining annotated samples. Self-supervised learning can alleviate this problem by using unlabeled data to learn the image's feature representation and then migrate to the downstream task. In this study, we use an encoder-decoder structure to construct a self-supervised learning architecture. In the encoding stage, the image mask is used to discard some of the image patches randomly, and the image's feature representation can be learned from the remaining image patches. In the decoding stage, the lightweight decoder is used to recover the pixels of the original image patches according to the features learned in the encoding stage. We constructed a large-scale unlabeled training set using several public scene classification datasets and Gaofen-2 satellite data to train the self-supervised learning model. In the downstream task, we use the encoder structure with the masked image patches that have been removed as the backbone network of the scene classification task. Then, we fine-tune the pre-trained weights of self-supervised learning in the encoding stage on two open datasets with complex scene categories. The datasets include NWPU-RESISC45 and AID. Compared with other mainstream supervised learning methods and self-supervised learning methods, our proposed method has better performance than the most state-of-the-art methods in the task of remote sensing image scene classification.

TI  - Cloud Occlusion Probability Calculation Jointly Using Himawari-8 and CloudSat Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud occlusion is an important factor affecting flight safety and scientific observation. The calculation of Cloud Occlusion Probability (COP) is significant for the planning of the flight time and route of aircraft. Based on Himawari-8 and CloudSat satellite data, we propose a method to calculate the COP. The COP statistics were carried out on different distances in 12 directions 6 km above Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA), at different heights and directions in the Haiyang aerostat production base, and at different times and seasons in Mount Qomolangma. It was found that the COP going in the southern direction from BCIA was greater than that in the northern direction by 0.67-3.12%, which is consistent with the climate conditions of Beijing. In Haiyang, the COP for several seasons in the direction of land was higher than in the direction of the ocean. The maximum COP for the 6 km altitude is 29.63% (summer) and the minimum COP is 7.59% (winter). The aerostat flight test can be conducted in the morning of winter and the direction of the ocean. The best scientific observation time for Mount Qomolangma is between 02:00 and 05:00 UTC in spring. With the increase in altitude, the COP gradually decreases. The research in this paper provides essential support for flight planning.

TI  - Power-Law Viscoelastic Flow of the Lower Accretionary Prism in the Makran Subduction Zone Following the 2013 Baluchistan Earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Subduction zone accretionary prisms are commonly modeled as elastic structures where permanent deformation is accommodated by faulting and folding of otherwise elastic materials, yet accretionary prisms may exhibit other deformation styles over relatively short time scales. In this study, we use 6.5-year (2014-2021) Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series of post-seismic deformation in the Makran accretionary prism of southeast Pakistan to characterize non-linear viscoelastic deformation within an active accretionary prism on short timescales (months to years). We constructed a series of 3-D finite-element models of the Makran subduction zone, including an accretionary prism, and constrained the elastic thickness of the upper wedge and the flow-law parameters (power-law exponent, activation enthalpy, and pre-exponential constant) of the lower wedge through forward model fits to the InSAR time-series. Our results show that the prism is elastically thin (8-12 km) and the non-linear viscoelastic relaxation of the deep portions of the prism alone can sufficiently explain the post-seismic surface deformation. Our best fitting flow-law parameters (n = 3.76 +/- 0.39, Q = 82.2 +/- 37.73 kJ mol(-1), and A = 10(-3.36 +/- 4.69)) are consistent with triggering of low temperature dislocation creep within fluid-saturated siliciclastic rocks. We believe that the fluids necessary for this weakening originate from sedimentary underplating and/or the presence the hydrocarbons. The presence of power-law rheology within the lower wedge impacts the estimated plate coupling and the stress state in the subduction system, with respect to the conventional elastic wedge model, and hence should to be considered in future earthquake cycle models.

TI  - A Simple and Effective Random Forest Refit to Map the Spatial Distribution of NO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a random forest-random pixel ID (RF-RID) method, which could reduce local anomalies in the simulation of NO2 spatial distribution and significantly improve prediction accuracy in rural areas. First, the 470 nm MAIAC AOD and OMI NO2 total and tropospheric vertical column were packed using the two-step method (TWS). Second, using RID, the filled data and auxiliary variables were combined with random forest (RF) to build an RF-RID model to predict the 1 km/d NO2 spatial distribution in southwestern Fujian (SWFJ) in 2018. The results show that the RF-RID achieves enhanced performance in the CV of the observed sample (R = 0.9117, RMSE = 3.895). Meanwhile, RF-RID has a higher correlation with the road length (RL) in remote areas, and the proposed method solves the issue related to strips or patches of NO2 spatial distribution. This model offers insights into the related research on air pollutants in large areas.

TI  - Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Based Prediction of Forest Plantation C Stock Using Spatially Varying Coefficient Bayesian Hierarchical Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study sought to establish the performance of Spatially Varying Coefficient (SVC) Bayesian Hierarchical models using Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 derived auxiliary information in predicting plantation forest carbon (C) stock in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe. The development and implementation of Zimbabwe's land reform program undertaken in the year 2000 and the subsequent redistribution and resizing of large-scale land holdings are hypothesized to have created heterogeneity in aboveground forest biomass in plantation ecosystems. The Bayesian hierarchical framework, accommodating residual spatial dependence and non-stationarity of model predictors, was evaluated. Firstly, SVC models utilizing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), derived from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data and 191 sampled C stock observations were constructed. The SVC models built for each of the two multispectral remote sensing data sets were assessed based on the goodness of fit criterion as well as the predictive performance using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. The introduction of spatial random effects in the form of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 derived covariates to the model intercept improved the model fit and predictive performance where residual spatial dependence was dominant. For the Landsat-8 C stock predictive model, the RMSPE for the non-spatial, Spatially Varying Intercept (SVI) and SVC models were 8 MgCha(-1), 7.77 MgCha(-1), and 6.42 MgCha(-1) whilst it was 7.85 MgCha(-1), 7.69 MgCha(-1) and 6.23 MgCha(-1) for the Sentinel-2 C stock predictive models, respectively. Overall, the Sentinel-2-based SVC model was preferred for predicting C stock in plantation forest ecosystems as its model provided marginally tighter credible intervals, [1.17-1.60] MgCha(-1) when compared to the Landsat-8 based SVC model with 95% credible intervals of [1.13-1.62] Mg Cha(-1). The built SVC models provided an understanding of the performance of the multispectral remote sensing derived predictors for modeling C stock and thus provided an essential foundation required for updating the current carbon forest plantation databases.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping and Biopsy in Cats with Solid Malignancies: An Explorative Study
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first node in the basin that drains a solid tumor, and its histopathological examination after surgical removal is recommended in dogs and humans for correct tumor staging. In cats, however, the implementation of SLN biopsy (SLNB) has never been described. In this study, we included 12 cats presented with 14 solid malignancies that underwent surgical excision of a solid tumor and SLNB. The mapping technique used, location and number of SLN, correspondence with the regional lymph node (RLN), and histological status of the SLN were determined. The detection rate and complications of SLNB were also recorded. Near-infrared fluorescence lymphography (NIRF-L) was performed in 64.3% of tumors and lymphoscintigraphy in 35.7%. The detection rate was 100% for both techniques. The SLN did not correspond (fully or partially) to the RLN in 71.4% of cases, with multiple SLN being excised in 9/14 tumors. No complications related to SLNB were recorded. At histopathology, metastases were identified in 41.7% of cats, all with MCT. SLNB guided by NIRF-L or lymphoscintigraphy seems to be feasible and safe in cats with solid tumors and should be suggested for correct tumor staging in cats, especially with MCT. There is increasing evidence on the utility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) for the staging of dogs with various malignancies; however, comparable information is missing in cats. This multi-institutional study aims at reporting the feasibility and detection rate of SLNB guided by lymphoscintigraphy and the blue dye or near-infrared fluorescent lymphography (NIRF-L) in cats with solid tumors. In total, 12 cats presented with 14 solid malignancies that underwent curative-intent surgical excision of the primary tumor and SLNB were retrospectively enrolled. The mapping technique used, location and number of SLN, correspondence with the regional lymph node (RLN), and histological status of the SLN were retrieved. The detection rate and complications of SLNB were also recorded. NIRF-L was performed in 64.3% of tumors and lymphoscintigraphy in 35.7%. The detection rate was 100% for both techniques. The SLN did not correspond (fully or partially) to the RLN in 71.4% of cases, with multiple SLN being excised in 9/14 tumors. No complications related to SLNB were recorded. At histopathology, metastases were identified in 41.7% of cats, all with mast cell tumors (MCT). SLNB guided by NIRF-L or lymphoscintigraphy is feasible and safe in cats with solid tumors and should be suggested for correct tumor staging in cats, especially with MCT.

TI  - Applications and Safety of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node status is important in predicting the prognosis and guiding adjuvant treatment in endometrial cancer. However, previous studies showed that systematic lymphadenectomy conferred no therapeutic values in clinically early-stage endometrial cancer but might lead to substantial morbidity and impact on the quality of life of the patients. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node that tumor cells drain to, and sentinel lymph node biopsy has emerged as an acceptable alternative to full lymphadenectomy in both low-risk and high-risk endometrial cancer. Evidence has demonstrated a high detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy. It can also reduce surgical morbidity and improve the detection of lymph node metastases compared with systematic lymphadenectomy. This review summarizes the current techniques of sentinel lymph node mapping, the applications and oncological outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy in low-risk and high-risk endometrial cancer, and the management of isolated tumor cells in sentinel lymph nodes. We also illustrate a revised sentinel lymph node biopsy algorithm and advocate to repeat the tracer injection and explore the presacral and paraaortic areas if sentinel lymph nodes are not found in the hemipelvis.

TI  - Magma Chamber Detected Beneath an Arc Volcano With Full-Waveform Inversion of Active-Source Seismic Data
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arc volcanoes are underlain by complex systems of molten-rock reservoirs ranging from melt-poor mush zones to melt-rich magma chambers. Petrological and satellite data indicate that eruptible magma chambers form in the topmost few kilometres of the crust. However, very few chambers have ever been definitively located, suggesting that most are too short-lived or too small to be imaged, which has direct implications for hazard assessment and modeling of magma differentiation. Here we use a high-resolution technology based on inverting full seismic waveforms to image a small, high-melt-fraction magma chamber that was not detected with standard seismic tomography. The melt reservoir extends from similar to 2 to at least 4 km below sea level (b.s.l.) at Kolumbo-a submarine volcano near Santorini, Greece. The chamber coincides with the termination point of the recent earthquake swarms and may be a missing link between a deeper melt reservoir and the high-temperature hydrothermal system venting at the crater floor. The chamber poses a serious hazard as it could produce a highly explosive, tsunamigenic eruption in the near future. Our results suggest that similar reservoirs (relatively small but high-melt-fraction) may have gone undetected at other active volcanoes, challenging the existing eruption forecasts and reactive-flow models of magma differentiation.

TI  - Regional Variability and Driving Forces behind Forest Fires in Sweden
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme forest fires have been a historic concern in the forests of Canada, the Russian Federation, and the USA, and are now an increasing threat in boreal Europe, where recent fire events in 2014 and 2018 drew attention to Sweden. Our study objective was to understand the vulnerability of Swedish forests to fire by spatially analyzing historical burned areas, and to link fire events with weather, landscape, and fire-related socioeconomic factors. We developed an extensive database of 1 x 1 km(2) homogenous grids, where monthly burned areas were derived from the MODIS FireCCI51 dataset. The database consists of various socio-economic, topographic-, forest-, and weather-related remote sensing products. To include new factors in the IIASA's FLAM model, we developed a random forest model to assess the spatial probabilities of burned areas. Due to Sweden's geographical diversity, fire dynamics vary between six biogeographical zones. Therefore, the model was applied to each zone separately. As an outcome, we obtained probabilities of burned areas in the forests across Sweden and observed burned areas were well captured by the model. The result accuracy differs with respect to zone; the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.875 and 0.94 for zones with few fires, but above 0.95 for zones with a higher number of fire events. Feature importance analysis and their variability across Sweden provide valuable information to understand the reasons behind forest fires. The Fine Fuel Moisture Code, population and road densities, slope and aspect, and forest stand volume were found to be among the key fire-related factors in Sweden. Our modeling approach can be extended to hotspot mapping in other boreal regions and thus is highly policy-relevant. Visualization of our results is available in the Google Earth Engine Application.

TI  - Measuring Vertical Velocities with ADCPs in Low-Energy Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical velocities knowledge is essential to study fine-scale dynamics in the surface layers of the ocean and to understand their impact on biological production mechanisms. However, these vertical velocities have long been neglected, simply parameterized, or considered as not measurable, due mainly to their order of magnitude (less than mm s(-1) up to cm s(-1)), generally much lower than the one of the horizontal velocities (cm s(-1) to dm s(-1)), hence the challenge of their in situ measurement. In this paper, we present an upgraded method for direct in situ measurement of vertical velocities using data from different acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) associated with CTD probes, and we perform a comparative analysis of the results obtained by this method. The analyzed data were collected during the FUMSECK cruise, from three ADCPs: two Workhorse (conventional ADCPs), one lowered on a carousel and the other deployed in free-fall mode, and one Sentinel V (a new-generation ADCP with four classical beams and a fifth vertical beam), also lowered on a carousel. Our analyses provide profiles of vertical velocities on the order of mm s(-1), as expected, with standard deviations of a few mm s(-1). While the fifth beam of the Sentinel V exhibits a better accuracy than conventional ADCPs, the free-fall technique provides a more accurate measurement compared to the carousel technique. Finally, this innovative study opens up the possibility to perform simple and direct in situ measurements of vertical velocities, coupling the free-fall technique with a five-beam ADCP.

TI  - Optimizing Spectral Libraries from Landsat Imagery for the Analysis of Habitat Richness Using MESMA
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral mixture analysis of satellite images, such as MESMA (multiple endmember spectral mixtures analysis), can be used to obtain fraction images in which the abundance of each land occupation class is represented at the pixel level, which is crucial for the analysis of heterogeneous landscapes in which types of habitats vary at fine spatial scales. The objective of this work is to analyze the influence of spectral libraries of various characteristics on the performance of MESMA. To this end, eight spectral libraries from Landsat satellite images were elaborated with different characteristics in terms of size, composition, and temporality. The spectral libraries were optimized using the iterative selection of endmembers (IES) method with the MESMA technique to obtain the fraction images considering five habitat classes (forest, shrubland, grassland, water, and rock and bare soil). The application of MESMA resulted in the classification of more than 95% of pixels in all cases with a root mean square error (RMSE) less than or equal to 0.025. Validation of the fraction images through linear regressions resulted in an RMSE >= 0.35 for the shrubland and grassland classes, with a lower RMSE for the remaining classes. A significant influence of library size was observed, as well as a significant effect of temporality, with the best results obtained for the largest monotemporal libraries.

AB  - Valdivia Bank is an oceanic plateau in the South Atlantic formed by hot spot magmatism at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during the Late Cretaceous. It is part of the Walvis Ridge, an aseismic ridge and seamount chain widely considered to be formed by age-progressive volcanism from the Tristan-Gough plume. To better understand the formation and history of this edifice, we developed a bathymetric map of Valdivia Bank by merging available multibeam echosounder data sets with a bathymetry grid based mainly on satellite altimetry (SRTM15+). The bathymetric map reveals previously unresolved features including extensive rift grabens, volcanic mounds and knolls, and large-scale sediment transport systems. After Valdivia Bank was emplaced and probably eroded at sea level, it underwent a period of rifting, followed by a secondary magmatic pulse that caused regional uplift to sea-level, followed by subsidence to current depths. Shallow banks at depths of similar to 1,000 m are the result of a thick sediment pile atop uplifted volcanic crust. Several shallower mounds (similar to 1,000-520 m) and a guyot (similar to 220 m) likely resulted from coral reef growth atop one or more volcanic pedestals formed during the younger Cenozoic magmatic event. As sediments accumulated on the shallow platforms, sediment transport systems developed as gullies, channels and mass transport deposits carved valleys and troughs, shedding sediment into abyssal fans at the plateau base. The new bathymetric map demonstrates that oceanic plateaus are geologically active long after initial emplacement.

TI  - RTM Inversion through Predictive Equations for Multi-Crop LAI Retrieval Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-real-time, high-spatial-resolution leaf area index (LAI) maps would enable producers to monitor crop health and growth status, improving agricultural practices such as fertiliser and water management. LAI retrieval methods are numerous and can be divided into statistical and physically based methods. While statistical methods are generally subject to high site-specificity but possess high ease of implementation and use, physically based methods are more transferable, albeit more complex to use in operational settings. In addition, statistical methods need a large amount of data for calibration and subsequent validation, and this is only seldom feasible. Techniques based on predictive equations (PEphysical) represent a viable alternative, allowing the partial combination of statistical and physical methods merits while minimising their shortcomings. In this paper, predictive equation-based techniques were compared with four other methods: two radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion methods, one based on neural network (NNET) and one based on a look-up table (LUT), and two empirical methods (one using empirical models based on vegetation indices and in situ data and one based on empirical models found in the scientific literature). The methods were chosen based on common use. To evaluate the performance of the studied methods, the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and normalised root mean square error (nRMSE, %) between the estimates and in situ LAI measurements were reported. The best PEphysical results, achieved by the OSAVI index (RMSE = 0.84 m(2) m(-2)), provided better performance for LAI recovery than the NNET-based RTM inversions (0.86 m(2) m(-2)) or the estimates made by LUT (0.94 m(2) m(-2)). Furthermore, the best PEphysical produced accuracies comparable to the best empirical model (RMSE = 0.71 m(2) m(-2)), calibrated through in situ data, and similar to the best literature model (RMSE = 0.76 m(2) m(-2)). These results indicated that PEphysical can be used to recover LAI with transferability comparable to literature models.

TI  - Reporting of Surgically Removed Lymph Nodes for Breast Tumors Recommendations From the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context.-The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR), supported by major pathology and cancer organizations, aims at the standardization of evidence-based pathology reporting of different types of cancers, with the inclusion of all parameters deemed to be relevant for best patient care and future data collection. Lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer.Objective.-To produce a histopathology reporting guide by a panel of recognized experts from the fields of pathology and surgery with elements deemed to be core (required) and noncore (recommended) to report when assessing regional lymph nodes of patients with breast cancer.Data Sources.-Published literature, previous guidelines/recommendations, and current cancer staging principles were the basis of the data set drafted by the expert panel. This was discussed in a series of teleconferences and email communications. The draft data set was then made available for public consultation through the ICCR Web site. After this consultation and ICCR ratification, the data set was finalized.Conclusions.-The ICCR has published a data set for the reporting of surgically removed lymph nodes (including sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary lymph node dissection, targeted axillary surgery, and lymph node sampling specimens) for breast tumors. This is part of a series of 4 ICCR breast cancer-related data sets. It includes 10 core elements along with 2 noncore elements. This should allow for synoptic reporting, which is more precise, uniform, and complete than nonsynoptic reporting, and leads to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Effectiveness of the Reconstructed MODIS Typical-Angle Reflectances on Forest Biomass Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-angle optical reflectance measurements such as those from the NASA moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) are sensitive to forest 3D structures, potentially serving as a useful proxy to estimate forest structural variables such as aboveground biomass (AGB)-a potential theoretically recognized but rarely explored. In this paper, we examined the effectiveness of the reconstructed MODIS typical-angle reflectances-reflectances observed from the hotspot, darkspot, and nadir directions-for estimating forest AGB from both theoretical and practical perspectives. To gain theoretical insights, we first tested the sensitivities of typical-angle reflectances to forest AGB through simulations using the 4-scale bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. We then built statistical models to fit the relationship between MODIS multi-angle observations and field-measured deciduous-broadleaf/mixed-temperate forest AGB at five sites in the eastern USA, assisted by a semivariogram analysis to determine the effect of pixel heterogeneity on the MODIS-AGB relationship. We also determined the effects of terrain and season on the predictive relationships. Our results indicated that multi-angle reflectances with fewer visible shadows yielded better AGB estimates (hotspot: R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 54.28 Mg/ha; nadir: R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 59.95 Mg/ha; darkspot: R-2 = 0.46, RMSE = 65.66 Mg/ha) after filtering out the effects of complex terrain and pixel heterogeneity; the MODIS typical-angle reflectances in the NIR band were the most sensitive to forest AGB. We also found strong sensitivities of estimated accuracies to MODIS image acquisition dates or season. Overall, our results suggest that the current practice of leveraging only single-angle MODIS data can be a suboptimal strategy for AGB estimation. We advocate the use of MODIS multi-angle reflectances for optical remote sensing of forest AGB or potentially other ecological applications requiring forest structure information.

TI  - System Structure-Based Drought Disaster Risk Assessment Using Remote Sensing and Field Experiment Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the impacts of climate change and human activities, agricultural drought disaster losses have increased remarkably. Drought disaster risk assessment is a prerequisite for formulating disaster reduction strategies and ensuring food security. However, drought disaster risk is a complex system, and quantitative assessment methods reflecting the risk formation mechanism are still rarely reported. This study presented a chain transmission system structure of drought disaster risk, which meant that drought disaster loss risk R was derived from drought hazard H by the transformation of drought disaster vulnerability V. Based on this point, firstly, a drought hazard curve between drought intensity and drought frequency was established using remote sensing data and the copula function. Then, a crop loss calculation approach under various drought events and drought resistance capacity scenarios was achieved by two-season field experiments and the AquaCrop model. Finally, a loss risk curve cluster of "drought frequency-drought resistance capacity-yield loss rate" was proposed by the composition of the above two quantitative relationships. The results of the case study for summer maize in Bengbu City indicated that the average yield loss rate under 19 droughts occurring during the growth period of maize from 1982 to 2017 was 24.51%. High risk happened in 1988, 1992, 1994, 2001, and 2004, with the largest loss rate in 2001, up to 65.58%. Overall, droughts with a return period less than two years occurred frequently during the growth period of summer maize in Bengbu, though the loss risk was still controllable. In conclusion, the results suggest that the loss risk curve provides a new effective method of drought disaster risk quantitative assessment from a physical mechanism perspective, which lays a scientific foundation for decision-making in risk management.

TI  - Backscattering Statistics of Labeled Sentinel-1 Wave Mode Imagettes for Ten Geophysical Phenomena
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a sensor that is proven to have great potential in observing atmospheric and oceanic phenomena at high-spatial resolutions (similar to 10 m). The statistics of SAR backscattering that describe the image characteristics are essential to help interpret the properties of the geophysical processes. In this study, we took advantage of a hand-labeled database of ten commonly observed geophysical processes created based on the Sentinel-1 wave mode vignettes to document the SAR backscattering statistics. The probability density function (PDF), normalized variance, skewness, and kurtosis were investigated among the ten labeled categories. We found that the NRCS PDFs differ between types, implying the influences of these large-scale features on the radar backscattering distribution. The statistical parameters exhibited distinct variations among classes at the two incidence angles of 23.5 degrees and 36.5 degrees. In particular, the normalized variance of low wind area at 23.5 degrees exceeded other phenomena by an order of magnitude. This lays the basis for directly identifying the SAR images of low wind areas in terms of this parameter. Sea ice and rain cells at 36.5 degrees span within a similar range of kurtosis values, much higher than the other groups. While sea ice could be excluded using a latitude threshold, the rain cells are readily detected. The global percentage map of directly identified rain cells is consistent with the deep-learning results but with higher efficiency. The influence of these large-scale atmospheric and oceanic features on radar backscattering statistics must be considered in the future wave retrieval algorithm for improved accuracy.

TI  - Mapping of Forest Biomass in Shangri-La City Based on LiDAR Technology and Other Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems can be regarded as huge carbon sinks. In order to effectively assess carbon balance in such ecosystems, rapid and accurate estimation of the aboveground biomass of a forest is critically needed. However, the current methods for biomass estimation and mapping are of limited spatial resolution and mostly depend on large numbers of measurements. In order to obtain better biomass estimation outcomes with higher spatial resolution, a rapid method is introduced for region-scale biomass estimation in alpine and canyon areas using space-borne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and optical remote-sensing images. Specifically, we explored alpine and canyon areas in Shangri-La City in China using space-borne LiDAR data from ICESAT-2 and optical remote-sensing images from Landsat8 OLI, Sentinel-2, and Microwave remote sensing Sentinel-1. An extrapolation model of the forest canopy heights in these areas was constructed with a 30-m resolution of continuous canopy height outputs. For continuously estimating the diameter at breast height (DBH) in Shangri-La City, a tree height-DBH growth model was constructed based on the LiDAR and remote-sensing measurements. Finally, based on the average DBH of the explored forests, a model was constructed for estimating and mapping the aboveground biomass and carbon storage in Shangri-La with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The results show that the forest canopy height in Shangri-La City is mainly in the range of 2.82-30.96 m, and that the estimation accuracy is verified by the LiDAR-based canopy height model (CHM) with a coefficient of determination of R-2 = 0.7143. The inversion results were still largely affected by geospatial location factors (longitude, latitude), terrain factors (slope, elevation), and vegetation indices (NBR, NDGI, NDVI). Based on the relationship between the tree height and the DBH, the DBH of trees in Shangri-La City was estimated to be mainly in the range of 20 cm to 30 cm, and this estimate was verified by actual measurements with R-2 greater than 0.7 all. Finally, the established model estimated the aboveground forest biomass and carbon storage of the study area of Shangri-La City in 2020 to be 1.28 x 10(8) t and 6.41 x 10(7) t, respectively. These estimates correspond to total accuracies of 92.28%, respectively.

TI  - Chlorinated Persistent Organic Pollutants (PCDD/Fs and PCBs) in Loggerhead Sea Turtles Stranded along the Central Adriatic Coast
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of organic compounds characterized by long-range transport, persistence, bioaccumulation, and high toxicity. They can be found in aquatic environments where they can be ingested by marine organisms. As a long-lived, widely distributed, and opportunistic predator, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is a sentinel species in the Mediterranean Sea, and it can also be considered a bioindicator of the health of the sea in terms of contaminants. In this study, 44 C. caretta stranded along the Adriatic coast were selected, considering sex and curved carapace length (CCL) as a proxy of age. The fat tissues and the livers of the animals were sampled and analyzed for studying the contamination level of chlorinated POPs in relation to sex and size. This work points the focus on the importance of monitoring these contaminants in C. caretta to evaluate the anthropic effects on the marine environment. Persistent organic pollutants are widespread in the marine environment. They can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine organisms through the food web with a potentially toxic effect on living organisms. The sea turtle Caretta caretta is a carnivorous animal with opportunistic feeding behavior. These turtles tend to bioaccumulate pollutants through food, and hence they can be considered an indicator of chemical pollutants in the marine ecosystem. In this study, 44 loggerhead sea turtles were considered, and liver and fat tissue were sampled from each of them to investigate the levels of dioxins (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sea turtles and their potential correlation with sex and size in terms of curved carapace length (CCL). Results suggested that these contaminants were easily bioaccumulated, and PCBs were predominant compared to dioxins in both liver and fat tissue. The congener patterns were similar to those found in sea fish. Moreover, there were no differences in the contamination levels between females and males, nor was there a correlation with the size. There is a need to harmonize the methodological approaches to better evaluate the results and trends over time and to monitor the species and indirectly the health status of the marine environment.

TI  - Development of the Statistical Errors Raster Toolbox with Six Automated Models for Raster Analysis in GIS Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Statistical Errors Raster Toolbox includes models of the most popular error metrics in the interdisciplinary literature, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), mean bias error (MBE), normalized mean bias error (NMBE), mean absolute error (MAE) and normalized mean absolute error (NMAE), for computing the areal errors of any raster file in .tiff format as compared with a reference raster file. The models are applicable to any size of raster files, no matter if no-data pixels are included. The only prerequisites are that the two raster files share the same units, cell size, and projection system. The novelty lies in the fact that, to date, there is no such application in ArcGIS Pro 3/ArcMap 10.8. Therefore, users who work with raster files require external software, plus the relevant expertise. An application on the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) of Peloponnese peninsula (Greece) is presented. MODIS ET products and ETo raster files for empirical methods are employed. The results of the models (for 20,440 valid values) are compared to the results of external software (for 1000 random points). Considering that the different sample sizes can lead to different accuracies and the inhomogeneity of the area, it is obvious that the results are almost identical.

AB  - The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) is one of the main imaging sensors on the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite. Due to the combination of high spatial and temporal resolution, the AGRI is suitable for continuously monitoring atmospheric aerosol. Existing studies only perform AOD retrieval on the dark target area of FY-4A/AGRI, and the full disk AOD retrieval is still under exploration. The Neural Network AEROsol Retrieval for Geostationary Satellite (NNAeroG) based on the Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) was used to retrieve FY-4A/AGRI full disk aerosol optical depth (AOD). The data from 111 ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network (SONET) sites were used to train the neural network, and the data from 28 other sites were used for independent validation. FY-4A/AGRI AOD data from 2017 to 2020 were validated over the full disk and three different surface types (vegetated areas, arid areas, and marine and coastal areas). For general validation, the AOD predicted by the application of NNAeroG to FY-4A/AGRI observations is consistent with the ground-based reference AOD data. The validation of the FY-4A/AGRI AOD versus the reference data set shows that the root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R squared (R-2), and percentage of data with errors within the expected error +/- (0.05 + 15%) (EE15) are 0.237, 0.145, 0.733, and 58.7%, respectively. The AOD retrieval accuracy over vegetated areas is high but there is potential for improvement of the results over arid areas and marine and coastal areas. AOD retrieval results of FY-4A/AGRI were compared under fine and coarse modes. The retrieved AOD has low accuracy in coarse mode but is better in coarse-fine mixed mode and fine mode. The current AOD products over the ocean of NNAeroG-FY4A/AGRI are not recommended. Further development of algorithms for marine areas is expected to improve the full disk AOD retrieval accuracy.

TI  - Time Series Analysis of Land Cover Change Using Remotely Sensed and Multisource Urban Data Based on Machine Learning: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China from 1979 to 2022
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shenzhen has experienced rapid urbanization since the establishment of the Special Economic Zone in 1978. However, it is rare to witness high-speed urbanization in Shenzhen. It is important to study the LUCC progress in Shenzhen (regarding refusing multisource data), which can provide a reference for governments to solve the problems of land resource shortages and urban expansion spaces. In this paper, nine Landsat images were used to retrieve land cover maps in Shenzhen, China, from 1979 to 2022. The classification method is based on support vector machines with assistance from visual interpretation. The results show that the urban area increased by 756.84 km(2), the vegetation area decreased by 546.27 km(2), the water area decreased by 132.95 km(2), and the bare area decreased by 77.62 km(2) in the last 43 years of our research region. Urban sprawl starts from the Luohu district, then propagates to Futian, Nanshan, and Yantian districts, and finally expands to other outlying districts (Baoan, Longgang, Guangming, Dapeng, and Pingshan). The spatial-temporal characteristics and the impact factors of urbanization were further analyzed. The visualization of land cover changes based on a complex network approach reveals that the velocity of urban expansion is growing. The coastline distributions were retrieved from nine observation times from 1979 to 2022; the results show that the west coastline changed more dramatically than the east and most of the east coastline remained stable, except for the parts near Yantian port and Mirs Bay, which experienced some changes. The impact factors of coastline changes are further discussed. Through a correlation analysis using urban data, such as transportation and socioeconomic factors, it was found that elevation and roads have strong constraints on the spatial patterns of a city's expansion. There is exponential decay in the urban land increase against the distance to the roads, implying that traffic factors greatly determine urban land expansion. The turning point of the exponential decay is a distance of around 150 m. Time and population are highly correlated with land use development, indicating that urban land grows linearly with time and the population, which are important driving forces of urban land development. Compared with secondary and tertiary industries, the primary industry is less related to urban land use in Shenzhen.

TI  - Response of Ecosystem Service Value to Spatio-Temporal Pattern Evolution of Land Use in Typical Heavy Industry Cities: A Case Study of Taiyuan City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services value (ESV) has been one index of quantitative evaluation for the ecological livability of heavy industry cities in the new era, which is intimately relevant to patterns of spatio-temporal changes in land use. This study aims to reveal the response of ecosystem service value in heavy industrial cities to the spatial-temporal evolution structure of land use and to analyze the cold and hot spots and sensitivity. In this study, Taiyuan was taken as an example, and Landsat images were adopted as the basic data. This study used intensity analysis, revised ESV, fishing nets, sensitivity analysis, and the methods of hotspot analysis and spatial overlay. The results showed as follows, (1) The characteristics of land use structure evolution mainly focus on the increase of construction land in the early and the rapid development stage of heavy industry cities. All land use types were partly transferred to construction land, but farmland was the main source, with the largest change intensity in the rapid development stage in Taiyuan; (2) The low-value zones of ESV were mostly distributed in the main urban area for construction and farmland, while the high-value zones were primarily distributed in the forestland and grassland. They were distributed in the Fenhe River valley, western and northern mountainous and hilly areas of Taiyuan. The total ESV continued to decline from 2003 to 2018, with a loss amount of RMB 29 million; (3) The patches of land use change were more and more broken, and the spatial distribution of the cold and hot spots was more and more dispersed. The cold and hot spots of ESV were concentrated in the eastern main urban area and its surrounding areas and expanded to the north and south; (4) The forestland was the most sensitive land factor of ESV. The study provides a theoretical method for land use planning, environmental governance, and ecological restoration in heavy industry cities in the new era.

TI  - Analysis of the Evolution Pattern and Driving Mechanism of Lakes in the Northern Ningxia Yellow Diversion Irrigation Area
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the northern part of the Ningxia Autonomous Region, there are rich lake resources, which are known as the "South of the Seas". In recent years, the natural evolution of the water system and human activities have caused significant changes in the lake area. In order to fully understand the evolution of lakes in the northern Ningxia Yellow Irrigation Area, Landsat, Sentinel-2 images and ArcGIS were used to extract relevant information, and the cumulative distance level curve and Mann-Kendall trend analysis were used to analyze the trends of each driving factor in depth. The results showed that (1) the lake surface area in the northern Yellow Diversion Irrigation Area showed a significant increasing trend from 1986 to 2019. (2) The annual average temperature in the Ningxia Yellow River Irrigation Area has shown an increasing trend over the past 39 years, and no year has obvious cyclical changes, but in 1998, there was a sudden change in temperature and the temperature began to rise sharply; the annual average precipitation showed an increasing trend with a large variation, and the annual average precipitation from 1980 to 2018 showed a fluctuating increasing trend. (3) There is no significant linear pattern of runoff from upstream during 1986-2015, and it is characterized by fluctuating changes; the precipitation in the Yellow Irrigation Area is much lower than the average level in Ningxia, and it is classified as a typical arid area; the water consumption is all decreasing, but its linear trend is not significant; the most significant impact of the change in the substratum on the water surface is the construction of fields around the lake after 1990, followed by the Lake engineering treatment. (4) The water surface area of the mainstream is significantly and positively correlated with the incoming water from upstream, is significantly and negatively correlated with the area of grassland, and is significantly and positively correlated with the areas of arable land and construction land. The effect of land cover on the water surface area of the mainstream is lower than that on the water surface area other than the mainstream.

TI  - GPS-Derived Slant Water Vapor for Cloud Monitoring in Singapore
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a GPS-derived slant water vapor technique for cloud monitoring in Singapore. The normalized slant wet delay (SWD) and slant water vapor (SWV) are introduced. The suitability of the normalized SWV over SWV for cloud monitoring is demonstrated, as it is not very sensitive to the satellite elevation angle. For better illustration and representation of the spatial distribution of the normalized SWV, the skyplot is discretized into different cells based on the azimuth and elevation angles to produce the spatial plot. The spatial plots are analyzed for cloud monitoring and compared alongside the sky images. The results show that the spatial plots of normalized SWV are generally consistent with the cloud formation observed in the sky images, hence demonstrating their usefulness for cloud monitoring. The probability distribution of the normalized SWV associated with cloudy and clear sky conditions is also analyzed, which shows that the mean values of normalized SWV associated with the former are higher. Finally, the time series of the normalized SWV is explored in relation to the solar irradiance. It is shown that the time series and spatial plots of normalized SWV are also consistent with the ratio of clear sky to measured irradiance.

TI  - Modeling Phenological Phases of Winter Wheat Based on Temperature and the Start of the Growing Season
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenological phases of field crops have shifted to earlier times in the Czech Republic in recent decades; additionally, they have shown correlations with temperatures from previous spring months. Using a thermal time model called PhenoClim, the correlations between temperatures and phenophases allow us to evaluate the strongest predictors (i.e., maximum temperature) and indicators of base temperatures and growing degree days for the selected phenophases of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). With the help of this model, it is possible to explain 0.6-0.82% of the phase variability and to estimate the onset of phenophases for the selected time period and stations (with the RMSE values of 9.4 days for jointing, 4.3 days for heading, and 5.3 days for full ripeness). To further refine the modeled onsets of phenophases, we used satellite data, specifically the normalized difference vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index 2 from MODIS; based on these vegetation indices, the start of the growing season (SOS) was determined. After including SOS to model PhenoClim, we modeled the onsets of phenophases, with average accuracies ranging from 6.2 to 15.2. By combining the thermal time model and remote sensing data, specifically the data concerning the determination of SOS, we can refine the modeling of the onset of full ripeness in some locations.

TI  - Linking Remote Sensing with APSIM through Emulation and Bayesian Optimization to Improve Yield Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The enormous increase in the volume of Earth Observations (EOs) has provided the scientific community with unprecedented temporal, spatial, and spectral information. However, this increase in the volume of EOs has not yet resulted in proportional progress with our ability to forecast agricultural systems. This study examines the applicability of EOs obtained from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 for constraining the APSIM-Maize model parameters. We leveraged leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to constrain a series of APSIM-Maize model parameters in three different Bayesian multi-criteria optimization frameworks across 13 different calibration sites in the U.S. Midwest. The novelty of the current study lies in its approach in providing a mathematical framework to directly integrate EOs into process-based models for improved parameter estimation and system representation. Thus, a time variant sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most influential parameters driving the LAI (Leaf Area Index) estimates in APSIM-Maize model. Then surrogate models were developed using random samples taken from the parameter space using Latin hypercube sampling to emulate APSIM's behavior in simulating NDVI and LAI at all sites. Site-level, global and hierarchical Bayesian optimization models were then developed using the site-level emulators to simultaneously constrain all parameters and estimate the site to site variability in crop parameters. For within sample predictions, site-level optimization showed the largest predictive uncertainty around LAI and crop yield, whereas the global optimization showed the most constraint predictions for these variables. The lowest RMSE within sample yield prediction was found for hierarchical optimization scheme (1423 Kg ha(-1)) while the largest RMSE was found for site-level (1494 Kg ha(-1)). In out-of-sample predictions for within the spatio-temporal extent of the training sites, global optimization showed lower RMSE (1627 Kg ha(-1)) compared to the hierarchical approach (1822 Kg ha(-1)) across 90 independent sites in the U.S. Midwest. On comparison between these two optimization schemes across another 242 independent sites outside the spatio-temporal extent of the training sites, global optimization also showed substantially lower RMSE (1554 Kg ha(-1)) as compared to the hierarchical approach (2532 Kg ha(-1)). Overall, EOs demonstrated their real use case for constraining process-based crop models and showed comparable results to model calibration exercises using only field measurements.

TI  - SDG Final Decade of Action: Resilient Pathways to Build Back Better from High-Impact Low-Probability (HILP) Events
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a blueprint for global peace and prosperity, while conserving natural ecosystems and resources for the planet. However, factors such as climate-induced weather extremes and other High-Impact Low-Probability (HILP) events on their own can devastate lives and livelihoods. When a pandemic affects us, as COVID-19 has, any concurrent hazards interacting with it highlight additional challenges to disaster and emergency management worldwide. Such amplified effects contribute to greater societal and environmental risks, with cross-cutting impacts and exposing inequities. Hence, understanding how a pandemic affects the management of concurrent hazards and HILP is vital in disaster risk reduction practice. This study reviews the contemporary literature and utilizes data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) to unpack how multiple extreme events have interacted with the coronavirus pandemic and affected the progress in achieving the SDGs. This study is especially urgent, given the multidimensional societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic amidst climate change. Results indicate that mainstreaming risk management into development planning can mitigate the adverse effects of disasters. Successes in addressing compound risks have helped us understand the value of new technologies, such as the use of drones and robots to limit human exposure. Enhancing data collection efforts to enable inclusive sentinel systems can improve surveillance and effective response to future risk challenges. Stay-at-home policies put in place during the pandemic for virus containment have highlighted the need to holistically consider the built environment and socio-economic exigencies when addressing the pandemic's physical and mental health impacts, and could also aid in the context of increasing climate-induced extreme events. As we have seen, such policies, services, and technologies, along with good nutrition, can significantly help safeguard health and well-being in pandemic times, especially when simultaneously faced with ubiquitous climate-induced extreme events. In the final decade of SDG actions, these measures may help in efforts to "Leave No One Behind", enhance human-environment relations, and propel society to embrace sustainable policies and lifestyles that facilitate building back better in a post-pandemic world. Concerted actions that directly target the compounding effects of different interacting hazards should be a critical priority of the Sendai Framework by 2030.

TI  - Error and Uncertainty Degrade Topographic Corrections of Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemical and biological composition of surface materials and physical structure and arrangement of those materials determine the intrinsic reflectance of Earth's land surface. The apparent reflectance-as measured by a spaceborne or airborne sensor that has been corrected for atmospheric attenuation-depends also on topography, surface roughness, and the atmosphere. Especially in Earth's mountains, estimating properties of scientific interest from remotely sensed data requires compensation for topography. Doing so requires information from digital elevation models (DEMs). Available DEMs with global coverage are derived from spaceborne interferometric radar and stereo-photogrammetry at similar to 30 m spatial resolution. Locally or regionally, lidar altimetry, interferometric radar, or stereo-photogrammetry produces DEMs with finer resolutions. Characterization of their quality typically expresses the root-mean-square (RMS) error of the elevation, but the accuracy of remotely sensed retrievals is sensitive to uncertainties in topographic properties that affect incoming and reflected radiation and that are inadequately represented by the RMS error of the elevation. The most essential variables are the cosine of the local solar illumination angle on a slope, the shadows cast by neighboring terrain, and the view factor, the fraction of the overlying hemisphere open to the sky. Comparison of global DEMs with locally available fine-scale DEMs shows that calculations with the global products consistently underestimate the cosine of the solar angle and underrepresent shadows. Analyzing imagery of Earth's mountains from current and future spaceborne missions requires addressing the uncertainty introduced by errors in DEMs on algorithms that analyze remotely sensed data to produce information about Earth's surface.

TI  - A Novel Fully Coupled Physical-Statistical-Deep Learning Method for Retrieving Near-Surface Air Temperature from Multisource Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of near-surface air temperature (NSAT) from remote sensing data is often ill-posed because of insufficient observational information. Many factors influence the NSAT, which can lead to the instability of the accuracy of traditional algorithms. To overcome this problem, in this study, a fully coupled framework was developed to robustly retrieve NSAT from thermal remote sensing data, integrating physical, statistical, and deep learning methods (PS-DL). Based on physical derivation, the optimal combinations of remote sensing bands were chosen for building the inversion equations to retrieve NSAT, and deep learning was used to optimize the calculations. Multisource data (physical model simulations, remote sensing data, and assimilation products) were used to establish the training and test databases. The NSAT retrieval accuracy was enhanced using the land surface temperature (LST) and land surface emissivity (LSE) as prior knowledge. The highest mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the retrieved NSAT data were 0.78 K and 0.89 K, respectively. In a cross-validation against the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD), the MAE and RMSE were 1.00 K and 1.29 K, respectively. The actual inversion MAE and RMSE for the optimal band combination were 1.21 K and 1.33 K, respectively. The proposed method effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional methods as the inversion accuracy is enhanced by adding the information of atmospheric water vapor and more bands, and the applicability (portability) of the algorithm is enhanced using LST and LSE as prior knowledge. This model can become a general inversion paradigm for geophysical parameter retrieval, which is of milestone significance because of its accuracy and the ability to allow deep learning for physical interpretation.

TI  - Investigating the Trends and Drivers between Urbanization and the Land Surface Temperature: A Case Study of Zhengzhou, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of urbanization on the urban thermal environment (UTE) has attracted increasing research attention because its significant effects on local weather and climate, and serious consequences for people. However, systematic study of the relationship between urbanization and UTE has been undertaken only to a limited extent. Using quantitative thermal remote sensing and multi-buffer ring method and multiple spatial scales method, here we analyze Landsat TM/ETM+ images of Zhengzhou in Central China acquired on four different dates in 2017 to investigate the spatiotemporal variations, trends, and driving force in the land surface temperature (LST). Our results showed that LST generally increased with urbanization intensity. This trend was extremely obvious in spring and summer, weak in winter, and slightly downward in autumn. Moreover, PLAND (e.g., percentage of impervious surface in a landscape) has the most significant effect on urban LST, and generally increases as the spatial scale becomes larger. In conclusion, the study recommends that urban planning in Zhengzhou should prioritize PLAND, especially at large spatial scales. These results provide a scientific reference for urban planners who are committed to the sustainable development of Zhengzhou City.

TI  - A Study on the Propagation Trend of Underground Coal Fires Based on Night-Time Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Technology
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal fires in coal fields endanger the mine surface ecological environment, endanger coal resources, threaten mine safety and workers' health, and cause geological disasters. The study of methods by which to monitor the laws that determine the way underground coal fires spread is helpful in the safe production of coal and the smooth execution of fire extinguishing projects. Based on night-time ASTER thermal infrared images of 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007 in Huangbaici and Wuhushan mining areas in the Wuda coalfield, an adaptive-edge-threshold algorithm was used to extract time-series for underground coal fire areas. A method of time-series dynamic analysis for geometric centers of underground coal fire areas was proposed to study the propagation law and development trend of underground coal fires. The results indicate that, due to the effective prevention of the external influences of solar irradiance, topographic relief and land cover, the identification accuracy of coal fires via the use of a night-time ASTER thermal infrared image was higher by 7.70%, 13.19% and 14.51% than that of the daytime Landsat thermal infrared image in terms of producer accuracy, user accuracy and overall accuracy, respectively. The propagation direction of the geometric center of the time-series coal fire areas can be used to represent the propagation direction of underground coal fires. There exists a linear regression relationship between the migration distance of the geometric center of coal fire areas and the variable-area of coal fires in adjacent years, with the correlation coefficient reaching 0.705, which indicates that the migration distance of the geometric center of a coal fire area can be used to represent the intensity variation of underground coal fires. This method can be applied to the analysis of the trends of underground coal fires under both natural conditions and human intervention. The experimental results show that the Wuda underground coal fires spread to the southeast and that the area of the coal fires increased by 0.71 km(2) during the period of 2002-2003. From 2003 to 2005, Wuda's underground coal fires spread to the northwest under natural conditions, and the area of coal fires decreased by 0.30 km(2) due to the closure of some small coal mines. From 2005 to 2007, due to increased mining activities, underground coal fires in Wuda spread to the east, south, west and north, and the area of coal fires increased dramatically by 1.76 km(2).

TI  - Comparison of PET-CT and MRI for evaluation of axillary lymph nodes in early breast cancer patients
T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of axillary lymph node in women with breast cancer is very important as it can change the initial treatment decision. None of the noninvasive methods used for assessment of axilla is accurate as sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) yet. This study compared the diagnostic performance of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) in preoperative axillary evaluation of women diagnosed with early breast cancer (EBC). METHODS: The records of 1246 patients operated for EBC between 2016-2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Pathological evaluations of axillary lymph nodes and the data of these two imaging modalities were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty patients operated for EBC had both DCE-MRI and PET-CT. Axillary metastasis were detected in 12 patients (27.5%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of DCE-MRI/ PET-CT for determining axillary lymph node metastases were 25/66.6%, 75/67.8%, 30/47%, 70/82.6%, and 60/67.5%, respectively. DISCUSSION: Any method has yet reached the performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the axillary mapping of patients with EBC. If a clinically EBC patient is suspected of axillary involvement in DCE-MRI or PET-CT (since have low PPV and sensitivity), a biopsy should be performed.

TI  - Influence of sea-ice-related features and anthropogenic subsidies on the foraging behaviour of a high-Arctic seabird, the ivory gull (<i>Pagophila eburnea</i>)
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic region is currently experiencing major modifications in sea ice extent and phenology due to global climate and anthropogenic changes. As Arctic marine ecosystems rely greatly on the presence of sea ice and its seasonal dynamics, these changes could have major impacts on Arctic biota. The ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea) is an endemic Arctic seabird whose populations are declining in Canada and Svalbard. Its affinity for sea ice makes it a good sentinel species of current changes in the high Arctic. We explored the influence of sea-ice-related features and anthropogenic subsidies on the foraging behaviour of ivory gulls during the breeding season. To this end, we analysed the movement of adult ivory gulls in north-east Greenland. We confirmed that ivory gulls use a dual foraging strategy, with birds faithful to their foraging areas at short distances from the colony, but used individual-specific areas during long-distance foraging trips. We highlight that ivory gulls are spatially specialised individuals within a generalist species. We demonstrated that human settlements attracted foraging birds, which shows that human presence in such a remote place may influence the seabird behaviour. Finally, by combining hidden Markov models and resource selection functions, we showed that ivory gulls selected highly concentrated sea ice for foraging during the breeding season. Our study provides key information on the use of space and foraging strategies of ivory gulls during the breeding season, and more broadly, how Arctic seabirds use ice features.

AB  - Barash and colleagues have demonstrated the use of a statewide database to identify potential cases of opioid-associated amnestic syndrome. While a valuable step towards establishing the epidemiology of this condition, it does not answer the more fundamental question of whether opioids are truly a cause of the observed amnesia. Counterfactual arguments are offered, as well as next steps for further research.

TI  - Hurricane Sally (2020) Shifts the Ocean Thermal Structure across the Inner Core during Rapid Intensification over the Shelf
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of rapid intensification in tropical cyclones prior to landfall is a major societal issue. While air-sea interactions are clearly linked to storm intensity, the connections between the underlying thermal conditions over continental shelves and rapid intensification are limited. Here, an exceptional set of in situ and satellite data are used to identify spatial heterogeneity in sea surface temperatures across the inner core of Hurricane Sally (2020), a storm that rapidly intensified over the shelf. A leftward shift in the region of maximum cooling was observed as the hurricane transited from the open gulf to the shelf. This shift was generated, in part, by the surface heat flux in conjunction with the along- and across-shelf transport of heat from storm-generated coastal circulation. The spatial differences in the sea surface temperatures were large enough to potentially influence rapid intensification processes suggesting that coastal thermal features need to be accounted for to improve storm forecasting as well as to better understand how climate change will modify interactions between tropical cyclones and the coastal ocean. Significance StatementThe connections between the underlying thermal energy in the ocean that powers tropical cyclones and rapid intensification of storms over continental shelves are limited. An exceptional set of data collected in the field as well as from space with satellites was used to identify spatial variations in sea surface temperatures across the inner core of Hurricane Sally (2020), a storm that rapidly intensified over the shelf. The spatial differences were due to the heat loss from the surface of the ocean as well as heat transport by shelf currents. The spatial differences were large enough to potentially influence how quickly storms can intensify, suggesting that coastal thermal features need to be accounted for to improve storm forecasting.

TI  - Mesoporous ionic liquid functionalized nanozeolite: Synthesis and high efficient material to improving pseudocapacitance performance of conductive polymer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Supercapacitors are emerging as a competitive candidate for electrochemical energy storage owing to their greater power outputs and longer cycle life than rechargeable batteries. In this work, a chloropropyl grafted zeolite-NaY modified with imidazolium chloride ionic liquid (Im-Cl IL@ZY) has been successfully synthesized by a chemical method. Notably, the imidazolium chloride ionic liquid enhances the electrical contact between zeolite network and conductive polymer film (poly ortho aminophenol) because of its high conductivity and good compatibility with different substances. The synergistic effect of the most efficient composite endows the hybrid electrode with a high specific capacitance of 665 F/g F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and reliable cycling stability of 88 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles. Moreover, a symmetric supercapacitor based on the composite electrodes achieves a high energy density of 36.7 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 485 W kg(-1). Results highlight that POAP/Im-Cl IL@ZY composites are promising materials for energy storage devices with long cycling stability.

TI  - A Summary Analysis of Groundwater Vulnerability to Climate Variability and Anthropic Activities in the Haouz Region, Morocco
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Haouz aquifer is undergoing climatic aridity and anthropic pressure largely related to the agricultural sector. In this study, special attention was given to the main factors that have a direct impact on the fluctuations of the piezometric level (PL). Different statistical analyses (cross-correlations, PCA, cascading analysis) of the relationship between these factors were applied here. The results identify three distinct groundwater operating systems. The first is manifested in areas dominated by groundwater irrigation. The correlation is insignificant between the PL and surface water (R <= +/- 0.3). The natural balance of the water cycle is then disturbed causing a pronounced deficit in the PL. The second system is perceptible in areas dominated by irrigation from surface water, while the third system is noticeable in Bour areas, cultivated in rainfed mode. For both systems, the hydrological cycle is preserved, and the contribution of surface water to groundwater recharge is noticeable (+/- 0.4 <= R <= +/- 1). Drought transfer between the water cycle components occurs in a cascading process for both systems. These results can help decision-makers to identify the risks related to groundwater vulnerability to climatic variability and overexploitation in the Haouz region, allowing for the promotion of efficient groundwater management.

TI  - Wheat Yield Estimation Using Remote Sensing Indices Derived from Sentinel-2 Time Series and Google Earth Engine in a Highly Fragmented and Heterogeneous Agricultural Region
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In Morocco, monitoring and estimation of wheat yield at the regional and national scales are critical issues for national food security. The recent Sentinel-2 imagery offers potential for managing grain production systems on a field and regional level. The present study was planned based on a time series of six remote sensing indices and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methods for real-time estimation of wheat yield using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in a highly heterogeneous and fragmented agricultural region, such as the Tadla Irrigated Perimeter (TIP). First, the spatial distribution of wheat in the TIP region was mapped by performing Random Forest (RF) classification of Sentinel 2 images. Following that, using MLR models, the wheat yield of nine sampled fields was estimated for the different phenological stages of wheat. The yield measured in-situ was the independent variable of the regressions. The dependent variables included the remote sensing indices derived from Sentinel-2. The remote sensing index and the phenological period of the greatest model were investigated to estimate and map the wheat yield in the entire study area. The RF generated the wheat mapping of the study area with an overall accuracy (OA) of 93.82%. Furthermore, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the tested MLR was from 0.53 to 0.89, while the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) varied from 4.29 to 7.78 q ha(-1). The best model was the one that uses the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) in the tillering and maturity stages.

TI  - Monitoring Coastal Changes and Assessing Protection Structures at the Damietta Promontory, Nile Delta, Egypt, to Secure Sustainability in the Context of Climate Changes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Damietta Promontory is a distinct coastal region in the Nile Delta Egypt, which comprises several communities with strategic economic projects. The promontory has experienced numerous inundation crises due to anthropogenic intervention and/or sea level rise (SLR). The recorded rate of erosion detected is from -18 to -53 m/yr., and -28 to -210 m/yr. along the promontory's western and eastern coasts, respectively, with a total loss of about 3 km during the past century. It is critical to ensure sustainability of this coastal region in case of future climate changes and expected SLR; accordingly, the state has implemented a long-term plan of coastal protection. The current study updates the coastal changes and assesses the efficiency of the protection structures. For such study, Ikonos satellite images of 1 m high-resolution were acquired on 30 July 2014 and 10 August 2022, respectively. These were compared to multitemporal Landsat images dated 30 June 2015, 29 September 1987, 15 October 1984, and the Landsat 4 MSS images dated 20 October 1972. The results confirm the presence of accretion along the western jetty of the Damietta Harbor with an average of +10.91 m/yr., while erosion of -4.7 m/yr. was detected at the east of the eastern harbor jetty. At the detached breakwaters along Ras El-Bar, an accretion of +4 m/yr. was detected, and then erosion was measured westward to the tip of the detached breakwaters with an average of -1.77 m/yr. At the eastern coast of the promontory, eastward erosion was recorded with rates of -44.16, -34.33, and -20.33 m/yr., respectively, then the erosion stopped after the construction of the seawall. The current study confirms the efficiency of the detached breakwaters and seawalls as coastal protection structures. However, the seawalls lack swimming-friendly long, wide beaches like those found on the detached breakwaters. The groins seem ineffective with rips and reversed currents like those at Ras El -Bar. To develop a fishing community at the Manzala triangle similar in nature to Venice, it is recommended to extend the seawall to 12 km and then construct detached breakwaters eastward to the El-Diba inlet. To secure sustainability of the coast, a continuous maintenance of the protection structures to keep their elevations between 4-6 m above sea level (a.s.l.) is a critical task, in order to reduce the potential risks that could arise from a tsunami, with sand nourishment as a preferred strategy.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data for Geological Mapping in the Saka Region in Northeast Morocco: An Integrated Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Together with geological survey data, satellite imagery provides useful information for geological mapping. In this context, the aim of this study is to map geological units of the Saka region, situated in the northeast part of Morocco based on Landsat Oli-8 and ASTER images. Specifically, this study aims to: (1) map the lithological facies of the Saka volcanic zone, (2) discriminate the different minerals using Landsat Oli-8 and ASTER imagery, and (3) validate the results with field observations and geological maps. To do so, in this study we used different techniques to achieve the above objectives including color composition (CC), band ratio (BR), minimum noise fraction (MNF), principal component analysis (PCA), and spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification. The results obtained show good discrimination between the different lithological facies, which is confirmed by the supervised classification of the images and validated by field missions and the geological map with a scale of 1/500,000. The classification results show that the study area is dominated by Basaltic rocks, followed by Trachy andesites then Hawaites. These rocks are encased by quaternary sedimentary rocks and an abundance of Quartz, Feldspar, Pyroxene, and Amphibole minerals.

TI  - Evaluation of the Landsat-8 Albedo Product across the Circumpolar Domain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo plays an extremely important role in the surface energy budget, by determining the proportion of incoming solar radiation, which is available to drive photosynthesis and surface heating, and that which is reflected directly back to space. In northern high latitude regions, the albedo of snow-covered vegetation and open, leafless forest canopies in winter, is quite high, while the albedo of boreal evergreen conifers can either be quite low (even with extensive snow lying under the canopy) or rather bright depending on the structure and density of the canopy. Here, we present the further development and evaluation of a 30 m Landsat albedo product, including an operational blue-sky albedo product, for application in the circumpolar domain. The surface reflectances from the Landsat satellite constellation are coupled with surface anisotropy information (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function, BRDF) from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The product is extensively validated across diverse land cover and conditions and performs well with root mean squared error of 0.0395 and negligible bias when compared to coincident tower-based albedo measurements. The development of this Landsat albedo products allows for better capture of ephemeral, heterogeneous and dynamic surface conditions at the landscape scale across the circumpolar domain.

TI  - Determination of Water Footprint for the Cotton and Maize Production in the Kucuk Menderes Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the effects of rapid population growth, urbanisation and climate change in recent years, the protection of freshwater resources, the prevention of water pollution and the proper sharing of freshwater resources among different sectors have become important issues. Water footprint (WF) is a sign of freshwater use and is not only an indicator that can be used in the climate crisis, but also to protect water against nitrate pollution. In this study, the Kucuk Menderes Basin was chosen as the study area due to different crop varieties. Agricultural crop patterns were classified using Rapideye and Sentinel-2 satellite images of the study area obtained in 2017. Thus, the cultivated areas were obtained for cotton and maize (grain and silage) in the basin. In particular, agricultural crop patterns were considered in which agricultural production was intensive and blue water was used predominantly. As a result, the first-crop corn production, which has a high blue WF of 3840 m(3)/ton in the basin, has the highest greywater footprint due to the use of intensive chemical fertilisers. This was followed by cotton with 2331 m(3)/ton, and the second-crop silage corn production had the lowest greywater footprint. Agriculture's water footprint assessment provides a solid foundation for planning climate change adaptive crop production, managing nitrate-sensitive areas and anticipating future regional changes.

TI  - An Integrated InSAR and GNSS Approach to Monitor Land Subsidence in the Po River Delta (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence affects many areas of the world, posing a serious threat to human structures and infrastructures. It can be effectively monitored using ground-based and remote sensing techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). GNSS provides high precision measurements, but in a limited number of points, and is time-consuming, while InSAR allows one to obtain a very large number of measurement points, but only in areas characterized by a high and constant reflectivity of the signal. The aim of this work is to propose an approach to combine the two techniques, overcoming the limits of each of them. The approach was applied in the Po River Delta (PRD), an area located in Northern Italy and historically affected by land subsidence. Ground-based GNSS data from three continuous stations (CGNSS) and 46 non-permanent sites (NPS) measured in 2016, 2018, and 2020, and Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed SAR data acquired from 2016 to 2020, were considered. In the first phase of the method, InSAR processing was calibrated and verified through CGNSS measurements; subsequently, the calibrated interferometric data were used to validate the GNSS measurements of the NPS. In the second phase, the datasets were integrated to provide an efficient monitoring system, extracting high-resolution deformation maps. The results showed a good agreement between the different sources of data, a high correlation between the displacement rate and the age of the emerged surfaces composed of unconsolidated fine sediments, and high land subsidence rates along the coastal area (up to 16-18 mm/year), where the most recent deposits outcrop. The proposed approach makes it possible to overcome the disadvantages of each technique by providing more complete and detailed information for a better understanding of the ongoing phenomenon.

TI  - Vulvar Malignant Melanoma: A Narrative Review
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Vulvar melanoma (VM) is a rare and fatal disease. Knowledge of this disease is poor and, consequently, so is knowledge of the prognosis. Our aim was to collect evidence on VM with particular attention to its molecular profile and related clinical and therapeutic implications. Malignant melanoma is a fatal disease that affects all skin sites. Among these, vulvar melanoma (VM) is a rare gynecological condition that accounts for 5% of all vulvar neoplasms. VM primarily affects older Caucasian women and its relationship to sun exposure is undefined. Diagnosis is defined by biopsy but many clinical, dermatoscopic, and confocal microscopic features can guide doctors. The molecular profile is characterized by the KIT mutation, revealed by all of the technologies that are used (classical sequencing, next-generation sequencing, and immunohistochemical staining). BRAF and NRAS mutations are also common in VM. All of these mutations are possible therapeutic targets. Today, surgery remains the first treatment choice for primary VM. The role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy is scarce and the treatment of relapses is widely debated.

TI  - Evaluation of Multi-Incidence Angle Polarimetric Gaofen-3 SAR Wave Mode Data for Significant Wave Height Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant wave height (SWH) is one of the most important descriptors for ocean wave fields. The polynomial regression (PolR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) models are implemented to explore the effects of polarization and incidence angles on the SWH estimation from multi-incidence angle quad-polarization Gaofen-3 SAR wave mode data, based on the collocated data set of approximately 12,000 Gaofen-3 wave mode imagettes, matched with SWH from the fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The results show that the model performance improves, as long as polarimetry information increases. The hybrid polarizations perform stronger than the co-polarizations or cross-polarizations alone, and they show better performance over the low to high seas. The lower incidence angles are more favorable for SAR SWH inversion. It is superior to introduce incidence angle in piecewise way, rather than to include it as an independent variable in the models. Then, the final PolR and GPR models, with the superior input scheme that includes the quad-polarized features and introduces the incidence angle in piecewise way, are assessed independently through a comparison with observations from altimeter and buoys. The accuracies of our SWH estimates are comparable or even higher than other published results. The GPR model outperforms the PolR model, due to the superiority of the added nonlinearity of GPR.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Relationship Analysis of Vegetation Phenology and Meteorological Parameters in an Agro-Pasture Ecotone in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of climate change, and can help understand the response of vegetation cycles to climate, which is important for understanding the impact of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, based on the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time-series data, derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the climate parameters were extracted using the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtering method to explore the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of the vegetation phenology in an agro-pasture ecotone in China, from 2000 to 2020. In addition, the response characteristics of the vegetation phenology to the climate elements (temperature and precipitation) were also analyzed. The results showed the following: (1) The start of the growing season (SOS) was widely advanced, and that was caused by climate change. The end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed, and the length of the growing season (LOS) was gradually extended with a large interannual fluctuation in the SOS and the LOS in the region; (2) the SOS showed significant negative correlations with the air temperature and precipitation. Precipitation was mainly positively correlated with the EOS, but there was no significant difference in the correlation between temperature and the EOS. In general, pre-season precipitation is the main driver of the vegetation phenology, while the influence of temperature on the phenology is less obvious; (3) in the semi-arid area and arid area, the phenology was mainly influenced by precipitation. The response of the vegetation phenology to the temperatures in different temperature zones was found to be regular, showing high spatial differences. In general, the higher the cumulus temperature, the lower the negative effect of the temperature on both the SOS and EOS. These results may provide new reference to study the non-systematic changes of the vegetation phenology in response to climate change.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Images Based Modeling of Grassland Above-Ground Biomass Using Random Forest Algorithm: A Case Study on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) is critical to better understanding the carbon cycle and conserve grassland resources. As a climate-sensitive key ecological function area, it is important to accurately estimate the grassland AGB of the Tibetan Plateau. Sentinel-2 (S2) images have advantages in reducing mixed pixels and the scale effect for remote sensing, while the data volume is correspondingly larger. In order to improve the estimation accuracy while reducing the data volume required for AGB estimation and improving the computational efficiency, this study used the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm to find the optimal feature set and compared the performance of the Cubist, Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms for estimating AGB. In this study, ten S2 bands, ten S2-derived vegetation indexes, 218 pieces of AGB field survey data, four types of meteorological data and three types of topographic data were used as the alternative input features for the AGB estimation model. The impurity and permutation importance were used as the feature importance calculation method input to the RFE, and the Cubist, GBRT, RF and XGBoost algorithms were used to construct the AGB estimation models. The results showed that the RF algorithm based on the monthly average temperature (T), elevation, Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) performed best (R-2 = 0.8838, RMSE = 35.05 g/m(2), LCCC = 2.44, RPPD = 0.91). The above findings suggest that the RF model based on the features related to temperature, altitude, humidity and leaf water content is beneficial to estimate the grassland AGB on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Earthquake Cycle Deformation Associated With the 2021<i> M<sub>W</sub></i> 7.4 Maduo (Eastern Tibet) Earthquake: An Intrablock Rupture Event on a Slow-Slipping Fault From Sentinel-1 InSAR and Teleseismic Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the continents, the importance of earthquakes that occur away from major block-bounding faults is still debated. The 21 May 2021 M-W similar to 7.4 Maduo earthquake occurred on a secondary fault away from previously-identified major block boundaries. Here we use 7 years of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series (between October 2014 and November 2021) to determine the distribution of coseismic slip and early postseismic afterslip following the Maduo earthquake, and the preceding interseismic strain accumulation. We devised a 13-segment 3-D fault geometry constrained by the SAR range offsets and the distribution of relocated aftershocks and used a Bayesian method incorporating von Karman regularization to solve for coseismic slip and afterslip models. We also used teleseismic waveforms as a standalone inversion to show the rupture evolution in space and time during the earthquake, finding that it propagates bilaterally with three notable rupture episodes. Our preferred coseismic self-similar slip model shows a moderate shallow slip deficit, with the majority of moment release occurring in the depth interval of 1-10 km. The coseismic slip deficit is taken up in part by afterslip at shallow (< 4 km) depths that grows linearly with time during the first similar to 6 months, and at > 10 km depths where afterslip grows logarithmically with time. We suggest that this heterogeneity is likely controlled by spatial variations in fault friction related to lithology. We discuss the implications for seismic hazard away from major tectonic block boundaries in light of our observations of the earthquake cycle on this intrablock fault.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article identifies a remarkable degree of consilience between aspects of classical Jungian theory, dual-aspect monism, Earth System science and deep ecology, despite their mostly independent formulation. The resulting synergy offers a radically different and urgently needed worldview based on respectful relationship with, rather than hubristic domination of, the other-than-human world. This metanoia, rooted in psychology, science and metaphysics, informs practical change without being conventionally political or moralistic.Circumscribing the Pauli-Jung conjecture to our inner and outer worlds - the human psyche and this planet respectively - reveals qualitative correlations between their dynamics, structure and pathologies. In particular, the comparable roles of ego in the psyche and of humankind in the Earth System link our modern monotheism of consciousness, that Jung decried, with the advent of the Anthropocene epoch. This connection is explored over time by applying Jung's stages of life developmental theory, with its crucial mid-life enantiodromia, to our civilization. It contrasts our heroic development to date with future adaptation through what I call frugal individuation, and attributes our persistent failure to address dangers such as the climate emergency to a combination of inertia, nostalgia and hubris. Finally, parallels are drawn between Jungian individuation and the philosophy of the long-range deep ecology movement.

TI  - Borana rangeland of southern Ethiopia: Estimating biomass production and carrying capacity using field and remote sensing data
T2  - PLANT DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing rangeland productivity is critical to reduce ecological degradation and promote sustainable livestock management. Here, we estimated biomass productivity and carrying capacity dynamics in the Borana rangeland of southern Ethiopia by using field-based data and remote sensing data (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)). Data was collected from both rainy and dry seasons when biomass production was high and low respectively. Results of linear regression showed that both biomass production (R2adj 1/4 0.672) and NDVI value (R2adj 1/4 0.471) were significantly decreased from 1990 to 2019. Field data and NDVI values for mean annual biomass showed a significant linear rela-tionship. The model accuracy in the annual relationship between the observed and predicted biomass values was strong (R2adj 1/4 0.986) but with high standard error, indicating that the observed biomass production in the rangeland area was not in good condition as compared with the predicted one. This study suggests that, using NDVI data and field-based data in combined way has high potential to esti -mate rangeland biomass and carrying capacity dynamics at extensively grazed arid and semi-arid ran-gelands. And to use for estimating stoking rates and predicting future management techniques for decision making.Copyright (c) 2022 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Mapping Based on GEE for the Monitoring of Changes in Ecosystem Types in the Upper Yellow River Basin over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Yellow River basin over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is an important ecological barrier in northwestern China. Effective LULC products that enable the monitoring of changes in regional ecosystem types are of great importance for their environmental protection and macro-control. Here, we combined an 18-class LULC classification scheme based on ecosystem types with Sentinel-2 imagery, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and the random forest method to present new LULC products with a spatial resolution of 10 m in 2018 and 2020 for the upper Yellow River Basin over the TP and conducted monitoring of changes in ecosystem types. The results indicated that: (1) In 2018 and 2020, the overall accuracy (OA) of LULC maps ranged between 87.45% and 93.02%. (2) Grassland was the main LULC first-degree class in the research area, followed by wetland and water bodies and barren land. For the LULC second-degree class, the main LULC was grassland, followed by broadleaf shrub and marsh. (3) In the first-degree class of changes in ecosystem types, the largest area of progressive succession (positive) was grassland-shrubland (451.13 km(2)), whereas the largest area of retrogressive succession (negative) was grassland-barren (395.91 km(2)). In the second-degree class, the largest areas of progressive succession (positive) were grassland-broadleaf shrub (344.68 km(2)) and desert land-grassland (302.02 km(2)), whereas the largest areas of retrogressive succession (negative) were broadleaf shrubland-grassland (309.08 km(2)) and grassland-bare rock (193.89 km(2)). The northern and southwestern parts of the study area showed a trend towards positive succession, whereas the south-central Huangnan, northeastern Gannan, and central Aba Prefectures showed signs of retrogressive succession in their changes in ecosystem types. The purpose of this study was to provide basis data for basin-scale ecosystem monitoring and analysis with more detailed categories and reliable accuracy.

TI  - Global and Local Assessment of Image Classification Quality on an Overall and Per-Class Basis without Ground Reference Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground reference data are typically required to evaluate the quality of a supervised image classification analysis used to produce a thematic map from remotely sensed data. Acquiring a suitable ground data set for a rigorous assessment of classification quality can be a major challenge. An alternative approach to quality assessment is to use a model-based method such as can be achieved with a latent class analysis. Previous research has shown that the latter can provide estimates of class areal extent for a non-site specific accuracy assessment and yield estimates of producer's accuracy which are commonly used in site-specific accuracy assessment. Here, the potential for quality assessment via a latent class analysis is extended to show that an estimate of a complete confusion matrix can be predicted which allows a suite of standard accuracy measures to be generated to indicate global quality on an overall and per-class basis. In addition, information on classification uncertainty may be used to illustrate classification quality on a per-pixel basis and hence provide local information to highlight spatial variations in classification quality. Classifications of imagery from airborne and satellite-borne sensors were used to illustrate the potential of the latent class analysis with results compared against those arising from the use of a conventional ground data set.

TI  - Urban growth modeling based on cellular automata with transition rules optimized using genetic fuzzy systems
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a new methodology for urban growth modeling by integrating cellular automata (CA) and genetic fuzzy algorithms. The urban growth phenomenon is a spatio-temporal and continuous process that can be modeled by employing fuzzy logic as a framework for handling vagueness. Dependence upon an expert for assigning membership functions and rule weights has made the fuzzy logic approach rather subjective. Our proposed methodology overcomes this shortcoming by applying genetic algorithms to tune and optimize the fuzzy logic system and to make it expert independent. The optimization process encompasses a fuzzy membership function and weights for fuzzy rules. This model uses linguistic variables for defining CA transition rules and applies them to represent the non-deterministic nature of urban growth. The proposed model is applied to simulate urban growth in the Tehran Metropolitan Area in Iran across time steps of 1988, 1999, and 2010 developed using Landsat TM and ETM+ images and a Digital Elevation Model. The first data pairs were employed for calibration of the model parameters, and the remainder of the data was used for validation of the model across time. The model was evaluated using a relative operating characteristic of 0.88 and a figure of merit statistic of 0.31, which quantifies the model goodness of fit.

TI  - Assessing the Landscape Ecological Risks of Land-Use Change
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, a changing global climate and the continuous expansion of the intensity and scope of human activities have led to regional differentiation in the surface landscape. This has caused numerous ecological risks under multiple pressure sources, gradually becoming an important factor restricting the sustainable development of economic and social health. With the continuous development of the social economy, land use and associated ecological risks will inevitably change. According to the forest transformation theory and the environmental Kuznets curve, we put forward the theoretical framework of ecological risk transformation of land-use change and took Zhangjiachuan County (China) as an example to verify it. Therefore, on the basis of Landsat satellite data, this paper used landscape structures to calculate an ecological risk index, and evaluated the ecological risk of land-use changes through pattern index analyses. The results show that, from 2000 to 2020, the ecological risk index of land-use change in Zhangjiachuan County exhibited an increasing and then decreasing trend, showing an overall "inverted U-shaped" trend of change consistent with the transformation theoretical framework of ecological risks of land use change. Secondly, in terms of patterns, the ecological risk of land-use change in Zhangjiachuan County showed a distribution feature of high in the west and low in the east. In 2000, high-risk areas were mainly concentrated in the central and northern areas, while low-risk areas were mainly concentrated in the eastern areas. From 2000 to 2015, the medium-risk areas expanded to the west and midwest, and the geographic centers of the risk areas were slightly offset. From 2015 to 2020, the overall pattern of ecological risk areas was basically the same as that of the previous stage, but the medium-risk areas were slightly reduced. In terms of quantity, from 2000 to 2015, the areas of the lowest risk level and low risk level decreased, while the areas of medium risk level, high risk level, and the highest risk level increased; from 2015 to 2020, the areas of the lowest risk level and low risk level increased, and the areas of medium risk level, high risk level, and highest risk level decreased. Lastly, the spatial aggregation of ecological risks in Zhangjiachuan County weakened slightly from 2000 to 2005, gradually increased from 2005 to 2015, and then slightly weakened from 2015 to 2020.

TI  - An Improved Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Method for Snow-Covered Mountain Areas Using Snow Index and Elevation Information
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images with high spatial and temporal resolution in snow-covered areas are important for forecasting avalanches and studying the local weather. However, it is difficult to obtain images with high spatial and temporal resolution by a single sensor due to the limitations of technology and atmospheric conditions. The enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) can fill in the time-series gap of remote sensing images, and it is widely used in spatiotemporal fusion. However, this method cannot accurately predict the change when there is a change in surface types. For example, a snow-covered surface will be revealed as the snow melts, or the surface will be covered with snow as snow falls. These sudden changes in surface type may not be predicted by this method. Thus, this study develops an improved spatiotemporal method ESTARFM (iESTARFM) for the snow-covered mountain areas in Nepal by introducing NDSI and DEM information to simulate the snow-covered change to improve the accuracy of selecting similar pixels. Firstly, the change in snow cover is simulated according to NDSI and DEM. Then, similar pixels are selected according to the change in snow cover. Finally, NDSI is added to calculate the weights to predict the pixels at the target time. Experimental results show that iESTARFM can reduce the bright abnormal patches in the land area compared to ESTARFM. For spectral accuracy, iESTARFM performs better than ESTARFM with the root mean square error (RMSE) being reduced by 0.017, the correlation coefficient (r) being increased by 0.013, and the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) being increased by 0.013. For spatial accuracy, iESTARFM can generate clearer textures, with Robert's edge (Edge) being reduced by 0.026. These results indicate that iESTARFM can obtain higher prediction results and maintain more spatial details, which can be used to generate dense time series images for snow-covered mountain areas.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping of Kinnaur District in Himachal Pradesh, India Using Probabilistic Frequency Ratio Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a recurring phenomenon in hilly areas that destroy the natural environment, causing enormous property damage and human loss every year. Geological rock structure plays an important role in the occurrence of landslides. Concentration of dolomite, phyllite, schist and quartzite make this area more susceptible to failure. Landslides are prompted with the aid of using aggregate of things like slope, soil type, lithology, land use, land cover, drainage density, relative relief, curvature, etc. The main aim of this study is to delineate landslide susceptibility zone. In the study, the primary concern was to evaluate the contribution of controlling factors to landslides and to produce a landslide susceptibility map of the examination area. This study uses the landslide susceptibility model using frequency ratio in Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh, India. A landslide inventory was prepared with the help of Landsat, google earth images from 2010-2020 period. Digital elevation model (DEM) was used to prepare slope, aspect, curvature, and relative relief maps. Other maps like soil, land use land cover, was prepared using LISS-iii and LISSiv data to analyze landslide controlling factors. An aggregate of 379 landslide polygons was digitized and then divided into a preparation set (70%) with 265 polygons and a test set with 114 polygons (30%). The connection between landslides and controlling factors was statistically assessed with FR analysis. Values were utilized to create the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) and the investigation region was divided into five zones of relative landslide susceptibility which were divided as very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. The findings of the analysis were validated by calculating the area under curve (AUC), which reveals a success rate accuracy of 73.01% and a prediction rate curve accuracy of 0.73%, indicating a high-quality susceptibility map derived from the FR model.

TI  - Douglas Fir Growth Is Constrained by Drought: Delineating the Climatic Limits of Timber Species under Seasonally Dry Conditions
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is debate on which tree species can sustain forest ecosystem services in a drier and warmer future. In Europe, the use of non-native timber species, such as Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco), is suggested as a solution to mitigate climate change impacts because of their high growth resilience to drought. However, the biogeographical, climatic and ecological limits for widely planted timber species still need to be defined. Here, we study the growth response to climate variables and drought of four Douglas fir plantations in northern Spain subjected to contrasting climate conditions. Further, we measure wood density in one of the sites to obtain a better understanding of growth responses to climate. Correlative analyses and simulations based on the Vaganov-Shaskin process-based model confirm that growth of Douglas fir is constrained by warm and dry conditions during summer and early autumn, particularly in the driest study site. Minimum wood density increased in response to dry spring conditions. Therefore, planting Douglas fir in sites with a marked summer drought will result in reduced growth but a dense earlywood. Stands inhabiting dry sites are vulnerable to late-summer drought stress and can act as "sentinel plantations", delineating the tolerance climate limits of timber species.

TI  - Long-term vegetation phenology changes and response to multi-scale meteorological drought on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the response of vegetation phenology to meteorological drought can provide insight into the feedback mechanisms of ecosystems to environmental and climate change. These key phenological parameters of vegetation are extracted on the China's Loess Plateau (LP) based on TimeSat using MODIS remote sensing data, and their trends are estimated using Sen's slope. Then, response of key physical parameters of vegetation phenology to multi-scale drought was investigated using Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The results show that: 1) LP vegetation Start of Season (SOS) and Peak of Season (POS) are delayed from south (low elevation) to north (high elevation). End of Season (EOS) is delayed from northeast to southwest. Length of Season (LOS) show decrease trend with altitude and latitude increasing. Besides, temporal variation of different vegetation phenological periods is highest in farmland and is lowest in the forest. 2) Vegetation SOS and POS are advanced in the eastern part of LP and delayed in the western part. Meanwhile, EOS and LOS are advanced in the southern part of LP. 3) The POS and EOS of LP vegetation responded more significantly to drought. The western Longzhong Plateau of LP was susceptible to the negative effects of preseason drought, and the eastern Northern Shaanxi Plateau and Taihang Mountains were susceptible to the positive effects. Moreover, monthly-and seasonal-scale droughts have significantly effects on vegetation phenology than annual-scale drought. 4) Compared to forest and grassland, the vegetation phenology of farmland is more sensitive to monthly-and seasonal-scale droughts. However, the response of forest to annual-scale drought is more signifi-cant. The results of the study could provide scientific basis for crop yield stabilization and agricultural disaster warning in the LP. Keywords: Vegetation phenology; TimeSat; Drought response; Loess Plateau.

TI  - Improved LSTM Model for Boreal Forest Height Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of SAR imagery combined with reference ground data can be suitable for producing forest inventories. Copernicus Sentinel-1 imagery is particularly interesting for forest mapping because of its free availability to data users; however, temporal dependencies within SAR time series that can potentially improve mapping accuracy are rarely explored. In this study, we introduce a novel semi-supervised Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, CrsHelix-LSTM, and demonstrate its utility for predicting forest tree height using time series of Sentinel-1 images. The model brings three important modifications to the conventional LSTM model. Firstly, it uses a Helix-Elapse (HE) projection to capture the relationship between forest temporal patterns and Sentinel-1 time series, when time intervals between datatakes are irregular. A skip-link based LSTM block is introduced and a novel backbone network, Helix-LSTM, is proposed to retrieve temporal features at different receptive scales. Finally, a novel semisupervised strategy, Cross-Pseudo Regression, is employed to achieve better model performance when reference training data are limited. CrsHelix-LSTM model is demonstrated over a representative boreal forest site located in Central Finland. A time series of 96 Sentinel-1 images are used in the study. The developed model is compared with basic LSTM model, attention-based bidirectional LSTM and several other established regression approaches used in forest variable mapping, demonstrating consistent improvement of forest height prediction accuracy. At best, the achieved accuracy of forest height mapping was 28.3% relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) for pixel-level predictions and 18.0% rRMSE on stand level. We expect that the developed model can also be used for modeling relationships between other forest variables and satellite image time series.

TI  - A Constellation of Rare Gynecological Malignancies and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma: A Case Report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ovarian microcystic stromal tumors (MST) are a rare subtype of sex-cord stromal tumors. We are presenting a case of a MST arising in a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and concurrent colonic adenocarcinoma. During the patient's workup of an ampullary adenoma associated with her FAP, she was found to have an enlarged uterus with a thickened endometrium and an incidental pelvic mass on the fundus of the uterus. Subsequent imaging identified heterogenous bulky ovaries. This patient underwent surgical resection including a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, bilateral pelvic sentinel lymph node biopsy during her planned total proctocolectomy and transduodenal ampullectomy. Extensive histologic and immunohistochemical investigations were completed and the final pathology report revealed a unique compilation of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage II, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, bilateral ovarian MST, a sperate pedunculated mass favoring a diagnosis of uterine tumor resembling ovarian sex cord tumor (UTROSCT), 2 distinct adenocarcinomas of the colon (T2N0 and T1N0) and a tubular adenoma of the ampulla. The pathology showed the endometroid adenocarcinoma was beta-catenin negative while the MST and UTROSCT both showed nuclear positivity with beta-catenin. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a UTROSCT with concurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma presenting with bilateral ovarian MST's and adenomatous polyposis coli gene positive FAP colon adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Remote Sensing Imaging as a Tool to Support Mulberry Cultivation for Silk Production
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades there has been an increasing use of remotely sensed data for precision agricultural purposes. Sericulture, the activity of rearing silkworm (Bombyx mori L.) larvae to produce silk in the form of cocoons, is an agricultural practice that has rarely used remote sensing techniques but that could benefit from them. The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility of using satellite imaging in order to monitor leaf harvesting in mulberry (Morus alba L.) plants cultivated for feeding silkworms; additionally, quantitative parameters on silk cocoon production were related to the analyses on vegetation indices. Adopting PlanetScope satellite images, four M. alba fields were monitored from the beginning of the silkworm rearing season until its end in 2020 and 2021. The results of our work showed that a decrease in the multispectral vegetation indices in the mulberry plots due to leaf harvesting was correlated with the different parameters of silk cocoons spun by silkworm larvae; in particular, a decrease in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) had high correlations with quantitative silk cocoon production parameters (R-2 values up to 0.56, p < 0.05). These results led us to the conclusion that precision agriculture can improve sericultural practice, offering interesting solutions for estimating the quantity of produced silk cocoons through the remote analysis of mulberry fields.

TI  - Breast surgery after neoadjuvant therapy
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThe standard of care in breast surgery has changed, from mastectomy to breast conserving surgery whenever possible, and from axillary dissection to sentinel node biopsy. Neoadjuvant systemic approaches have broadened the indications for organ-conserving and less mutilating surgery, but also raise important questions of balancing locoregional treatment de-escalation and protecting excellent long-term outcomes.Recent findingsRecent studies have aimed at investigating the safety of de-escalating surgical approaches not only in the upfront breast surgery situation but also after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. This pertains to both the safety of breast conserving surgery - including more complex oncoplastic approaches - within the new (posttherapeutic) anatomical extent of the residual disease, but more controversially to de-escalating surgical treatment of the axilla. While sentinel node biopsy appears to be the standard of care for node-negative disease also after primary systemic therapy, the optimal procedure in situations of posttherapeutic node-positive disease remains highly controversial.SummaryBoth breast and axillary surgery after neoadjuvant systemic therapy for women with breast cancer has undergone multiple paradigm changes in recent years. For the primary tumor in the breast, breast-conserving surgery constitutes the standard of care, and unnecessary mastectomies should be strongly discouraged. For axillary surgery, sentinel-node biopsy should be aimed at, and completion axillary dissections minimized for situations of extensive disease and or poor neoadjuvant treatment response. Additional techniques such as targeted axillary dissection are currently under evaluation in clinical trials.

TI  - Dynamics of the Burlan and Pomacochas Lakes Using SAR Data in GEE, Machine Learning Classifiers, and Regression Methods
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonas is a mountain region in Peru with high cloud cover, so using optical data in the analysis of surface changes of water bodies (such as the Burlan and Pomacochas lakes in Peru) is difficult, on the other hand, SAR images are suitable for the extraction of water bodies and delineation of contours. Therefore, in this research, to determine the surface changes of Burlan and Pomacochas lakes, we used Sentinel-1 A/B products to analyse the dynamics from 2014 to 2020, in addition to evaluating the procedure we performed a photogrammetric flight and compared the shapes and geometric attributes from each lake. For this, in Google Earth Engine (GEE), we processed 517 SAR images for each lake using the following algorithms: a classification and regression tree (CART), Random Forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).) 2021-02-10, then; the same value was validated by comparing the area and perimeter values obtained from a photogrammetric flight, and the classification of a SAR image of the same date. During the first months of the year, there were slight increases in the area and perimeter of each lake, influenced by the increase in rainfall in the area. CART and Random Forest obtained better results for image classification, and for regression analysis, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) were a better fit to the data (higher R-2), for Burlan and Pomacochas lakes, respectively. The shape of the lakes obtained by classification was similar to that of the photogrammetric flight. For 2021-02-10, for Burlan Lake, all 3 classifiers had area values between 42.48 and 43.53, RFR 44.47 and RPAS 45.63 hectares. For Pomacohas Lake, the 3 classifiers had area values between 414.23 and 434.89, SVR 411.89 and RPAS 429.09 hectares. Ultimately, we seek to provide a rapid methodology to classify SAR images into two categories and thus obtain the shape of water bodies and analyze their changes over short periods. A methodological scheme is also provided to perform a regression analysis in GC using five methods that can be replicated in different thematic areas.

TI  - SealNet 2.0: Human-Level Fully-Automated Pack-Ice Seal Detection in Very-High-Resolution Satellite Imagery with CNN Model Ensembles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pack-ice seals are key indicator species in the Southern Ocean. Their large size (2-4 m) and continent-wide distribution make them ideal candidates for monitoring programs via very-high-resolution satellite imagery. The sheer volume of imagery required, however, hampers our ability to rely on manual annotation alone. Here, we present SealNet 2.0, a fully automated approach to seal detection that couples a sea ice segmentation model to find potential seal habitats with an ensemble of semantic segmentation convolutional neural network models for seal detection. Our best ensemble attains 0.806 precision and 0.640 recall on an out-of-sample test dataset, surpassing two trained human observers. Built upon the original SealNet, it outperforms its predecessor by using annotation datasets focused on sea ice only, a comprehensive hyperparameter study leveraging substantial high-performance computing resources, and post-processing through regression head outputs and segmentation head logits at predicted seal locations. Even with a simplified version of our ensemble model, using AI predictions as a guide dramatically boosted the precision and recall of two human experts, showing potential as a training device for novice seal annotators. Like human observers, the performance of our automated approach deteriorates with terrain ruggedness, highlighting the need for statistical treatment to draw global population estimates from AI output.

TI  - Transperitoneal vs extraperitoneal approach for aortic sentinel node detection in endometrial cancer.
T2  - AJOG global reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the sentinel lymph node technique in endometrial cancer is currently replacing pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy for the evaluation of lymph node status in endometrial cancer, its performance is not yet standardized.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the detection rates and locations of aortic sentinel lymph node detection after dual cervical and fundal indocyanine green injection in patients with endometrial cancer, using the transperitoneal and extraperitoneal approaches.STUDY DESIGN: Between June 26, 2014 and December 31, 2019, 278 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer at our institution. In all cases, we performed sentinel lymph node biopsy with dual cervical and fundal indocyanine green injection, and back-up lymphadenectomy in high-risk cases. A post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate differences between the transperitoneal and extraperitoneal approach to aortic sentinel lymph nodes.RESULTS: The detection rates were as follows: overall detection rate: 93.2% (259/278); pelvic detection rate: 90.3% (251/278); bilateral pelvic detection rate: 68.0% (189/278); aortic detection rate: 66.9% (186/278); and isolated aortic detection rate: 2.88% (8/278). Transperitoneal and extraperitoneal aortic detection rates were similar (65.0% and 69.6%, respectively), with no significant differences (P=.441). Isolated aortic metastases were similar in both groups (2% vs 4.7%, respectively; P=.185). The laterality of aortic sentinel lymph node detection was influenced by the surgical approach (P=.002), but not its location above or below the inferior mesenteric artery (P=.166 and P=.556, respectively).CONCLUSION: The detection rates at the aortic level were similar between the transperitoneal and extraperitoneal approaches, with no impact on subsequent pelvic detection. The transperitoneal approach detected more laterocaval, precaval, and interaortocaval nodes, whereas the extraperitoneal approach detected more preaortic and left lateroaortic nodes.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variations of Active Accumulated Temperature and Its Impact on Vegetation NDVI in the Source Region of China's Yellow River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change has greatly influenced the ecosystems in the Tibetan Plateau. Many studies focused on the direct effects of climate warming on the headwater regions by mean temperature, while less investigating its implication for the eco-environment. To address this, the study discussed the spatial-temporal variations of the bio-related climate indicators >= 0 degrees C annual accumulated temperature AAT0 and its lasting days LDT0, and corresponding >= 5 degrees C indicators AAT5 and LDT5 on the source region of the Yellow River (SRYR). The stationarity of indicators during 1979-2018 were tested by Pettitt test, and trends checked by linear regression analysis and Mann-Kendall test. Normalized difference vegetation index NDVI (2001-2016) was adopted to detect the correlation between vegetation activities and indicators. Results show that the AAT and LDT0 exhibited significant increasing trend over the SRYR, while the LDT5 significantly increased mainly under 4000 m. Most LDT extended due to the combined efforts of the early onset and late termination of the given temperature. 1997 was detected in the abrupt change analysis of AAT0 both on the basin scale and most area, and was adopted to divide the period into two stages. The regional mean AAT0 linearly grew at a rate of 96 degrees C decade(-1) during the entire period, and 104 degrees C decade(-1) during the second stage. Except for a drastic jump in the areal mean values, there was a distinct upward-shift of isoline in elevation between stages. NDVI showed strong correlativity with >= 0 degrees C indicators on the basin scale, according to the Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. Spatially, the overlap area between Pearson's gamma >= 0.5 and linearly rising AAT0 reached 50%, which was fully covered with significantly increasing AAT0 during the recent stage. Thus the rapid growth of >= 0 degrees C indicators would effectively accelerate NDVI over this major alpine grasslands, especially around the eastern low regions, where indicators are higher and grow faster.

TI  - Tracking Deforestation, Drought, and Fire Occurrence in Kutai National Park, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dry lowland and mangrove forests of Kutai National Park (KNP) in Indonesia provide invaluable ecosystem services to local human populations (>200,000 in number), serve as immense carbon sinks to recapture anthropogenic emissions, and safeguard habitats for thousands of wildlife species including the critically endangered Northeast Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus morio). With recent reports of ongoing illegal logging and large-scale wildfires within this National Park, we sought to leverage the extensive catalogue and processing power of Google Earth Engine to track the rates and influences of forest loss within KNP over various time periods since 1997. We present estimates of forest loss from the Hansen Global Forest Change v1.9 dataset (2000-2021) which detected a loss of 15% (272 km(2)) of forest cover within KNP since 2000, half of which (137 km(2)) coincided with the El Nino-induced wildfires of 2015-2016. Using the MCD64A1 C6.1 MODIS dataset, we found significant spatial overlap between burned area and forest loss detections during the 2015-2016 period but identified considerable omissions in the burned area dataset over smallholder farms within KNP. We discuss the implications of deforestation in areas of primary orangutan habitat and how patterns of forest loss have influenced drought and fire dynamics within KNP. Finally, we compare time-series estimates of precipitation, the ENSO index, burned area, and forest loss to demonstrate that fire risk within KNP depends largely-but not exclusively-on drought severity, and that rates of non-fire (gradual) and fire-related (extreme) forest loss threaten the remaining forests of this National Park.

TI  - Using a Two-Stage Scheme to Map Toxic Metal Distributions Based on GF-5 Satellite Hyperspectral Images at a Northern Chinese Opencast Coal Mine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxic metals have attracted great concern worldwide due to their toxicity and slow decomposition. Although metal concentrations can be accurately obtained with chemical methods, it is difficult to map metal distributions on a large scale due to their inherently low efficiency and high cost. Moreover, chemical analysis methods easily lead to secondary contamination. To address these issues, 110 topsoil samples were collected using a soil sampler, and positions for each sample were surveyed using a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver from a coal mine in northern China. Then, the metal contents were surveyed in a laboratory via a portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) device, and GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite hyperspectral images were used to retrieve the spectra of the soil samples. Furthermore, a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) were selected to smooth and enhance the soil reflectance. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and Boruta algorithms were utilized to identify the feature bands. The optimum two-stage method, consisting of the random forest (RF) and ordinary kriging (OK) methods, was used to infer the metal concentrations. The following outcomes were achieved. Firstly, both zinc (Zn) (68.07 mg/kg) and nickel (Ni) (26.61 mg/kg) surpassed the regional background value (Zn: 48.60 mg/kg, Ni: 19.5 mg/kg). Secondly, the optimum model of RF, combined with the OK (RFOK) method, with a relatively higher coefficient of determination (R-2) (R-2 = 0.60 for Zn, R-2 = 0.30 for Ni), a lower root-mean-square error (RMSE) (RMSE = 12.45 mg/kg for Zn, RMSE = 3.97 mg/kg for Ni), and a lower mean absolute error (MAE) (MAE = 9.47 mg/kg for Zn, MAE = 3.31mg/kg for Ni), outperformed the other four models, including the RF, OK, inverse distance weighted (IDW) method, and the optimum model of RF combined with IDW (RFIDW) method in estimating soil Zn and Ni contents, respectively. Thirdly, the distribution of soil Zn and Ni concentrations obtained from the best-predicted method and the GF-5 satellite hyperspectral images was in line with the actual conditions. This scheme proves that satellite hyperspectral images can be used to directly estimate metal distributions, and the present study provides a scientific base for mapping heavy metal spatial distribution on a relatively large scale.

TI  - Remote Sensing Evidence for Significant Variations in the Global Gross Domestic Product during the COVID-19 Epidemic
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly and is still threatening human health currently. A series of measures for restraining epidemic spreading has been adopted throughout the world, which seriously impacted the gross domestic product (GDP) globally. However, details of the changes in the GDP and its spatial heterogeneity characteristics on a fine scale worldwide during the pandemic are still uncertain. We designed a novel scheme to simulate a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees resolution grid global GDP map during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simulated nighttime-light remotely sensed data (SNTL) was forecasted via a GM(1, 1) model under the assumption that there was no COVID-19 epidemic in 2020. We constructed a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to determine the quantitative relationship between the variation of nighttime light (Delta NTL) and the variation of GDP (Delta GDP). The scheme can detect and explain the spatial heterogeneity of Delta GDP at the grid scale. It is found that a series of policies played an obvious role in affecting GDP. This work demonstrated that the global GDP, except for in a few countries, represented a remarkably decreasing trend, whereas the Delta GDP exhibited significant differences.

TI  - A Novel Workflow for Crop Type Mapping with a Time Series of Synthetic Aperture Radar and Optical Images in the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution crop type mapping is of importance for site-specific agricultural management and food security in smallholder farming regions, but is challenging due to limited data availability and the need for image-based algorithms. In this paper, we developed an efficient object- and pixel-based mapping algorithm to generate a 10 m resolution crop type map over large spatial domains by integrating time series optical images (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (Sentinel-1) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results showed that the proposed method was reliable for crop type mapping in the study area with an overall accuracy (OA) of 93.22% and a kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.89. Through experiments, we also found that the monthly median values of the vertical transmit/vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit/horizontal receive (VH) bands were insensitive to crop type mapping itself, but adding this information to supplement the optical images improved the classification accuracy, with an OA increase of 0.09-2.98%. Adding the slope of vegetation index change (VIslope) at the critical period to crop type classification was obviously better than that of relative change ratio of vegetation index (VIratio), both of which could make an OA improvement of 2.58%. These findings not only highlighted the potential of the VIslope and VIratio indices during the critical period for crop type mapping in small plots, but suggested that SAR images could be included to supplement optical images for crop type classification.

TI  - A Monitoring Method Based on Vegetation Abnormal Information Applied to the Case of Jizong Shed-Tunnel Landslide
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the most dangerous natural disasters, which have affected national economic development and social stability. This paper proposes a method to indirectly monitor the deformation characteristics of landslides by extracting the abnormal vegetation information, especially for the inaccessible high-mountain landslides in southwestern China. This paper extracts the vegetation anomaly information in the Jizong Shed-Tunnel landslide which is located on the main traffic road to Tibet by the optical remote sensing Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data, and analyzes the temporal and spatial characteristics of the vegetation anomaly information through a time series. Then, we use the small baseline subsets interferometry synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology to process Sentinel-1 data to obtain the time-series surface deformation information. Finally, we analyze and verify the results of the two methods. The results show that there is obvious vegetation coverage (VC) decline, with a maximum increasing percentage of 8.77% for the low and medium VC, and obvious surface deformation around the landslide, with the highest settlement rate of between 0 mm/year and 30 mm/year. Through the time-series analysis, we find that the change trends of the two methods are basically the same. This paper shows that the method of using abnormal vegetation information to monitor the Jizong Shed-Tunnel landslide has a certain degree of reliability and practicability. It can provide a new idea and effective supplement for landslide monitoring.

TI  - Improvement of Lithological Mapping Using Discrete Wavelet Transformation from Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithological mapping using dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is limited by the low classification accuracy. In this study, we extract ten parameters (backscatter coefficients and polarization decomposition parameters) from the Sentinel-1 dual-pol SAR data. Using 94 mother wavelet functions (MF), a one-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to all the parameters, and the suitable MF is screened by comparing the overall accuracy and F1 score. Finally, the lithological mapping of the study area is performed. According to the cross-validation results, DWT can improve the overall accuracy for all MF. Db13 improved the overall accuracy by 6.1% (from 49.5% to 55.6%). The F1 score of granitoids improved by 0.223. Among the five rock units, Grantoids and Quaternary alluvium and sediment with finer gravel can be better differentiated than the other three rock units. The overall accuracy of effusive rocks (marine basic volcanic rocks) is not improved by DWT, but this study confirms the great potential of DWT in lithology classification.

TI  - Ground Deformation in Yuxi Basin Based on Atmosphere-Corrected Time-Series InSAR Integrated with the Latest Meteorological Reanalysis Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) is often affected by tropospheric artifacts caused by temporal and spatial variability in the atmospheric refractive index. Conventional temporal and spatial filtering cannot effectively distinguish topography-related stratified delays, leading to biased estimates of the deformation phases. Here, we propose a TS-InSAR atmospheric delay correction method based on ERA-5; the robustness and accuracy of ERA-5 data under the influence of different atmospheric delays were explored. Notably, (1) wet delay was the main factor affecting tropospheric delay within the interferogram; the higher spatial and temporal resolution of ERA-5 can capture the wet delay signal better than MERRA-2. (2) The proposed method can mitigate the atmospheric delay component in the interferogram; the average standard deviation (STD) reduction for the Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A interferograms were 19.68 and 14.75%, respectively. (3) Compared to the empirical linear model, the correlation between the stratified delays estimated by the two methods reached 0.73. We applied this method for the first time to a ground subsidence study in the Yuxi Basin and successfully detected three subsidence centers. We analyzed and discussed ground deformation causes based on rainfall and fault zones. Finally, we verified the accuracy of the proposed method by using leveling monitoring data.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial-Temporal Distribution Characteristics of NO<sub>2</sub> and Their Influencing Factors in the Yangtze River Delta Based on Sentinel-5P Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent rapid economic development in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) has led to atmospheric destruction; therefore, it is imperative to solve the issue of atmospheric environmental pollution to ensure stable long-term development. Based on the NO2 column concentration observed by the TROPOMI (a tropospheric monitoring instrument) on the Sentinel-5P, the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of the NO2 column concentration in the YRD from 2019 to 2020 were analyzed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and the Geographical Detector (Geodetector) model was used to determine the driving factors of the NO2 column concentration. The results show that the correlation between the NO2 column concentration and the ground-monitored NO2 concentrations reached 70%. The annual variation trend of the NO2 column concentration exhibited a 'U'-shaped curve, with the characteristics of 'high in winter and low in summer, with a transition between spring and autumn'. It exhibited obvious agglomeration characteristics in terms of the spatial distribution, with a high-value agglomeration in the central region of the YRD, followed by the northern region, and a low-value agglomeration in the southern region, with higher altitudes. The change in the NO2 column concentration in the YRD was affected by both physical geographical factors and socio-economic factors; it is clear that the influence of socio-economic factors has increased.

TI  - Remote Sensing Retrieval of Total Nitrogen in the Pearl River Delta Based on Landsat8
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pearl River Delta in South China is subject to severe eutrophication, which is significantly exacerbated by the total nitrogen (TN). Remote sensing technology with large-scale synchronous observations in the Pearl River Delta can effectively monitor organic pollution. Statistical methods based on remote sensing images have been widely used in water quality parameter retrieval for inland rivers, reservoirs, and lakes, but have seldom been applied in the Pearl River Delta. TN is also a non-optically active substance, so it is difficult to retrieve TN through analysis methods. This study retrieves the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) based on Landsat8 images of the Pearl River Delta using a statistical method. The stepwise regression function is built by analyzing the TN concentration and the single-band, two-band, and three-band spectral information groups measured by an ASD FieldSpec3 spectrometer. The retrieval results show that the proposed method performs well with a small mean absolute error (MAE) (0.36 mg/L for TN) and high agreement (R-2 = 0.61 for TN) between the in situ data and the retrieval concentration. The results demonstrate that the concentration of TN in the east of the Pearl River Delta was higher than in the west. Dachan Bay and Shenzhen Bay had the highest TN concentrations, which were around 3.02 mg/L and 3.67 mg/L. The 750-850 nm band could be an important reference for further exploring the spectral characteristics and retrieval of TN. The retrieval method in this study is easy to implement and convenient for local TN distribution capture, which can provide a timely reference for daily water quality supervision and management in the Pearl River Delta.

TI  - Measuring impact of Covid-19 pandemic at a teaching hospital in north India
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Government runs teaching hospitals to impart a high-quality medical education to budding medicos and paramedical students in training. The experiences these trainees at various tenure positions get then and there shape their worldview for rest of the life and have an indelible impression. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted all the routines at the hospitals around the world-including ours- and we make an attempt to measure it in one dimension in this study. Materials and Methods: We obtained attendance data of patients at out patient department and in patient department of our hospital. During the pandemic for a certain duration offline (physical) registrations were closed and they were attended only by online ones. Hence that data (actually a part of it) got captured electronically and we analyzed it to get an idea of the traversed course of the scourge. Results: When the pandemic surged during the spring and summer of 2021, our hospital was turned into a Covid facility. Hence average routine attendance of patients got reduced to a significant extent, elective surgeries/ interventions and procedures were postponed and this data is reflected in an electronic system, perhaps making a long-lasting effect on the budding trainees. This fact needs to be realized so as to take appropriate action. Conclusion: We need to realize that the effects of the viral communicable disease may be enduring, not only for the infected patients and their families but also for those who learn on those patients. Therefore, the transmissible diseases disabled not only our society, economy, and health care services when they ascended but pedagogy too. Online learning came to rescue but only up to a certain extent and with several caveats and limitations.

TI  - Contesting the meaning of gender: Right-wing populism and gender in Germany
T2  - WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The current rise of right-wing populism in Germany has manifested itself in two major events: the mobilizations following the sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015 and the 'Demonstrations for all' against sexual diversity education from 2014 to 2016. Remarkably, however, they seem to propagate contrary gender policies: while the former focuses on the fight for women's (sexual) self-determination, the latter blames feminism for destroying the family.The article analyzes these events as two of the most important right-wing populist mobilizations to better understand right-wing gender policies as a means to intervene in ongoing negotiations about the meaning of gender and family. We argue, that despite their differences, these mobilizations share certain problem definitions, a need for action and gender positions. They mobilize by articulating a comprehensive worldview. Especially the propagated female subject positions must not be reduced to mere conservativism. Rather, they articulate a specific image of white, reproductive, yet politically mobilized and supposedly emancipated femininity.

TI  - God?s Gift: Narratives of Disability in Malay Popular Fiction
T2  - GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthesis of literature and popular culture helps literary scholars form inferences about the challenges preoccupying society's collective psyche. It is therefore no stretch to assert that popular fiction, particularly popular fiction that has garnered sufficient traction to be adapted into a popular telenovela with a sizable following, is reflective of the general public's perceptions on any given issue. Having garnered sufficient attention, it is then capable of influencing, to some extent, those same public perceptions. The malleability of public opinion in reaction to what is broadcast or written is a valuable instrument for comprehending cultural paradigms. It is important, then, to analyse telenovelas and the novels upon which they are based in order to put a metaphorical finger on Malaysian attitudes toward disability. This article will focus on two Malay books that have been converted into telenovelas with the same names due to their popularity. These novel-based perceptions will then be compared to real-world experiences of caregivers and family members of children with autism in order to demonstrate that, while autism may appear to be a life sentence, children with autism are also perceived as God's gift. Additionally, while it is necessary to acknowledge how disability shapes our perceptions of what it means to be mocked for our insignificance and disability, the concepts of forgiveness and repentance appear the Malay worldview, with the implication that forgiving others' faults exemplifies a human virtue.

TI  - Physical-Based Spatial-Spectral Deep Fusion Network for Chlorophyll-a Estimation Using MODIS and Sentinel-2 MSI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is an important environmental evaluation indicator for monitoring water environments. However, the available satellite images either have a coarse spatial or low spectral resolution, which restricts the applicability of Chl-a retrieval in coastal water (e.g., less than 1 km from the shoreline) for large- and medium-sized lakes/oceans. Considering Lake Chaohu as the study area, this paper proposes a physical-based spatial-spectral deep fusion network (PSSDFN) for Chl-a retrieval using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) reflectance data. The PSSDFN combines residual connectivity and attention mechanisms to extract effective features, and introduces physical constraints, including spectral response functions and the physical degradation model, to reconcile spatial and spectral information. The fused and MSI data were used as input variables for collaborative retrieval, while only the MSI data were used as input variables for MSI retrieval. Combined with the Chl-a field data, a comparison between MSI and collaborative retrieval was conducted using four machine learning models. The results showed that collaborative retrieval can greatly improve the accuracy compared with MSI retrieval. This research illustrates that the PSSDFN can improve the estimated accuracy of Chl-a for coastal water (less than 1 km from the shoreline) in large- and medium-sized lakes/oceans.

TI  - Multi-Polarisation C-Band SAR Imagery to Estimate the Recent Dynamics of the d'Iberville Glacier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To monitor polar regions is of paramount importance for climatological studies. Climate change due to anthropogenic activities is inducing global warming that, for example, has resulted in glacier melting. This has had a significant impact on sea levels and ocean circulation. In this study, the temporal trend of the marine-terminated d'Iberville glacier (Ellesmere Island, Canada) is analysed using C-band synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery collected by the Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 missions. The data set consists of a time series of 10 synthetic aperture radar data collected from 2010 to 2022 in dual-polarimetric imaging mode, where a horizontally polarised electromagnetic wave was transmitted. An automatic approach based on a global threshold constant false alarm rate method is applied to the single- and dual-polarisation features, namely the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section and a combination of the HH- and HV-polarised scattering amplitudes, with the aim of extracting the ice front of the glacier and, therefore, estimating its behaviour over time. Independent collocated satellite optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument is also considered, where available, to support the experimental outcomes. The experimental results show that (1) the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section achieved better performance with respect to the dual-polarised feature, especially under the most challenging case of a sea-ice infested sea surface; (2) when the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section was considered, the ice front extraction methodology provided a satisfactory accuracy, i.e., a root mean square error spanning from about 1.1 pixels to 3.4 pixels, depending on the sea-surface conditions; and (3) the d'Iberville glacier exhibited, during the study period, a significant retreat whose average surface velocity was 160 m per year, resulting in a net ice area loss of 2.2 km(2) (0.18 km(2) per year). These outcomes demonstrate that the d'Iberville glacier is behaving as most of the marine-terminated glaciers in the study area while experiencing a larger ice loss.

TI  - A 20-Year Climatology of Sea Ice Leads Detected in Infrared Satellite Imagery Using a Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice leads, or fractures account for a small proportion of the Arctic Ocean surface area, but play a critical role in the energy and moisture exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere. As the sea ice area and volume in the Arctic has declined over the past few decades, changes in sea ice leads have not been studied as extensively. A recently developed approach uses artificial intelligence (AI) and satellite thermal infrared window data to build a twenty-year archive of sea ice lead detects with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and later, an archive from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The results are now available and show significant improvement over previously published methods. The AI method results have higher detection rates and a high level detection agreement between MODIS and VIIRS. Analysis over the winter season from 2002-2003 through to the 2021-2022 archive reveals lead detections have a small decreasing trend in lead area that can be attributed to increasing cloud cover in the Arctic. This work reveals that leads are becoming increasingly difficult to detect rather than less likely to occur. Although the trend is small and on the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty, leads are likely increasing at a rate of 3700 km(2) per year with a range of uncertainty of 3500 km(2) after the impact of cloud cover changes are removed.

TI  - Characterizing the Turning Points in Ecosystem Functioning and Their Linkages to Drought and Human Activities over the Arid and Semi-Arid Regions of Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the changes in dryland functioning and the drivers of those changes are critical for global ecosystem conservation and sustainability. The arid and semi-arid regions of northern China (ASARNC) are located in a key area of the generally temperate desert of the Eurasian continent, where the ecological conditions have experienced noticeable changes in recent decades. However, it is unclear whether the ecosystem functioning (EF) in this region changed abruptly and how that change was affected by natural and anthropogenic factors. Here, we estimated monthly rain use efficiency (RUE) from MODIS NDVI time series data and investigated the timing and types of turning points (TPs) in EF by the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) family algorithms during 2000-2019. The linkages between the TPs, drought, the frequency of land cover change, and socioeconomic development were examined. The results show that 63.2% of the pixels in the ASARNC region underwent sudden EF changes, of which 26.64% were induced by drought events, while 55.67% were firmly associated with the wetting climate. Wet and dry events were not detected in 17.69% of the TPs, which might have been caused by human activities. TP types and occurrences correlate differently with land cover change frequency, population density, and GDP. The improved EF TP type was correlated with the continuous humid climate and a reduced population density, while the deteriorated EF type coincided with persistent drought and increasing population density. Our research furthers the understanding of how and why TPs of EF occur and provides fundamental data for the conservation, management, and better decision-making concerning dryland ecosystems in China.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of PERSIANN Products in Studying the Precipitation Variations over Luzon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the capability of satellite precipitation estimates from five products derived from Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (including PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CCS, PERSIANN-CDR, PERSIANN-CCS-CDR, and PDIR-Now) to represent precipitation characteristics over Luzon. The analyses focused on monthly and daily timescales from 2003-2015 and adopted surface observations from the Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE) platform as the evaluation base. Among the five satellite precipitation products (SPPs), PERSIANN-CDR was observed to possess a better ability to qualitatively and quantitatively estimate spatiotemporal variations of precipitation over Luzon for the majority of the examined features with the exception of the extreme precipitation events, for which PERSIANN-CCS-CDR is superior to the other SPPs. These results highlight the usefulness of the addition of the cloud patch approach to PERSIANN-CDR to produce PERSIANN-CCS-CDR to depict the characteristics of extreme precipitation events over Luzon. A similar advantage of adopting the cloud patch approach in producing extreme precipitation estimates was also revealed from the comparison of PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CCS, and PDIR-Now. Our analyses also highlighted that all PERSIANN-series exhibit improved skills in regard to detecting precipitation characteristics over west Luzon compared to that over east Luzon. To overcome this weakness, we suggest that an adjustment in the cloud patch approach (e.g., using different cloud temperature thresholds or different brightness temperature and precipitation rate relationships) over east Luzon may be helpful.

TI  - Searching for shell stars in LAMOST DR4 by probing the Fe 42 multiplet lines
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shell stars, in particular the cooler ones, often do not show conspicuous Balmer-line emission and may consequently be missed in surveys that specifically search for emission signatures in the H alpha line. This work is aimed at identifying stars with shell-signatures via a search for strong Fe ii multiplet 42 lines at lambda lambda 4924, 5018, 5169 angstrom in archival LAMOST spectra. Candidates were selected by probing the Fe ii (42) lines in the spectra of a sample of colour-preselected early-type stars using a modified version of the MKCLASS code and then categorized by visual inspection of their spectra. We identified 75 stars showing conspicuous shell features, 43 Am/CP1 stars, 12 Ap/CP2 stars, and three objects with composite spectra. Spectral types and equivalent width measurements of the Fe ii (42) lines are presented for the sample of shell stars. Except for three objects, all shell stars appear significantly removed from the ZAMS in the colour-magnitude diagram, which is likely due to extinction by circumstellar material. We find a correlation between the equivalent width of the lambda 5169 angstrom line and the distance to the locus of the main-sequence stars (the larger the IR-excess, the stronger the lambda 5169 angstrom line) and studied the variability of the shell star sample using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, identifying a very high proportion of double stars. All but 14 shell stars are new discoveries, which highlights the efficiency of the here presented novel approach to identify stars with subtle shell features. This study may be used as a blueprint for discovering these objects in massive spectral data bases.

TI  - A Methodology for Georeferencing and Mosaicking Corona Imagery in Semi-Arid Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution Corona imagery acquired by the United States through spy missions in the 1960s presents an opportunity to gain critical insight into historic land cover conditions and expand the timeline of available data for land cover change analyses, particularly in regions such as Northern China where data from that era are scarce. Corona imagery requires time-intensive pre-processing, and the existing literature lacks the necessary detail required to replicate these processes easily. This is particularly true in landscapes where dynamic physical processes, such as aeolian desertification, reshape topography over time or regions with few persistent features for use in geo-referencing. In this study, we present a workflow for georeferencing Corona imagery in a highly desertified landscape that contained mobile dunes, shifting vegetation cover, and a few reference points. We geo-referenced four Corona images from Inner Mongolia, China using uniquely derived ground control points and Landsat TM imagery with an overall accuracy of 11.77 m, and the workflow is documented in sufficient detail for replication in similar environments.

TI  - Development and Utilization of a Mirror Array Target for the Calibration and Harmonization of Micro-Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The utilization of multi-sensor and constellation satellite data with appropriate geometric and radiometric calibration and validation is required for effective satellite data applications for various monitoring tasks. In this paper, we present the research and development of optical calibration sites using both natural surface and ground point-source-mirror reflectors constructed at The Center for Research and Application of Satellite Remote Sensing of Yamaguchi University (YUCARS), Japan. The YUCARS calibration sites experimented with GRUS-1A (Axelspace Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and PlanetScope (Planet Lab, San Francisco, CA, USA) images for the verification of radiometric and geometric performance following the harmonized reflectance product. The top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance and reflectance of optical micro-satellite imageries were simulated by MODTRAN6 based on the in-situ data of the ground point-source-mirror reflector, ground surface and atmospheric measurements. The YUCARS mirror arrays were used to verify geometric accuracy and better band co-registration. The TOA reflectance derived from the ground measurements and acquired by satellite instruments were correlated to derive harmonization coefficients. The results show an improvement in image accuracy and harmonization of the different sensor data for the multi-temporal application. The preliminary results show that the mirror-arrays method can efficiently solve the limits of the external environment, time, and space. Furthermore, it can be used for improving radiometric performance and image quality using deblurring from a point spread function created from YUCARS mirror arrays.

TI  - Meddies and Their Sea Surface Expressions: Observations and Theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea surface expressions of Mediterranean Water eddies, known as "meddies," are observed in satellite data, and their main characteristics are measured. Satellite altimeter observations of surface expressions are detected over the meddies observed in situ using the MEDTRANS meddy dataset (1950-2013). In this study 209 observed meddy cores in the North Atlantic Ocean, selected over the period of the 22 years of sea surface height measurements with satellite altimetry (1993-2013), were analyzed. Results show relatively good agreement between the theoretical estimates of the meddy surface signals as reported by Bashmachnikov and Carton and the measured surface expressions. It was found that, on average, the theoretical results underestimate the measured sea surface elevations of the meddy surface expressions by a factor of 2. Although the variability of the measured expressions is reasonably well described by the combination of meddy core and the ocean background parameters of the theoretical expression, we cannot define a single individual parameter of the meddy core, which chiefly shapes the magnitude of the meddy surface signal. Interestingly, the overall distribution of characteristics of meddy surface expressions in the Atlantic shows that the sea level anomalies formed by meddies intensify westward, growing both in magnitude and radius. This opposes the expected theoretical decrease of meddy surface signals due to a known progressive decay of the meddy cores with distance from their generation region at the Iberian continental slope. This observed tendency is attributed to meddy interaction with the upper-ocean currents and other eddies (in particular in the region of the North Atlantic Current and Azores Current) that are not considered by the theory.

TI  - Application of Soil and Water Assessment Tool in Indonesia - a review and challenges
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Watersheds are increasingly experiencing environmental damage in various parts of the world recently, including in Indonesia. Indonesia, which has approximately 17 thousand watersheds, faces major challenges in watershed management, especially with the increasing pressure on watershed resources. The accuracy of watershed management is very necessary for the era of rapid development and growth. The abilities of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) will assist in making the right decisions in watershed management. Although the model has several advantages such as free access and user-friendly, the model still has limitations when applied to watersheds that do not have sufficient observation data. The purpose of this study is to review the uses of this model in Indonesia. The SWAT has been applied in various watersheds reported in 178 publications that have passed peer-review. Most of the applications were found in Java Island, with 112 publications. The availability of climatological and hydrological data was main obstacle for model application. However, remotely sensed data this limitation and challenge can be handled with remote sensing techniques which will make this model very compatible to be applied in Indonesia. The SWAT will expectantly direct its application to regions still less or never been established, such as the Kalimantan and Papua regions.

TI  - A Survey of Computer Vision Techniques for Forest Characterization and Carbon Monitoring Tasks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Estimation of terrestrial carbon balance is one of the key tasks in the understanding and prognosis of climate change impacts and the development of tools and policies according to carbon mitigation and adaptation strategies. Forest ecosystems are one of the major pools of carbon stocks affected by controversial processes influencing carbon stability. Therefore, monitoring forest ecosystems is a key to proper inventory management of resources and planning their sustainable use. In this survey, we discuss which computer vision techniques are applicable to the most important aspects of forest management actions, considering the wide availability of remote sensing (RS) data of different resolutions based both on satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observations. Our analysis applies to the most occurring tasks such as estimation of forest areas, tree species classification, and estimation of forest resources. Through the survey, we also provide a necessary technical background with a description of suitable data sources, algorithms' descriptions, and corresponding metrics for their evaluation. The implementation of the provided techniques into routine workflows is a significant step toward the development of systems of continuous actualization of forest data, including real-time monitoring. It is crucial for diverse purposes on both local and global scales. Among the most important are the implementation of improved forest management strategies and actions, carbon offset projects, and enhancement of the prediction accuracy of system changes under different land-use and climate scenarios.

TI  - Comparison of PROSAIL Model Inversion Methods for Estimating Leaf Chlorophyll Content and LAI Using UAV Imagery for Hemp Phenotyping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing was used to estimate the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) of two hemp cultivars during two growing seasons under four nitrogen fertilisation levels. The hemp traits were estimated by the inversion of the PROSAIL model from UAV multispectral images. The look-up table (LUT) and hybrid regression inversion methods were compared. The hybrid methods performed better than LUT methods, both for LAI and LCC, and the best accuracies were achieved by random forest for the LAI (0.75 m(2) m(-2) of RMSE) and by Gaussian process regression for the LCC (9.69 mu g cm(-2) of RMSE). High-throughput phenotyping was carried out by applying a generalised additive model to the time series of traits estimated by the PROSAIL model. Through this approach, significant differences in LAI and LCC dynamics were observed between the two hemp cultivars and between different levels of nitrogen fertilisation.

TI  - Assessing the Added Value of Sentinel-1 PolSAR Data for Crop Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification is an important remote sensing task with many applications, e.g., food security monitoring, ecosystem service mapping, climate change impact assessment, etc. This work focuses on mapping 10 crop types at the field level in an agricultural region located in the Spanish province of Navarre. For this, multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Polarimetric (PolSAR) Sentinel-1 imagery and multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data were jointly used. We applied the Cloude-Pottier polarimetric decomposition on PolSAR data to compute 23 polarimetric indicators and extracted vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 time-series to generate a big feature space of 818 features. In order to assess the relevance of the different features for the crop mapping task, we run a number of scenarios using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. The model that was trained using only the polarimetric data demonstrates a very promising performance, achieving an overall accuracy over 82%. A genetic algorithm was also implemented as a feature selection method for deriving an optimal feature subset. To showcase the positive effect of using polarimetric data over areas suffering from cloud coverage, we contaminated the original Sentinel-2 time-series with simulated cloud masks. By incorporating the genetic algorithm, we derived a high informative feature subset of 120 optical and polarimetric features, as the corresponding classification model increased the overall accuracy by 5% compared to the model trained only with Sentinel-2 features. The feature importance analysis indicated that apart from the Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices, several polarimetric parameters, such as Shannon entropy, second eigenvalue and normalised Shannon entropy are of high value in identifying crops. In summary, the findings of our study highlight the significant contribution of Sentinel-1 PolSAR data in crop classification in areas with frequent cloud coverage and the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in discovering the most informative features.

TI  - FAPNET: Feature Fusion with Adaptive Patch for Flood-Water Detection and Monitoring
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In satellite remote sensing applications, waterbody segmentation plays an essential role in mapping and monitoring the dynamics of surface water. Satellite image segmentation-examining a relevant sensor data spectrum and identifying the regions of interests to obtain improved performance-is a fundamental step in satellite data analytics. Satellite image segmentation is challenging for a number of reasons, which include cloud interference, inadequate label data, low lighting and the presence of terrain. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), combined with (satellite captured) multispectral image segmentation techniques, have led to promising advances in related research. However, ensuring sufficient image resolution, maintaining class balance to achieve prediction quality and reducing the computational overhead of the deep neural architecture are still open to research due to the sophisticated CNN hierarchical architectures. To address these issues, we propose a number of methods: a multi-channel Data-Fusion Module (DFM), Neural Adaptive Patch (NAP) augmentation algorithm and re-weight class balancing (implemented in our PHR-CB experimental setup). We integrated these techniques into our novel Fusion Adaptive Patch Network (FAPNET). Our dataset is the Sentinel-1 SAR microwave signal, used in the Microsoft Artificial Intelligence for Earth competition, so that we can compare our results with the top scores in the competition. In order to validate our approach, we designed four experimental setups and in each setup, we compared our results with the popular image segmentation models UNET, VNET, DNCNN, UNET++, U2NET, ATTUNET, FPN and LINKNET. The comparisons demonstrate that our PHR-CB setup, with class balance, generates the best performance for all models in general and our FAPNET approach outperforms relative works. FAPNET successfully detected the salient features from the satellite images. FAPNET with a MeanIoU score of 87.06% outperforms the state-of-the-art UNET, which has a score of 79.54%. In addition, FAPNET has a shorter training time than other models, comparable to that of UNET (6.77 min for 5 epochs). Qualitative analysis also reveals that our FAPNET model successfully distinguishes micro waterbodies better than existing models. FAPNET is more robust to low lighting, cloud and weather fluctuations and can also be used in RGB images. Our proposed method is lightweight, computationally inexpensive, robust and simple to deploy in industrial applications. Our research findings show that flood-water mapping is more accurate when using SAR signals than RGB images. Our FAPNET architecture, having less parameters than UNET, can distinguish micro waterbodies accurately with shorter training time.

TI  - Temporal Subset SBAS InSAR Approach for Tropical Peatland Surface Deformation Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatland in Southeast Asia has undergone rapid degradation and shows large subsidence due to oxidation and peat shrinkage. The measurement of those deformations is thus valuable for evaluating the peat condition and assessing peat restoration. The time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TInSAR), especially with the small baseline subsets (SBAS) method, is capable of measuring long-term deformation. However, the dynamic surface scatterers often change in tropical peatland, which degrades the coherent scatterer (CS) distribution density. This article presents a simple and efficient TInSAR approach that enhances the CS density under such dynamic surface scatter variation based on the SBAS method. In the presented approach, a long-time series of single-look complex images is separated into subsets, and deformation estimation is performed for each subset. The effectiveness of this simple solution was investigated by InSAR simulation and validated using SAR observation data. We applied the subset SBAS approach to the three-year Sentinel-1A C-band SAR dataset acquired over tropical peatland in Indonesia. The analyses showed an improved number of CSs for the introduced subset approach. We further introduce the color representation of CS temporal behavior per subset for visual interpretation of scatterer change.

M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) provides a robust connection between hydrological cycles and surface energy balance. Accurate and near-daily ET estimation has utility in water resources, agricultural management applications, crop yields and drought monitoring. This study describes the implementation of an ET modeling system based on a Priestley-Taylor version of the Two-Source (soil and vegetation) Energy Balance Model (TSEB-PT) within Google Earth Engine environment. TSEB-PT performance was compared with the simpler single-source HSEB (Hybrid Surface Energy Balance) ET model to assess relative advantages and disadvantages for operational application. Results were evaluated across multiple biomes and climatic zones across the US, Europe, and Australia in comparison with eddy covariance data from 30 flux tower sites. Both models produced similar results when considering all biomes at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales. Daily ET metrics for all sites combined yielded comparable results for both models, with a slightly lower root-mean-square error for TSEB-PT (HSEB) of 1.2 (1.3) mm/d and a higher correlation (r) of 0.83 (0.80), but a larger mean percent bias error (MPBE = -9%) than HSEB (MPBE = 1%). TSEB-PT performance was lowest for sites in warm summer humid continental and hot semi-arid climates and in evergreen broadleaf forest cover, while HSEB showed lowest performance in tropical savanna hot semi-arid climates and in savanna covers. Model performance was improved for both cropland and non-cropland sites when TSEB-PT and HSEB ET estimates were combined through simple averaging due to cancellation of opposing errors, showing a promise as potential tools for water resource management on a global scale.

TI  - Generalization of Deep Learning in Digital Pathology: Experience in Breast Cancer Metastasis Detection
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Pathology is a cornerstone in cancer diagnostics, and digital pathology and artificial intelligence-driven image analysis could potentially save time and enhance diagnostic accuracy. For clinical implementation of artificial intelligence, a major question is whether the computer models maintain high performance when applied to new settings. We tested the generalizability of a highly accurate deep learning model for breast cancer metastasis detection in sentinel lymph nodes from, firstly, unseen sentinel node data and, secondly, data with a small change in surgical indication, in this case lymph nodes from axillary dissections. Model performance dropped in both settings, particularly on axillary dissection nodes. Retraining of the model was needed to mitigate the performance drop. The study highlights the generalization challenge of clinical implementation of AI models, and the possibility that retraining might be necessary. Poor generalizability is a major barrier to clinical implementation of artificial intelligence in digital pathology. The aim of this study was to test the generalizability of a pretrained deep learning model to a new diagnostic setting and to a small change in surgical indication. A deep learning model for breast cancer metastases detection in sentinel lymph nodes, trained on CAMELYON multicenter data, was used as a base model, and achieved an AUC of 0.969 (95% CI 0.926-0.998) and FROC of 0.838 (95% CI 0.757-0.913) on CAMELYON16 test data. On local sentinel node data, the base model performance dropped to AUC 0.929 (95% CI 0.800-0.998) and FROC 0.744 (95% CI 0.566-0.912). On data with a change in surgical indication (axillary dissections) the base model performance indicated an even larger drop with a FROC of 0.503 (95%CI 0.201-0.911). The model was retrained with addition of local data, resulting in about a 4% increase for both AUC and FROC for sentinel nodes, and an increase of 11% in AUC and 49% in FROC for axillary nodes. Pathologist qualitative evaluation of the retrained model ' s output showed no missed positive slides. False positives, false negatives and one previously undetected micro-metastasis were observed. The study highlights the generalization challenge even when using a multicenter trained model, and that a small change in indication can considerably impact the model ' s performance.

TI  - ALLAN PINKERTON: INFORMED SCOT OR SCOTTISH INFORMER?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCOTTISH HISTORICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Allan Pinkerton (1819-1884) has a conflicted legacy. To some, the founder of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency (PNDA) pioneered law and order on the American frontier, upheld principles of racial equality, and prepared the way for better public police forces including the FBI. To others, Pinkerton betrayed the values of his Scottish youth: he had been a champion of militant workers in Scotland, and participated in revolutionary uprisings in Wales and England, yet was instrumental in crushing organised labour in the United States. In truth, Pinkerton never played a part inWales' Newport uprising, and took with him, when he crossed the Atlantic in 1842, knowhow about repression that he had acquired on his native soil. He may have learned about informers because he was one of their victims, or he may have promoted labour espionage in Pennsylvania in the 1870s because he had been himself an informer before he emigrated. The Scottish authorities' deliberate abstinence from record-keeping and the serial, defensive destruction of PNDA records mean it is impossible to prove or disprove the informer hypothesis, but the role of the informer in Scottish political culture does help to explain Pinkerton's behaviour and apparent hypocrisy.

TI  - Monitoring Asbestos Mine Remediation Using Airborne Hyperspectral Imaging System: A Case Study of Jefferson Lake Mine, US
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated an asbestos mine restoration project using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral data. The distribution of an abandoned asbestos mine (AAM) and treatment area were analyzed before and after the remediation based on the spectral indices for detecting naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) indicators and encapsulation. The spectral indices were developed for NOA, host rock, and encapsulation by logistic regression models using spectral bands extracted from the random forest algorithm. The detection models mostly used VNIR spectra rather than SWIR and were statistically significant. The overall accuracy of the detection models was approximately 84%. Notably, the detection accuracy of non-treated and treated areas was increased to about 96%, excluding the host rock index. The NOA index detected asbestos in the mine area as well as those in outcrops outside of the mine. It has been confirmed that the NOA index can be efficiently applied to all cases of asbestos occurrence. The remote sensing data revealed that the mine area was increased by similar to 5% by the remediation, and the treatment activity reduced asbestos exposure by similar to 32%. Moreover, the integrative visualization between the detection results and 3D high-resolution images provided an intuitive and realistic understanding of the reclamation project.

TI  - US Embassy air-quality tweets led to global health benefits
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The World Health Organization estimates that over 90% of the world's population is exposed to hazardous levels of local air pollution. Air pollution is markedly worse in low- and middle-income countries, yet air-quality monitoring is typically sparse. In 2008, the US Embassy in Beijing began tweeting hourly air-quality information from a newly installed pollution monitor, dramatically improving the information on air quality available to Beijing residents. Since then, the United States has installed over 50 monitors around the world, tweeting real-time reports on air quality in those locations. Using spatially granular measurements of local air pollution from satellite data that span the globe, we employ variation in whether and when US embassies installedmonitors to evaluate the impact of air-quality information on pollution. We estimate that embassy monitors led to reductions in fine particulate concentration levels in host countries of 2 to 4 mu g/m(3). Our central estimate of the annual monetized benefit of the decrease in premature mortality due to this reduction in pollution is $127 million for the median city in 2019. Our findings point to the substantial benefits of improving the availability and salience of air-quality information in low- and middle-income countries.

TI  - Assessments of three evapotranspiration products over China using extended triple collocation and water balance methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an essential role in the water and energy balance between the surface and the atmosphere. Recent decades have witnessed the generation of various land evapotranspiration products. It is important to quantify their uncertainties, thus to identify which one exhibits the best performance. Therefore, to assess the performance of three popular ET products, namely the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA-interim), and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), across Chinese mainland on monthly scale, the rootmean-square error (RMSE) of each product was calculated at the basin scale using extended triple collocation (ETC) together with the water balance method. The results indicated that the RMSEs of GLEAM, ERA-interim and MODIS based on the ETC method (and water balance method) at the basin scale are 17.63 (12.04), 27.41 (22.90) and 40.55 (31.62) mm/month on average, while those at the grid scale are 8.47, 9.71 and 10.52 mm/month, respectively. This finding illustrates that GLEAM has the best performance (taking up similar to 60 %) in China, while MODIS performs the worst. In addition, it indicates that the ETC method is a potential tool for evaluating different products and estimating their uncertainty without knowing the true value.

TI  - Above-Ground Biomass Estimation for Coniferous Forests in Northern China Using Regression Kriging and Landsat 9 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is critical for assessing forest quality and carbon stocks, which can improve understanding of the vegetation growth processes and the global carbon cycle. Landsat 9, the latest launched Landsat satellite, is the successor and continuation of Landsat 8, providing a highly promising data resource for land cover change, forest surveys, and terrestrial ecosystem monitoring. Regression kriging was developed in the study to improve the AGB estimation and mapping using the Landsat 9 image in Wangyedian forest farm, northern China. Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF) were used as the original models to predict the AGB trends, and the optimal model was used to overlay the results of kriging interpolation based on the residuals to obtain the new AGB predictions. In addition, Landsat 8 images in Wangyedian were used for comparison and verification with Landsat 9. The results showed that all bands of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 maintained a high degree of uniformity, with positive correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.89 (p < 0.01). RF achieved the highest estimation accuracy among all the original models based on the two data sources. However, kriging regression can significantly reduce the estimation error, with the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 55.4% and 51.1%, for Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, respectively, compared to the original RF. Further, the R-2 and the lowest RMSE for Landsat 8 were 0.88 and 16.83 t/ha, while, for Landsat 9, they were 0.87 and 17.91 t/ha. The use of regression kriging combined with Landsat 9 imagery has great potential for achieving efficient and highly accurate forest AGB estimates, providing a new reference for long-term monitoring of forest resource dynamics.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of rooftop solar photovoltaic potential using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - ENERGY AND AI
M3  - Article
AB  - Rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) play increasing role in the global sustainable energy transition. This raises the challenge of accurate and high-resolution geospatial assessment of PV technical potential in policymaking and power system planning. To address the challenge, we propose a general framework that combines multi-resource satellite images and deep learning models to provide estimates of rooftop PV power generation. We apply deep learning based inversion model to estimate hourly solar radiation based on geostationary satellite images, and automatic segmentation model to extract building footprint from high-resolution satellite images. The framework enables precise survey of available rooftop resources and detailed simulation of power generation on an hourly basis with a spatial resolution of 100 m. The case study in Jiangsu Province demonstrates that the framework is applicable for large areas and scalable between precise locations and arbitrary regions across multiple temporal scales. Our estimates show that rooftop resources across the province have a potential installed capacity of 245.17 GW, corresponding to an annual power generation of 290.66 TWh. This highlights the huge space for carbon emissions reduction through developing rooftop PVs.

TI  - Estimation of Heat Released from Fire Based on Combustible Load in Inner Mongolian Grasslands
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The grasslands of Inner Mongolia are prone to wildfires, which can endanger the grassland ecosystem, as well as people's lives and property. The amount of heat released by grassland fires must be determined for the quantitative evaluation of grassland fires. On the basis of a field survey of combustible load and an indoor heat release experiment, together with the acquisition of NDVI and fire area data, this study evaluated the amount of combustible load, plant heat release, potential heat release, and fire-caused heat release in Inner Mongolia grasslands. The following results were obtained: (1) The models for determining Inner Mongolia's combustible load (Y) per unit area throughout the growing and nongrowing seasons were Y-i = 412.74NDVI(i)(1.5917) and Y-j = -7.21t(j) + Y-10 (i represents May-October of the growing season; j represents November-April of the following year). In the northern temperate zones, grasslands and meadows showed a decline in combustible load per unit area. The interannual combustible load variance increased between 2001 and 2016; (2) the per square meter average heat release of Stipa capillata, Cleistogenes squarrosa, Carex doniana, Leymus chinensis, and other plants was 0.51, 0.18, 0.17, 0.3, and 1.42 MJ/g, respectively. Unit weights were released at 2.13, 1.77, 2.06, 1.9, and 3.99 MJ/m(2); (3) from 2001 to 2016, Inner Mongolia's grassland fires predominantly occurred in northern temperate grasslands and meadows. Over the 16 year period, the total heat emission was 1.01 x 10(12) MJ, with variable decreasing trends noted in spring and fall. The main practical objectives of this paper were to provide basic data for fire spread modeling and suggest more scientific and effective fire management methods for the future.

TI  - Comparing Gaofen-5, Ground, and Huanjing-1A Spectra for the Monitoring of Soil Salinity with the BP Neural Network Improved by Particle Swarm Optimization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the world's saline soils are found in arid or semiarid areas, where salinization is becoming serious. Ground laboratory hyperspectral data (analytical spectral devices, ASD) as well as spaceborne hyperspectral data, including Gaofen-5 (GF-5) and Huanjing-1A (HJ-1A), provide convenient salinity monitoring. However, the difference among ASD, GF-5, and HJ-1A spectra in salinity monitoring remains unclear. So, we used ASD, GF-5, and HJ-1A spectra as data sources in Gaotai County of Hexi Corridor, which has been affected by salinization. For a more comprehensive comparison of the three spectra datum, four kinds of band screening methods, including Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), principal component analysis (PCA), successive projections algorithm (SPA), and random forest (RF) were used to reduce the dimension of hyperspectral data. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to improve the random initialization of weights and thresholds of the back propagation neural network (BPNN) model. The results showed that root mean square error (RMSE) and determination of the coefficients (R-2) of models based on ASD and HJ-1A spectra were basically similar. ASD spectra (RMSE = 4 mS center dot cm(-1), R-2 = 0.82) and HJ-1A (RMSE = 2.98 mS center dot cm(-1), R-2 = 0.93) performed better than GF-5 spectra (RMSE = 6.45 mS center dot cm(-1), R-2 = 0.67) in some cases. The good modelling result of HJ-1A and GF-5 data confirmed that spaceborne hyperspectral imagery has great potential in salinity mapping. Then, we used HJ-1A and GF-5 hyperspectral imagery to map soil salinity. The results of GF-5 and HJ-1A showed that extremely and highly saline soil mainly occurred in grassland and the southern part of arable land in Gaotai County. Other lands mainly featured non-saline and slightly saline soil. This can provide a reference for salinity monitoring research.

TI  - Fractional Vegetation Cover and Spatiotemporal Variations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region of China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) of China maintains high-pollution levels of particulate matter >= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). Accordingly, understanding the spatiotemporal distributions of PM2.5 and their relationship with fractional vegetation cover in this region is of great significance for effective air pollution treatment. In the present study, ground-based PM2.5 monitoring, MODIS-NDVI satellite data, spatial interpolation, dimidiate pixel model, and Spearman's rank correlation analyses were used to explore this relationship in the years 2018 and 2019. The results indicated the following: (1) In the BTH, the average annual PM2.5 mass concentration was 50 mu g center dot m(-3) in 2019, a 9.2% decrease from 2018, but still in excess of China's second-level environmental air quality standards (35 mu g center dot m(-3)). (2) PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH were temporally distributed, exhibiting a roughly U-shaped pattern within a year, peaking in the winter, followed by the spring and autumn, and reaching its minimum in the summer. (3) Spatially, distributions of PM2.5 mass concentrations in the BTH were significantly lower in the north and higher in the south. PM2.5 in the central and southern areas displayed concentrated and continuous distribution trends. (4) PM2.5 concentrations were negatively correlated with fractional vegetation cover in the BTH, and the effect of fractional vegetation cover on PM2.5 mass concentration was more significant in the winter than in other seasons. According to the results of this study, improving vegetation cover and increasing vegetation area have a positive effect on PM2.5 deposition in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Therefore, the author suggests that the ability of urban green spaces to mitigate PM2.5 pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region can be improved in the future by controlling the vegetation coverage of urban green spaces to a suitable extent, especially in winter. This study provides an important scientific basis for the quantitative analysis of the effect of vegetation cover on PM2.5 concentration distribution and air pollution control and environmental protection in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.

AB  - Forest fires cause damage to property and the environment around the world every year. North Korea has suffered from fires every year. Fires may lead to temporary or permanent damage to forest ecosystems, long-term site degradation, and alteration of hydrological regimes, producing detrimental impacts on economies, human health, and safety. In North Korea, fires cause serious damage to the affected mountainous environment. However, it is very difficult to obtain ground information or perform field checks because of the political isolation of North Korea. Thus, there are few studies that have investigated North Korean fires. In this situation, remote sensing techniques and digital topographic data can be used to investigate fire characteristics in North Korea. In this study, fire trends were analyzed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LPDAAC) from 2004 to 2015, and Landsat data were processed to estimate burned areas in South Hamgyong Province (SHP) and Gangwon Province (GWP) in North Korea. The burn severity of large fires in elevation, slope, and landform features was also analyzed to investigate large fire-burned areas using 30-m-resolution Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). After the results were compared and discussed, the following conclusions were derived. (1) In terms of location, fires in SHP were relatively concentrated along BaekDu-DaeGan (BDDG), while fires in GWP were scattered throughout the province. (2) In terms of size, the large fire-burned areas with an area greater than 1000 ha are significantly more frequent in SHP than in GWP. In brief, large fires occurred more frequently and were more serious in SHP than in GWP. (3) In terms of forest type, coniferous areas were more susceptible to damage from fires and large fires than deciduous areas in both GWP and SHP. This is attributed to the combustible resin within the coniferous trees. Particularly, when a crown fire occurs, it tends to spread rapidly throughout the coniferous forest. (4) Regarding landforms, most large fires occurred along windward-side open slopes, while there were very few fires in shallow valleys, high ridges, or U-shaped valleys. It is believed that cultivation in high-elevation terrain and a lack of fire-extinguishing equipment and systems allow large fires to spread quickly. North Korea is very susceptible to large fire damage and must develop preparation measures against such situations.

TI  - Characteristics of Summer Hailstorms Observed by Radar and Himawari-8 in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe hailstorms frequently occurred in Beijing between May and August 2021, leading to extensive hail damage. These hailstorms were observed by radar and satellite data, and reported by surface observers. In this study, the spectral and cloud microphysical characteristics of typical Beijing events in 2021 were analyzed using Himawari-8 satellite products and ground-based S-band weather radar data obtained from the Beijing Meteorological Bureau. The relationship between Himawari-8 brightness temperature differences (BTD) and radar reflectivity was also investigated. The results revealed that the significant spectral depression of brightness temperatures (BTs) in hail clouds was observed by a satellite. Furthermore, the stronger the radar reflectivity was, the more rapidly BTD decreased, with a nonlinear relationship between them. The results of cloud physical characteristics show that, for cloud-top heights above 10 km, the cloud effective radius was about 25 mu m, with a cloud-top temperature of 225 K during these hail events. By means of Gaussian fitting, the BT threshold value (11.2 mu m) was determined by satellite at 230 K, with a BTD focused on 1.9 K when hailstorms occurred. These results will help us better understand the characteristics of hailstorms, while also providing information for future hail suppression in Beijing.

TI  - An Advanced Data Fusion Method to Improve Wetland Classification Using Multi-Source Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this research was to improve wetland classification by fully exploiting multi-source remotely sensed data. Three distinct classifiers were designed to distinguish individual or compound wetland categories using random forest (RF) classification. They were determined, in part, to best use the available remotely sensed features in order to maximize that information and to maximize classification accuracy. The results from these classifiers were integrated according to Dempster-Shafer theory (D-S theory). The developed method was tested on data collected from a study area in Northern Alberta, Canada. The data utilized were Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (multi-spectral), Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar-SAR), and digital elevation model (DEM). Classification of fen, bog, marsh, swamps, and upland resulted in an overall accuracy of 0.93 using the proposed methodology, an improvement of 5% when compared to a traditional classification method based on the aggregated features from these data sources. It was noted that, with the traditional method, some pixels were misclassified with a high level of confidence (>85%). Such misclassification was significantly reduced (by similar to 10%) by the proposed method. Results also showed that some features important in separating compound wetland classes were not considered important using the traditional method based on the RF feature selection mechanism. When used in the proposed method, these features increased the classification accuracy, which demonstrated that the proposed method provided an effective means to fully employ available data to improve wetland classification.

TI  - Forest Biodiversity Monitoring Based on Remotely Sensed Spectral Diversity-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Forests are essential for global environmental well-being because of their rich provision of ecosystem services and regulating factors. Global forests are under increasing pressure from climate change, resource extraction, and anthropologically-driven disturbances. The results are dramatic losses of habitats accompanied with the reduction of species diversity. There is the urgent need for forest biodiversity monitoring comprising analysis on alpha, beta, and gamma scale to identify hotspots of biodiversity. Remote sensing enables large-scale monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Concepts of remotely sensed spectral diversity have been identified as promising methodologies for the consistent and multi-temporal analysis of forest biodiversity. This review provides a first time focus on the three spectral diversity concepts "vegetation indices", "spectral information content", and "spectral species" for forest biodiversity monitoring based on airborne and spaceborne remote sensing. In addition, the reviewed articles are analyzed regarding the spatiotemporal distribution, remote sensing sensors, temporal scales and thematic foci. We identify multispectral sensors as primary data source which underlines the focus on optical diversity as a proxy for forest biodiversity. Moreover, there is a general conceptual focus on the analysis of spectral information content. In recent years, the spectral species concept has raised attention and has been applied to Sentinel-2 and MODIS data for the analysis from local spectral species to global spectral communities. Novel remote sensing processing capacities and the provision of complementary remote sensing data sets offer great potentials for large-scale biodiversity monitoring in the future.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Method for Classification of Sugarcane Varieties
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of sugarcane varieties using products derived from remote sensing allows for the monitoring of plants with different profiles without necessarily having physical contact with the study objects. However, differentiating between varieties can be challenging due to the similarity of the spectral characteristics of each crop. Thus, this study aimed to classify four sugarcane varieties through deep neural networks, subsequently comparing the results with traditional machine learning techniques. In order to provide more data as input for the classification models, along with the multi-band values of the pixels and vegetation indices, other information can be obtained from the sensor bands through RGB combinations by reconciling different bands so as to yield the characteristics of crop varieties. The methodology created to discriminate sugarcane varieties consisted of a dense neural network, with the number of hidden layers determined by the greedy layer-wise method and multiples of four neurons in each layer; additionally, a 5-fold evaluation in the training data was composed of Sentinel-2 band data, vegetation indices, and RGB combinations. Comparing the results acquired from each model with the hyperparameters selected by Bayesian optimisation, except for the neural network with manually defined parameters, it was possible to observe a greater precision of 99.55% in the SVM model, followed by the neural network developed by the study, random forests, and kNN. However, the final neural network model prediction resulted in the 99.48% accuracy of a six-hidden-layers network, demonstrating the potential of using neural networks in classification. Among the characteristics that contributed the most to the classification, the chlorophyll-sensitive bands, especially B6, B7, B11, and some RGB combinations, had the most impact on the correct classification of samples by the neural network model. Thus, the regions encompassing the near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions proved to be suitable for the discrimination of sugarcane varieties.

TI  - Landsat 9 Cross Calibration Under-Fly of Landsat 8: Planning, and Execution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the early post-launch phase of the Landsat 9 mission, the Landsat 8 and 9 mission teams conducted a successful under-fly of Landsat 8 by Landsat 9, allowing for the near-simultaneous data collection of common Earth targets by the on-board sensors for cross-calibration. This effort, coordinated by the Landsat Calibration and Validation team, required contributions from various entities across National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Geological Survey such as Flight Dynamics, Systems, Mission Planning, and Flight Operations teams, beginning about 18 months prior to launch. Plans existed to allow this under-fly for any possible launch date of Landsat 9. This included 16 ascent plans and 16 data acquisition plans, one for every day of the Landsat orbital repeat period, with a minimum of 5 days of useful coverage overlap between the sensors. After the Landsat 9 launch, the plan executed, and led to the acquisition of over 2000 partial to full overlapping scene pairs. Although containing less than the expected number of scenes, this dataset was larger than previous Landsat mission under-fly efforts and more than sufficient for performing cross-calibration of the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 sensors. The details of the planning process and execution of this under-fly are presented.

TI  - ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IN PREPARING FUTURE MATHEMATICS TEACHERS
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The disparate study of certain areas and branches of knowledge, characteristic of the disciplinary approach, has largely lost its position, recognising the inev- itability of interdisciplinary cooperation. At present, interdisciplinarity is already being com- prehended at a new level, creating the prerequisites for the introduction of a transdisciplinary approach to solving complex problems, including in the educational sphere. Aim. The current research aims to present the transdisciplinary teaching means, which are relevant in the process of training future teachers of mathematics, and which are identified on the basis of an analysis of the content of education. Methodology and research methods. General scientific and empirical methods were used to develop the ideological basis of the study. The aforementioned methods allowed the authors to draw up a complete picture of the problem under study, to identify its patterns and trends, to understand the essence. The search and selection of mathematics subject content with trans -disciplinary properties was based on a systematic and interdisciplinary approach. At the stage of testing the research hypothesis, the competency-based approach was decisive, and tactical tasks were solved by referring to the activity approach. In addition, the main provisions of the concepts of humanisation and humanitarisation of education, as well as the principles of fun- damentalisation of mathematical education, were taken into account. Results and theoretical significance. The expediency of using inequalities and convex functions in the training of future mathematics teachers in the context of a transdisciplinary approach is substantiated. A phased description of the work carried out allows us to trace the methods of reflecting the modern scientific content of the relevant topics, conditions, means and expected results of pedagogical interaction. The theory and methods of teaching mathematics at the university are enriched with a qualitatively new vision of the educational potential of the concepts of inequality and a convex function. Practical significance. The introduction of inequalities and convex functions in the pro-cess of future mathematics teachers training at Vyatka State University made it possible to demonstrate the possibilities of a transdisciplinary approach in the development of students' worldview and the formation of professionally significant students' competencies. The present-ed means of implementing the transdisciplinary approach can also be comprehended in teach-ing students of other areas of training.

TI  - Spatial autocorrelation based on remote sensing data in monitoring of Norway spruce dieback caused by the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus L. in the Bia?owie?a Forest
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial patterns of tree mortality are important factors in the analysis of forest health and sustain- able forest management. This study presents the use of spatial autocorrelation techniques in monitoring forest insect outbreaks using individual trees in a 100x100 m resolution grid based on data from 2015 and 2019. The study area was the Hajnowka Forest District (Hajnowka FD) in the Bialowieza Forest (BF) in Poland which had an intense bark beetle outbreak from 2015- -2019 that killed 38% of all living spruce trees in the upper layer of the stands. The development of a suitable methodology using spatial statistics tools, in particular spatial autocorrelation, allowed the following: (a) describe and compare the spatial structure of the data, (b) assess the magnitude and spatial distribution of the spruce dieback phenomenon in the first and last years of the study, (c) identify the distances at which clustering was most significant for the severity of spruce dieback and show how the size of clusters within a data set varied over the years, (d) to perform a typo- logical classification of the study area according to specific spatial types which identify clusters with a highest intensity of the phenomenon (hot spots), areas with bark beetle-resistant stands (cold spots), and spatial outliers, and (e) to produce a map of spruce mortality local clusters. The methods and results presented in this study serve as baseline information in supporting the efforts to model the spread of bark beetle dynamics for future decision-making.

TI  - An All-Sky Scattering Index Derived from Microwave Sounding Data at Dual Oxygen Absorption Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining the temperature sounding channels near 118 GHz onboard Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) with channels near 50 GHz makes it possible to obtain the spatial and vertical distributions of the clouds through a cloud emission and scattering index (CESI). Previous research has shown its advantages in cloud detection over oceans. In this study, the CESI method is expanded and validated under different surface conditions, and angular corrections are conducted to remove the effect of viewing angles. The landfall process of Typhoon MANGKHUT and a case over special terrain are chosen to investigate its sensitivities to different surface types. It is found that the cloud spatial distribution is well demonstrated in both of the cases. Moreover, the CESI vertical distributions are compared with the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) hydrometeor profiles. The results show that CESIs are highly related to the GPM hydrometeor profiles in all of the conditions, and the correlations with the sea surface vary with the weighting functions of the matched channels, while the phenomenon is not obvious for the land surface. In addition, the validation results show that the new threshold combination for different surface types at different heights can be more effective for cloud identification. The probability density distribution for most of the channels of the screened-out clear sky data approximates a Gaussian distribution well, and these radiances can be well assimilated into the numerical weather prediction models.

TI  - On the Evaluation of the SAR-Based Copernicus Snow Products in the French Alps
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We perform a first evaluation of the Copernicus pan-European wet snow products in mountainous terrain in the French Alps. Mountains are very challenging due to the complexity of the terrain and the multiple interactions between soil, snow and atmosphere that can impact the snowpack state. We focused on the evaluation of the Sentinel-1 derived SAR Wet Snow (SWS) product with the use of Sentinel-2 derived Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) products for the evaluation during wet snow periods. Comparisons were also made with snowpack reanalyses from the Crocus model. We showed that melt lines computed from the SWS product at the scale of massifs show realistic variations in elevation, orientation and season supported by comparisons with some snow variables as simulated by the Crocus model. We developed a new score, which is particularly suitable for mountain products and allows a very useful comparison of satellite products of different ground resolutions. We show that for melting periods, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 snow cover probability curves calculated at the scale of a mountain range are very close for altitudes below 2000 m with RMS errors lower than 0.2. We also illustrate how the generated probability curves can be used to infer highly relevant information on the extent of snow by altitude and on its melting process evolution by connecting information from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 (taking into account morning and evening orbits).

TI  - High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping (HTPP) in Resource-Constrained Research Programs: A Working Example in Ghana
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a procedure for implementing field-based high-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) that can be used in resource-constrained research programs. The procedure relies on opensource tools with the only expensive item being one-off purchase of a drone. It includes acquiring images of the field of interest, stitching the images to get the entire field in one image, calculating and extracting the vegetation indices of the individual plots, and analyzing the extracted indices according to the experimental design. Two populations of groundnut genotypes with different maturities were evaluated for their reaction to early and late leaf spot (ELS, LLS) diseases under field conditions in 2020 and 2021. Each population was made up of 12 genotypes in 2020 and 18 genotypes in 2021. Evaluation of the genotypes was done in four locations in each year. We observed a strong correlation between the vegetation indices and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) for ELS and LLS. However, the strength and direction of the correlation depended upon the time of disease onset, level of tolerance among the genotypes and the physiological traits the vegetation indices were associated with. In 2020, when the disease was observed to have set in late in medium duration population, at the beginning of the seed stage (R5), normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI) and variable atmospheric resistance index (VARI) derived at the beginning pod stage (R3) had a positive relationship with the AUDPC for ELS, and LLS. On the other hand, NGRDI and VARI derived from images taken at R5, and physiological maturity (R7) had negative relationships with AUDPC for ELS, and LLS. In 2021, when the disease was observed to have set in early (at R3) also in medium duration population, a negative relationship was observed between NGRDI and VARI and AUDPC for ELS and LLS, respectively. We found consistently negative relationships of NGRDI and VARI with AUDPC for ELS and LLS, respectively, within the short duration population in both years. Canopy cover (CaC), green area (GA), and greener area (GGA) only showed negative relationships with AUDPC for ELS and LLS when the disease caused yellowing and defoliation. The rankings of some genotypes changed for NGRDI, VARI, CaC, GA, GGA, and crop senescence index (CSI) when lesions caused by the infections of ELS and LLS became severe, although that did not affect groupings of genotypes when analyzed with principal component analysis. Notwithstanding, genotypes that consistently performed well across various reproductive stages with respect to the vegetation indices constituted the top performers when ELS, LLS, haulm, and pod yields were jointly considered.

TI  - A fuzzy logic framework to handle uncertainty in remote sensing-based hydrological data for water budget improvement across mid- and small-scale basins
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the efficacy of remote sensing (RS) products for water budget (WB) analysis has been widely tested and implemented in global and regional basins. Although RS products provide high temporal and spatial resolution images with near-global coverage, uncertainty is still a significant problem. Fuzzy logic is a powerful technique for dealing with uncertainty in different engineering problems. In this study, the annual residual error (r$$ r $$) in the WB equation arising from the uncertainties of the RS products was minimized by applying fuzzy correction coefficients to each WB component. For analysis, three different fuzzy linear regression (FLR) models with 14 different sub-models were used in the two basins having different spatial characteristics, namely Sakarya and Cyprus basins. Although FLR sub-models produce similar findings in the Sakarya basin, they generated more complex results in the Cyprus basin. This is mainly due to the higher uncertainty of the RS products in the Cyprus basin. The Cyprus basin is too small for some low-resolution RS-based products to resolve, and it has a higher leakage error due to across ocean/land boundary. In addition, the general performance of sub-models is better in the Sakarya basin than that in the Cyprus basin. The best fuzzy sub-models reduced the error up to 68% and 52% in terms of mean absolute error compared with the non-fuzzy model in the Sakarya and Cyprus basins, respectively. Further evaluations showed that the best sub-model precipitation well captured the temporal patterns of gauge observations in both basins. Moreover, they have the best consistency with gauge observations in terms of root mean square error, Kling-Gupta efficiency, and percent bias in both basins. The results proved that this study will provide valuable insights into WB analysis in ungauged basins by incorporating the fuzzy logic approach into hydrological RS products.

AB  - The field of remote sensing has undergone a remarkable shift where vast amounts of imagery are now readily available to researchers. New technologies, such as uncrewed aircraft systems, make it possible for anyone with a moderate budget to gather their own remotely sensed data, and methodological innovations have added flexibility for processing and analyzing data. These changes create both the opportunity and need to reproduce, replicate, and compare remote sensing methods and results across spatial contexts, measurement systems, and computational infrastructures. Reproducing and replicating research is key to understanding the credibility of studies and extending recent advances into new discoveries. However, reproducibility and replicability (R&R) remain issues in remote sensing because many studies cannot be independently recreated and validated. Enhancing the R&R of remote sensing research will require significant time and effort by the research community. However, making remote sensing research reproducible and replicable does not need to be a burden. In this paper, we discuss R&R in the context of remote sensing and link the recent changes in the field to key barriers hindering R&R while discussing how researchers can overcome those barriers. We argue for the development of two research streams in the field: (1) the coordinated execution of organized sequences of forward-looking replications, and (2) the introduction of benchmark datasets that can be used to test the replicability of results and methods.

TI  - Critical Climate Periods Explain a Large Fraction of the Observed Variability in Vegetation State
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that a major part of the observed variability in vegetation state might be associated with variability in climatic drivers during relatively short periods within the year. Identification of such critical climate periods, when a particular climate variable most likely has a pronounced influence on the vegetation state of a particular ecosystem, becomes increasingly important in the light of climate change. In this study, we present a method to identify critical climate periods for eight different semi-natural ecosystem categories in Hungary, in Central Europe. The analysis was based on the moving-window correlation between MODIS NDVI/LAI and six climate variables with different time lags during the period 2000-2020. Distinct differences between the important climate variables, critical period lengths, and direction (positive or negative correlations) have been found for different ecosystem categories. Multiple linear models for NDVI and LAI were constructed to quantify the multivariate influence of the environmental conditions on the vegetation state during the late summer. For grasslands, the best models for NDVI explained 65-87% variance, while for broad-leaved forests, the highest explained variance for LAI was up to 50%. The proposed method can be easily implemented in other geographical locations and can provide essential insight into the functioning of different ecosystem types.

TI  - The MosHouse® Trap: Evaluation of the Efficiency in Trapping Sterile <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Males in Semi-Field Conditions
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arbovirus diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, are important public health problems. Controlling the major vector, Aedes aegypti, is the only approach to suppressing these diseases. The surveillance of this mosquito species needs effective collecting methods. In this study, a simple MosHouse sticky trap was evaluated in a semi-field condition. Our results demonstrated the efficiency of this trap in collecting Ae. aegypti males, and no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the numbers of males was detected when compared with the widely used BG- Sentinel trap. However, there were significantly lower numbers of females (p < 0.05) collected using the MosHouse trap when compared to the BG-Sentinel trap. We also found a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the collected numbers between irradiated and non-irradiated males. More irradiated males were collected in the MosHouse traps. The improvement of male collection was achieved with the addition of a sugar stick and sticky flags. Significantly higher numbers of males were collected in the MosHouse trap with sticky flags compared to the original one when they were released independently of females, but both were collected in higher numbers when they were released together (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our experiments demonstrated that the MosHouse trap could sample Ae. aegypti, especially males, as efficiently as the established BG-Sentinel trap, while the cost was more than 50 times lower, showing the potential of the MosHouse trap for improved Ae. aegypti male and female surveillance with very large numbers of traps at affordable costs. In addition, significantly (p < 0.001) increased male sampling was achieved by adding an external sticky flag on the MosHouse trap, providing an avenue for further development of the novel male-trapping strategy.
