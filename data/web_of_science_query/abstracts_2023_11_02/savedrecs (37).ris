TI  - Spatial Downscaling of MODIS Snow Cover Observations Using Sentinel-2 Snow Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding those processes in which snow dynamics has a significant influence requires long-term and high spatio-temporal resolution observations. While new optical space-borne sensors overcome many previous snow cover monitoring limitations, their short temporal length limits their application in climatological studies. This work describes and evaluates a probabilistic spatial downscaling of MODIS snow cover observations in mountain areas. The approach takes advantage of the already available high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 snow observations to obtain a snow probability occurrence, which is then used to determine the snow-covered areas inside partially snow-covered MODIS pixels. The methodology is supported by one main hypothesis: the snow distribution is strongly controlled by the topographic characteristics and this control has a high interannual persistence. Two approaches are proposed to increase the 500 m resolution MODIS snow cover observations to the 20 m grid resolution of Sentinel-2. The first of these computes the probability inside partially snow-covered MODIS pixels by determining the snow occurrence frequency for the 20 m Sentinel-2 pixels when clear-sky conditions occurred for both platforms. The second approach determines the snow probability occurrence for each Sentinel-2 pixel by computing the number of days in which snow was observed on each grid cell and then dividing it by the total number of clear-sky days per grid cell. The methodology was evaluated in three mountain areas in the Iberian Peninsula from 2015 to 2021. The 20 m resolution snow cover maps derived from the two probabilistic methods provide better results than those obtained with MODIS images downscaled to 20 m with a nearest-neighbor method in the three test sites, but the first provides superior performance. The evaluation showed that mean kappa values were at least 10% better for the two probabilistic methods, improving the scores in one of these sites by 25%. In addition, as the Sentinel-2 dataset becomes longer in time, the probabilistic approaches will become more robust, especially in areas where frequent cloud cover resulted in lower accuracy estimates.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Dust Fusion Model for Integration of MODIS and WRF-Chem
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are common meteorological events appearing in arid and semi-arid regions. Various methods have been developed to calculate aerosol optical depth (AOD) in dust storms studies. The AOD data obtained either from remote sensing measurements or numerical models have their own specific limitations and advantages. In this study, in order to benefit from the advantages of both types of AOD data and generate a fused AOD product with higher spatial and temporal resolutions, the Spatial-Temporal Dust Fusion Model (STDFM) was developed to integrate remote sensing data on AOD and numerical model AOD via simultaneous enhancing of spatial and temporal resolutions from 15 to 3 kilometers and from one day to one hour, respectively. The remote sensing AOD data from MODIS and numerical modeling of AOD from WRF model from 16-20 June, 2012 for the geographical region of Iran were used to verify the applicability and assess the accuracy of the STDFM. An average correlation coefficient of 0.64 was measured between the STDFM-fused AOD and the AOD data retrieved from ground-based visibility. The results affirmed the high accuracy of STDFM in obtaining fused AOD with higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

TI  - Data-Driven Inference of the Mechanics of Slip Along Glacier Beds Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Case Study on Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable projections of sea-level rise depend on accurate representations of how fast-flowing glaciers slip along their beds. The mechanics of slip are often parameterized as a constitutive relation (or "sliding law") whose proper form remains uncertain. Here, we present a novel deep learning-based framework for learning the time evolution of drag at glacier beds from time-dependent ice velocity and elevation observations. We use a feedforward neural network, informed by the governing equations of ice flow, to infer spatially and temporally varying basal drag and associated uncertainties from data. We test the framework on 1D and 2D ice flow simulation outputs and demonstrate the recovery of the underlying basal mechanics under various levels of observational and modeling uncertainties. We apply this framework to time-dependent velocity data for Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica, and present evidence that ocean-tide-driven changes in subglacial water pressure drive changes in ice flow over the tidal cycle.Plain Language Summary The relation between slip of glaciers along their beds and the level of basal drag at the ice-bed interface is a critical component of ice dynamics for fast-flowing glaciers and ice streams. However, uncertainty surrounding the proper form of this relation, often referred to as the sliding law, has hindered efforts to reliably project the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to future sea-level rise. Here, we utilize the tools of physics-informed deep learning to learn the evolution of drag at glacier beds from time-dependent ice velocity and elevation observations. By training a neural network with both data reconstruction losses and ice physics-based losses, we are able to reconstruct the evolution of drag for glaciers and ice streams undergoing changes in flow speed and surface elevations. Thus, we can investigate the relation between slip and basal drag without specifying the form of the sliding law. We use this approach to present observational evidence that ocean-tide-driven changes in flow speed for Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica are driven by changes in subglacial water pressure. Ultimately, this approach provides a natural way to integrate our existing knowledge of ice flow physics with remote sensing data in order to improve flow models.

TI  - Emergency Medical Services and Syndromic Surveillance: A Comparison With Traditional Surveillance and Effects on Timeliness
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Traditional public health surveillance of nonfatal opioid overdose relies on emergency department (ED) billing data, which can be delayed substantially. We compared the timeliness of 2 new data sources for rapid drug overdose surveillance-emergency medical services (EMS) and syndromic surveillance-with ED billing data.Methods: We used data on nonfatal opioid overdoses in Kentucky captured in EMS, syndromic surveillance, and ED billing systems during 2018-2019. We evaluated the time-series relationships between EMS and ED billing data and syndromic surveillance and ED billing data by calculating cross-correlation functions, controlling for influences of autocorrelations. A case example demonstrates the usefulness of EMS and syndromic surveillance data to monitor rapid changes in opioid overdose encounters in Kentucky during the COVID-19 epidemic.Results: EMS and syndromic surveillance data showed moderate-to-strong correlation with ED billing data on a lag of 0 (r = 0.694; 95% CI, 0.579-0.782; t = 9.73; df = 101; P < .001; and r = 0.656; 95% CI, 0.530-0.754; t = 8.73; df = 101; P < .001; respectively) at the week-aggregated level. After the COVID-19 emergency declaration, EMS and syndromic surveillance time series had steep increases in April and May 2020, followed by declines from June through September 2020. The ED billing data were available for analysis 3 months after the end of a calendar quarter but closely followed the trends identified by the EMS and syndromic surveillance data.Conclusion: Data from EMS and syndromic surveillance systems can be reliably used to monitor nonfatal opioid overdose trends in Kentucky in near-real time to inform timely public health response.

TI  - Robust Damage Estimation of Typhoon Goni on Coconut Crops with Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon Goni crossed several provinces in the Philippines where agriculture has high socioeconomic importance, including the top-3 provinces in terms of planted coconut trees. We have used a computational model to infer coconut tree density from satellite images before and after the typhoon's passage, and in this way estimate the number of damaged trees. Our area of study around the typhoon's path covers 15.7 Mha, and includes 47 of the 87 provinces in the Philippines. In validation areas our model predicts coconut tree density with a Mean Absolute Error of 5.9 Trees/ha. In Camarines Sur we estimated that 3.5 M of the 4.6 M existing coconut trees were damaged by the typhoon. Overall we estimated that 14.1 M coconut trees were affected by the typhoon inside our area of study. Our validation images confirm that trees are rarely uprooted and damages are largely due to reduced canopy cover of standing trees. On validation areas, our model was able to detect affected coconut trees with 88.6% accuracy, 75% precision and 90% recall. Our method delivers spatially fine-grained change maps for coconut plantations in the area of study, including unchanged, damaged and new trees. Beyond immediate damage assessment, gradual changes in coconut density may serve as a proxy for future changes in yield.

TI  - Greater Compliance With Early Sepsis Management is Associated With Safer Care and Shorter Hospital Stay
T2  - JOURNAL FOR HEALTHCARE QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This retrospective, cross-sectional study of U.S. hospitals in Medicare's Inpatient Quality Reporting Program aimed to determine whether variation in Sepsis/Septic Shock (Bundle SEP-1) compliance is linked to hospital size and measures of safety and operational efficiency. Two thousand six hundred and fifty-three acute care hospitals in Medicare's Hospital Compare online database were included in the study. Relationships between SEP-1 bundle compliance, hospital size, and indices of operational excellence (including Patient Safety Index [PSI-90], average length of stay [ALOS] and readmission rate) were analyzed. SEP-1 compliance score was inversely associated with staffed bed number (r = -.14, p < .001), PSI-90 (r = -.01, p < .001), and ALOS (r = -.13, p < .001) in a multivariate analysis. Hospitals in the lowest versus highest quartile by bed number had SEP-1 compliance score of 49.8 +/- 20.2% versus 46.9 +/- 16.8%, p < .001. Hospitals in the lowest versus highest quartile for SEP-1 score had an ALOS of 5.0 +/- 1.2 days versus 4.7 +/- 1.1 days and PSI-90 rate of 1.03 +/- 0.22 versus 0.98 +/- 0.16, p < .001 for both. Although this does not establish a causal relationship, it supports the hypothesis that the ability of hospitals to successfully implement SEP-1 is associated with superior performance in key measures of operational excellence.

TI  - How Much Shallow Coral Habitat Is There on the Great Barrier Reef?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a globally unique and precious national resource; however, the geomorphic and benthic composition and the extent of coral habitat per reef are greatly understudied. However, this is critical to understand the spatial extent of disturbance impacts and recovery potential. This study characterizes and quantifies coral habitat based on depth, geomorphic and benthic composition maps of more than 2164 shallow offshore GBR reefs. The mapping approach combined a Sentinel-2 satellite surface reflectance image mosaic and derived depth, wave climate, reef slope and field data in a random-forest machine learning and object-based protocol. Area calculations, for the first time, incorporated the 3D characteristic of the reef surface above 20 m. Geomorphic zonation maps (0-20 m) provided a reef extent estimate of 28,261 km(2) (a 31% increase to current estimates), while benthic composition maps (0-10 m) estimated that ~10,600 km(2) of reef area (~57% of shallow offshore reef area) was covered by hard substrate suitable for coral growth, the first estimate of potential coral habitat based on substrate availability. Our high-resolution maps provide valuable information for future monitoring and ecological modeling studies and constitute key tools for supporting the management, conservation and restoration efforts of the GBR.

TI  - Simplified and Hybrid Remote Sensing-Based Delineation of Management Zones for Nitrogen Variable Rate Application in Wheat
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancing digital and precision agriculture is currently inevitable to overcome the economic and environmental challenges of the agriculture in the 21st century. The purpose of this study was to generate and compare management zones (MZ) based on the Sentinel-2 satellite data for variable rate application of mineral nitrogen in wheat production, calculated using different remote sensing (RS)-based models under varied soil, yield and crop data availability. Three models were applied, including (1) a modified "RS- and threshold-based clustering ", (2) a "hybrid-based, unsupervised clustering ", in which data from different sources were combined for MZ delineation, and (3) a "RS-based, unsupervised clustering ". Various data processing methods including machine learning were used in the model development. Statistical tests such as the Paired Sample T-test, Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were applied to evaluate the final delineated MZ maps. Additionally, a procedure for improving models based on information about phenological phases and the occurrence of agricultural drought was implemented. The results showed that information on agronomy and climate enables improving and optimizing MZ delineation. The integration of prior knowledge on new climate conditions (drought) in image selection was tested for effective use of the models. Lack of this information led to the infeasibility of obtaining optimal results. Models that solely rely on remote sensing information are comparatively less expensive than hybrid models. Additionally, remote sensing-based models enable delineating MZ for fertilizer recommendations that are temporally closer to fertilization times.

TI  - A Preliminary Global Automatic Burned-Area Algorithm at Medium Resolution in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A preliminary version of a global automatic burned-area (BA) algorithm at medium spatial resolution was developed in Google Earth Engine (GEE), based on Landsat or Sentinel-2 reflectance images. The algorithm involves two main steps: initial burned candidates are identified by analyzing spectral changes around MODIS hotspots, and those candidates are then used to estimate the burn probability for each scene. The burning dates are identified by analyzing the temporal evolution of burn probabilities. The algorithm was processed, and its quality assessed globally using reference data from 2019 derived from Sentinel-2 data at 10 m, which involved 369 pairs of consecutive images in total located in 50 20 x 20 km(2) areas selected by stratified random sampling. Commissions were around 10% with both satellites, although omissions ranged between 27 (Sentinel-2) and 35% (Landsat), depending on the selected resolution and dataset, with highest omissions being in croplands and forests; for their part, BA from Sentinel-2 data at 20 m were the most accurate and fastest to process. In addition, three 5 x 5 degree regions were randomly selected from the biomes where most fires occur, and BA were detected from Sentinel-2 images at 20 m. Comparison with global products at coarse resolution FireCCI51 and MCD64A1 would seem to show to a reliable extent that the algorithm is procuring spatially and temporally coherent results, improving detection of smaller fires as a consequence of higher-spatial-resolution data. The proposed automatic algorithm has shown the potential to map BA globally using medium-spatial-resolution data (Sentinel-2 and Landsat) from 2000 onwards, when MODIS satellites were launched.

TI  - The Isolation of Culturable Bacteria in <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> Ticks of a Belgian Peri-Urban Forest Uncovers Opportunistic Bacteria Potentially Important for Public Health
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Most bacteria found in ticks are not pathogenic to humans but coexist as endosymbionts and may have effects on tick fitness and pathogen transmission. In this study, we cultured and isolated 78 bacteria from 954 Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in 7 sites of a Belgian peri-urban forest. Most isolated species were non-pathogenic environmental microorganisms, and were from the Firmicutes (69.23%), Actinobacteria (17.95%) and Proteobacteria (3.84%) phyla. One bacterium isolate was particularly noteworthy, Cedecea davisae, a rare opportunistic bacterium, naturally resistant to various antibiotics. It has never been isolated from ticks before and this isolated strain was resistant to ampicillin, cefoxitin and colistin. Although cultivable bacteria do not represent the complete tick microbiota, the sites presented variable bacterial compositions and diversities. This study is a first attempt to describe the culturable microbiota of ticks collected in Belgium. Further collections and analyses of ticks of different species, from various areas and using other bacterial identification methods would strengthen these results. However, they highlight the importance of ticks as potential sentinel for opportunistic bacteria of public health importance.

TI  - Prediction of Wheat Stripe Rust Occurrence with Time Series Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat stripe rust has a severe impact on wheat yield and quality. An effective prediction method is necessary for food security. In this study, we extract the optimal vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to stripe rust at different time-periods, and develop a wheat stripe rust prediction model with satellite images to realize the multi-temporal prediction. First, VIs related to stripe rust stress are extracted as candidate features for disease prediction from time series Sentinel-2 images. Then, the optimal VI combinations are selected using sequential forward selection (SFS). Finally, the occurrence of wheat stripe rust in different time-periods is predicted using the support vector machine (SVM) method. The results of the features selected demonstrate that, before the jointing period, the optimal VIs are related to the biomass, pigment, and moisture of wheat. After the jointing period, the red-edge VIs related to the crop health status play important roles. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the prediction model, which is based on SVM, is generally higher than those of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) methods. The SVM method is more suitable for time series predictions of wheat stripe rust. The model obtained accuracy based on the optimal VI combinations and the SVM increased over time; the highest accuracy was 86.2%. These results indicate that the prediction model can provide guidance and suggestions for early disease prevention of the study site, and the method combines time series Sentinel-2 images and the SVM, which can be used to predict wheat stripe rust.

TI  - "Our Party Is Science": On the Causes and Consequences of the Party's Interference in Agricultural Science in the Soviet Union
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Through the prism of the historical and anthropological approach, which presupposes the important role of ideological and worldview factors in the life of society, the article examines the reasons for party interference in agricultural scientific knowledge and analyzes its consequences. Initially, this interference was caused by the ideas existing in society about the relationship between biological and social processes, which led to the party structures' support of scientists who defended the decisive influence of the external environment on the formation of heredity of crops and animals. These ideas were considered as an additional justification for the possibility of social transformation on socialist grounds, provided that the social basis changes and the individualistic psychology in people's minds is overcome. However, the precedent of "ideological" interference in agricultural science served as the basis for further steps in this direction and on problems that did not have a political and ideological "sound". Party interference in the field of agricultural scientific knowledge manifested itself in the authorization of certain developments, in the initiation of "projects" that subsequently received "scientific" substantiation, in the bureaucratization of the implementation of the most important scientific and production programs, as happened with the program for the development of virgin and fallow lands. At the same time, the ideological factor gradually lost its significance, and a utilitarian approach was established in the party's attitude to agricultural science, the essence of which was as follows: the party will support the one who "promises" more. As a result of party interference in scientific knowledge, a stereotype of the behavior of scientists "dependent" on decisions "from above" was formed, which affected not only the agrarian science, but also other natural sciences. At the same time, an anti-scientific psychology was formed among production workers, who were forced not so much to follow scientific recommendations as to evade their implementation. As a result, the possibilities of scientific and technological progress were limited, production indicators in the agricultural sector worsened. Overcoming the mistakes made since the mid-1960s opened up opportunities for accelerating the integration of agricultural science and production. In the USSR, there appeared specific "oases" of agrarian well-being, with quite "harmonious" relations between agricultural science and production. However, the negative scenario of the country's development did not allow the positive trends that had been identified to be fully realized.

TI  - A novel ensemble model of automatic multilayer perceptron, random forest, and ZeroR for groundwater potential mapping
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining levels of the water table in India have become a major concern, especially with climate change and burgeoning population compounding the problem and causing a perpetual state of water crisis. A better insight into the state of these precious resources is essential for their planned exploration and usage. This study introduces a novel machine learning ensemble model (ARZ ensemble), through an implementation of majority voting-based technique over its standalone classifier constituents, namely, Automatic Multilayer Perceptron (AutoMLP), random forest (RF), and ZeroR for undertaking the groundwater potential mapping for the Jabalpur district, Madhya Pradesh. Ten groundwater influencing factors (i.e., slope, rainfall, aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index, land use, lithology, distance from rivers, plan and profile curvature) and groundwater well locations from the study area were used to construct the spatial database. In order to validate the applicability of the proposed model, its performance was compared against a conventionally employed statistical method of Shannon's entropy (SE) model. The results revealed that the ARZ ensemble model (AUC: 0.8542) outperformed SE (AUC: 0.7639). The groundwater potential map revealed that approximately 4.18% of the region has very high groundwater potential, while 47.66% belongs to a low potential zone. Such information can hold solutions for a lot of the ailments afflicting these resources and can genuinely aid in the attempts to restore them to their natural state.

TI  - Assessing the change of groundwater quality compared with land-use change and precipitation rate (Zrebar Lake's Basin)
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Population, salinity, and increasing water consumption have caused high pressure on groundwater resources in Iran. The study reported here investigates the change of groundwater quality in Zrebar lake basin and the relationship between it with land-use change and precipitation rate from 1992 to 2018. To achieve the intended goal, chemical parameters of water from wells around the lake, bicarbonate (HCO3-), sulfate (SO4), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), and electrical conductivity (EC) were analyzed. Then, four methods including interpolation in the ArcGIS environment, Wilcox and Schoeller Diagram in Aq.QA software and Ground Water Quality Index (GWQI) were used to indicate the trend of water quality from 1992 to 2018. To detect land-use changes from 1992 to 2018, three Landsat satellite images covering the study area were used to identify land uses and their changes during the period that shows a significant area of forests that has been replaced by agricultural use, the dominant cover in 2018, while the area of forest has declined sharply. In this study, the precipitation patterns over the past years were showed to assess the relationship between rainy and low rainfall years with water quality. The results showed that forest area in 1992, 2003 and 2018 was 70.6, 62.5 and 50.2 hectares, respectively, which shows a significant reduction, 22%, during this study period. On the other hand, the area of farmlands and human-made constructions has increased by 20% and 200%, respectively. This study additionally revealed that although there was a decreasing trend in the rate of rainfall and the agricultural lands have increased, the quality of water was still suitable for drinking and agriculture consumptions. Changes in groundwater quality were not justifiable by rainfall rate and land-use change because there was no significant relationship between them with all the groundwater quality parameters.

TI  - Lithological and tectonic response on catchment characteristics of Rishi Khola, Sikkim, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rishi Khola, a sub-watershed of Teesta river, traverses along the Main Central Thrust (MCT) with a multitude of litho units and structural entities. This study examines the impact of tectonic and lithologic controls in configuring the catchment characteristics of Rishi Khola, Sikkim, India. Corrected SRTM 30 m DEM and Landsat 8 satellite image have been used for extracting the river network, preparing the sub-catchments, the longitudinal profile and thereby calculating the morphotectonic indices. An aggregated tectonic index (ATI) has been prepared to map the intensity of tectonic perturbations in the fluvial environment using the entropy weightage method (EWM) and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC). The undulating nature of the longitudinal profile with prominent knick points confirms the presence of tectonic disturbances and lithological variations. From all the computed morphotectonic indices and the ATI, it has been evident that the region has experienced surface deformations. When viewed at the entire catchment, the morphotectonic indices suggest ample responses to the tectonic perturbations due to the dominance of lithology-controlled hill slope processes and fluvial erosion. The spatiality of the tectonic sensitiveness is rather concentrated into certain pockets of differential stress field formed due to fault thrusting of the Himalayas. The study chiefly focuses on the peculiarity of the watershed which displays a complex response of tectonic and rock structure; wherein the proposed methodology has been successful in excavating such complex responses around the Himalayan thrusts.

TI  - Spatial Prediction of Agrochemical Properties on the Scale of a Single Field Using Machine Learning Methods Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Creating accurate digital maps of the agrochemical properties of soils on a field scale with a limited data set is a problem that slows down the introduction of precision farming. The use of machine learning methods based on the use of direct and indirect predictors of spatial changes in the agrochemical properties of soils is promising. Spectral indicators of open soil based on remote sensing data, as well as soil properties, were used to create digital maps of available forms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It was shown that machine learning methods based on support vectors (SVMr) and random forest (RF) using spectral reflectance data are similarly accurate at spatial prediction. An acceptable prediction was obtained for available nitrogen and available potassium; the variability of available phosphorus was modeled less accurately. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the best model for nitrogen is R-SVMr(2) = 0.90 (Landsat 8 OLI) and R-SVMr(2) = 0.79 (Sentinel 2), for potassium-R-SVMr(2) = 0.82 (Landsat 8 OLI) and R-SVMr(2) = 0.77 (Sentinel 2), for phosphorus-R-SVMr(2) = 0.68 (Landsat 8 OLI), R-SVMr(2) = 0.64 (Sentinel 2). The models based on remote sensing data were refined when soil organic matter (SOC) and fractions of texture (Silt, Clay) were included as predictors. The SVMr models were the most accurate. For Landsat 8 OLI, the SVMr model has a R-2 value: nitrogen-R-2 = 0.95, potassium-R-2 = 0.89 and phosphorus-R-2 = 0.65. Based on Sentinel 2, nitrogen-R-2 = 0.92, potassium-R-2 = 0.88, phosphorus-R-2 = 0.72. The spatial prediction of nitrogen content is influenced by SOC, potassium-by SOC and texture, phosphorus-by texture. The validation of the final models was carried out on an independent sample on soils from a chernozem zone. For nitrogen based on Landsat 8 OLI R-2 = 0.88, for potassium R-2 = 0.65, and for phosphorus R-2 = 0.31. Based on Sentinel 2, for nitrogen R-2 = 0.85, for potassium R-2 = 0.62, and for phosphorus R-2 = 0.71. The inclusion of SOC and texture in remote sensing-based machine learning models makes it possible to improve the spatial prediction of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium availability of soils in chernozem zones and can potentially be widely used to create digital agrochemical maps on the scale of a single field.

TI  - Development of a Fish-Based Multimetric Index for the Assessment of Lagoons' Ecological Quality in Northern Greece
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining and improving the aquatic ecosystems in the community is the aim of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC. The WFD requires the water quality to be classified into five categories. Lagoons are dynamic ecosystems. The fish communities inhabiting them are highly affected by the environmental conditions prevailing both in the freshwater systems and in the marine environment. The current paper presented the first effort to develop a fish-based index (Lagoon Fish-based Index-LFI) for the assessment of the Mediterranean shallow lagoons, as almost all indices produced to date refer to freshwater or estuarine systems. For the development and calibration of the index, data were collected from nine lagoons situated in three estuarine systems in the East Macedonia and Thrace regions. The development of the LFI was based on the principles of the Indices of Biological Integrity (IBIs) that were primary used for the assessment of aquatic ecosystems in the USA. A total number of 25 metrics were selected as potential metrics for the LFI. These metrics describe attributes such as the abundance and composition of the fish fauna, the feeding strategies of the species, and the presence of sentinel species. Finally, eight metrics were included in the LFI.

TI  - Utilization and uncertainties of satellite precipitation data in flash flood hydrological analysis in ungauged watersheds
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of the study is to examine the potential utilization of satellite precipitation data to estimate the peak discharges of flash floods in ungauged Mediterranean watersheds. Cumulative precipitation heights from local rain gauge and the GPM-IMERG were correlated in a scatter plot. The calculated linear equations were used to adjust the uncalibrated GPM-IMERG precipitation data in Thasos island (Northern Greece), to investigate the mechanisms of the flash floods recorded in November 2019 and to evaluate the significance of satellite precipitation data in hydrological modeling. The uncalibrated GPM-IMERG precipitation failed to explain the flash floods phenomena. The rain gauge data are reliable to accurately predict the peak discharges only in cases, where the rain gauges are within the study area. The strong correlation between ground rainfall data and satellite spatiotemporal precipitation data (R-2 > 0.65), provides linear regression equations that, through their extrapolation and appliance to the rest of the flooded area, could adjust and correct the satellite data, optimizing the efficiency and accuracy of flash flood analysis, especially in ungauged watersheds. The proposed methodology could highly contribute to the optimization of flood mitigation measures establishment, flood risk assessment, hydrological and hydraulic simulation of flash flood events in ungauged watersheds.

TI  - Agricultural Production on Erosion-Affected Land from the Perspective of Remote Sensing
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we discuss the influence of soil erosion on crop yield in the erosion-prone chernozem region of South Moravia. Erosional and depositional areas show significant differences in soil properties, which are also reflected in total crop yield. Plots of winter wheat, grown during the years 2016-2019 were used for analysis. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), referred to in literature as one of the best correlates of yield, was used to provide indirect information on yield. Although erosional areas are visible on orthophoto images on chernozem soils, the necessary orthophoto images are not always available. Thus, we have proposed a method for the identification of such erosion-affected areas based on the use of Sentinel 2 satellite images and NDVI or NBR2 indices. The relationship between yield and erosion was expressed through Pearson's correlation on a sample of pixels randomly selected on the studied plots. The results showed a statistically significant linear reduction in yield depending on the level of degradation. All plots were further reclassified, according to level of degradation, as high, medium, or low state of degradation, where the average EVI values were subsequently calculated. Yield on non-degraded soil is 16 & PLUSMN; 1% higher on average.

TI  - Metallogenic Features of the Andean Volcanic Belt in Peru in the Light of Satellite Data on the Deep Crustal and Upper Mantle Structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Peruvian part of the Andean volcanic belt (AVB) is characterized by significant mineralization. There are explored Au-Ag epithermal, Cu-porphyry, skarn, Fe-oxide (IOCG-type) and polymetallic deposits. The metallogeny of the AVB is determined by the subduction process, i.e., the underthrusting of the Nazca oceanic plate under the margin of the South American continent. The AVB metallogeny is considered on the basis of modern geophysical studies of the lithosphere using data from the GOCE satellite: the gravity field, the Moho surface, and the thermal regime of the upper mantle. The anomaly in the linear distribution of ore objects in the southeast of the studied area of the AVB is apparently due to the influence of the "hot spot" on the composition of magmatic formations and ore-bearing solutions, and IOCG-type objects can be indicators of such environments.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Cover Contrasts on Arable Land Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Abstract- Knowledge about the heterogeneity of the soil cover of arable land and its impact on crop yield is of great practical importance. One of the main indicators of heterogeneity of the soil cover of arable fields is their contrast. The existing methods of assessment of soil contrast are based on the analysis of soil properties, classification position, or belonging to a certain agroproductive group. We propose a new method for estimating soil contrast of arable lands, which is entirely based on the use of satellite data. We suggest using a pairwise comparison of NDVI values for the soil segments calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite data for the last six years for all available scenes with the image of crops as the criterion of contrast. Based on the paired assessment of soil contrast and the length of boundaries between soils with different degrees of contrast, the contrast of the field as a whole can be estimated. Testing of the developed approaches on two test fields has shown their efficiency and the possibility in the future to create a system of automated remote technology for analyzing the contrast of the fields in order to gain prompt, low-cost, and independent assessments of their quality and develop recommendations on soil management.

TI  - Deriving the Main Cultivation Direction from Open Remote Sensing Data to Determine the Support Practice Measure Contouring
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The P-factor for support practice of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) accounts for soil conservation measures and leads to a significant reduction in the modelled soil loss. However, in the practical application, the P-factor is the most neglected factor overall due to high effort for determining or lack of input data. This study provides a new method for automatic derivation of the main cultivation direction from seed rows and tramlines on agricultural land parcels using the Fast Line Detector (FLD) of the Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) package and open remote sensing data from Google Earth (TM). Comparison of the cultivation direction with the mean aspect for each land parcel allows the determination of a site-specific P-factor for the soil conservation measure contouring. After calibration of the FLD parameters, the success rate in a first application in the low mountain range Fischbach catchment, Germany, was 77.7% for 278 agricultural land parcels. The main reasons for unsuccessful detection were problems with headland detection, existing soil erosion, and widely varying albedo within the plots as well as individual outliers. The use of a corrected mask and enhanced parameterization offers promising improvements for a higher success rate of the FLD.

TI  - Potentials and Limitations of WorldView-3 Data for the Detection of Invasive Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl. in Semi-Natural Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-natural grasslands contribute highly to biodiversity and other ecosystem services, but they are at risk by the spread of invasive plant species, which alter their habitat structure. Large area grassland monitoring can be a powerful tool to manage invaded ecosystems. Therefore, WorldView-3 multispectral sensor data was utilized to train multiple machine learning algorithms in an automatic machine learning workflow called 'H2O AutoML' to detect L. polyphyllus in a nature protection grassland ecosystem. Different degree of L. polyphyllus cover was collected on 3 x 3 m(2) reference plots, and multispectral bands, indices, and texture features were used in a feature selection process to identify the most promising classification model and machine learning algorithm based on mean per class error, log loss, and AUC metrics. The best performance was achieved with a binary classification of lupin-free vs. fully invaded 3 x 3 m(2) plot classification with a set of 7 features out of 763. The findings reveal that L. polyphyllus detection from WorldView-3 sensor data is limited to large dominant spots and not recommendable for lower plant coverage, especially single plant detection. Further research is needed to clarify if different phenological stages of L. polyphyllus as well as time series increase classification performance.

TI  - Variation of Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> on the Territories of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Region According to Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - NO2 is a reactive gas which is produced mainly due to man-made activities (burning of fossil fuels) and influences negatively people organisms and environment. Since the Earth population keeps increasing, the content of the gas in the atmosphere is expected to rise. Satellite monitoring is the most optimal method to observe the spatio-temporal distribution of NO2 in the troposphere globally which cannot be achieved by ground-based measurements. However, there are several different satellite measurement systems which provide the information on tropospheric NO2. In the current study we compared tropospheric NO2 data for the more than 10-year period retrieved from the measurements of OMI and GOME/SCIAMACHY/GOME-2 satellite measurement systems for the territories of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad region (Russia). Also, we investigated correlation between the NO2 tropospheric content by satellite measurements and near-surface NO2 concentration by ground-based measurements in Saint Petersburg. The research demonstrated that OMI and GOME/SCIAMACHY/GOME-2 data on tropospheric NO2 content possessed large discrepancies (approximately 100% relative to OMI data) for the area and period of interest. The datasets did not correlate well but some similarities in a seasonal variation of the tropospheric NO2 content for Saint Petersburg and Leningrad region were found. In addition, we registered an obvious correlation in the trend of near-surface and tropospheric NO2 content obtained by ground-based and OMI satellite measurements respectively.

TI  - Umbilical venous catheterisation: emergency central venous access which saves lives in coarctation of the aorta
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a 9-day-old baby with coarctation of the aorta who required urgent resuscitation including intubation and cardiac compressions. Despite the commencement of prostaglandin E1 (PGE(1)) to reopen the ductus arteriosus via the intraosseous route, postductal saturations remained unrecordable for a further 45 min. Within 3 min of administration of PGE(1) via an umbilical venous catheter (UVC), saturations were recordable at 92%. UVC access was the sentinel intervention that irrevocably altered the clinical prognosis. This baby boy has survived with excellent neurodevelopmental outcome. Clinicians are less familiar with UVCs outside of the newborn period. Our data demonstrate successful placement in neonates up to 28 days of age. We hope this case encourages clinicians to consider the UVC as first-line central venous access in collapsed neonates. In cases of suspected left heart obstruction, we argue that UVCs are the optimal route.

TI  - Usefulness of histological superstudy of sentinel lymph nodes detected with radioisotopes in colon cancer.
T2  - Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) significally reduces the rate of relapse in +pN (stage III) colon cancer (CC) and in some pN0 (stage II) with risk factors such as pT4, vascular invasion V1, perineural invasion Pn1, and complicated tumors. However, unexpectedly, 20%-30% of pN0 present a relapse in the follow-up, which may suggest that the lymph node involvement was not discovered in the conventional histological study (CS), and its finding with a superstudy (SS) could increase the number of patients who would benefit from neoadjuvant CT. It is not possible to perform this SS in every lymph node (LN) from the specimen, but it is possible in a small group of LN which are representative of the N status (definition of sentinel node SN). The aim of our work is to state the representativeness of the SN and to analyze de number of patients who are suprastaged after the SS of the SN.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study of a series of patients who have undergone curative surgery for CC, to whom we perform selective biopsy of sentinel node (SBDN). Identification of SN was carried out with in vivo injection of the radiotracer, with ex vivo isolation of SN. Once the specimen is out, we take pictures of the surgical bed to rule out the presence of aberrant drainage routes, out of the routine oncological resection area. We performed the histological CS (Hematoxilin-Eosin stain (H-E) in conventional sections) in the rest of the LN from the mesocolon. In the SN we performed the CS and a SS with H-E in serial sections, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular study with OSNA (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification). Diagnostic validity study od SBSN was carried out, defining the false negative (FN) as the negativity of the SN while other LN are positive (N+), as well as a valuation of the suprastaging due to the SS of the SN.RESULTS: We performed lymphatic map in 72 patients, finding the SN in 62 of them (87.3%). The 9 identification failures happened in the first 17 cases. We have not found aberrant drainage routes. A total of 1.164 LN were studied in the 62 patients (18.8 LN/patient), from which 145 are SN (2,34 SN/patient), having found 103 positive LN with the CS and 112 positive with the SS of SN (9+ LN more in 8 patients than detected with the CS). Positivity after CS in the SN group is 17.24% (25/145), while it is 8.53% in the rest (87/1.019) (P < .001). With the CS, 50% of the patients (31/62) were pN+ (4 are N+ exclusively in the SN), and after the SS of the SN, only 1 of the 31 pN0 patients (3.2%) becomes pN1a, with a definitive 51.6% of N+ in the whole series (32 N+ in the 62 patients) (5 are N+ exclusively in the SN). Exclusively with the SS of the SN, FN rate ("-SN, +others", meaning patients who are N+ having -SN) is 54.8% (17/31). With the SS of the SN, 8 of the 62 patients (12.9%) increase their total number of +LN: apart from the patient who turns from pN0 to pN1a, suprastaging from IIA to IIIB (and therefore increasing the total number of pN+ to 32), 5 of the 17 FN in the CS turns into positive (2 change the pN subindex and one is suprastaged from IIIB to IIIC), decreasing FN to 37.5% (12/32 cases). Besides, 2 patients whose SN is already positive in the CS increase the number of +SN after the SS of the SN, therefore both changing their pN subindex and one of them suprastaging from IIIB to IIIC. In summary, 8 patients increase the total number of positive SN after the SS (8/62, 12.9%), 5 of them changing the pN subindex (5/62, 12.9%), even if only 3 of them get suprastaged (3/62, 4.8%), among them the one who turns from pN0 to pN1a.CONCLUSION: Technique is valid and reproducible, with a high detection rate even with a high learning curve. It globally increases the number of affected LN in 12.9% of patients, having prognostic implications in 4.8% (suprastaging rate). Only 3.2% of pN0 patients in the CS turn to be +pN after the SS of the SN, with its therapeutic implications (prescription of adjuvant CT), which could be relevant when extrapolated to a big number of patients. The high FN rate (37.5%) prevents us from accepting the representativeness of SN as the global N status, but it is not clinically relevant in CC, as its aim is not to avoid lymphadenectomy, which remains mandatory (opposite to breast cancer or melanoma in which SN detection decides upon whether to perform or not the lymphadenectomy), but to decide which patients would benefit from adjuvant CT.

TI  - Unsupervised Deep Learning for Landslide Detection from Multispectral Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new approach based on an unsupervised deep learning (DL) model for landslide detection. Recently, supervised DL models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely studied for landslide detection. Even though these models provide robust performance and reliable results, they depend highly on a large labeled dataset for their training step. As an alternative, in this paper, we developed an unsupervised learning model by employing a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) to deal with the problem of limited labeled data for training. The CAE was used to learn and extract the abstract and high-level features without using training data. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we used Sentinel-2 imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM) to map landslides in three different case studies in India, China, and Taiwan. Using minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation, we reduced the multispectral dimension to three features containing more than 80% of scene information. Next, these features were stacked with slope data and NDVI as inputs to the CAE model. The Huber reconstruction loss was used to evaluate the inputs. We achieved reconstruction losses ranging from 0.10 to 0.147 for the MNF features, slope, and NDVI stack for all three study areas. The mini-batch K-means clustering method was used to cluster the features into two to five classes. To evaluate the impact of deep features on landslide detection, we first clustered a stack of MNF features, slope, and NDVI, then the same ones plus with the deep features. For all cases, clustering based on deep features provided the highest precision, recall, F1-score, and mean intersection over the union in landslide detection.

TI  - Statistical Quantification of Texture Visual Features for Pattern Recognition by Analyzing Pre- and Post-Multispectral Landsat Satellite Imagery
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the performance of visual texture features based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix to analyze multispectral remotely sensed Landsat images. Different case studies related to urbanization, flood, and drought are investigated in this research work. The changing land use/land cover pattern caused by urbanization, floods, and droughts is examined through quantitative assessment. Texture visual features, i.e., correlation, contrast, angular second moment or energy, and homogeneity, are derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix. These features are used to develop a pattern for the changing texture of land use/land cover. Human visual perception of smoothness and coarseness is related to the texture features and is later used to describe the texture features' changing behavior. The quantitative assessment of texture features in terms of smoothness and coarseness establishes a novel pattern between pre- and postimages of urbanization, flood, and drought.

TI  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry for Pettimudi (India) Landslide Monitoring using Sentinel-1A Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous monitoring of land surface movement over time is of paramount importance for assessing landslide triggering factors and mitigating landslide hazards. This research focuses on measuring horizontal and vertical surface displacement due to a devastating landslide event in the west-facing slope of the Rajamala Hills, induced by intense rainfall. The landslide occurred in Pettimudi, a tea-plantation village of the Idukki district in Kerala, India, on August 6-7, 2020. The persistent-scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PSInSAR) technique, along with the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS), was applied to investigate the land surface movement over time. A stack of 20 Sentinel-1A single-look complex images (19 interfero-grams) acquired in descending passes was used for PSInSAR processing. The line-of-sight (LOS) displacement in long time series, and hence the average LOS velocity, was measured at each measurement-point location. The mean LOS velocity was decomposed into horizontal east-west (EW) and vertical up-down velocity components. The results show that the mean LOS, EW, and up-down velocities in the study area, respectively, range from -18.76 to +11.88, -10.95 to +6.93, and -15.05 to +9.53 mm/y, and the LOS displacement ranges from -19.60 to +19.59 mm. The displacement values clearly indicate the instability of the terrain. The time-series LOS displacement trends derived from the applied PSInSAR technique are very useful for providing valuable inputs for disaster management and the development of disaster early-warning systems for the benefit of local residents.

TI  - Synthesis technique of a low-profile multiple sub-beam phased array antenna for high-throughput satellite applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sub-beam concept is very useful for size reduction of multiple beam phased array antenna (PAA) systems that are applied for high-throughput communication satellites. In this paper, the synthesis procedure for a PAA with multiple sub-beams in two dimensions of the coverage domain is proposed and analyzed. In the design procedure, the interleaved sub-arraying technique has been applied to eliminate the grating lobes. The extremely short angular distance between adjacent sub-beams is challenging. An innovative beam forming network is proposed, which can generate multiple orthogonal sub-beams while keeping the required angular distance between sub-beams. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the design technique, an example considering the requirements derived from conceptual design of a high-throughput communication payload is presented. The array is optimized using the genetic algorithm while taking into account the technical requirements of the antenna. The gain patterns exhibit a 0.4 degrees angular distance between adjacent sub-beams. In addition, the number of sub-arrays and element spacing guarantee the orthogonality of the sub-beams. The calculated carrier to interference ratio in the synthesized array shows that it has acceptable values in each spot. The aperture size reduction in the synthesized array compared to a conventional multiple beam array is more than 36.7%.

TI  - Phenology and Spectral Unmixing-Based Invasive Kudzu Mapping: A Case Study in Knox County, Tennessee
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an invasive plant species, kudzu has been spreading rapidly in the Southeastern United States in recent years. Accurate mapping of kudzu is critical for effective invasion control and management. However, the remote detection of kudzu distribution using multispectral images is challenging because of the mixed reflectance and potential misclassification with other vegetation. We propose a three-step classification process to map kudzu in Knox County, Tennessee, using multispectral Sentinel-2 images and the integration of spectral unmixing analysis and phenological characteristics. This classification includes an initial linear unmixing process to produce an overestimated kudzu map, a phenological-based masking to reduce misclassification, and a nonlinear unmixing process to refine the classification. The initial linear unmixing provides high producer's accuracy (PA) but low user's accuracy (UA) due to misclassification with grasslands. The phenological-based masking increases the accuracy of the kudzu classification and reduces the domain for further processing. The nonlinear unmixing further refines the kudzu classification via the selection of an appropriate nonlinear model. The final kudzu classification for Knox County reaches relatively high accuracy, with UA, PA, Jaccard, and Kappa index values of 0.858, 0.907, 0.789, and 0.725, respectively. Our proposed method has potential for continuous monitoring of kudzu in large areas.

TI  - Fusing Geostationary Satellite Observations with Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Time Series for Monitoring Field-Scale Land Surface Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely land surface phenology (LSP) provides essential information for investigating the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to climate changes and quantifying carbon and surface energy cycles on the Earth. LSP has been widely investigated using daily Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, but the resultant phenometrics are frequently influenced by surface heterogeneity and persistent cloud contamination in the time series observations. Recently, LSP has been derived from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 time series providing detailed spatial pattern, but the results are of high uncertainties because of poor temporal resolution. With the availability of data from Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard a new generation of geostationary satellites that observe the earth every 10-15 min, daily cloud-free time series could be obtained with high opportunities. Therefore, this study investigates the generation of synthetic high spatiotemporal resolution time series by fusing the harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) time series with the temporal shape of ABI data for monitoring field-scale (30 m) LSP. The algorithm is verified by detecting the timings of greenup and senescence onsets around north Wisconsin/Michigan states, United States, where cloud cover is frequent during spring rainy season. The LSP detections from HLS-ABI are compared with those from HLS or ABI alone and are further evaluated using PhenoCam observations. The result indicates that (1) ABI could provide ~3 times more high-quality observations than HLS around spring greenup onset; (2) the greenup and senescence onsets derived from ABI and HLS-ABI are spatially consistent and statistically comparable with a median difference less than 1 and 10-days, respectively; (3) greenup and senescence onsets derived from HLS data show sharp boundaries around the orbit-overlapped areas and shifts of ~13 days delay and ~15 days ahead, respectively, relative to HLS-ABI detections; and (4) HLS-ABI greenup and senescence onsets align closely to PhenoCam observations with an absolute average difference of less than 2 days and 5 days, respectively, which are much better than phenology detections from ABI or HLS alone. The result suggests that the proposed approach could be implemented the monitor of 30 m LSP over regions with persistent cloud cover.

TI  - Early Forecast of Crop Yields Based on PlanetScope Dove Satellite Data
T2  - Biofizika
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of early forecast of spring wheat yields based on data from PlanetScope Dove satellite with spatial (3 m) resolution operated by Planet Labs. Prediction of spring wheat yield was made in early July in the heading stage - the beginning of flowering through linear regression analysis; the values of the integral under the NDVI curve in different periods of time were used as parameters. A multiple linear regression equation was constructed to predict the yield of spring wheat using eight variables (determination co-efficient 0.86; mean square error 3.77). Grain yield map of spring wheat was created using satellite data from PlanetScope with spatial (3 m) resolution. The resulting map made it possible to reveal the heterogeneity of the yield within the experimental field. Studies have shown a good relationship between the NDVI integral and the actual yield obtained at the end of the growing season. Therefore, the intermediate results of intraseasonal measurements can be used to adjust the ratio of fertilizers.

TI  - Analysis of the Impacts of Environmental Factors on Rat Hole Density in the Northern Slope of the Tienshan Mountains with Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the impacts of environmental factors on spatial-temporal and large-scale rodent distribution is important for rodent damage prevention. Investigating rat hole density (RHD) is one of the most effective methods to obtain the intensity of rodent damage. However, most of the previous field surveys or UAV-based remote sensing methods can only evaluate small-scale RHD and its influencing factors. However, these studies did not consider large-scale temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we collected small-scale and in situ measurement records of RHD on the northern slope of the Tien Shan Mountains in Xinjiang (NTXJ), China, from 1982 to 2015, and then used correlation analysis and Bayesian network (BN) to analyze the environmental impacts on large-scale RHD with satellite remote sensing data such as the GIMMS NDVI product. The results show that the built BN can better quantify causality in the environmental mechanism modeling of RHD. The NDVI and LAI data from satellite remote sensing are important to the spatial-temporal RHD distribution and the mapping in the future. In regions with an elevation higher than 600 m (UPR) and lower than 600 m (LWR) of NTXJ, there are significant differences in the driving mechanism patterns of RHD, which are dependent on the elevation variation. In LWR, vegetation conditions have a weaker impact on RHD than UPR. It is possibly due to the Artemisia eaten by the dominant species Lagurus luteus (LL) in UPR being more sensitive to precipitation and temperature if compared with the Haloxylon ammodendron eaten by the Rhombomys opimus (RO) in LWR. In LWR, grazing intensity is more strongly and positively correlated to RHD than UPR, possibly due to both winter grazing and RO dependency on vegetation distribution; moreover, in UPR, sheep do not feed Artemisia as the main food, and the total vegetation is sufficient for sheep and LL to coexist. Under the different conditions of water availability of LWR and UPR, grazing may affect the ratio of aboveground and underground biomass by photosynthate allocation, thereby affecting the distribution of RHD. In extremely dry years, the RHD of LWR and UPR may have an indirect interactive relation due to changes in grazing systems.

TI  - The 20-Year Spatiotemporal Trends of Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture and Vegetation and Their Response to Climate Change over the Third Pole
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the ``Third Pole,'' is a climate-sensitive and ecology-fragile region. In this study, the spatiotemporal trends of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation were analyzed using satellite-based ESA CCI SM and MODIS LAI data, respectively, in the growing season during the last 20 years (2000-19) over the TP covering diverse climate zones. The climatic drivers (precipitation and air temperature) of SM and LAI variations were fully investigated by using both ERA5 reanalysis and observation-based gridded data. The results reveal the TP is generally wetting and significantly greening in the last 20 years. The SM with significant increasing trend accounts for 21.80% (fraction of grid cells) of the TP, and is about twice of the SM with significant decreasing trend (10.19%), while more than half of the TP (58.21%) exhibits significant increasing trend of LAI. Though the responses of SM and LAI to climatic factors are spatially heterogeneous, precipitation is the dominant driver of SM variation with 48.36% (ERA5) and 32.51% (observation-based) precipitation data showing the strongest significant positive partial correlation with SM. Temperature rise largely explains the vegetation greening, though precipitation also plays an important role in vegetation growth in arid and semiarid zones. The combined trend of SM and LAI indicates the TP is mainly composed of wetting and greening areas, followed by drying and greening regions. The change rate ofSMis negative at low altitudes and becomes positive as altitude increases, while the LAI value and its change rate decrease as altitude increases.

TI  - Using Time Series Optical and SAR Data to Assess the Impact of Historical Wetland Change on Current Wetland in Zhenlai County, Jilin Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands, as the most essential ecosystem, are degraded throughout the world. Wetlands in Zhenlai county, with the Momoge National Nature Reserve, which was included on the Ramsar list, have degraded by nearly 30%. Wetland degradation is a long-term continuous process with annual or interannual changes in water area, water level, or vegetation presence and growth. Therefore, it requires sufficiently frequent and high-spatial-resolution data to represent its dynamics. This study mapped yearly land-use maps with 30-m resolution from 1985 to 2018 using Landsat data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to explore the wetland degradation process and mapped 12-day interval land-use maps with 15-m resolution using the Sentinel-1B and Sentinel-2 data in GEE and other assistant platforms to study the characteristics of wetland dynamics in 2018. Four sets of maps were generated using Sentinel-1B (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), the combination of Sentinel-1B and Sentinel-2 (S12), and S12 with multitemporal remote sensing (S12'). All of the classifications were performed in the Random Forest Classification (RFC) method using remote sensing indicators. The results indicate that S12' was the most accurate. Then, the impact of the historic land-use degradation process on current wetland change dynamics was discussed. Stable, degradation, and restoration periods were identified according to the annual changes in wetlands. The degraded, stable, restored, and vulnerable zones were assessed based on the transformation characteristics among wetlands and other land-use types. The impact of historical land-use trajectories on wetland change characteristics nowadays is diverse in land-use types and distributions, and the ecological environment quality is the comprehensive result of the effect of historical land-use trajectories and the amount of rainfall and receding water from paddy fields. This study offers a new method to map high-spatiotemporal-resolution land-use (S12') and addresses the relationship between historic wetland change characteristics and its status quo. The findings are also applicable to wetland research in other regions. This study could provide more detailed scientific guidance for wetland managers by quickly detecting wetland changes at a finer spatiotemporal resolution.

TI  - Increasing fire and logging disturbances in Siberian boreal forests: a case study of the Angara region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances are a critical environmental issue globally and within the boreal biome, yet detailed attribution and trends in disturbances are lacking for many Siberian regions. The Angara region located in the southern taiga of Central Siberia has experienced significant disturbances during the past several decades and is a hotspot of change in Eurasia. Here we estimated fire and logging disturbances using MODIS and Landsat data for the period 2002-2020 across the Angara region and analyzed the resulting trends. Average annual burned and logged area was about 220 and 31 thousand ha or 2 and 0.3% of the study area, respectively. In total, about 4.1 million ha (38% of the region) and 0.6 million ha (6% of the region) were disturbed by fires and logging, respectively. Spatial analysis showed that almost 50% of fires were ignited within 2 km of anthropogenic features such as settlements, roads and logged areas. Almost 5% of the Angara region was burned two or more times during the 19 years of observations. Improved and strictly-enforced conservation and management policies are required to halt continued forest degradation in the Angara region and similarly-affected boreal forests in Siberia.

TI  - The lineaments as one of the precursors of earthquakes: A case study of Tashkent geodynamical polygon in Uzbekistan
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work is to study earthquake precursors using lineament analysis of five M(W)3 earthquakes that occurred in 2018 on the territory of the Tashkent geodynamic polygon in Uzbekistan. The Landsat 8 satellite images were processed using the automated lineament detection method in the LEFA software. The processing steps included image preprocessing with graphic filters, edge detection using Canny's algorithm, the definition of a vector of linear elements based on the probabilistic Hough transform and combining collinear linear elements into lineaments. The analysis of the cyclicity of precursors before and after earthquakes was based on the study of the distribution of the lineaments trend in the study area using rose diagrams and lineaments density maps. The results showed a change in the dynamics of the lineament structure. The statistical analysis of lineaments revealed that the number and orientation of lineaments changed significantly about 2-4 months before an earthquake, and after 2-3 months, the system gradually returned to its initial state. The rapid increase in lineaments density began almost 20 days before the event, reaching a maximum about 4 days before the earthquake, and its decrease began 16 days after the earthquake. The main trends observed in the lineament map showed dominant trends in NS, EW, and the subdominant directions were in NW-SE, NE-SW, which coincided with main directions of the faults.

T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we study the spatial structure of the polarization jet based on data from the NorSat-1 and Swarm ionospheric satellites during a geomagnetic storm. A comparative analysis of the electron density and temperature dependence on the invariant latitude is carried out simultaneously according to measurements of the NorSat-1 and Swarm C satellites during their crossing of the polarization jet. The dependence of the invariant latitude of polarization jet on the auroral geomagnetic activity and on the magnetic local time is confirmed. A double structure of polarization jet is discovered as well as small-scale spatial structures inside the jet with a size of 0.1 degrees-0.2 degrees. It is found that spatial structures are not local and are extended in longitude for at least 2 h of magnetic local time.

TI  - Resilience of the Central Indian Forest Ecosystem to Rainfall Variability in the Context of a Changing Climate
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern of natural vegetation helps decoding the responses to climate change and interpretation on forest resilience. Satellite remote sensing based data products, by virtue of their synoptic and repetitive coverage, offer to study the correlation and lag effects of rainfall on forest growth in a relatively longer time scale. We selected central India as the study site. It accommodates tropical natural vegetation of varied forest types such as moist and dry deciduous and evergreen and semi-evergreen forests that largely depend on the southwest monsoon. We used the MODIS derived NDVI and CHIRPS based rainfall datasets from 2001 to 2018 in order to analyze NDVI and rainfall trend by using Sen's slope and standard anomalies. The study observed a decreasing rainfall trend over 41% of the forests, while the rest of the forest area (59%) demonstrated an increase in rainfall. Furthermore, the study estimated drought conditions during 2002, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2015 for 98.2%, 92.8%, 89.6%, 90.1% and 95.8% of the forest area, respectively; and surplus rainfall during 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013 and 2016 for 69.5%, 63.9%, 71.97%, 70.35%, 94.79% and 69.86% of the forest area, respectively. Hence, in the extreme dry year (2002), 93% of the forest area showed a negative anomaly, while in the extreme wet year (2013), 89% of forest cover demonstrated a positive anomaly in central India. The long-term vegetation trend analysis revealed that most of the forested area (> 80%) has a greening trend in central India. When we considered annual mean NDVI, the greening and browning trends were observed over at 88.65% and 11.35% of the forested area at 250 m resolution and over 93.01% and 6.99% of the area at 5 km resolution. When we considered the peak-growth period mean NDVI, the greening and browning trends were as follows: 81.97% and 18.03% at 250 m and 88.90% and 11.10% at 5 km, respectively. The relative variability in rainfall and vegetation growth at five yearly epochs revealed that the first epoch (2001-2005) was the driest, while the third epoch (2011-2015) was the wettest, corresponding to the lowest vegetation vigour in the first epoch and the highest in the third epoch during the past two decades. The study reaffirms that rainfall is the key climate variable in the tropics regulating the growth of natural vegetation, and the central Indian forests are dominantly resilient to rainfall variation.

TI  - Addressing Peatland Rewetting in Russian Federation Climate Reporting
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rewetting is the most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from drained peatlands and must significantly contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate within the land sector. In 2010-2013, more than 73 thousand hectares of fire-prone peatlands were rewetted in the Moscow Region (the hitherto largest rewetting program in the Northern Hemisphere). As the Russian Federation has no national accounting of rewetted areas yet, this paper presents an approach to detect them based on multispectral satellite data verified by ground truthing. We propose that effectively rewetted areas should minimally include areas with wet grasslands and those covered with water (cf. the IPCC categories "rewetted organic soils" and "flooded lands"). In 2020, these lands amounted in Moscow Region to more than 5.3 and 3.6 thousand hectares, respectively. Assuming that most rewetted areas were former peat extraction sites and using IPCC default GHG emission factors, an overall GHG emission reduction of over 36,000 tCO(2)-eq year(-1) was calculated. We furthermore considered the uncertainty of calculations. With the example of a 1535 ha large rewetted peatland, we illustrate the estimation of GHG emission reductions for the period up to 2050. The approach presented can be used to estimate GHG emission reductions by peatland rewetting on the national, regional, and object level.

TI  - TRAUMA: AN IDEOLOGY IN SEARCH OF EVIDENCE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SOCIAL IN SOCIAL WELFARE
T2  - SCOTTISH AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent special issue of this journal focussed on the emergence of the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) movement as a key driver of Scottish social policy. In this article, we extend the critiques advanced therein by locating ACEs within a wider cultural turn towards psychological trauma which, over the past decade, has become reified as a master theory across social welfare. Yet, the concept is insubstantial and ill-defined, and the claims made for policy based upon it are at best disputable. Its prominence is less evidence-based than it is testimony to how a particular (cultural and professional) ideology, regardless of its intellectual merit, can be insinuated into policy discourse. ACEs, we suggest, is utilised to provide the trauma paradigm with some ostensibly quantifiable substance. We illustrate our argument through reference to the Scottish Government's National Trauma Training Programme (2020). We go on to consider some of the implications of such ideological capture for the direction of Scottish social welfare policy and practice. The prominence given to trauma perspectives has potentially iatrogenic consequences for those identified or self-identifying as traumatised. At a wider level, it reflects a professional and epistemic privileging of a narrow, ostensibly therapeutic, worldview which, in turn, acts to marginalise 'the social' that characterised erstwhile Scottish approaches to welfare.

TI  - Deep Hashing Learning for Visual and Semantic Retrieval of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Driven by the urgent demand for managing remote sensing big data, large-scale remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) attracts increasing attention in the remote sensing field. In general, existing retrieval methods can be regarded as visual-based retrieval approaches that search and return a set of similar images to a given query image from a database. Although these retrieval methods have delivered good results, there is still a question that needs to be addressed: can we obtain the accurate semantic labels of the returned similar images to further help analyzing and processing imagery? To this end, in this article, we redefine the image retrieval problem as visual and semantic retrieval of images. Especially, we propose a novel deep hashing convolutional neural network (DHCNN) to retrieve similar images and classify their semantic labels simultaneously in a unified framework. In more detail, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract high-dimensional deep features. Then, a hash layer is perfectly inserted into the network to transfer the deep features into compact hash codes. In addition, a fully connected layer with a softmax function is performed on the hash layer to generate the probability distribution of each class. Finally, a loss function is elaborately designed to consider the label loss of each image and similarity loss of pairs of images simultaneously. Experimental results on three remote sensing data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-art retrieval and classification performance.

TI  - Geohazards Monitoring and Assessment Using Multi-Source Earth Observation Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological disasters are responsible for the loss of human lives and for significant economic and financial damage every year. Considering that these disasters may occur anywhere-both in remote and/or in highly populated areas-and anytime, continuously monitoring areas known to be more prone to geohazards can help to determine preventive or alert actions to safeguard human life, property and businesses. Remote sensing technology-especially satellite-based-can be of help due to its high spatial and temporal coverage. Indeed, data acquired from the most recent satellite missions is considered suitable for a detailed reconstruction of past events but also to continuously monitor sensitive areas on the lookout for potential geohazards. This work aims to apply different techniques and methods for extensive exploitation and analysis of remote sensing data, with special emphasis given to landslide hazard, risk management and disaster prevention. Multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) interferometry, SAR tomography, high-resolution image matching and data modelling are used to map out landslides and other geohazards and to also monitor possible hazardous geological activity, addressing different study areas: (i) surface deformation of mountain slopes and glaciers; (ii) land surface displacement; and (iii) subsidence, landslides and ground fissure. Results from both the processing and analysis of a dataset of earth observation (EO) multi-source data support the conclusion that geohazards can be identified, studied and monitored in an effective way using new techniques applied to multi-source EO data. As future work, the aim is threefold: extend this study to sensitive areas located in different countries; monitor structures that have strategic, cultural and/or economical relevance; and resort to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to be able to analyse the huge amount of data generated by satellite missions and extract useful information in due course.

TI  - Economic Comparison of Satellite, Plane and UAV-Acquired NDVI Images for Site-Specific Nitrogen Application: Observations from Italy
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Defining the most profitable remote sensing platforms is a difficult decision-making process, as it requires agronomic and economic considerations. In this paper, the price and profitability of three levels of remote sensing platforms were evaluated to define a decision-making process. Prices of satellite, plane and UAV-acquired vegetation indices were collected in Italy during 2020 and compared to the economic benefits resulting from variable rate nitrogen application, according to a bibliographic meta-analysis performed on grains. The quality comparison of these three technologies was performed considering the error propagation in the NDVI formula. The errors of the single bands were used to assess the optical properties of the sensors. Results showed that medium-resolution satellite data with good optical properties could be profitably used for variable rate nitrogen applications starting from 2.5 hectares, in case of medium resolution with good optical properties. High-resolution satellites with lower optical quality were profitable starting from 13.2 hectares, while very high-resolution satellites with good optical properties could be profitably used starting from 76.8 hectares. Plane-acquired images, which have good optical properties, were profitable starting from 66.4 hectares. Additionally, a reference model for satellite image price is proposed.

TI  - Shadow Aspects of the Organization of Soviet Trade in the Assessments of Collective Consciousness in the 1960s-1980s: Interpretation of Letters to the Central Authorities and the Media
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article raises the question of the specifics of the socioeconomic development of the Soviet society in the 1960s-1980s in terms of the specifics of the organization of trade activities. The aim of this study is to identify the shadow aspects in the implementation of trade and economic practices in the Soviet state during the deep social transformations of the second half of the 20th century. Special attention is paid to the reaction of people to situations related to the growing deterioration of the population's supply of food, basic necessities, and household appliances. Observing the actions of the authorities, abuse of office, supply disruptions, production of low quality products, violations in the household arrangement of shopkeepers, lack of premises for organizing trade (especially in rural areas), Soviet citizens, hoping for justice, wrote to the newspapers Sovetskaya Torgovlya [Soviet Trade], Sel'skaya zhizn' [Rural Life], Pravda [Truth], and directly to the governing authorities. Based on the analysis of the database of materials of the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History, the author comes to the conclusion that the all-encompassing trend of the time was the formation of procedures for a speculative resale of goods. Their approval took place in the environment of bazaars and markets, gradually spreading to other trading enterprises. The most important problem of the time was commodity shortage and related criminal schemes, non-compliance with labor discipline, and so on. Soviet citizens showed a keen desire to make the egregious facts of reality public. Changes in people's behavioral patterns and moral appearance, the presence of special privileges for heads of the trade business, their families, and governing elites caused a persistent rejection by many. However, the attitude to things gradually changed, the desire for a comfortable life in society increased, which often led to joining the shadow models of the development of trade activities. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the author demonstrates the modernization of worldview characteristics, traits of consciousness, both among the corporate management, trade organizers, and among urban and rural residents. During the analyzed period, the commercialization of life manifestations gained momentum, and the formation of entrepreneurial initiatives and private-property psychology took place. The source basis of the study is archival materials from the funds of the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History. Within the framework of the problem, the application of sociocultural and systemic approaches that determine the formation of a holistic, comprehensive view of the construction of transformational, modernizing, and evolutionary processes in Soviet trade in the second half of the 20th century is convincing.

TI  - Evaluation of Precipitable Water Vapor Retrieval from Homogeneously Reprocessed Long-Term GNSS Tropospheric Zenith Wet Delay, and Multi-Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor is one of the most important greenhouse gases in the world. There are many techniques that can measure water vapor directly or remotely. In this work, we first study the Global Positioning System (GPS)- and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS)-derived Zenith Wet Delay (ZWD) time series based on 11 years of the second reprocessing campaign of International Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Service (IGS) using 320 globally distributed stations. The amount of measurement, the local environment, and the antenna radome are shown to be the main factors that affect the GNSS ZWDs and the corresponding a posteriori formal errors. Furthermore, antenna radome is able to effectively reduce the systematic bias of ZWDs and a posteriori formal errors between the GPS- and GLONASS-based solutions. With the development of the GLONASS, the ZWD differences between the GPS- and the GLONASS-based solutions have gradually decreased to sub-mm-level after GLONASS was fully operated. As the GPS-based Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is usually used as the reference to evaluate the other PWV products, the PWV consistency among several common techniques is evaluated, including GNSSs, spaceborne sensors, and numerical products from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). As an example of the results from a detailed comparison analysis, the long-term global analysis shows that the PWV obtained from the GNSS and the ECMWF have great intra-agreements. Based on the global distribution of the magnitude of the PWV and the PWV drift, most of the techniques showed superior agreement and proved their ability to do climate research. With a detailed study performed for the ZWDs and PWV on a long-term global scale, this contribution provides a useful supplement for future research on the GNSS ZWD and PWV.

TI  - Superpixel-Based Singular Spectrum Analysis for Effective Spatial-Spectral Feature Extraction
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the processing of remotely sensed data, classification may be preceded by feature extraction, which helps in making the most informative parts of the data emerge. Effective feature extraction may boost the efficiency and accuracy of the following classification, and hence various methods have been proposed to perform it. Recently, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and its 2-D variation (2D-SSA) have emerged as popular, cutting-edge technologies for effective feature extraction in Hyperspectral Images (HSI). Using 2D-SSA, each band image of an HSI is initially decomposed into various components, and then the image is reconstructed using the most significant eigen-tuples relative to their eigen-values, which represent strong spatial features for the classification task. However, instead of performing reconstruction on the whole image, it may be more effective to apply reconstruction to object-specific spatial regions, which is the proposed objective of this research. As an HSI may cover a large area, multiple objects are generally present within a single scene. Hence, spatial information can be highlighted accurately by specializing the reconstruction based on the local context. The local context may be defined by the so-called superpixels, i.e., finite sets of pixels that constitute a homogeneous set. Each superpixel may undergo tailored reconstruction, with a process expected to perform better than non-spatially-adaptive approaches. In this paper, a Superpixel-based SSA (SP-SSA) method is proposed where the image is first segmented into multiple regions using a superpixel segmentation approach. Next, each segment is individually reconstructed using 2D-SSA. In doing so, the spatial contextual information is preserved, leading to better classifier performance. The performance of the reconstructed features is evaluated using an SVM classifier. Experiments on four popular benchmark datasets reveal that, in terms of the classification accuracy, the proposed approach overperforms the standard SSA technique and various common spatio-spectral classification methods.

TI  - Optical Remote Sensing Indexes of Soil Moisture: Evaluation and Improvement Based on Aircraft Experiment Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing (about 0.4~2.0 mu m) indexes of soil moisture (SM) are valuable for some specific applications such as monitoring agricultural drought and downscaling microwave SM, due to their abundant data sources, higher spatial resolution, and easy-to-use features, etc. In this study, we evaluated thirteen typical optical SM indexes with aircraft and in situ observed SM from two field campaigns, the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) and 2016 (SMAPVEX16) conducted in Manitoba, Canada. MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09A1) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imager Level-1C data were utilized to calculate the optical SM indexes. The evaluation results demonstrated that (1) the Visible and Shortwave Infrared Drought Index (VSDI) and Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) outperform the other eleven optical SM indexes as compared with aircraft and in situ observed SM. They also presented well consistence in temporal variation with the in situ observed SM. (2) The VSDI achieved comparable performance with the OPTRAM while the former has very simple calculation expression and the latter requires complex process to determine the dry and wet boundaries. (3) Both the VSDI and OPTRAM utilize two sensitive bands of soil and vegetation moisture, i.e., Red and SWIR bands, whereas the other eleven SM indexes only employ one sensitive band. This may be the main reason of the evaluation results. (4) Based on this recognition, improvements of the VSDI and OPTRAM were created and validated in this study through adding more sensitive band to VSDI and combining NDVI and modified VSDI into a new feature space for calculating the optical SM index as with OPTRAM. The results are conducive to selecting and utilizing the current numerous optical SM indexes for SM and drought monitoring.

TI  - Identifying and understanding alternative states of dryland landscape: A hierarchical analysis of time series of fractional vegetation-soil nexuses in China's Hexi Corridor
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and early identification of state transitions in dryland systems' landscape pattern are challenging but critical for conservation planning and sustainable management strategies. Currently the alternative states of drylands have been identified based on dynamics of single vegetation index (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index), with the interactions between vegetation and soil components often being neglected. Here, we proposed a framework for identifying the alternative states in relation to land degradation based on the interactive pathways of fractional vegetation and soil-related endmember nexuses. In this framework, we initially generated 16-day fractional green vegetation endmember (green vegetation [GV]) and soil-related endmembers (sand [SL], saline [SA], dark surface [DA]) time series using a standardized linear spectral mixture analysis model in the Hexi Corridor during 2001-2017. A discrete wavelet transform based trends and turning points detection (DWT-TTD) algorithm was proposed to detect trends, turning point types, and timing of these time series records. These metrics were subsequently used to identify eight state transition pathways for each endmember and synthetic degradation processes at the appropriate 5-10 year scale. We found that the unmixed fractional endmembers exhibited a consistent agreement with both field abundance values and estimated fractions from high-spatial-resolution Google Earth images. Based on the DWT-TTD algorithm derived alternative pathways, we found that four positive pathways of GV and DA fractions can be observed in the vegetated areas were integrated with corresponding negative pathways of SA and SL fractions. These pathways resulted in remarkably increasing GV (+4551.81 km2) and DA (+9749.26 km2) and significantly declining SA (-1452.70 km2) and SL (-9555.57 km2) from 2001 to 2017. These processes were linked to increased precipitation and temperature and reduced drought degree. Also, the timing of the turning points (around 2007 and 2013) was largely coincidental with the timing of ecological management, suggesting that ecological governance played a crucial role in the state shifts. However, because of drought trends in the barren regions, land desertification exhibited an increasing occurrence in extent (+2.5% of total pixels) during the study period, which may increase in the future, as indicated by the large pixel proportion of initially positive reversal pathway for SL (9.31%). Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the DWT-TTD algorithm, as a multi-resolution analysis method, has the potential to detect hierarchical temporal changes and disentangle the cross-scale inherent shifts of vegetation-soil systems. The framework can help devise sustainable management practices that maintain land degradation neutrality, especially when integrated with land use cover change analysis.

TI  - Modelling Aboveground Biomass Carbon Stock of the Bohai Rim Coastal Wetlands by Integrating Remote Sensing, Terrain, and Climate Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) have been widely used to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) carbon stock of coastal wetlands by establishing Vis-related linear models. However, these models always have high uncertainties due to the large spatial variation and fragmentation of coastal wetlands. In this paper, an efficient coastal wetland AGB model for the Bohami Rim coastal wetlands was presented based on multiple data sets. The model was developed statistically with 7 independent variables from 23 metrics derived from remote sensing, topography, and climate data. Compared to previous models, it had better performance, with a root mean square error and r value of 188.32 g m(-2) and 0.74, respectively. Using the model, we firstly generated a regional coastal wetland AGB map with a 10 m spatial resolution. Based on the AGB map, the AGB carbon stock of the Bohai Rim coastal wetland was 2.11 Tg C in 2019. The study demonstrated that integrating emerging high spatial resolution multi-remote sensing data and several auxiliary metrics can effectively improve VIs-based coastal wetland AGB models. Such models with emerging freely available data sets will allow for the rapid monitoring and better understanding of the special role that "blue carbon " plays in global carbon cycle.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite products are essential in many research fields. Geostationary satellite imagery is rapidly updating and offers vast multi-spectral data that is useful in applications such as gridded solar forecasting and resource assessment. However, there is a high-barrier to entry for researchers in obtaining and using satellite data. A new database from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) offers near-real-time Himawari-8/9 satellite imagery by Advanced Himawari Imagers (AHIs), for free, to researchers. Typically, this type of data has a high price point; hence, it is a good opportunity for scientific researchers to work in the real real-time operational space. We present a data article complete with a Python package that: (i) downloads full disk Himawari-8/9 AHI Himawari standard data from the JAXA Himawari Monitor P-Tree system, (ii) provides example scripts showing how the data can remapped, cropped, and stored appropriately, and (iii) gives examples how to visualize the data. The Python package can be found on the Python package index at .

TI  - Estimation of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> Mass Concentration over Land from FY-4A Aerosol Optical Depth Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to estimate the particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) in China using the improved geographically and temporally weighted regression (IGTWR) model and Fengyun (FY-4A) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. Based on the IGTWR model, the boundary layer height (BLH), relative humidity (RH), AOD, time, space, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data are employed to estimate the PM2.5 and PM10. The main processes of this study are as follows: firstly, the feasibility of the AOD data from FY-4A in estimating PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations were analysed and confirmed by randomly selecting 5-6 and 9-10 June 2020 as an example. Secondly, hourly concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are estimated between 00:00 and 09:00 (UTC) each day. Specifically, the model estimates that the correlation coefficient R-2 of PM2.5 is 0.909 and the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 5.802 mu g/m(3), while the estimated R-2 of PM10 is 0.915, and the RMSE is 12.939 mu g/m(3). Our high temporal resolution results reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of hourly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations on the day. The results indicate that the use of data from the FY-4A satellite and an improved time-geographically weighted regression model for estimating PM2.5 and PM10 is feasible, and replacing land use classification data with NDVI facilitates model improvement.

TI  - Waiving Subsequent Complete Lymph Node Dissection in Melanoma Patients with Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Does Not Result in Worse Outcome on 20-Year Analysis
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate long-term outcomes of melanoma patients who had micrometastasis on sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. We focused on the comparison between melanoma patients with and without complete lymph node dissection (CLND) following a positive SLN biopsy result. Patients without CLND did not significantly differ from patients with CLND in regard to age, gender, tumor thickness, tumor ulceration, capsule infiltration of SLN, and invasion level of SLN. On 10-year analysis, we did not observe a significantly increased risk for melanoma relapse or melanoma-specific death in patients who did not undergo CLND after the detection of micrometastases on SLN biopsy. On 20-year analysis, again, the patients without CLND had no significantly increased risk of melanoma relapse and worse melanoma-specific survival. Hence, our 10-year survival data confirm the current notion that waiving CLND in SLN-positive patients does not result in clinical disadvantages with respect to melanoma-specific survival. For the first time, we demonstrate on 20-year survival analysis that relapse rates and melanoma-specific survival does not significantly differ between patients with or without CLND on long-term follow-up.Complete lymph node dissection (CLND) following positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been the standard of care for decades. We aimed to study melanoma patients with an emphasis on the outcome of patients with versus without CLND following positive SLN biopsy. SLN-positive patients with or without CLND were compared regarding important prognostic clinical and histological characteristics. Ten-year and 20-year survival curves for melanoma relapse and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression. We studied 258 patients who had micrometastases in their SLN biopsy. CLND was performed in 209 of 258 patients (81%). Hence, in 49 of 258 patients (19%) with SLN micrometastases, CLND was not performed. These patients did not significantly (p > 0.05) differ from patients with CLND in regard to age, gender, tumor thickness, tumor ulceration, capsule infiltration of SLN, or invasion level of SLN. On 10-year analysis, we did not observe a significantly increased risk for melanoma relapse and worse in MSS in patients who did not undergo CLND (hazard ratio: 1.1 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.7) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.9), respectively). On 20-year survival analysis, we confirmed that the risk of melanoma relapse and impaired MSS does not significantly increase in patients without CLND (hazard ratio: 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.9) and 1.3 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.3), respectively). On 10-year as well as 20-year multivariable follow-up analysis (including several important prognostic factors), Cox proportional-hazards regression showed that the status of CLND did not remain in the regression model (p > 0.1). Our 10-year data give conclusive support to previous investigations indicating that waiving CLND in patients with SLN micrometastases does not affect MSS. More importantly, our long-term follow-up data confirm for the first time the 10-year survival data of previous investigations.

TI  - Reconstruction of All-Weather Daytime and Nighttime MODIS Aqua-Terra Land Surface Temperature Products Using an XGBoost Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating spatiotemporally continuous land surface temperature (LST) data is in great demand for hydrology, meteorology, ecology, environmental studies, etc. However, the thermal infrared (TIR)-based LST measurements are prone to cloud contamination with missing pixels. To repair the missing pixels, a new XGBoost-based linking approach for reconstructing daytime and nighttime Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST measurements was introduced. The instantaneous solar radiation and two soil-related predictors from China Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) 0.0625 & DEG;/1-h data were selected as the linking variables to depict the relationship with instantaneous MODIS LST data. Other land surface properties, including two vegetation indices, the water index, the surface albedo, and topographic parameters, were also used as the predictor variables. The XGBoost method was used to fit an LST linking model by the training datasets from clear-sky pixels and was then applied to the MODIS Aqua-Terra LSTs during summer time (June to August) in 2017 and 2018 across China. The recovered LST data was further rectified with the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering method. The results showed the distribution of the reconstructed LSTs present a reasonable pattern for different land-cover types and topography. The evaluation results using in situ longwave radiation measurements showed the RMSE varies from 3.91 K to 5.53 K for the cloud-free pixels and from 4.42 K to 4.97 K for the cloud-covered pixels. In addition, the reconstructed LST products correlated well with CLDAS LST data with similar LST spatial patterns. The variable importance analysis revealed that the two soil-related predictors and the elevation variable are key parameters due to their great contribution to the XGBoost model performance.

TI  - Etiology of Diarrhea Requiring Hospitalization in Bangladesh by Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction, 2014-2018
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Diarrhea remains a major public health problem and characterization of its etiology is needed to prioritize interventions. However, most data are from single-site studies of children. We tested samples from participants of any age from 11 geographically diverse hospitals in Bangladesh to describe pathogen-specific burdens of diarrhea.Methods. We utilized 2 existing diarrhea surveillance systems: a Nationwide network at 10 sentinel hospitals and at the icddr,b hospital. We tested stools from enrolled participants and nondiarrheal controls for enteropathogens using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and calculated pathogen-specific attributable fractions (AFs) of diarrhea.Results. We analyzed 5516 patients with diarrhea and 735 controls. Overall, rotavirus had the highest attributable burden of diarrhea (Nationwide AF, 17.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3-20.9%; icddr,b AF, 39.9%; 38.0-41.8%), followed by adenovirus 40/41 (Nationwide AF, 17.9%; 95% CI: 13.9-21.9%; icddr,b AF, 16.6%; 95% CI, 14.4-19.4%) and Vibrio cholerae (Nationwide AF, 10.2%; 95% CI, 9.1-11.3%; icddr,b AF, 13.3%; 95% CI: 11.9-15.1%). Rotavirus was the leading pathogen in children <5 years and was consistent across the sites (coefficient of variation = 56.3%). Adenovirus 40/41 was the second leading pathogen in both children and adults. Vibrio cholerae was the leading pathogen in individuals >5 years old, but was more geographically variable (coefficient of variation = 71.5%). Other attributable pathogens included astrovirus, norovirus, Shigella, Salmonella, ETEC, sapovirus, and typical EPEC.Conclusions. Rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, and V. cholerae were the leading etiologies of infectious diarrhea requiring hospitalization in Bangladesh. Other pathogens were important in certain age groups or sites.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for estimating the size of the region in which cloudiness affects errors in retrieving the reflection coefficients of the Earth's surface areas observed through breaks in the cloud field is proposed. The algorithm is based on statistical simulation of the process of radiation transfer through broken stochastic cloudiness by the Monte Carlo method. Two stochastic models of cloud fields are considered: (i) clouds shaped as parallelepipeds and (ii) clouds shaped as paraboloids. The method is tested for two fragments of an actual MODIS image. It is shown that broken cloudiness influences the retrieval error in the reflection coefficient at distances from 5-7 to 25 km from the observation point (depending on situations under consideration).

TI  - Estimation of the Broken Cloud Effect on Retrieving Reflectance of Cloudless Earth Surface Regions from MODIS Imagery
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for estimating the range of influence of broken cloudiness on the results of retrieving reflectance of cloudless Earth surface regions is proposed for satellite observations through gaps in a cloud field. The algorithm is based on the Monte Carlo method of simulation of radiation transfer in broken stochastic cloudiness with averaging over the cloud field. Two models of cloud fields are considered: the field shapes as parallelepipeds and paraboloids. The method is tested for two fragments of the real MODIS image with the coordinates of 53.4 degrees-56.4 degrees N, 109 degrees-115 degrees E and 49.0 degrees-51.0 degrees N, 121 degrees-123 degrees E. The results of computations show that the effect of cloudiness is significant at distances up to 25 km for the first image fragment and up to 5-7 km for the second one.

TI  - Spatial Variability of Suspended Sediments in San Francisco Bay, California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatial variability of water quality in estuary systems is important for making monitoring decisions and designing sampling strategies. In San Francisco Bay, the largest estuary system on the west coast of North America, tracking the concentration of suspended materials in water is largely limited to point measurements with the assumption that each point is representative of its surrounding area. Strategies using remote sensing can expand monitoring efforts and provide a more complete view of spatial patterns and variability. In this study, we (1) quantify spatial variability in suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations at different spatial scales to contextualize current in-water point sampling and (2) demonstrate the potential of satellite and shipboard remote sensing to supplement current monitoring methods in San Francisco Bay. We collected radiometric data from the bow of a research vessel on three dates in 2019 corresponding to satellite overpasses by Sentinel-2, and used established algorithms to retrieve SPM concentrations. These more spatially comprehensive data identified features that are not picked up by current point sampling. This prompted us to examine how much variability exists at spatial scales between 20 m and 10 km in San Francisco Bay using 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. We found 23-80% variability in SPM at the 5 km scale (the scale at which point sampling occurs), demonstrating the risk in assuming limited point sampling is representative of a 5 km area. In addition, current monitoring takes place along a transect within the Bay's main shipping channel, which we show underestimates the spatial variance of the full bay. Our results suggest that spatial structure and spatial variability in the Bay change seasonally based on freshwater inflow to the Bay, tidal state, and wind speed. We recommend monitoring programs take this into account when designing sampling strategies, and that end-users account for the inherent spatial uncertainty associated with the resolution at which data are collected. This analysis also highlights the applicability of remotely sensed data to augment traditional sampling strategies. In sum, this study presents ways to supplement water quality monitoring using remote sensing, and uses satellite imagery to make recommendations for future sampling strategies.

TI  - Shoreline Variation and Identification of Local Erosion Geoindicators on the Brazilian Amazon Coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis was conducted of the change in the shoreline in the northern part of Para ' (Amazonian coast, Brazil) over a medium-term period. The analysis of the variation of the shoreline was carried out by tracing the spring high tide level in LANDSAT images from 1988 to 2019. With this tracing, it was possible to verify the behavior of the processes of erosion and accretion in the different morphological units (mangroves, beaches, cliffs, and rocky shores). The results show that changes in the shoreline occurred differently in the four morphological units, both in spatial and temporal scales. Regionally, the northern coast of Para ' showed a trend of stability between losses and gains in areas, but with a slight predominance of the accretion process. The mangroves and beaches showed periods of alternation of predominance between the processes, while in the stretches with cliffs, the smallest areas of retreat were detected. The stretches of shoreline with a rocky shore remained stable throughout the study period. The study allowed the identification of local geoindicators for diagnosis and identification of the erosion process in coastal macrotidal regions. These results can assist in the identification of areas at risk of coastal erosion, as well as in coastal management in Para ' State and related areas.

TI  - Predicting Days to Maturity, Plant Height, and Grain Yield in Soybean: A Machine and Deep Learning Approach Using Multispectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In soybean, there is a lack of research aiming to compare the performance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to predict more than one agronomic variable, such as days to maturity (DM), plant height (PH), and grain yield (GY). As these variables are important to developing an overall precision farming model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict DM, PH, and GY for soybean cultivars based on multispectral bands. The field experiment considered 524 genotypes of soybeans in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 growing seasons and a multitemporal-multispectral dataset collected by embedded sensor in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We proposed a multilayer deep learning regression network, trained during 2000 epochs using an adaptive subgradient method, a random Gaussian initialization, and a 50% dropout in the first hidden layer for regularization. Three different scenarios, including only spectral bands, only vegetation indices, and spectral bands plus vegetation indices, were adopted to infer each variable (PH, DM, and GY). The DL model performance was compared against shallow learning methods such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR). The results indicate that our approach has the potential to predict soybean-related variables using multispectral bands only. Both DL and RF models presented a strong (r surpassing 0.77) prediction capacity for the PH variable, regardless of the adopted input variables group. Our results demonstrated that the DL model (r = 0.66) was superior to predict DM when the input variable was the spectral bands. For GY, all machine learning models evaluated presented similar performance (r ranging from 0.42 to 0.44) for each tested scenario. In conclusion, this study demonstrated an efficient approach to a computational solution capable of predicting multiple important soybean crop variables based on remote sensing data. Future research could benefit from the information presented here and be implemented in subsequent processes related to soybean cultivars or other types of agronomic crops.

TI  - Influence of lightning activity on weather parameters and its association with aerosol optical depth over land and ocean of Indian region
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - The study discusses the influence of lightning activity on weather parameters and its association with aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Indian land and oceanic regions by using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data of flash count (FC) for the period (1998-2014). It is seen from the results that the monthly mean variation of FC and Bowen Ratio (BR) shows a first higher peak in the month of May and a second lower peak in September over land and ocean. The lightning activity is found to be 89% higher over the land than the oceanic region. The results also show that sensible heat flux delivers heat to the lower atmosphere to create deep convection and strong electrification to produce high lightning over the land. The maritime clouds with shallow convection, result in a slow charging mechanism to produce low lightning over the ocean. The results also show that the first higher peak of FC and maximum updraft speed in the month of May and second lower peak in the month of September over the land and ocean. The lightning intensity is found to be sensitive function of the maximum updraft speed in thunderstorm cloud over land and oceanic region of India. It is also seen from the results that the FC shows the first higher peak in the month of May, whereas AOD shows the first higher peak in the month of July over the land and ocean. The first higher peak of FC in the month of May indicates that the anthropogenic particles on land which also acts aerosol particles such as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei, influence the formation of cloud droplets, ice crystals, graupel particles with strong updraft during charge separation process which is responsible for strong cloud electrification to produce high lightning over the land than the oceanic regions of India.

TI  - High-Resolution Polar Low Winds Obtained from Unsupervised SAR Wind Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution sea surface observations by spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments are sorely neglected resources for meteorological applications in polar regions. Such radar observations provide information about wind speed and direction based on wind-induced roughness of the sea surface. The increasing coverage of SAR observations in polar regions calls for the development of SAR-specific applications that make use of the full information content of this valuable resource. Here we provide examples of the potential of SAR observations to provide details of the complex, mesoscale wind structure during polar low events, and examine the performance of two current wind retrieval methods. Furthermore, we suggest a new approach towards accurate wind vector retrieval of complex wind fields from SAR observations that does not require a priori wind direction input that the most common retrieval methods are dependent on. This approach has the potential to be particularly beneficial for numerical forecasting of weather systems with strong wind gradients, such as polar lows.

TI  - Measuring Deformed Sea Ice in Seasonal Ice Zones Using L-Band SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the understanding of the dynamical deformation processes of sea ice in the seasonal ice zone (SIZ), measures to detect deformed ice were developed and validated using satellite L-band synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) images for the southern Sea of Okhotsk. To approach, sea ice was categorized into three ice types, typical of the sea ice in this region: nilas (thin level), pancake ice (thin rough), and deformed ice (thick rough), and then the measures to classify into these categories were developed using ALOS/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) as a function of backscatter coefficients at HH polarization (sigma(0)(HH)) and incidence angle (theta(i)), based on the field observations. Comparative analysis confirmed that PALSAR can detect deformed ice more efficiently than RADARSAT-2 (C-band SAR). The temporal evolution of the area, judged as deformed ice from these measures, shows significant variability with both time and space, and deformed ice regions appear in relatively linear alignments with a width of a few tens of kilometers in the inner ice pack region, consistent with ice drift convergence. To confirm the results, PALSAR-2 images at HH and HV polarizations were examined as a function of theta(i), based on the four-year field observations in the same area. The results revealed that sigma(0)(HH) and sigma(0)(HV) are both subject to floe sizes as well as deformed ice, and sigma(0)(HV) is more sensitive. This indicates that care should be taken when applying these measures to the ice areas where significantly small floes are dominant like the marginal ice zone.

TI  - Synergetic Classification of Coastal Wetlands over the Yellow River Delta with GF-3 Full-Polarization SAR and Zhuhai-1 OHS Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of coastal wetlands affects their ecological functions. Wetland classification is a challenging task for remote sensing research due to the similarity of different wetlands. In this study, a synergetic classification method developed by fusing the 10 m Zhuhai-1 Constellation Orbita Hyperspectral Satellite (OHS) imagery with 8 m C-band Gaofen-3 (GF-3) full-polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery was proposed to offer an updated and reliable quantitative description of the spatial distribution for the entire Yellow River Delta coastal wetlands. Three classical machine learning algorithms, namely, the maximum likelihood (ML), Mahalanobis distance (MD), and support vector machine (SVM), were used for the synergetic classification of 18 spectral, index, polarization, and texture features. The results showed that the overall synergetic classification accuracy of 97% is significantly higher than that of single GF-3 or OHS classification, proving the performance of the fusion of full-polarization SAR data and hyperspectral data in wetland mapping. The synergy of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) and hyperspectral imagery enables high-resolution classification of wetlands by capturing images throughout the year, regardless of cloud cover. The proposed method has the potential to provide wetland classification results with high accuracy and better temporal resolution in different regions. Detailed and reliable wetland classification results would provide important wetlands information for better understanding the habitat area of species, migration corridors, and the habitat change caused by natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

TI  - Earth Observation Data-Driven Cropland Soil Monitoring: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - We conducted a systematic review and inventory of recent research achievements related to spaceborne and aerial Earth Observation (EO) data-driven monitoring in support of soil-related strategic goals for a three-year period (2019-2021). Scaling, resolution, data characteristics, and modelling approaches were summarized, after reviewing 46 peer-reviewed articles in international journals. Inherent limitations associated with an EO-based soil mapping approach that hinder its wider adoption were recognized and divided into four categories: (i) area covered and data to be shared; (ii) thresholds for bare soil detection; (iii) soil surface conditions; and (iv) infrastructure capabilities. Accordingly, we tried to redefine the meaning of what is expected in the next years for EO data-driven topsoil monitoring by performing a thorough analysis driven by the upcoming technological waves. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of an EO data-driven soil mapping include: (i) a further leverage of recent artificial intelligence techniques to achieve the desired representativeness and reliability; (ii) a continued effort to share harmonized labelled datasets; (iii) data fusion with in situ sensing systems; (iv) a continued effort to overcome the current limitations in terms of sensor resolution and processing limitations of this wealth of EO data; and (v) political and administrative issues (e.g., funding, sustainability). This paper may help to pave the way for further interdisciplinary research and multi-actor coordination activities and to generate EO-based benefits for policy and economy.

TI  - Dominant clade-featured SARS-CoV-2 co-occurring mutations reveal plausible epistasis: An in silico based hypothetical model
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into eight fundamental clades with four of these clades (G, GH, GR, and GV) globally prevalent in 2020. To explain plausible epistatic effects of the signature co-occurring mutations of these circulating clades on viral replication and transmission fitness, we proposed a hypothetical model using in silico approach. Molecular docking and dynamics analyses showed the higher infectiousness of a spike mutant through more favorable binding of G(614) with the elastase-2. RdRp mutation p.P323L significantly increased genome-wide mutations (p < 0.0001), allowing for more flexible RdRp (mutated)-NSP8 interaction that may accelerate replication. Superior RNA stability and structural variation at NSP3:C241T might impact protein, RNA interactions, or both. Another silent 5 '-UTR:C241T mutation might affect translational efficiency and viral packaging. These four G-clade-featured co-occurring mutations might increase viral replication. Sentinel GH-clade ORF3a:p.Q57H variants constricted the ion-channel through intertransmembrane-domain interaction of cysteine(C81)-histidine(H57). The GR-clade N:p.RG203-204KR would stabilize RNA interaction by a more flexible and hypo-phosphorylated SR-rich region. GV-clade viruses seemingly gained the evolutionary advantage of the confounding factors; nevertheless, N:p.A220V might modulate RNA binding with no phenotypic effect. Our hypothetical model needs further retrospective and prospective studies to understand detailed molecular events and their relationship to the fitness of SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Optimal surveillance strategies for patients with stage 1 cutaneous melanoma post primary tumour excision: three systematic reviews and an economic model
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, with rates continuing to rise, resulting in considerable burden to patients and the NHS.Objectives: The objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of current and alternative follow-up strategies for stage IA and IB melanoma.Review methods: Three systematic reviews were conducted. (1) The effectiveness of surveillance strategies. Outcomes were detection of new primaries, recurrences, metastases and survival. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk-of-Bias 2.0 tool. (2) Prediction models to stratify by risk of recurrence, metastases and survival. Model performance was assessed by study-reported measures of discrimination (e.g. D-statistic, Harrel's c-statistic), calibration (e.g. the Hosmer-Lemeshow 'goodness-of-fit' test) or overall performance (e.g. Brier score, R-2). Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). (3) Diagnostic test accuracy of fine-needle biopsy and ultrasonography. Outcomes were detection of new primaries, recurrences, metastases and overall survival. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Review data and data from elsewhere were used to model the cost-effectiveness of alternative surveillance strategies and the value of further research.Results: (1) The surveillance review included one randomised controlled trial. There was no evidence of a difference in new primary or recurrence detected (risk ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.31). Risk of bias was considered to be of some concern. Certainty of the evidence was low. (2) Eleven risk prediction models were identified. Discrimination measures were reported for six models, with the area under the operating curve ranging from 0.59 to 0.88. Three models reported calibration measures, with coefficients of >= 0.88. Overall performance was reported by two models. In one, the Brier score was slightly better than the American Joint Committee on Cancer scheme score. The other reported an R-2 of 0.47 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.49). All studies were judged to have a high risk of bias. (3) The diagnostic test accuracy review identified two studies. One study considered fine-needle biopsy and the other considered ultrasonography. The sensitivity and specificity for fine-needle biopsy were 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.97) and 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.97), respectively. For ultrasonography, sensitivity and specificity were 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.00) and 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 0.99), respectively. For the reference standards and flow and timing domains, the risk of bias was rated as being high for both studies. The cost-effectiveness results suggest that, over a lifetime, less intensive surveillance than recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence might be worthwhile. There was considerable uncertainty. Improving the diagnostic performance of cancer nurse specialists and introducing a risk prediction tool could be promising. Further research on transition probabilities between different stages of melanoma and on improving diagnostic accuracy would be of most value.Limitations: Overall, few data of limited quality were available, and these related to earlier versions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging. Consequently, there was considerable uncertainty in the economic evaluation.Conclusions: Despite adoption of rigorous methods, too few data are available to justify changes to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations on surveillance. However, alternative strategies warrant further research, specifically on improving estimates of incidence, progression of recurrent disease; diagnostic accuracy and health-related quality of life; developing and evaluating risk stratification tools; and understanding patient preferences.

TI  - Barbary ground squirrels do not have a sentinel system but instead synchronize vigilance
T2  - BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coordinated behaviors, such as hunting in lions and coordinated vigilance as antipredator behavior, are examples of benefits of group-living. Instead of asynchronous vigilance, some social species synchronize their vigilance bouts or take turns acting as sentinels. To increase our knowledge on the evolution of vigilance behavior, we studied whether vigilance is coordinated in Barbary ground squirrels, Atlantoxerus getulus. We show that vigilance was synchronized instead of taking turns. Multiple non-mutually exclusive hypotheses could explain synchronization: Barbary ground squirrels may perch because (1) neighbors are perched (copying effect), (2) perch synchrony may be an emergent property of the ecology as all squirrels may be satiated at the same time (collective behavior), or (3) the benefits are large in terms of evading ambush predators and scanning effectiveness (watch each other's back). Particularly, in habitats where the field of view is obstructed by man-made structures and multiple individuals may be necessary to watch for terrestrial predators, synchronized vigilance may have greater fitness benefits than sentinel behavior. We conclude that it is essential to test assumptions of coordination and, thus, to analyze coordination to describe sentinel systems. Significance statement Vigilance behavior can be vital to an animal's survival. Taking turns acting as sentinels or synchronizing vigilance bouts reduces the cost of the trade-off between feeding and predation risk. A sentinel system assumes that sentinels are vigilant from raised positions, warn group members of danger, and alternate vigilance bouts. However, the assumption of alternating vigilance bouts remains poorly tested. We tested this assumption in invasive Barbary ground squirrels. We found that instead of alternating, individuals synchronized their vigilance bouts. Perch synchrony may be (1) a response to perching group members (copying effect), (2) an emergent property of the species' ecology, and (3) an adaptation to anthropogenically altered habitats (watch each other's back).

TI  - Evaluating the Hyperspectral Sensitivity of the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio for Assessing Fire Severity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity represents fire-induced environmental changes and is an important variable for modeling fire emissions and planning post-fire rehabilitation. Remotely sensed fire severity is traditionally evaluated using the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) derived from multispectral imagery. This spectral index is based on bi-temporal differenced reflectance changes caused by fires in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions. Our study aims to evaluate the spectral sensitivity of the dNBR using hyperspectral imagery by identifying the optimal bi-spectral NIR SWIR combination. This assessment made use of a rare opportunity arising from the pre- and post-fire airborne image acquisitions over the 2013 Rim and 2014 King fires in California with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor. The 224 contiguous bands of this sensor allow for 5760 unique combinations of the dNBR at a high spatial resolution of approximately 15 m. The performance of the hyperspectral dNBR was assessed by comparison against field data and the spectral optimality statistic. The field data is composed of 83 in situ measurements of fire severity using the Geometrically structured Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) protocol. The optimality statistic ranges between zero and one, with one denoting an optimal measurement of the fire-induced spectral change. We also combined the field and optimality assessments into a combined score. The hyperspectral dNBR combinations demonstrated strong relationships with GeoCBI field data. The best performance of the dNBR combination was derived from bands 63, centered at 0.962 mu m, and 218, centered at 2.382 mu m. This bi-spectral combination yielded a strong relationship with GeoCBI field data of R-2 = 0.70 based on a saturated growth model and a median spectral index optimality statistic of 0.31. Our hyperspectral sensitivity analysis revealed optimal NIR and SWIR bands for the composition of the dNBR that are outside the ranges of the NIR and SWIR bands of the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 sensors. With the launch of the Precursore Iperspettrale Della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) in 2019 and several planned spaceborne hyperspectral missions, such as the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) and Surface Biology and Geology (SBG), our study provides a timely assessment of the potential and sensitivity of hyperspectral data for assessing fire severity.

TI  - Chaco region: Forest loss and fragmentation in the context of the territorial planning law. Remote sensing assessment in Formosa, Argentina application case
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural expansion is the primary cause of forest loss and fragmentation. It threatens the conservation of its biodiversity as well as the capability to provide ecosystem services. Land-use policies, such as zonation programs, have been traditionally used as a tool for promoting a sustainable natural resource management; however, we still lack standardized methodologies that can be applied world-widely to achieve this purpose. In the current context of rampant deforestation over the tropical forests, there is an urgent need of identifying policies that steer agricultural land-use change into a reduced pressure on forests. This study focuses on the outcomes of the first territorial planning law in the Province of Formosa (Argentina) located within the Chaco region, one of the world's deforestation hotspots. The research questions were: a) How did agriculture expand in Formosa before, during and after the enactment of the territorial planning law? b) Did the introduction of the law affect the spatial distribution of land-use change?; and c) How did the sanction of the law affect forest loss and forest fragmentation? Landsat imagery was used to map land-use change, and to calculate the cover loss and cover loss rate considering the zoning and physiognomic classification of the law. The forest fragmentation was evaluated in terms of forest loss spatial configuration, classified as perforation or shrinkage, forest edge generation, patch size distribution, and patch isolation. The territorial planning law effect over agricultural expansion was tested using a difference in difference model. After the law was passed, a reduced land-use pressure was observed for the forest within the conservation designated zone; however, the forest presented the highest cover loss rates among the physiognomic categories of the law. Land-use change within the conservation designated zone was predominantly made according to a perforation spatial configuration, which promoted the forest edge generation. The isolation between forest patches decreased and its size distribution changed towards a less large-patch-centered pattern, indicating that Formosa is experiencing an early fragmentation process. Overall, the territorial planning law in Formosa succeeded in the relief of land-use pressure on forest, but highlighted the need of incorporating spatial configuration guidelines for long-term forest conservation. The case of Formosa case could be useful in the design of future sustainable natural resource management policies and implies the importance of early natural resource planning.

TI  - Vegetation Resilience under Increasing Drought Conditions in Northern Tanzania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - East Africa is comprised of many semi-arid lands that are characterized by insufficient rainfall and the frequent occurrence of droughts. Drought, overgrazing and other impacts due to human activity may cause a decline in vegetation cover, which may result in land degradation. This study aimed to assess drought occurrence, vegetation cover changes and vegetation resilience in the Monduli and Longido districts in northern Tanzania. Satellite-derived data of rainfall, temperature and vegetation cover were used. Monthly precipitation (CenTrends v1.0 extended with CHIRPS2.0) and monthly mean temperatures (CRU TS4.03) were collected for the period of 1940-2020. Eight-day maximum value composite data of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (NOAA CDR-AVHRR) were obtained for the period of 1981-2020. Based on the meteorological data, trends in rainfall, temperature and drought were determined. The NDVI data were used to determine changes in vegetation cover and vegetation resilience related to the occurrence of drought. Rainfall did not significantly change over the period of 1940-2020, but mean monthly temperatures increased by 1.06 & DEG;C. The higher temperatures resulted in more frequent and prolonged droughts due to higher potential evapotranspiration rates. Vegetation cover declined by 9.7% between 1981 and 2020, which is lower than reported in several other studies, and most likely caused by the enhanced droughts. Vegetation resilience on the other hand is still high, meaning that a dry season or year resulted in lower vegetation cover, but a quick recovery was observed during the next normal or above-normal rainy season. It is concluded that despite the overall decline in vegetation cover, the changes have not been as dramatic as earlier reported, and that vegetation resilience is good in the study area. However, climate change predictions for the area suggest the occurrence of more droughts, which might lead to further vegetation cover decline and possibly a shift in vegetation species to more drought-prone species.

TI  - Incremental Partitioning for Efficient Spatial Data Analytics
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Big spatial data has become ubiquitous, from mobile applications to satellite data. In most of these applications, data is continuously growing to huge volumes. Existing systems for big spatial data organize records at either the record-level or block-level. Systems that use record-level structures include key-value stores and LSM-Tree stores, which support insert and delete operations and they are optimized for highly-selective queries. On the other hand, systems like GeoSpark that use block-level structures (e.g. 128 MB each) are more efficient for analytical queries, but they cannot incrementally maintain the partitioned data and do not support delete operations. This paper proposes a general framework that enables block-level systems to incrementally maintain spatial partitions, in the presence of bulk insertions and deletions, in distributed file system (DES) blocks. We first formally study the incremental spatial partitioning problem for big data and demonstrate its NP-hardness. Then, we propose a cost model to estimate the performance of queries on the partitioned data and the effect of modifying it as the data grows. After that, we provide three different implementations of the incremental partitioning framework. Comprehensive experiments on large real datasets show that our proposed partitioning algorithms outperforms state-of-the-art spatial partitioning methods.

TI  - A Sentinel-1 Backscatter Datacube for Global Land Monitoring Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites allow global monitoring of the Earth's land surface with unprecedented spatio-temporal coverage. Yet, implementing large-scale monitoring capabilities is a challenging task given the large volume of data from Sentinel-1 and the complex algorithms needed to convert the SAR intensity data into higher-level geophysical data products. While on-demand processing solutions have been proposed to cope with the petabyte-scale data volumes, in practice many applications require preprocessed datacubes that permit fast access to multi-year time series and image stacks. To serve near-real-time as well as offline land monitoring applications, we have created a Sentinel-1 backscatter datacube for all continents (except Antarctica) that is constantly being updated and maintained to ensure consistency and completeness of the data record over time. In this technical note, we present the technical specifications of the datacube, means of access and analysis capabilities, and its use in scientific and operational applications.

TI  - Investigating the Effects of <i>k</i> and Area Size on Variance Estimation of Multiple Pixel Areas Using a <i>k</i>-NN Technique for Forest Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining auxiliary variables and field inventory data of forest parameters using the model-based approach is frequently used to produce synthetic estimates for small areas. These small areas arise when it may not be financially feasible to take ground measurements or when such areas are inaccessible. Until recently, these estimates have been calculated without providing a measure of the variance when aggregating multiple pixel areas. This paper uses a Random Forest algorithm to produce estimates of quadratic mean diameter at breast height (QMDBH) (cm), basal area (m2 ha-1), stem density (n/ha-1), and volume (m3 ha-1), and subsequently estimates the variance of multiple pixel areas using a k-NN technique. The area of interest (AOI) is the state owned commercial forests in the Slieve Bloom mountains in the Republic of Ireland, where the main species are Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) and Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.). Field plots were measured in summer 2018 during which a lidar campaign was flown and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery captured, both of which were used as auxiliary variables. Root mean squared error (RMSE%) and R2 values for the modelled estimates of QMDBH, basal area, stem density, and volume were 19% (0.70), 22% (0.67), 28% (0.62), and 26% (0.77), respectively. An independent dataset of pre-harvest forest stands was used to validate the modelled estimates. A comparison of measured values versus modelled estimates was carried out for a range of area sizes with results showing that estimated values in areas less than 10-15 ha in size exhibit greater uncertainty. However, as the size of the area increased, the estimated values became increasingly analogous to the measured values for all parameters. The results of the variance estimation highlighted: (i) a greater value of k was needed for small areas compared to larger areas in order to obtain a similar relative standard deviation (RSD) and (ii) as the area increased in size, the RSD decreased, albeit not indefinitely. These results will allow forest managers to better understand how aspects of this variance estimation technique affect the accuracy of the uncertainty associated with parameter estimates. Utilising this information can provide forest managers with inventories of greater accuracy, therefore ensuring a more informed management decision. These results also add further weight to the applicability of the k-NN variance estimation technique in a range of forests landscapes.

TI  - The Use of Remote Sensing-Based ET Estimates to Improve Global Hydrological Simulations in the Community Land Model Version 5.0
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical component of water and energy cycles, and improving global land evapotranspiration is one of the challenging works in the development of land surface models (LSMs). In this study, we apply a bias correction approach into the Community Land Model version 5.0 (CLM5) globally by utilizing the remote sensing-based ET dataset. Results reveal that the correction approach can alleviate both overestimation and underestimation of ET by CLM5 over the globe. The adjustment to overestimation is generally effective, whereas the effectiveness for underestimation is determined by the ET regime, namely water-limited or energy-limited. In the areas with abundant precipitation, the underestimation is effectively corrected by increasing ET without the water supply limit. In areas with rare precipitation, however, increasing ET is limited by water supply, which leads to an undesirable correction effect. Compared with the ET simulated by CLM5, the bias correction approach can reduce the global-averaged relative bias (RB) and the root mean square error (RMSE) by 51.8% and 65.9% against Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) ET data, respectively. Meanwhile, the correlation coefficient (CC) can also be improved from 0.93 to 0.98. Continentally, the most substantial ET improvement occurs in Asia, with the RB and RMSE decreased by 69.7% (from 7.04% to 2.14%) and 70.2% (from 0.312 mm day(-1) to 0.093 mm day(-1), equivalent to from 114 mm year(-1) to 34 mm year(-1)), and the CC increased from 0.92 to 0.99, respectively. Consequently, benefiting from the improvement of ET, the simulations of runoff and soil moisture are also improved over the globe and each of the six continents, and the improvement varies with region. This study demonstrates that the use of satellite-based ET products is beneficial to hydrological simulations in land surface models over the globe.

TI  - Developing a Method to Extract Building 3D Information from GF-7 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The three-dimensional (3D) information of buildings can describe the horizontal and vertical development of a city. The GaoFen-7 (GF-7) stereo-mapping satellite can provide multi-view and multi-spectral satellite images, which can clearly describe the fine spatial details within urban areas, while the feasibility of extracting building 3D information from GF-7 image remains understudied. This article establishes an automated method for extracting building footprints and height information from GF-7 satellite imagery. First, we propose a multi-stage attention U-Net (MSAU-Net) architecture for building footprint extraction from multi-spectral images. Then, we generate the point cloud from the multi-view image and construct normalized digital surface model (nDSM) to represent the height of off-terrain objects. Finally, the building height is extracted from the nDSM and combined with the results of building footprints to obtain building 3D information. We select Beijing as the study area to test the proposed method, and in order to verify the building extraction ability of MSAU-Net, we choose GF-7 self-annotated building dataset and a public dataset (WuHan University (WHU) Building Dataset) for model testing, while the accuracy is evaluated in detail through comparison with other models. The results are summarized as follows: (1) In terms of building footprint extraction, our method can achieve intersection-over-union indicators of 89.31% and 80.27% for the WHU Dataset and GF-7 self-annotated datasets, respectively; these values are higher than the results of other models. (2) The root mean square between the extracted building height and the reference building height is 5.41 m, and the mean absolute error is 3.39 m. In summary, our method could be useful for accurate and automatic 3D building information extraction from GF-7 satellite images, and have good application potential.

TI  - Monitoring Mining Activities Using Sentinel-1A InSAR Coherence in Open-Pit Coal Mines
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term continuous monitoring of the mining activities in open-pit coal mines is conducive to planning and management of the mining operations. Additionally, this faciliatates assessment on their environmental impact and supervises illegal mining behaviors. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology can be effectively applied in the monitoring of open-pit mines where vegetation is sparse and land cover is dominated by bare rock. The main objective of this study is to monitor the mining activities of four open-pit coal mines in the Wucaiwan mining area in China from 2018 to 2020, namely No. 1, No. 2 (containing two mining areas), and No. 3. We use the normalized differential activity index (NDAI) based on the coherence coefficient as an indicator of the mine activity due to its robustness to temporal and spatial decorrelation. After analyzing and removing the decorrelation caused by rain and snow weather, 70 NDAI images in 12-day intervals are obtained from Sentinel-1A InSAR coherence images. Then, the annually-averaged NDAI images are applied to an RGB composite technique (red for 2018, green for 2019, blue for 2020) to express the interannual variation of the mining activities. Points of interest are then selected for NDAI time series analysis. The RGB composite results indicated that No. 1 and 3 open-pit coal mines were continuously mined during the three years; whereas, the two mining areas of No. 2 were mainly active in 2018. The 12-day NDAI time-series graphs of No. 2 open-pit coal mine also indicate that the coal piles located in the coal transferring area of the first mining area were not completely removed until April 2019. It is also seen that the second mining area was decommissioned in November 2018 and became rehabilitated in July 2019. Results were validated using the Sentinel-2A images and related background information confirming the efficiency of the proposed approach for monitoring the mining activity in open-pit mines.

TI  - Stitching and Geometric Modeling Approach Based on Multi-Slice Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time delay and integration (TDI) charge-coupled device (CCD) is an image sensor for capturing images of moving objects at low light levels. This study examines the model construction of stitched TDI CCD original multi-slice images. The traditional approaches, for example, include the image-space-oriented algorithm and the object-space-oriented algorithm. The former indicates concise principles and high efficiency, whereas the panoramic stitching images lack the clear geometric relationships generated from the image-space-oriented algorithm. Similarly, even though the object-space-oriented algorithm generates an image with a clear geometric relationship, it is time-consuming due to the complicated and intensive computational demands. In this study, we developed a multi-slice satellite images stitching and geometric model construction method. The method consists of three major steps. First, the high-precision reference data assist in block adjustment and obtain the original slice image bias-corrected RFM to perform multi-slice image block adjustment. The second process generates the panoramic stitching image by establishing the image coordinate conversion relationship from the panoramic stitching image to the original multi-slice images. The final step is dividing the panoramic stitching image uniformly into image grids and employing the established image coordinate conversion relationship and the original multi-slice image bias-corrected RFM to generate a virtual control grid to construct the panoramic stitching image RFM. To evaluate the performance, we conducted experiments using the Tianhui-1(TH-1) high-resolution image and the Ziyuan-3(ZY-3) triple liner-array image data. The experimental results show that, compared with the object-space-oriented algorithm, the stitching accuracy loss of the generated panoramic stitching image was only 0.2 pixels and that the mean value was 0.799798 pixels, achieving the sub-pixel stitching requirements. Compared with the object-space-oriented algorithm, the RFM positioning difference of the panoramic stitching image was within 0.3 m, which achieves equal positioning accuracy.

TI  - Extraction of City Roads Using Luojia 1-01 Nighttime Light Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of a road network is critical for city planning and has been widely studied in previous research using high resolution images, whereas the high cost of high-resolution remote sensing data and the complexity of its analysis also cause huge challenges for the extraction. The successful launch of a high resolution (130 m) nighttime remote sensing satellite, Luojia 1-01, provides great potential in the study of urban issues. This study attempted to extract city roads using a Luojia 1-01 nighttime lighting image. The urban regions were firstly distinguished through a threshold method. Then, an unsupervised PCNN (pulse coupled neural network) was established to extract the road networks in urban regions. A series of optimizing methods was proposed to enhance the image contrast and eliminate the residential regions along the roads. The final extraction results after optimizing were compared with OSM (OpenStreetMap) data, showing the high precision of the proposed approach with the accuracy rate reaching 83.2%. We also found the precision of city centers to be lower than suburban regions due to the influence of intensive human activities. Our study confirms the potential of Luojia 1-01 data in the extraction of city roads and provides new thought for more complex and microscopic study of city issues.

TI  - Partial Shape Recognition for Sea Ice Motion Retrieval in the Marginal Ice Zone from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an algorithm for computing ice drift in the marginal ice zone (MIZ), based on partial shape recognition. With the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, and the low sensitivity to atmospheric influences of Sentinel-1, a considerable quantity of ice floes is identified using a mathematical morphology method. Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity of segmented ice floes. It is tolerant to perturbations and deficiencies of floe shapes, which enhances the density of retrieved sea ice motion vectors. The PHD algorithm can be applied to sequential images from different sensors, and was tested on two combined image mosaics consisting of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data acquired over the Fram Strait; the PHD algorithm successfully produced pairs of matched ice floes. The matching result has been verified using shape and surface texture similarity of the ice floes. Moreover, the present method can naturally be extended to the problem of multi-source sea ice image registration.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Impervious Surface Expansion in the Qinhuai River Basin, China, 1988-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces are key indicators for urbanization monitoring and watershed degradation assessment over space and time. However, most empirical studies only extracted impervious surface from spatial, temporal or spectral perspectives, paying less attention to integrating multiple dimensions in acquiring continuous changes in impervious surfaces. In this study, we proposed a neighborhood-based spatio-temporal filter (NSTF) to obtain the continuous change information of impervious surfaces from multi-temporal Landsat images in the Qinhuai River Basin (QRB), Jiangsu, China from 1988-2017, based on the results from semi-automatic decision tree classification. Moreover, we used the expansion intensity index (EII) and the landscape extension index (LEI) to further characterize the spatio-temporal characteristics of impervious surfaces on different spatial scales. The preliminary results showed that the overall accuracies of the final classification were about 95%, with the kappa coefficients ranging between 0.9 and 0.96. The QRB underwent rapid urbanization with the percentage of the impervious surfaces increasing from 2.72% in 1988 to 25.6% in 2017. Since 2006, the center of urbanization expansion was shaped from the urban built-up areas of Nanjing and Jiangning to non-urban built-up areas of the Jiangning, Lishui, and Jurong districts. The edge expansion occupied 73% on average among the different landscape expansion types, greatly beyond outlying (12%) and infilling (15%). The window size in the NSTF has a direct impact on the subsequent analysis. Our research could provide decision-making references for future urban planning and development in the similar basins.

TI  - Requirement-driven remote sensing metadata planning and online acquisition method for large-scale heterogeneous data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data acquisition is one of the most essential processes in the field of Earth observation. However, traditional methods to acquire data do not satisfy the requirements of current applications because large-scale data processing is required. To address this issue, this paper proposes a data acquisition framework that carries out remote sensing metadata planning and then realizes the online acquisition of large amounts of data. Firstly, this paper establishes a unified metadata cataloging model and realizes the catalog of metadata in a local database. Secondly, a coverage calculation model is presented, which can show users the data coverage information in a selected geographical region under the data requirements of a specific application. Finally, according to the data retrieval results and the coverage calculation, a machine-to-machine interface is provided to acquire target remote sensing data. Experiments were conducted to verify the availability and practicality of the proposed framework, and the results show the strengths and powerful capabilities of our framework by overcoming deficiencies in traditional methods. It also achieved the online automatic acquisition of large-scale heterogeneous remote sensing data, which can provide guidance for remote sensing data acquisition strategies.

TI  - A General Framework of Remote Sensing Epipolar Image Generation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Epipolar images can improve the efficiency and accuracy of dense matching by restricting the search range of correspondences from 2-D to 1-D, which play an important role in 3-D reconstruction. As most of the satellite images in archives are incidental collections, which do not have rigorous stereo properties, in this paper, we propose a general framework to generate epipolar images for both in-track and cross-track stereo images. We first investigate the theoretical epipolar constraints of single-sensor and multi-sensor images and then introduce the proposed framework in detail. Considering large elevation changes in mountain areas, the publicly available digital elevation model (DEM) is applied to reduce the initial offsets of two stereo images. The left image is projected into the image coordinate system of the right image using the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). By dividing the raw images into several blocks, the epipolar images of each block are parallel generated through a robust feature matching method and fundamental matrix estimation, in which way, the horizontal disparity can be drastically reduced while maintaining negligible vertical disparity for epipolar blocks. Then, stereo matching using the epipolar blocks can be easily implemented and the forward intersection method is used to generate the digital surface model (DSM). Experimental results on several in-track and cross-track images, including optical-optical, SAR-SAR, and SAR-optical pairs, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which not only has obvious advantages in mountain areas with large elevation changes but also can generate high-quality epipolar images for flat areas. The generated epipolar images of a ZiYuan-3 pair in Songshan are further utilized to produce a high-precision DSM.

TI  - Ship Detection in SAR Images via Enhanced Nonnegative Sparse Locality-Representation of Fisher Vectors
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a powerful coding strategy for superpixels in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, Fisher vector (FV) lies in a low-dimensional subspace and can be sparsely represented as a linear combination of training samples. The existing ship detection methods based on FVs often consider the Euclidean distances between target FVs and clutter FVs, where the subspace features of FVs are generally not exploited. In this article, we propose a new ship detection algorithm based on nonnegative sparse locality-representation (NSLR) to exploit the subspace features of FVs. The proposed NSLR method is based on the assumption that FVs of superpixels in SAR images are sparsely represented by the dictionary of background sea clutter only under a null hypothesis. In addition, we propose two FV-based filters to enhance the robustness of our newly developed NSLR to heterogeneous sea clutter environments by further exploiting the intrinsic features of ship targets in terms of intensity and spatiality. The experimental results based on Gaofen-3 SAR images demonstrate that the proposed NSLR detection method provides higher target-to-clutter contrast and achieves better detection performance than other commonly used ship detection algorithms.

TI  - Lightweight Deep Neural Network Method for Water Body Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images with Multisensors
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate extraction of water bodies from high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images is of great value for water resource management, water quality monitoring and natural disaster emergency response. For traditional water body extraction methods, it is difficult to select image texture and features, the shadows of buildings and other ground objects are in the same spectrum as water bodies, the existing deep convolutional neural network is difficult to train, the consumption of computing resources is large, and the methods cannot meet real-time requirements. In this paper, a water body extraction method based on lightweight MobileNetV2 is proposed and applied to multisensor high-resolution remote sensing images, such as GF-2, WorldView-2 and UAV orthoimages. This method was validated in two typical complex geographical scenes: water bodies for farmland irrigation, which have a broken shape and long and narrow area and are surrounded by many buildings in towns and villages; and water bodies in mountainous areas, which have undulating topography, vegetation coverage and mountain shadows all over. The results were compared with those of the support vector machine, random forest and U-Net models and also verified by generalization tests and the influence of spatial resolution changes. First, the results show that the F1-score and Kappa coefficients of the MobileNetV2 model extracting water bodies from three different high-resolution images were 0.75 and 0.72 for GF-2, 0.86 and 0.85 for Worldview-2 and 0.98 and 0.98 for UAV, respectively, which are higher than those of traditional machine learning models and U-Net. Second, the training time, number of parameters and calculation amount of the MobileNetV2 model were much lower than those of the U-Net model, which greatly improves the water body extraction efficiency. Third, in other more complex surface areas, the MobileNetV2 model still maintained relatively high accuracy of water body extraction. Finally, we tested the effects of multisensor models and found that training with lower and higher spatial resolution images combined can be beneficial, but that using just lower resolution imagery is ineffective. This study provides a reference for the efficient automation of water body classification and extraction under complex geographical environment conditions and can be extended to water resource investigation, management and planning.

TI  - Research on Fire Point Monitoring Based on GaoFen-4 Satellite Data With Bright Temperature Difference Correction
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - GF-4 can provide stable data for disaster prevention and mitigation, and its mid-infrared sensor can be well applied in rapid-fire monitoring. Because of lacking far-infrared, the spectral information that GF-4 provided is supplementary data as usual. Affected by a single band, the commission error and omission error of the adaptive threshold method is high. Therefore, to probe the potential of GF-4 data and improve the accuracy of fire point recognition, this study analyzed the characteristics of GF-4 data and proposed a fire point detection method with brightness temperature difference correction based on dual temporal image. The method mainly includes three parts : brightness temperature compensation acquisition based on Kriging interpolation on temporal scale, adaptive threshold segmentation on a spatial scale based on contextual information, and fire point detection, with two images-before and during the fire event. Firstly, the difference between the two images is processed. Moreover, we use this difference of non-polluted pixels in the dynamic neighborhood around the potential fire point as the sampling data for spatial interpolation and then substitute the result of the previous step into the first image. Finally, using discrimination conditions for fire point discrimination and false alarm elimination get the final results. The study also compares three spatial interpolation acquisitions : Inverse Distance Weigh, Simple Kriging and Ordinary Kriging. From the fitting results, the Ordinary Kriging can reflect the volatility of the pixel area and has a certain smoothing effect to avoid peaks of background brightness temperature, which is the better method. The study area contains two fires in Qinyuan, Shanxi Province and New Barhu Right Bannerin, Inner Mongolia. Results show that compared with the traditional single time phase algorithm, introducing brightness temperature difference correction data can better fit the background brightness temperature, reducing the commission error to 3% and obtaining comprehensive evaluation index F-beta above 0. 9. This developed method could be used to support automatic fire point detection and extraction in future studies.

TI  - Automated and Operational Access to Environmental Data for Alaska's Management Areas.
T2  - NOAA AFSC Processed Reports
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of operational satellite data has facilitated new capabilities for downstream data products with fisheries applications. The Alaska Fisheries Science Center and Alaska Fisheries Information Network (AKFIN) have utilized such data accessibility to streamline use of satellite sea surface temperature ( SST) data. We briefly describe three gridded satellite data sets and we present two data products that are updated automatically and regularly in a database backend: 1) satellite SST data linked to spatial management regions across Alaska and 2) spatially-explicit fishery-dependent data (e.g., observer, fish ticket, and vessel monitoring system (VMS) data) linked with satellite SST data. Full gridded data sets apportioned to management areas can be queried from the AKFIN database. Alternatively, aggregated data products (e.g., time series of SST for individual management regions or ecosystem areas) can be accessed via a custom AKFIN SST web service. We demonstrate several queries of the web service and illustrate how this product can yield seamless integration with downstream analyses; for example, analyzing time series of SST for relevant spatial regions using only a few lines of code. For fisheries-dependent sources, SST data were linked to fish tickets, observer, and VMS in the Oracle backend from 2002 to the present (millions of records), and new data are automatically matched each day. The coding examples that we provide demonstrate how little code is required to plot and analyze spatially-explicit time series of SST, the SST at which a particular species is caught in trawl fisheries, and how to quickly generate heatmaps of SST using the AKFIN process. These simple demonstrations are indicative of new efficiencies to be gained through integration of AKFIN tools into our data management system and we describe opportunities for expansion of these services.

TI  - An Object- and Topology-Based Analysis (OTBA) Method for Mapping Rice-Crayfish Fields in South China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rice-crayfish field (i.e., RCF), a newly emerging rice cultivation pattern, has greatly expanded in China in the last decade due to its significant ecological and economic benefits. The spatial distribution of RCFs is an important dataset for crop planting pattern adjustment, water resource management and yield estimation. Here, an object- and topology-based analysis (OTBA) method, which considers spectral-spatial features and the topological relationship between paddy fields and their enclosed ditches, was proposed to identify RCFs. First, we employed an object-based method to extract crayfish breeding ditches using very high-resolution images. Subsequently, the paddy fields that provide fodder for crayfish were identified according to the topological relationship between the paddy field and circumjacent crayfish ditch. The extracted ditch objects together with those paddy fields were merged to derive the final RCFs. The performance of the OTBA method was carefully evaluated using the RCF and non-RCF samples. Moreover, the effects of different spatial resolutions, spectral bands and temporal information on RCF identification were comprehensively investigated. Our results suggest the OTBA method performed well in extracting RCFs, with an overall accuracy of 91.77%. Although the mapping accuracies decreased as the image spatial resolution decreased, satisfactory RCF mapping results (> 80%) can be achieved at spatial resolutions greater than 2 m. Additionally, we demonstrated that the mapping accuracy can be improved by more than 10% when near-infrared (NIR) band information was involved, indicating the necessity of the NIR band when selecting images to derive reliable RCF maps. Furthermore, the images acquired in the rice growth phase are recommended to maximize the differences of spectral characteristics between paddy fields and ditches. These promising findings suggest that the OTBA approach performs well for mapping RCFs in areas with fragmented agricultural landscapes, which provides fundamental information for further agricultural land use and water resources management.

AB  - Introduction The aim of the study was to explore the feasibility of performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using a carbon nanoparticle suspension (CNPS) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.Methods Some 152 patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer (cT1-3N0-2M0) were recruited. Patients were divided into two groups according to axillary lymph node (ALN) status after four to six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients received a CNPS injection, after which SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were performed.Results Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) of 143 patients were identified; with an accuracy rate of 94.4% and a false-negative rate of 9.9%. Group A included 67 patients, and the detection, accuracy and false-negative rates within this group were 95.5%, 96.9% and 6.7%, respectively. The corresponding rates for group B (85 patients) were 92.9%, 92.4% and 11.8%, respectively.Conclusions CNPS is an ideal tracer for improving the detection rate of SLN and can be used to determine SLN status following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Sentinel-Based Inventory of Thermokarst Lakes and Ponds Across Permafrost Landscapes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermokarst lakes and ponds (hereafter referred to as thaw lakes) play an important role in the permafrost regions by regulating hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry. However, detailed quantitative information on thaw lake extent and distribution remains poorly resolved across the entire permafrost regions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Here, we applied the random forest (RF) model and manual visual vectorization methods to extract thaw lake boundaries on the QTP based on Sentinel-2 images. Accuracy assessment was comprehensively demonstrated regarding the inherent spatial resolution of imagery and RF model performance. The results showed that the accumulated uncertainty of the total thaw lake area was +/- 5.75 km(2), and the mean accuracy (91.9%) from field-measured boundaries of 132 thaw lakes supported the accuracy of this inventory. A total of similar to 161,300 thaw lakes with sizes ranging from 500 m(2) to 3 km(2) were detected, with a total area of similar to 2,825.45 +/- 5.75 km(2). Most thaw lakes were detected in the continuous permafrost type (94.1%) and within the elevations of 4,500-5,000 m (68.4%). The small thaw lakes (<10,000 m(2)) predominated the total lake number (78.9%) but contributed to a small portion of the total lake area (12.7%). Spatial distributions of thaw lakes in terms of different climatic and environmental conditions were also comprehensively explored, including temperature, precipitation, ground thermal stability, active layer thickness, vegetation, soil properties, and underground ice content. This inventory is expected to be incorporated into Earth system models for a more comprehensive projection of the large-scale biogeochemical feedback of thermokarst landforms on the QTP under continued global warming.Plain Language Summary Thaw lakes develop when warming soil melts ground ice, causing the surface to collapse and form pools of water. Such lakes can greatly influence local water resources and ecosystems, but also are important sources of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere. Using Sentinel-2 images, we provided robust information of thaw lake numbers, areas, and spatial distributions across the entire QTP permafrost regions by applying the random forest model and manual visual vectorization methods. The accuracy of the data set has been demonstrated in regard to the image spatial resolution, model performance, and field-measured results. Within sizes ranging from 500 m(2) to 3 km(2), we extracted similar to 161,300 thaw lakes with a total area of similar to 2,825.45 +/- 5.75 km(2). We found that most thaw lakes were located in the continuous permafrost regions and within the elevations of 4,500-5,000 m. Most thaw lake sizes were smaller than 10,000 m(2) but they only contributed to a little percentage of the total lake area. We also comprehensively explored the spatial distributions of thaw lakes in different climatic and environmental areas. This inventory would be useful for future Earth system models to predict the large-scale biogeochemical feedback of thaw lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the future.

TI  - Endosalpingiosis Is Negative for GATA3 A Useful Marker for Distinguishing Metastatic Breast Carcinoma From a Benign Mimicker
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context.-Endosalpingiosis is a benign Mu spacing diaeresis llerian inclusion that can mimic metastatic low-grade mammary carcinoma, particularly when encountered in axillary lymph nodes excised for breast cancer staging. Immunohistochemistry can be useful in histologically ambiguous cases, and a targeted immunopanel should include a marker of gynecologic tract origin and a marker of mammary origin. GATA3 is a sensitive immunomarker for breast carcinoma, but the immunoreactivity of GATA3 in endosalpingiosis has not been systematically evaluated.Objective.-To evaluate whether GATA3 immunohistochemistry could be used to differentiate endosalpingiosis from metastatic mammary carcinoma.Design.-Whole slide sections of 15 cases of endosalpingiosis involving nonneoplastic tissues were subjected to GATA3 immunohistochemistry. Nuclear GATA3 labeling was scored as percentage and intensity labeling, with any labeling considered positive; GATA3 labeling was recorded in all cells present in the sections.Results.-Half (47%, n = 7 of 15) of the endosalpingiosis cases involved lymph nodes (2 axillary, 5 pelvic) and half (53%, n = 8 of 15) involved pelvic organs or soft tissue (3 myometrial, 2 paratubal, 2 periadnexal soft tissue, and 1 pelvic sidewall). GATA3 immunohistochemistry was negative in all cases of endosalpingiosis, with intact, positive control labeling in lymphocytes. The benign fallopian tube epithelium present on the sections of paratubal endosalpingiosis displayed focal (<5%), weak labeling for GATA3, specifically within the ciliated and secretory cells.Conclusions.-These findings support the diagnostic utility of GATA3 immunohistochemistry and its use in a targeted immunopanel to resolve the differential diagnosis of metastatic low-grade mammary carcinoma (GATA3E) and nodal endosalpingiosis (GATA3(-)).

TI  - Evidence of Episodic Nitrate Injections in the Oligotrophic North Pacific Associated With Surface Chlorophyll Blooms
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Summer blooms of chlorophyll develop in the oligotrophic North Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and 30 degrees N. It is thought that episodic injections of subsurface nutrients fuel these blooms, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Here data from Biogeochemical-Argo floats are examined to look for evidence of subsurface mixing that could stimulate these surface chlorophyll features. Data are examined from 25 floats that measured 5,569 profiles near Hawaii between September 2002 to April 2021. Since not all floats had nitrate sensors, but all floats had oxygen sensors, nitrate concentrations were calculated from oxygen measurements using the "CArbonate system and Nutrients concentration from hYdrological properties and Oxygen using a Neural-network" model. There were 14 times when the nitracline, defined as the depth where nitrate is 1 mu mol kg(-1), reached 100 m during the summer (June-September). In six of these 14 episodes, the nitracline anomaly was the result of shoaling isopycnals. During the other eight episodes nitrate increased along isopycnal surfaces, indicating diapycnal mixing was occurring. In these events, referred to as injection events, perturbations to the vertical nitrate distribution extended all the way down to 300 m depth, and lasted up to 3.5 months, spanning hundreds of kilometer. Seven of the eight injection events occurred within cyclonic eddies, one occurred within an anticyclonic eddy. The timing of the injection events often coincided with a change in eddy dynamics, either eddy speed or eddy transformation. The injection events in cyclonic eddies were followed by a surface increase in chlorophyll in the surrounding area as observed in satellite data.

TI  - Molecular Characterization of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolated from the Intensive Care Unit in a Tertiary Teaching Hospital in Malaysia
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has now become a global sentinel event. CRAB infections often instigate severe clinical complications and are potentially fatal, especially for debilitated patients. The present study aimed to conduct molecular characterization on CRAB isolated from patients in the intensive care unit from 2015 to 2016 and determine the risk factors associated with patients' mortality. One hundred CRAB isolates were retrospectively selected and included in this study. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that all isolates remained susceptible to colistin, even though 62% of them conferred resistance to all other classes of antibiotics tested. OXA carbapenemase gene was found to be the predominant carbapenemase gene, with 99% of the isolates coharbouring bla(OXA-23)-like and bla(OXA-51)-like carbapenemase genes. All isolates were carrying intact CarO genes, with the presence of various degree of nucleotide insertion, deletion and substitution. Overall, PFGE subtyped the isolates into 13 distinct pulsotypes, with the presence of 2 predominant pulsotypes. Univariate analysis implied that age, infection/colonization by CRAB, ethnicity, comorbidity and CRAB specimen source were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Multivariate analysis identified a higher risk of mortality for patients who are of Chinese ethnicity with diabetes as an underlying disease. As CRAB infection could lead to high rate of mortality, comprehensive infection control measures are needed to minimize the spread of this pathogen.

TI  - Characterizing Buoy Wind Speed Error in High Winds and Varying Sea State with ASCAT and ERA5
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Buoys provide key observations of wind speed over the ocean and are routinely used as a source of validation data for satellite wind products. However, the movement of buoys in high seas and the airflow over waves might cause inaccurate readings, raising concern when buoys are used as a source of wind speed comparison data. The relative accuracy of buoy winds is quantified through a triple collocation (TC) exercise comparing buoy winds to winds from ASCAT and ERA5. Differences between calibrated buoy winds and ASCAT are analyzed through separating the residuals by anemometer height and testing under high wind-wave and swell conditions. First, we converted buoy winds measured near 3, 4, and 5 m to stress-equivalent winds at 10 m (U10S). Buoy U10S from anemometers near 3 m compared notably lower than buoy U10S from anemometers near 4 and 5 m, illustrating the importance of buoy choice in comparisons with remote sensing data. Using TC calibration of buoy U10S to ASCAT in pure wind-wave conditions, we found that there was a small, but statistically significant difference between height adjusted buoy winds from buoys with 4 and 5 m anemometers compared to the same ASCAT wind speed ranges in high seas. However, this result does not follow conventional arguments for wave sheltering of buoy winds, whereby the lower anemometer height winds are distorted more than the higher anemometer height winds in high winds and high seas. We concluded that wave sheltering is not significantly affecting the winds from buoys between 4 and 5 m with high confidence for winds under 18 ms(-1). Further differences between buoy U10S and ASCAT winds are observed in high swell conditions, motivating the need to consider the possible effects of sea state on ASCAT winds.

TI  - Characteristics of new adult users of mepolizumab with asthma in the USA
T2  - BMJ OPEN RESPIRATORY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the USA, over 25 million people have asthma; 5%-10% of cases are severe. Mepolizumab (Nucala) is an interleukin-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody; it was approved by the FDA in 2015 as add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma for patients aged >= 12 years with an eosinophilic phenotype.Objectives (1) Describe baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of new US adult mepolizumab users 20152019, (2) describe asthma medication use in the 12 months preceding initiation of and concomitant with mepolizumab and (3) assess mepolizumab adherence, persistence and discontinuation patterns in 12 months postinitiation.Methods We conducted a new-user observational cohort study using data from Aetna, a CVS Health Company, HealthCore (Anthem), Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, and IBM MarketScan Research Databases. Curated administrative claims data in the FDA Sentinel System common data model format and publicly available Sentinel analytical tools were used to query the databases. We included adults who initiated mepolizumab in 2015-2019 with an asthma diagnosis in the preceding 12 months and no evidence of cystic fibrosis. We examined age, sex, comorbid conditions, asthma medication use and severe asthma exacerbations.Results We identified 3496 adults (mean age 54.2 years, SD 12.5 years) who initiated mepolizumab. In the 12 months before mepolizumab initiation, 22% had received inhaled corticosteroids, 46% had inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta agonists, 72.6% had leukotriene antagonists, 38% had long-acting muscarinic antagonist, 18% had omalizumab,<1% had reslizumab, dupilumab or benralizumab. In the previous 12 months, 70% had a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, 32% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 17% eosinophilia and 3% eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Further, 56% had an asthma-related ambulatory visit, 73%>= 1 course of oral corticosteroids lasting 3-27 days, 10% an asthma-related emergency department visit and 22% an asthma-related hospitalisation. In the 12 months following initiation, the mean proportion of days covered was 70%, and reductions in the average mean dispensings of rescue oral corticosteriods (35%) and omalizumab (61%) were observed.Conclusions Adults with asthma treated with mepolizumab had varying levels of healthcare utilisation and we observed evidence of mepolizumab use in patients without severe asthma.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Ecological Vulnerability and Driving Factor Analysis in the Dongjiang River Basin, China, in the Recent 20 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global ecological environment faces many challenges. Landsat thematic mapper time-series, digital elevation models, meteorology, soil types, net primary production data, socio-economic data, and auxiliary data were collected in order to construct a comprehensive evaluation system for ecological vulnerability (EV) using multi-source remote sensing data. EV was divided into five vulnerability levels: potential I, slight II, mild III, moderate IV, and severe V. Then, we analyzed and explored the spatio-temporal patterns and driving mechanisms of EV in the region over the past 20 years. Our research results showed that, from 2001 to 2019, the DRB was generally characterized as being in the severe vulnerability class, with higher upstream and downstream EV classes and a certain amount of reduction in the midstream EV classes. Moreover, EV in the DRB continues to decrease. The spatio-temporal EV patterns in the DRB were significantly influenced by the relative humidity, average annual temperature, and vegetation cover over the past 20 years. Our work can provide a basis for decision-making and technical support for ecosystem protection, ecological restoration, and ecological management in the DRB.

TI  - Surface Chlorophyll-A Fronts in the Yellow and Bohai Seas Based on Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll fronts are important to monitor and map the oceanic front, especially in the season when sea surface temperature (SST) fronts weaken. In this study, surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) fronts in the Yellow and Bohai seas were characterized for the first time using satellite data. Five distinct chl-a fronts (i.e., the Bohai Strait, Shandong Peninsula, Jiangsu, Liaodong Peninsula, and Korean Peninsula fronts) were observed in summer along the 40 m isobaths and faded in other seasons. Notably, these fronts coincided with SST fronts. Strong chl-a fronts emerged during summer due to chl-a blooms in eutrophic coastal waters paired with surface chl-a fading in strongly stratified offshore waters and coastal physical fronts. Although SST fronts were strong during winter, light limitation and strong vertical mixing in offshore waters led to low chl-a in both coastal and offshore waters, suppressing chl-a front formation. Both chl-a and SST fronts coincided with steep seabed slopes (slope ratio > 1), suggesting that seabed slope may be an indicator of oceanic front location.

TI  - Improved Filtering of ICESat-2 Lidar Data for Nearshore Bathymetry Estimation Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of nearshore bathymetry is necessary for multiple aspects of coastal research and practices. The traditional shipborne single-beam/multi-beam echo sounders and Airborne Lidar bathymetry (ALB) have a high cost, are inefficient, and have sparse coverage. The Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) method has been proven to be a promising tool in obtaining bathymetric data in shallow water. However, current empirical SDB methods for multispectral imagery data usually rely on in situ depths as control points, severely limiting their spatial application. This study proposed a satellite-derived bathymetry method without requiring a priori in situ data by merging active and passive remote sensing (SDB-AP). It realizes rapid bathymetric mapping with only satellite remotely sensed data, which greatly extends the spatial coverage and temporal scale. First, seafloor photons were detected from the ICESat-2 raw photons based on an improved adaptive Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, which could calculate the optimal detection parameters for seafloor photons by adaptive iteration. Then, the bathymetry of the detected seafloor photons was corrected because of the refraction that occurs at the air-water interface. Afterward, the outlier photons were removed by an outlier-removal algorithm to improve the retrieval accuracy. Subsequently, the high spatial resolution (0.7 m) ICESat-2 derived bathymetry data were gridded to match the Sentinel-2 data with a lower spatial resolution (10 m). All of the ICESate-2 gridded data were randomly separated into two parts: 80% were employed to train the empirical bathymetric model, and the remaining 20% were used to quantify the inversion accuracy. Finally, after merging the ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps over St. Thomas of the United States Virgin Islands, Acklins Island in the Bahamas, and Huaguang Reef in the South China Sea were produced. The ICESat-2-derived results were compared against in situ data over the St. Thomas area. The results showed that the estimated bathymetry reached excellent inversion accuracy and the corresponding RMSE was 0.68 m. In addition, the RMSEs between the SDB-AP estimated depths and the ICESat-2 bathymetry results of St. Thomas, Acklins Island, and Huaguang Reef were 0.96 m, 0.91 m, and 0.94 m, respectively. Overall, the above results indicate that the SDB-AP method is effective and feasible for different shallow water regions. It has great potential for large-scale and long-term nearshore bathymetry in the future.

TI  - A Planimetric Location Method for Laser Footprints of the Chinese Gaofen-7 Satellite Using Laser Spot Center Detection and Image Matching to Stereo Image Product
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite stereo mapping, together with laser altimetry, can be used to obtain three-dimensional geospatial information. Spaceborne laser altimeter can provide high-accuracy elevation information; however, due to the lack of detailed intensity information, its planimetric accuracy is usually worse than the ranging accuracy. The Chinese Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite, which was designed for civilian mapping application, was launched on November 3, 2019. The GF-7 satellite's main payloads are a laser altimeter system (with footprint camera) and a dual-linear charge-coupled device (CCD) mapping camera. According to the pixel coordinate of the laser footprint in the stereo image, the laser altimeter together with the footprint camera can provide planimetric geodetic coordinates for the control points of a higher accuracy than the other traditional satellite laser altimeters, and represents a new technology for satellite mapping. In this article, a laser footprint planimetric location method for the GF-7 satellite is proposed. The method is designed based on the main payload characteristics of GF-7 and the working modes of the laser altimeter by the combined use of subpixel phase correlation image matching and four types of laser spot center detection methods. The planimetric positioning accuracies of the laser spots in urban, suburban, farmland, forest, mountainous, and ice sheet areas were also analyzed. The experimental results show that the accuracy of planimetric location relative to stereo image for the laser footprint is 0.3-1.0 m (except for ice sheets similar to 12 m) when the footprint camera works under the synchronous mode, and 0.2-0.4 m when the footprint camera works under asynchronous mode (AM).

TI  - Integration of a Crop Growth Model and Deep Learning Methods to Improve Satellite-Based Yield Estimation of Winter Wheat in Henan Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate regional crop-yield estimates are crucial for guiding agronomic practices and policies to improve food security. In this study, a crop-growth model was integrated with time series of remotely sensed data through deep learning (DL) methods to improve the accuracy of regional wheat-yield estimations in Henan Province, China. Firstly, the time series of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were input into the long short-term memory network (LSTM) model to identify the wheat-growing region, which was further used to estimate wheat areas at the municipal and county levels. Then, the leaf area index (LAI) and grain-yield time series simulated by the Crop Environment REsource Synthesis for Wheat (CERES-Wheat) model were used to train and evaluate the LSTM, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) and random forest (RF) models, respectively. Finally, an exponential model of the relationship between the field-measured LAI and MODIS NDVI was applied to obtain the regional LAI, which was input into the trained LSTM, 1-D CNN and RF models to estimate wheat yields within the wheat-growing region. The results showed that the linear correlations between the estimated wheat areas and the statistical areas were significant at both the municipal and county levels. The LSTM model provided more accurate estimates of wheat yields, with higher R-2 values and lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) values than the 1-D CNN and RF models. The LSTM model has an inherent advantage in capturing phenological information contained in the time series of the MODIS-derived LAI, which is important for satellite-based crop-yield estimates.

TI  - Integrated flood potential index for flood monitoring in the GRACE era
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - By utilizing Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and remote sensing precipitation data, Flood Potential Index (FPI) has been widely used in large-scale flood monitoring. However, divergent post-processing dynamics of different GRACE solutions result in substantial uncertainties in GRACE TWSA and thus affecting predictive skills of FPI. To overcome this, this study develops an Integrated Flood Potential Index (IFPI) by linking the FPI derived from six GRACE products. The Gaussian copula is employed to establish the joint distribution of FPI from six spherical harmonic (SH) products and mass concentration blocks solutions. One of the most flood-prone regions, Yangtze River basin in China, is selected as a case study. We have identified and characterized the floods with different intensities using IFPI, which is evaluated against standardized discharge observations as well as the Total Storage Deficit Index (TSDI), Water Storage Deficit Index (WSDI) and Combined Climatologic Deviation Index (CCDI). Results show that the area under curve (AUC) values of IFPI for different levels of floods are generally greater than FPIs and their ensemble mean, implying the better predictive skill for the large-scale flood events. During the three severest floods in 2010, 2015, and 2016, IFPI captures the flood variability exhibited by TSDI, WSDI, and CCDI, as well as hydrological observations. This proposed approach might provide reference for flood monitoring and from multimission satellite data.

TI  - SPB-Net: A Deep Network for SAR Imaging and Despeckling With Downsampled Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) typically faces both large-scale data and speckle noise problems, which, respectively, induce enormous strains on transmission and storage and interfere with the analysis and interpretation of SAR images. To tackle these, we present a real-time processing deep network, called SPB-Net, to implement imaging and speckle suppression simultaneously. First, a novel imaging-despeckling observation model with the nonlogarithmic additive speckle noise is established. Subsequently, guided by the statistical properties of noise and sparse and detail-preserved requirements in SAR imaging and despeckling, we formulate an L-2 along with two L-1 regularizations as the fidelity, sparse, and image detail-preserved constraints, respectively. Convolution layers are employed to improve the feature representation capability in the latter L-1 term as well. Based on this, we construct a corresponding convex optimization problem. Then, the complex-valued split Bregman method, focusing on the complex-variable convex problem, is unfolded into a parameter-learnable and architecture-fixed SPB-Net to solve the proposed problem effectively and efficiently. Experimental results with the downsampled Radarsat-1 raw data demonstrate the validity in imaging and speckle suppression and the real-time processing capability of the proposed SPB-Net.

TI  - Evaluation of the Simulation of Typhoon Lekima (2019) Based on Different Physical Parameterization Schemes and FY-3D Satellite's MWHS-2 Data Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the case of super typhoon Lekima, which landed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province on 4 August 2019, is numerically simulated. Based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, the sensitivity experiments are carried out with different combinations of physical parameterization schemes. The results show that microphysical schemes have obvious impacts on the simulation of the typhoon's track, while the intensity of the simulated typhoon is more sensitive to surface physical schemes. Based on the results of the typhoon's track and intensity simulation, one parameterization scheme was further selected to provide the background field for the following data assimilation experiments. Using the three-dimensional variational (3DVar) data assimilation method, the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) radiance data onboard the Fengyun-3D satellite (FY-3D) were assimilated for this case. It was found that the assimilation of the FY-3D MWHS-2 radiance data was able to optimize the initial field of the numerical model in terms of the model variables, especially for the humidity. Finally, by the inspection of the typhoon's track and intensity forecast, it was found that the assimilation of FY-3D MWHS-2 radiance data improved the skill of the prediction for both the typhoon's track and intensity.

TI  - Mapping and Characterizing Displacements of Landslides with InSAR and Airborne LiDAR Technologies: A Case Study of Danba County, Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is known as one of the most effective methods for active landslide identification and deformation monitoring in large areas, and thus it is conducive to preventing and mitigating the losses caused by landslides. However, great uncertainty inevitably exists due to influences of complex terrains, dense vegetations, and atmospheric interferences in the southwestern mountainous area of China, and this is associated with false or erroneous judgment during the process of landslide identification. In this study, a landslide identification method is put forward by integrating InSAR technology and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology. Via this method, surface deformation characteristics detected by InSAR technology and micro-geomorphic features reflected by LiDAR technology were used to identify and map landslides of large areas. Herein, the method was applied to process 224 Sentinel-1 images covering Danba County and its surrounding areas (540 km(2)) from October 2014 to September 2020. Firstly, 44 active landslides with total areas of 59 km(2) were detected by stacking InSAR technology. Then, major regions up to 135 km(2) were validated by data gained from the airborne LiDAR technology. Particularly, several large landslides with lengths and/or widths of more than 2 km were found. Further, the precipitation data were integrated with the above results to analyze the temporal deformation characteristics of three typical landslides from major regions via SBAS InSAR technology. The key findings were as follows: (1) The combination of InSAR and LiDAR technologies could improve the accuracy of landslide detection and identification; (2) there was a significant correlation between temporal deformation characteristics of some landslides and monthly rainfall, with an obvious hysteretic effect existing between the initiation timing of rainfall and that of deformation; (3) the results of this study will be important guidance for the prevention and control of geological hazards in Danba County and areas with similar complex geomorphological conditions by helping effectively identify and map landslides.

TI  - Envisioning Intelligent Reflecting Surface Empowered Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network
T2  - IEEE NETWORK
M3  - Article
AB  - With cooperative transmission of different access ways and unified resource management, the integration of space-air-ground network has become a historic tendency because of its distinctive superiority in global coverage, massive connectivity, high capacity and low latency, and so on. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) techniques rising recently are positioned as a vital enabler for facilitating wireless communication networks. In view of these, this article attempts to give an overview of space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) and IRS, as well as to provide a new perspective on how to apply IRS into SAGIN. Based on these, some important research agendas are identified. Then, we present an example of IRSbased vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) backscatter communication in integrated space-ground network. Finally, preliminary simulations verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy and evidence the benefit of integrating IRS into SAGIN.

TI  - A Combined Strategy of Improved Variable Selection and Ensemble Algorithm to Map the Growing Stem Volume of Planted Coniferous Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology is becoming mainstream for mapping the growing stem volume (GSV) and overcoming the shortage of traditional labor-consumed approaches. Naturally, the GSV estimation accuracy utilizing remote sensing imagery is highly related to the variable selection methods and algorithms. Thus, to reduce the uncertainty caused by variables and models, this paper proposes a combined strategy involving improved variable selection with the collinearity test and the secondary ensemble algorithm to obtain the optimally combined variables and extract a reliable GSV from several base models. Our study extracted four types of alternative variables from the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A image datasets, including vegetation indices, spectral reflectance variables, backscattering coefficients, and texture features. Then, an improved variable selection criterion with the collinearity test was developed and evaluated based on machine learning algorithms (classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN)) considering the correlation between variables and GSV (with random forest (RF), distance correlation coefficient (DC), maximal information coefficient (MIC), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) as evaluation metrics), and the collinearity among the variables. Additionally, we proposed a secondary ensemble with an improved weighted average approach (IWA) to estimate the reliable forest GSV using the first ensemble models constructed by Bagging and AdaBoost. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed variable selection criterion efficiently obtained the optimal combined variable set without affecting the forest GSV mapping accuracy. Specifically, considering the first ensemble, the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) values ranged from 21.91% to 30.28% for Bagging and 23.33% to 31.49% for AdaBoost, respectively. After the secondary ensemble involving the IWA, the rRMSE values ranged from 18.89% to 21.34%. Furthermore, the variance of the GSV mapped by the secondary ensemble with various ranking methods was significantly reduced. The results prove that the proposed combined strategy has great potential to reduce the GSV mapping uncertainty imposed by current variable selection approaches and algorithms.

TI  - Integrated Sentinel-1 InSAR and GNSS Time-Series Along the San Andreas Fault System
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring crustal strain and seismic moment accumulation, is crucial for understanding the growth and distribution of seismic hazards along major fault systems. Here, we develop a methodology to integrate 4.5 years (2015-2019.5) of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) time series to achieve 6 to 12-day sampling of surface displacements at similar to 500 m spatial resolution over the entire San Andreas fault system. Numerous interesting deformation signals are identified with this product (video link: ). We decompose the line-of-sight InSAR displacements into three dimensions by combining the deformation azimuth from a GNSS-derived interseismic fault model. We then construct strain rate maps using a smoothing interpolator with constraints from elasticity. The resulting deformation field reveals a wide array of crustal deformation processes including, on- and off-fault secular and transient tectonic deformation, creep rates on all the major faults, and vertical signals associated with hydrological processes. The strain rate maps show significant off-fault components that were not captured by GNSS-only models. These results are important in assessing the seismic hazard in the region.

TI  - P-Band InSAR for Geohazard Detection over Forested Terrains: Preliminary Results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Decorrelation of X, C, and L-band InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) over densely vegetated regions is a common obstacle for detecting ground deformation beneath forest canopies. Using long-wavelength P-band SAR sensors (wavelength of 69.72 cm), which can penetrate through dense forests and collect relatively consistent signals from ground surface, is one potential solution. Here, we experimented using the NASA JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory)'s P-band AirMOSS (Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface) radar system to collect repeat-pass P-band SAR data over densely vegetated regions in Oregon and California (USA), and generated by far the first P-band InSAR results to test the capability of P-band InSAR for geohazard detection over forested terrains. Our results show that the AirMOSS P-band InSAR could retain coherence two times as high as the L-band satellite ALOS-2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2) data, and was significantly more effective in discovering localized geohazards that were unseen by the ALOS-2 interferograms over densely vegetated areas. Our results suggest that the airborne P-band InSAR could be a revolutionary tool for studying geohazards under dense forest canopies.

TI  - Mapping Aquaculture Areas with Multi-Source Spectral and Texture Features: A Case Study in the Pearl River Basin (Guangdong), China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture has grown rapidly in the field of food industry in recent years; however, it brought many environmental problems, such as water pollution and reclamations of lakes and coastal wetland areas. Thus, the evaluation and management of aquaculture industry are needed, in which accurate aquaculture mapping is an essential prerequisite. Due to the difference between inland and marine aquaculture areas and the difficulty in processing large amounts of remote sensing images, the accurate mapping of different aquaculture types is still challenging. In this study, a novel approach based on multi-source spectral and texture features was proposed to map simultaneously inland and marine aquaculture areas. Time series optical Sentinel-2 images were first employed to derive spectral indices for obtaining texture features. The backscattering and texture features derived from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1A were then used to distinguish aquaculture areas from other geographical entities. Finally, a supervised Random Forest classifier was applied for large scale aquaculture area mapping. To address the low efficiency in processing large amounts of remote sensing images, the proposed approach was implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. A case study in the Pearl River Basin (Guangdong Province) of China showed that the proposed approach obtained aquaculture map with an overall accuracy of 89.5%, and the implementation of proposed approach on GEE platform greatly improved the efficiency for large scale aquaculture area mapping. The derived aquaculture map may support decision-making services for the sustainable development of aquaculture areas and ecological protection in the study area, and the proposed approach holds great potential for mapping aquacultures on both national and global scales.

TI  - Evaluation of Remote-Sensing Reflectance Products from Multiple Ocean Color Missions in Highly Turbid Water (Hangzhou Bay)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) products is necessary for the quantitative application of ocean color satellite data. While validation of Rrs products has been performed in low to moderate turbidity waters, their performance in highly turbid water remains poorly known. Here, we used in situ Rrs data from Hangzhou Bay (HZB), one of the world's most turbid estuaries, to evaluate agency-distributed Rrs products for multiple ocean color sensors, including the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner aboard HaiYang-1C (COCTS/HY1C), Ocean and Land Color Instrument aboard Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, respectively (OLCI/S3A and OLCI/S3B), Second-Generation Global Imager aboard Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (SGLI/GCOM-C), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite (VIIRS/SNPP). Results showed that GOCI and SGLI/GCOM-C had almost no effective Rrs products in the HZB. Among the others four sensors (COCTS/HY1C, OLCI/S3A, OLCI/S3B, and VIIRS/SNPP), VIIRS/SNPP obtained the largest correlation coefficient (R) with a value of 0.7, while OLCI/S3A obtained the best mean percentage differences (PD) with a value of 13.30%. The average absolute percentage difference (APD) values of the four remote sensors are close, all around 45%. In situ Rrs data from the AERONET-OC ARIAKE site were also used to evaluate the satellite-derived Rrs products in moderately turbid coastal water for comparison. Compared with the validation results at HZB, the performances of Rrs from GOCI, OLCI/S3A, OLCI/S3B, and VIIRS/SNPP were much better at the ARIAKE site with the smallest R (0.77) and largest APD (35.38%) for GOCI, and the worst PD for these four sensors was only 13.15%, indicating that the satellite-retrieved Rrs exhibited better performance. In contrast, Rrs from COCTS/HY1C and SGLI/GCOM-C at ARIAKE site was still significantly underestimated, and the R values of the two satellites were not greater than 0.7, and the APD values were greater than 50%. Therefore, the performance of satellite Rrs products degrades significantly in highly turbid waters and needs to be improved for further retrieval of ocean color components.

TI  - Clarifying Terminology of Signs in COVID-19
T2  - ERCIYES MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The term "sign" has been used to describe various phenomena observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Discrepancies in the use of this term have been identified when it is used in context with COVID-19. The goals of this review are to provide an overview, describe signs, and clarify misconceptions regarding the use of these terms in COVID-19 patients. PubMed and Medline databases were searched using individual and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including coronavirus, COVID-19, and sign, in human studies within the English literature published from inception to December 31, 2020. Studies where the word "sign" was used in a context different from that for COVID-19 (e.g., sentinel sign) were excluded. Three hundred fifty-seven studies were potentially identified and after applying the exclusion criteria and further adjudication, 92 studies constituted the final data set. The majority of signs found in the COVID-19 literature have been applied and aptly described primarily in radiologic diseases of the chest. The term "sign," in other situations, is often misappropriated as it actually represents a physical finding rather than a sign. A total of 27 radiologic signs have been identified on chest computed tomography (CT) or high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 18 cutaneous signs (or findings) have been observed during the physical examination in COVID-19. Signs lack sufficient sensitivity or specificity by themselves; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, they should raise clinical suspicion for this infectious disease.

TI  - The Cooling Effect of Urban Green Spaces in Metacities: A Case Study of Beijing, China's Capital
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces have many vital ecosystem services such as air cleaning, noise reduction, and carbon sequestration. Amid these great benefits from urban green spaces, the cooling effects via shading and evapotranspiration can mitigate the urban heat island effect. The impact of urban green spaces (UGSs) on the urban thermal environment in Beijing was quantified as a case study of metacities using four metrics: Land surface temperature (LST), cooling intensity, cooling extent, and cooling lapse. Three hundred and sixteen urban green spaces were extracted within the 4th ring road of Beijing from SPOT 6 satellite imagery and retrieved LST from Landsat 8 remote sensing data. The results showed that the cooling intensity of green spaces was generally more prominent in the areas with denser human activities and higher LST in this metacity. Vegetation density is always the dominant driver for the cooling effect indicated by all of the metrics. Furthermore, the results showed that those dispersive green spaces smaller than 9 ha, which are closely linked to the health and well-being of citizens, can possess about 6 degrees C of cooling effect variability, suggesting a great potential of managing the layout of small UGSs. In addition, the water nearby could be introduced to couple with the green and blue space for the promotion of cooling and enhancement of thermal comfort for tourists and residents. As the severe urban heating threatens human health and well-being in metacities, our findings may provide solutions for the mitigation of both the urban heat island and global climate warming of the UGS area customized cooling service.

TI  - Estimation of the Conifer-Broadleaf Ratio in Mixed Forests Based on Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most natural forests are mixed forests, a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest is essentially a heterogeneously mixed pixel in remote sensing images. Satellite missions rely on modeling to acquire regional or global vegetation parameter products. However, these retrieval models often assume homogeneous conditions at the pixel level, resulting in a decrease in the inversion accuracy, which is an issue for heterogeneous forests. Therefore, information on the canopy composition of a mixed forest is the basis for accurately retrieving vegetation parameters using remote sensing. Medium and high spatial resolution multispectral time-series data are important sources for canopy conifer-broadleaf ratio estimation because these data have a high frequency and wide coverage. This paper highlights a successful method for estimating the conifer-broadleaf ratio in a mixed forest with diverse tree species and complex canopy structures. Experiments were conducted in the Purple Mountain, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China, where we collected leaf area index (LAI) time-series and forest sample plot inventory data. Based on the Invertible Forest Reflectance Model (INFORM), we simulated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series of different conifer-broadleaf ratios. A time-series similarity analysis was performed to determine the typical separable conifer-broadleaf ratios. Fifteen Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite images of 2015 were acquired. The conifer-broadleaf ratio estimation was based on the GF-1 NDVI time-series and semi-supervised k-means cluster method, which yielded a high overall accuracy of 83.75%. This study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately estimating separable conifer-broadleaf ratios using field measurement data and GF-1 time series in mixed broadleaf-conifer forests.

TI  - Daily Flood Monitoring Based on Spaceborne GNSS-R Data: A Case Study on Henan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is a kind of natural disaster that is extremely harmful and occurs frequently. To reduce losses caused by the hazards, it is urgent to monitor the disaster area timely and carry out rescue operations efficiently. However, conventional space observers cannot achieve sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. As spaceborne GNSS-R technique can observe the Earth's surface with high temporal and spatial resolutions; and it is expected to provide a new solution to the problem of flood hazards. During 19-21 July 2021, Henan province, China, suffered a catastrophic flood and urban waterlogging. In order to test the feasibility of flood disaster monitoring on a daily basis by using GNSS-R observations, the CYGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System) Level 1 Science Data were processed for a few days before and after the flood to obtain surface reflectivity by correcting the analog power. Afterwards, the flood was monitored and mapped daily based on the analysis of changes in surface reflectivity from spaceborne GNSS-R mission. The results were evaluated based on the image from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, and compared with the observations of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) in the same period. The results show that the area with high CYGNSS reflectivity corresponds to the flooded area monitored by MODIS, and it is also in high agreement with SMAP. Moreover, CYGNSS can achieve more detailed mapping and quantification of the inundated area and the duration of the flood, respectively, in line with the specific situation of the flood. Thus, spaceborne GNSS-R technology can be used as a method to monitor floods with high temporal resolution.

TI  - How Does Spring Phenology Respond to Climate Change in Ecologically Fragile Grassland? A Case Study from the Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is an important indicator of global climate change, and the response of grassland phenology to climate change is particularly sensitive in ecologically fragile areas. To enhance the ecological security of the Tibetan Plateau, it is crucial to determine the relationship between fluctuations in the start of the growing season (SOS) and the response to environmental factors. We investigated the trends of the intra-annual (ten-day) and interannual spatiotemporal dynamics of the SOS on the Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (NQTP) from 2000-2020 with MOD09GA data. We identified the response relationships with environmental factors (climate, terrain) using the maximum value composite method and the Savitzky-Golay filtering and dynamic threshold method. The SOS was concentrated from the 110th to 150th days; the average annual SOS was on the 128th day, with a spatial pattern of "early in the east and late in the west ". The overall trend of the SOS was advanced (45.48%); the regions with the advanced trend were mainly distributed in the eastern part of the NQTP. The regions with a delayed SOS were mainly concentrated in the higher-altitude regions in the southwest (38.31%). The temperature, precipitation and SOS exhibited a reverse fluctuation trend around the midpoint of 2010. Precipitation affected the SOS earlier than temperature. When temperature became a limitation of the SOS, precipitation had a more significant regulatory effect on the SOS. The SOS and aspect, slope and altitude were distributed in axisymmetric, pyramidal and inverted pyramidal shapes, respectively. The SOS on shaded slopes was earlier and more intensive than that on sunny slopes. With increasing slope, the area of the SOS decreased, and it occurred later. The SOS area was largest at 4500-5000 m and decreased at lower and higher altitude intervals. The SOS occurred later as altitude increased.

TI  - Assessment of the Seismic Hazards of the Marikina Valley Fault from 2019 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.1 Castillejos Earthquake and Historical Events
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019 M-w 6.1 Castillejos earthquake occurred in the Zambales range of the central Luzon Island in Philippines. No active fault was reported around the seismogenic zone according to previous investigations. This earthquake draws attention for assessment in seismic risk along the Marikina Valley fault system (MVFS) near the Manila dense metropolitan population. The Coulomb failure stress (CFS) change on the MVFS is estimated by the coseismic faulting model derived from the inversion of coseismic deformation field observed from the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar using both the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The predicted CFS change is less than 0.5 kPa that implies insignificant Coulomb stress accumulation on the MVFS after the M-w 6.1 Castillejos event. However, the recorded 14 moderate and strong earthquakes in and around the Luzon islands caused significant CFS drop on the MVFS. This might delay the occurrence of the earthquake for 0.2-50 yr on the MVFS.

TI  - An Adaptive-Parameter Pixel Unmixing Method for Mapping Evergreen Forest Fractions Based on Time-Series NDVI: A Case Study of Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral unmixing remains the most popular method for estimating the composition of mixed pixels. However, the spectral-based unmixing method cannot easily distinguish vegetation with similar spectral characteristics (e.g., different forest tree species). Furthermore, in large areas with significant heterogeneity, extracting a large number of pure endmember samples is challenging. Here, we implement a fractional evergreen forest cover-self-adaptive parameter (FEVC-SAP) approach to measure FEVC at the regional scale from continuous intra-year time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery acquired over southern China, an area with a complex mixture of temperate, subtropical, and tropical climates containing evergreen and deciduous forests. Considering the cover of evergreen forest as a fraction of total forest (evergreen forest plus non-evergreen forest), the dimidiate pixel model combined with an index of evergreen forest phenological characteristics (NDVIann-min: intra-annual minimum NDVI value) was used to distinguish between evergreen and non-evergreen forests within a pixel. Due to spatial heterogeneity, the optimal model parameters differ among regions. By dividing the study area into grids, our method converts image spectral information into gray level information and uses the Otsu threshold segmentation method to simulate the appropriate parameters for each grid for adaptive acquisition of FEVC parameters. Mapping accuracy was assessed at the pixel and sub-pixel scales. At the pixel scale, a confusion matrix was constructed with higher overall accuracy (87.5%) of evergreen forest classification than existing land cover products, including GLC 30 and MOD12. At the sub-pixel scale, a strong linear correlation was found between the cover fraction predicted by our method and the reference cover fraction obtained from GF-1 images (R2 = 0.86). Compared to other methods, the FEVC-SAP had a lower estimation deviation (root mean square error = 8.6%). Moreover, the proposed method had greater estimation accuracy in densely than sparsely forested areas. Our results highlight the utility of the adaptive-parameter linear unmixing model for quantitative evaluation of the coverage of evergreen forest and other vegetation types at large scales.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Microwave Remote Sensing Data and a Deep Belief Network in the Naqu Region of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays an important role in the land surface model. In this paper, a method of using VV polarization Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat optical data to retrieve soil moisture data was proposed by combining the water cloud model (WCM) and the deep belief network (DBN). Since the simple combination of training data in the neural network cannot effectively improve the accuracy of the soil moisture inversion results, a WCM physical model was used to eliminate the effect of vegetation cover on the ground backscatter, in order to obtain the bare soil backscatter coefficient. This improved the correlation of ground soil backscatter characteristics with soil moisture. A DBN soil moisture inversion model based on the bare soil backscatter coefficients as the foundation training data combined with radar incidence angle and terrain factors obtained good inversion results. Studies in the Naqu area of the Tibetan Plateau showed that vegetation cover had a significant effect on the soil moisture, and the goodness of fit (R-2) between the backscatter coefficient and soil moisture before and after the elimination of vegetation cover was 0.38 and 0.50, respectively. The correlation between the backscatter coefficient and the soil moisture was improved after eliminating the vegetation cover. The inversion results of the DBN soil moisture model were further improved through iterative parameters. The model prediction reached its highest level of accuracy when the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was set to seven layers, the bias and R were 0.007 and 0.88, respectively. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that the DBN soil moisture model performed stably with different data. The prediction was further improved when the bare soil backscatter coefficient was used as the training data. The mean values of the root mean square error (RMSE), the inequality coefficient (TIC), and the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) were 0.023, 0.09, and 11.13, respectively.

TI  - ClusterCNN: Clustering-Based Feature Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in the field of remote sensing images. However, the applications of CNNs and related techniques often ignore the properties of remote sensing data. In our study, we focus on the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification problem, and address the issue of including the very rich spectral information present in HSIs in CNN-based models to produce highly accurate classification results. We propose a two-step classification technique, ClusterCNN. The first step divides HSI pixels into different clusters, to form a material map which can be considered as a compressed expression of the original spectral features. The second step trains a CNN that can extract spatial features from the material map, and then exploits these spatial features to classify HSI pixels. The proposed approach follows a strict hierarchy to exploit both the spectral and spatial features in HSIs. Experimental results show the effectiveness of ClusterCNN as compared to the much more complicated state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Lockdowns Save People from Air Pollution: Evidence from Daily Global Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> Satellite Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivated by the global fear of the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, we investigated whether lockdowns save people from air pollution, notably from Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Using daily satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), we first found that the global NO2 tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) decreased by 16.5% after the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Then, we calculated the global health benefits, as the monetized value of life, using the value of a statistical life (VSL). The total global health benefits were approximately 8.73 trillion USD, accounting for 10% of the global GDP; such benefits would be the largest in China, followed by the United States, Japan and Germany. Our results suggest that lockdowns may bring benefits to countries that policy interventions cannot easily bring, thus highlighting the importance of social distancing.

TI  - Application of Dirichlet Process and Support Vector Machine Techniques for Mapping Alteration Zones Associated with Porphyry Copper Deposit Using ASTER Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms for processing remote sensing data is momentous, particularly for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper deposits. The unsupervised Dirichlet Process (DP) and the supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques can be executed for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper deposits. The main objective of this investigation is to practice an algorithm that can accurately model the best training data as input for supervised methods such as SVM. For this purpose, the Zefreh porphyry copper deposit located in the Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Arc (UDMA) of central Iran was selected and used as training data. Initially, using ASTER data, different alteration zones of the Zefreh porphyry copper deposit were detected by Band Ratio, Relative Band Depth (RBD), Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU), Spectral Feature Fitting (SFF), and Orthogonal Subspace Projection (OSP) techniques. Then, using the DP method, the exact extent of each alteration was determined. Finally, the detected alterations were used as training data to identify similar alteration zones in full scene of ASTER using SVM and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) methods. Several high potential zones were identified in the study area. Field surveys and laboratory analysis were used to validate the image processing results. This investigation demonstrates that the application of the SVM algorithm for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper deposits is broadly applicable to ASTER data and can be used for prospectivity mapping in many metallogenic provinces around the world.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-2, MODIS, CGLS, SAF, GLASS and C3S Leaf Area Index Products in Maize Crops
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We proposed a direct approach to validate hectometric and kilometric resolution leaf area index (LAI) products that involved the scaling up of field-measured LAI via the validation and recalibration of the decametric Sentinel-2 LAI product. We applied it over a test study area of maize crops in northern China using continuous field measurements of LAINet along the year 2019. Sentinel-2 LAI showed an overall accuracy of 0.67 in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and it was used, after recalibration, as a benchmark to validate six coarse resolution LAI products: MODIS, Copernicus Global Land Service 1 km Version 2 (called GEOV2) and 300 m (GEOV3), Satellite Application Facility EUMETSAT Polar System (SAF EPS) 1.1 km, Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) 500 m and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) 1 km V2. GEOV2, GEOV3 and MODIS showed a good agreement with reference LAI in terms of magnitude (RMSE & LE; 0.29) and phenology. SAF EPS (RMSE = 0.68) and C3S V2 (RMSE = 0.41), on the opposite, systematically underestimated high LAI values and showed systematic differences for phenological metrics: a delay of 6 days (d), 20 d and 24 d for the start, peak and the end of growing season, respectively, for SAF EPS and an advance of -4 d, -6 d and -6 d for C3S.

TI  - Time-Series Landsat Data for 3D Reconstruction of Urban History
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of vertical structure (or 3D structure) and its change of a city is essential for understanding the evolution of urban form, and its social and ecological consequences. Previous studies have largely focused on the horizontal structure (or 2D structure), but few on 3D structure, especially for long time changes, due to the absence of such historical data. Here, we present a new approach for 3D reconstruction of urban history, which was applied to characterize the urban 3D structure and its change from 1986 to 2017 in Shenzhen, a megacity in southern China. This approach integrates the contemporary building height obtained from the increasingly available data of building footprint with building age estimated based on the long-term observations from time-series Landsat imagery. We found: (1) the overall accuracy for building change detection was 87.80%, and for the year of change was 77.40%, suggesting that the integrated approach provided an effective method to cooperate horizontal (i.e., building footprint), vertical (i.e., building height), and temporal information (i.e., building age) to generate the historical data for urban 3D reconstruction. (2) The number of buildings increased dramatically from 1986 to 2017, by eight times, with an increased proportion of high-rise buildings. (3) The old urban areas continued to have the highest density of buildings, with increased average height of buildings, but there were two emerging new centers clustered with high-rise buildings. The long-term urban 3D maps allowed characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of the vertical dimension at the city level, which can enhance our understanding on urban morphology.

TI  - Optimized Land Use through Integrated Land Suitability and GIS Approach in West El-Minia Governorate, Upper Egypt
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land evaluation is imperative for its efficient use in agriculture. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the suitability of a region in West El-Minia for cultivating some of the major crops using the geographical information system (GIS). The results focus on allocating space for cultivating sugar beet and utilizing the free period of sugar beet in other crops. This exploitation helps to maintain the quality of the land and increase its fertility by using crop rotation with integrated agricultural management. A machine learning technique was implemented using the random forest algorithm (RF) to predict soil suitability classes for sugar beet using geomorphology, terrain attribute and remote sensing data. Fifteen major crops were evaluated using a suitability multicriteria approach in GIS environment for crop rotation decisions. Soil parameters were determined (soil depth, pH, texture, CaCO3, drainage, ECe, and slope) to characterize the land units for soil suitability. Soils of the area were found to be Entisols; Typic Torrifluvents, Typic Torripsamments and Typic Torriorthents and Aridsols; Typic Haplocacids, Calcic Haplosalids and Sodic Haplocalcids. Overall, the studied area was classified into four suitability classes: high "S1 ", moderate "S2 ", marginal "S3 ", and not suitable "N ". The area of each suitability class changed depending on the crop tested. The highest two crops that occupied S1 class were barley with 471.5 ha (representing 6.8% of the total study area) and alfalfa with 157.4 ha (2.3%). In addition, barley, sugar beet, and sorghum occupied the highest areas in S2 class with 6415.3 ha (92.5%), 6111.3 ha (88.11%) and 6111.3 ha (88.1%), respectively. Regarding the S3 class, three different crops (sesame, green pepper, and maize) were the most highly represented by 6151.8 ha (88.7%), 6126.3 ha (88.3%), and 6116.7 ha (88.2%), respectively. In the end, potato and beans occupied the highest areas in N class with 6916.9 ha (99.7%) and 6853.5 ha (98.8%), respectively. The results revealed that the integration of GIS and soil suitability system consists of an appropriate approach for the evaluation of suitable crop rotations for optimized land use planning and to prevent soil degradation. The study recommends using crop rotation, as it contributes to soil sustainability and the control of plant pests and diseases, where the succession of agricultural crops on a scientific basis aims at maintaining the balance of nutrients and fertilizers in the soil.

TI  - A method of sequentially generating a set of components of a multidimensional random variable using a nonparametric pattern recognition algorithm
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We study in which way a priori information on the independence of random variables affects the approximation accuracy of a nonparametric estimate of the Rosenblatt-Parzen probability density. A new technique for generating sets of independent components of a multidimensional random variable is proposed. The methodology is based on testing the hypotheses of the independence of combinations of the multidimensional random variable components using a two-alternative nonparametric kernel algorithm for pattern recognition corresponding to the maximum likelihood criterion. Classes correspond to the domains of definition of the probability densities of sets of independent and dependent components of the multidimensional random variable. Nonparametric statistics of the kernel type are used to estimate the probability densities. The choice of the bandwidths of the kernel estimates of the probability densities is made from the condition of the minimum root-mean-square criterion. The sequential procedure for generating a set of independent components begins with the analysis of paired combinations of components of a multidimensional random variable. For each pair of components, the probability of an error in recognizing classes corresponding to the assumptions of independence and dependence of the considered components is estimated. A pair of components with the maximum difference between these errors is determined. If the errors obtained do not differ significantly, then there are no independent components in the considered multivariate random variable. If there is a significant difference in the probability estimates of class recognition errors, a pair of independent components is established. These components are included in a three-component set of a multidimensional random variable. The analysis of their combinations is carried out in the same way, following the above-described procedure. The process of generating the set of independent components is stopped when no reliable difference occurs any more between the probabilities of errors in recognizing situations belonging to the accepted classes. In this case, the previous set of independent components is the desired result. In contrast to the traditional methodology based on the Pearson criterion, the proposed approach allows us to bypass a problem of the decomposition of the range of values of random variables into multidimensional intervals.The method of generating a set of independent components of a multidimensional random variable is illustrated by the results of the analysis of spectral features of remote sensing data of forest tracts using space imagery from the Landsat-8 satellite.

TI  - Sea Ice Monitoring with CFOSAT Scatterometer Measurements Using Random Forest Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ku-band scatterometer called CSCAT onboard the Chinese-French Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) is the first spaceborne rotating fan-beam scatterometer (RFSCAT). This paper performs sea ice monitoring with the CSCAT backscatter measurements in polar areas. The CSCAT measurements have the characteristics of diverse incidence and azimuth angles and separation between open water and sea ice. Hence, five microwave feature parameters, which show different sensitivity to ice or water, are defined and derived from the CSCAT measurements firstly. Then the random forest classifier is selected for sea ice monitoring because of its high overall accuracy of 99.66% and 93.31% in the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively. The difference of features ranked by importance in different seasons and regions shows that the combination of these parameters is effective in discriminating sea ice from water under various conditions. The performance of the algorithm is validated against the sea ice edge data from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) on a global scale in a period from 1 January 2019 to 10 May 2021. The mean sea ice area differences between CSCAT and OSI SAF product in the Arctic and Antarctic are 0.2673 million km(2) and -0.4446 million km(2), respectively, and the sea ice area relative errors of CSCAT are less than 10% except for summer season in both poles. However, the overall sea ice area derived from CSCAT is lower than the OSI SAF sea ice area in summer. This may be because the CSCAT is trained by radiometer sea ice concentration data while the radiometer measurement of sea ice is significantly affected by melting in the summer season. In conclusion, this research verifies the capability of CSCAT in monitoring polar sea ice using a machine learning-aided random forest classifier. This presented work can give guidance to sea ice monitoring with radar backscatter measurements from other spaceborne scatterometers, particular for the recently launched FY-3E scatterometer (called WindRad).

TI  - Water Quality Index (WQI) as a Potential Proxy for Remote Sensing Evaluation of Water Quality in Arid Areas
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water Resource Sustainability Management plays a vitally important role in ensuring sustainable development, especially in water-stressed arid regions throughout the world. In order to achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to study and monitor the water quality in the arid region of Central Asia, an area that is increasingly affected by climate change. In recent decades, the rapid deterioration of water quality in the Ebinur Lake basin in Xinjiang (China) has severely threatened sustainable economic development. This study selected the Ebinur Lake basin as the study target, with the purpose of revealing the response between the water quality index and water body reflectivity, and to describe the relationship between the water quality index and water reflectivity. The methodology employed remote sensing techniques that establish a water quality index monitoring model to monitor water quality. The results of our study include: (1) the Water Quality Index (WQI) that was used to evaluate the water environment in Ebinur Lake indicates a lower water quality of Ebinur Lake, with a WQI value as high as 4000; (2) an introduction of the spectral derivative method that realizes the extraction of spectral information from a water body to better mine the information of spectral data through remote sensing, and the results also prove that the spectral derivative method can improve the relationship between the water body spectral and WQI, whereby R-2 is 0.6 at the most sensitive wavelengths; (3) the correlation between the spectral sensitivity index and WQI was greater than 0.6 at the significance level of 0.01 when multi-source spectral data were integrated with the spectral index (DI, RI and NDI) and fluorescence baseline; and (4) the distribution map of WQI in Ebinur Lake was obtained by the optimal model, which was constructed based on the third derivative data of Sentinel 2 data. We concluded that the water quality in the northwest of Ebinur Lake was the lowest in the region. In conclusion, we found that remote sensing techniques were highly effective and laid a foundation for water quality detection in arid areas.

TI  - An Urban Flooding Index for Unsupervised Inundated Urban Area Detection Using Sentinel-1 Polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flooding causes a variation in radar return from urban areas. However, such variation has not been thoroughly examined for different polarizations because of the lack of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images and ground truth data simultaneously collected over flooded urban areas. This condition hinders not only the understanding of the effect mechanism of urban flooding under different polarizations but also the development of advanced methods that could improve the accuracy of inundated urban area detection. Using Sentinel-1 PolSAR and Jilin-1 high-resolution optical images acquired on the same day over flooded urban areas in Golestan, Iran, this study investigated the characteristics and mechanisms of the radar return changes induced by urban flooding under different polarizations and proposed a new method for unsupervised inundated urban area detection. This study found that urban flooding caused a backscattering coefficient increase (BCI) and interferometric coherence decrease (ICD) in VV and VH polarizations. Furthermore, VV polarization was more sensitive to the BCI and ICD than VH polarization. In light of these findings, the ratio between the BCI and ICD was defined as an urban flooding index (UFI), and the UFI in VV polarization was used for the unsupervised detection of flooded urban areas. The overall accuracy, detection accuracy, and false alarm rate attained by the UFI-based method were 96.93%, 91.09%, and 0.95%, respectively. Compared with the conventional unsupervised method based on the ICD and that based on the fusion of backscattering coefficients and interferometric coherences (FBI), the UFI-based method achieved higher overall accuracy. The performance of VV was evaluated and compared to that of VH in the flooded urban area detection using the UFI-, ICD-, and FBI-based methods, respectively. VV polarization produced higher overall accuracy than VH polarization in all the methods, especially in the UFI-based method. By using VV instead of VH polarization, the UFI-based method improved the detection accuracy by 38.16%. These results indicated that the UFI-based method improved flooded urban area detection by synergizing the BCI and ICD in VV polarization.

TI  - Genetic diversity and structure of <i>Oncomelania hupensis hupensis</i> in two eco-epidemiological settings as revealed by the mitochondrial COX1 gene sequences
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Oncomelania hupensis hupensis is the only intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, the causative agent of schistosomiasis in China and is therefore of significant medical and veterinary health importance. Although tremendous progress has been achieved, there remains an understudied area of approximately 2.06 billion m(2) of potential snail habitats. This area could be further increased by annual flooding. Therefore, an understanding of population genetics of snails in these areas may be useful for future monitoring and control activities. Methods and results We sampled snails from Hexian (HX), Zongyang (ZY) and Shitai (ST) in Anhui (schistosomiasis transmission control), and from Hengtang (HT), Taicang (TC), Dongsan (DS) and Xisan (XS) in Jiangsu (schistosomiasis transmission interrupted), downstream of Anhui. ST, DS and XS are classified as hilly and mountainous areas, and HX, ZY, TC and HT as lake and marshland areas. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene were sequenced. Out of 115 snails analyzed, 29 haplotypes were identified. We observed 56 (8.72%) polymorphic sites consisting of 51 transitions, four transversions and one multiple mutational change. The overall haplotype and nucleotide diversity were 0.899 and 0.01569, respectively. Snail populations in Anhui had higher genetic diversity than in Jiangsu. 73.32% of total variation was distributed among sites and 26.68% within sites. Snails were significantly separated according to eco-epidemiological settings in both network and phylogenetic analyses. Conclusion Our results could provide important guidance towards assessing coevolutionary interactions of snails with S. japonicum, as well as for future molluscan host monitoring and control activities.

TI  - Salient Object Detection Based on Progressively Supervised Learning for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salient object detection (SOD) is a crucial task in the field of remote sensing image (RSI) processing. Weakly supervised SOD methods, which generate saliency maps by classification convolutional neural networks (CNNs), considerably reduce labor costs. However, due to the complexity of remote sensing scenes, concerns remain about weakly supervised SOD for RSIs: 1) since the pooling operations are applied in the classification CNNs, the boundary maintenance of weakly supervised methods is unsatisfactory and 2) several sophisticated postprocessing procedures are used in previous weakly supervised methods, which are inevitably time-consuming. To solve these problems, we combine the benefits of weakly and fully supervised learning and propose a new SOD method named progressively supervised learning (PSL) for RSIs. The proposed method realizes end-to-end SOD with a lightweight model under imagewise annotations. First, to reduce the demands on large-scale pixelwise annotations, we propose a pseudo-label generation method based on a classification network and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to compute pseudo saliency maps (PSMs) for training samples and auxiliary images in a weakly supervised manner. Then, to improve the computational efficiency, we construct a feedback saliency analysis network (FSAN), where the generated PSMs are regarded as pixelwise labels. Finally, inspired by curriculum learning, we design a new denoising loss function to further reduce the effect brought by missing judgment in PSMs and enhance the detection accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations with two remote sensing data sets and a comparison with 11 methods validate the superiority of the proposed PSL model.

TI  - SC-PNN: Saliency Cascade Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many remote sensing tasks, different types of regions or targets differ in requirements for spectral and spatial quality. The discrepancy reveals that a uniform pansharpening strategy applying to the entire image may not fulfill the varying demands of different regions appropriately. From this aspect, we resort to saliency analysis to distinguish regions with different spatial and spectral requirements and then propose a new saliency cascade convolutional neural network for pansharpening (SC-PNN). SC-PNN is composed of two parts: a dilated deformable convolutional network (DDCN) for saliency analysis and a saliency cascade residual dense network (SC-RDN) for pansharpening. DDCN is a fully convolutional network based on hybrid dilated convolution and deformable convolution, aiming to separate salient regions, such as residential areas from nonsalient areas, including mountains and vegetation areas, with well-defined boundaries and integrity. In the fusion process, SC-RDN is specially designed with the help of saliency analysis. We first construct a deep regression network to estimate a primarily sharpened image and subsequently leverage the saliency map produced by DDCN to develop a saliency enhancement module. In this module, the quality of salient and nonsalient areas is further improved by two independent deep residual dense networks. Thus, a precise fused image can be predicted. Experiments on SPOT5, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-3 data sets reveal that, compared to state-of-the-art pansharpening methods, our proposal has a superior ability to improve the spatial quality and preserve spectral information. The effectiveness of the saliency enhancement module is also validated in the experiment.

TI  - Continuous Detection of Surface-Mining Footprint in Copper Mine Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Socioeconomic development is often dependent on the production of mining resources, but both opencast and underground mining harm vegetation and the eco-environment. Under the requirements of the construction for ecological civilization in China, more attention has been paid to the reclamation of mines and mining management. Thus, it is the basement of formulating policies related to mining management and implementing reclamation that detection of mining disturbance rapidly and accurately. This research carries on an empirical study in the Dexing copper mine, Jiangxi, China, aiming at exploring the process of distance and reclamation. Based on the dense time-series stack derived from the Landsat archive on Google Earth Engine (GEE), the disturbance of surface mining in the 1986-2020 period has been detected using the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm. The results are that: (1) the overall accuracy of damage and recovery is 92% and 88%, respectively, and the Kappa coefficient is 85% and 84% respectively. This means that we obtained an ideal detection effect; (2) the surface-mining area was increasing from 1986-2020 in the Dexing copper mine, and the accumulation of mining damage is approximately 2865.96 ha with an annual area of 81.88 ha. We also found that the area was fluctuating with the increase. The detected natural restoration was appraised at a total of 544.95 ha in the 1988-2020 period with an average restoration of 16.03 ha. This means that it just restores less in general; (3) it has always been the case that the Dexing mine is damaged by mining and reclamation in the whole year (it is most frequently damaged month is July). All imageries in the mine are detected by the CCDC algorithm, and they are classified as four types by disturbing number in pixel scale (i.e., 0, 1, 2, more than 2 times). Based on that, we found that the only once disturbed pixels account for 64.75% of the whole disturbed pixels, which is the majority in the four classes; (4) this method provides an innovative perspective for obtaining the mining disturbed dynamic information timely and accurately and ensures that the time and number of surface mining disturbed areas are identified accurately. This method is also valuable in other applications including the detection of other similar regions.

TI  - The Expansion Dynamics and Modes of Impervious Surfaces in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Different urban growth patterns have various impact degrees on the urban ecosystem and environment. Impervious surface, a typical artificial construction can be used to reflect urban development. Therefore, this study estimated the spatiotemporal dynamics and expansion patterns of impervious surface area (ISA) in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau (GHM) Bay Area since the establishment of the "Pearl River Delta economic zone " in 1994. Landsat time-series images were used to map the distribution of the ISA based on the combinational biophysical composition index (CBCI) and the bidirectional temporal filtering method (BTFM). The results indicated that the ISA in the GHM Bay Area drastically expanded from 569.23 km(2) in 1994 to 10,200.53 km(2) in 2016. In addition, the aggregation index (AI) value of the high-density area showed a decreasing trend from 1994 to 2004. However, the value of each landscape metric rapidly increased after 2004. Moreover, the mean ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of standard deviational ellipses from 1994 to 2004 was higher than that from 2005 to 2016. The results of landscape metrics and standard deviational ellipses indicated that the ISA growth pattern changed from edge expanding and leapfrogging to infilling and consolidation, with a turning point in 2004. Moreover, the principal sprawl orientation of the ISA was northwest to southeast before 2004. After 2004, the expansion direction of the ISA was less obvious due to the development pattern of infilling and consolidation. The rapid increase of GDP and population are the driving forces of urban expansion. However, topography and ecological protection policies as the limiting factors, which caused the infilling of the inner city and redevelopment of old urban areas.

TI  - Balance learning for ship detection from synthetic aperture radar remote sensing imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is playing an important role in maritime domain awareness. As a fundamental ocean mission, SAR ship detection can offer high-quality services for marine surveillance. It receives widespread concern in the SAR remote sensing community. Recently, deep learning (DL) has greatly improved SAR ship detection accuracy. However, there are still some unperceived imbalance problems that seriously hinder further accuracy improvements among current DL-based SAR ship detectors. Therefore, we propose a novel concept of balance learning (BL) for high-quality SAR ship detection. We first point out the four unperceived imbalance problems, i.e., image sample scene imbalance, positive negative sample imbalance, ship scale feature imbalance, and classification regression task imbalance. Then, we offer some profound insights into these imbalances. Immediately, we propose four effective solutions to handle the above four imbalances correspondingly, i.e., balance scene learning mechanism (BSLM), balance interval sampling mechanism (BISM), balance feature pyramid network (BFPN), and balance classification regression network (BCRN). Finally, combined with the four solutions, a novel balance learning network (BL-Net) is proposed. Ablation studies can confirm each solution's effectiveness. Experimental results on five open datasets (SSDD, Gaofen-SSDD, Sentinel-SSDD, SAR-Ship-Dataset, and HRSID) reveal BL-Net's state-of-the-art SAR ship detection performance compared to the other 30 DL-based SAR ship detectors. Specifically, in contrast to the current most competitive method, the accuracy increase of BLNet is 2.98% on SSDD, 1.97% on Gaofen-SSDD, 1.49% on Sentinel-SSDD, 0.55% on SAR-Ship-Dataset, and 4.95% on HRSID. Last but not least, the satisfactory ship detection results on another two large-scene Sentinal-1 SAR images confirm BL-Net's strong migration capability. This indicates BL-Net's potential value in marine surveillance.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Changes in Mulberry-Dyke-Fish Ponds in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area over the Past 40 Years
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mulberry-dyke-fish pond ecosystems are a representative traditional eco-agriculture in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Investigations about the changes in the systems and their relevant water environments under the background of rapid urbanization can provide valuable information to formulate sustainable protection and development strategies. Using the Landsat images obtained after 1986, this study combined supervised classification and visual interpretation approaches, as well as water intensity index and synthesized index to identify the spatial patterns of changes in the ponds in the GBA over the past 40 years. The results indicated that during the period 1986-2013, the total surface area of the ponds in the GBA increased significantly and peaked in 2013 with a total increase of 84.63%; After that, the total surface area showed a downward trend with a total decrease of approximately 31.34%. The year of 2013 was identified as the milestone of the changes. The results proved that human activities have continuously influenced the spatial distribution and size of fish ponds in the past 40 years. The fish ponds had transformed from near-natural ponds with different sizes and a near-natural random distribution in the early stage into an artificial distribution and an artificial shape. Land use changes, industrial transfer, Government guidance and financial motives were the major drivers to the changes. If no effective measures are taken, this shrinking trend in the ponds will remain in the future.

TI  - High-Resolution Boundary Refined Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Agricultural Greenhouses Extraction from GaoFen-2 Satellite Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural greenhouses (AGs) are an important component of modern facility agriculture, and accurately mapping and dynamically monitoring their distribution are necessary for agricultural scientific management and planning. Semantic segmentation can be adopted for AG extraction from remote sensing images. However, the feature maps obtained by traditional deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based segmentation algorithms blur spatial details and insufficient attention is usually paid to contextual representation. Meanwhile, the maintenance of the original morphological characteristics, especially the boundaries, is still a challenge for precise identification of AGs. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a novel network called high-resolution boundary refined network (HBRNet). In this method, we design a new backbone with multiple paths based on HRNetV2 aiming to preserve high spatial resolution and improve feature extraction capability, in which the Pyramid Cross Channel Attention (PCCA) module is embedded to residual blocks to strengthen the interaction of multiscale information. Moreover, the Spatial Enhancement (SE) module is employed to integrate the contextual information of different scales. In addition, we introduce the Spatial Gradient Variation (SGV) unit in the Boundary Refined (BR) module to couple the segmentation task and boundary learning task, so that they can share latent high-level semantics and interact with each other, and combine this with the joint loss to refine the boundary. In our study, GaoFen-2 remote sensing images in Shouguang City, Shandong Province, China are selected to make the AG dataset. The experimental results show that HBRNet demonstrates a significant improvement in segmentation performance up to an IoU score of 94.89%, implying that this approach has advantages and potential for precise identification of AGs.

TI  - Characterizing Spatial Patterns of Pine Wood Nematode Outbreaks in Subtropical Zone in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine wood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xyophilus, originating from North America, has caused great ecological and economic hazards to pine trees worldwide, especially affecting the coniferous forests and mixed forests of masson pine in subtropical regions of China. In order to prevent PWN disease expansion, the risk level and susceptivity of PWN outbreaks need to be predicted in advance. For this purpose, we established a prediction model to estimate the susceptibility and risk level of PWN with vegetation condition variables, anthropogenic activity variables, and topographic feature variables across a large-scale district. The study was conducted in Dangyang City, Hubei Province in China, which was located in a subtropical zone. Based on the location of PWN points derived from airborne imagery and ground survey in 2018, the predictor variables were conducted with remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) data, which contained vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and normalized red edge index (NDRE) from Sentinel-2 imagery in the previous year (2107), the distance to different level roads which indicated anthropogenic activity, topographic variables in including elevation, slope, and aspect. We compared the fitting effects of different machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF), K-neighborhood (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) and predicted the probability of the presence of PWN disease in the region. In addition, we classified PWN points to different risk levels based on the density distribution of PWN sites and built a PWN risk level model to predict the risk levels of PWN outbreaks in the region. The results showed that: (1) the best model for the predictive probability of PWN presence is the RF classification algorithm. For the presence prediction of the dead trees caused by PWN, the detection rate (DR) was 96.42%, the false alarm rate (FAR) was 27.65%, the false detection rate (FDR) was 4.16%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was equal to 0.96; (2) anthropogenic activity variables had the greatest effect on PWN occurrence, while the effects of slope and aspect were relatively weak, and the maximum, minimum, and median values of remote sensing indices were more correlated with PWN occurrence; (3) modeling analysis of different risk levels of PWN outbreak indicated that high-risk level areas were the easiest to monitor and identify, while lower incidence areas were identified with relatively low accuracy. The overall accuracy of the risk level of the PWN outbreak was identified with an AUC value of 0.94. From the research findings, remote sensing data combined with GIS data can accurately predict the probability distribution of the occurrence of PWN disease. The accuracy of identification of high-risk areas is higher than other risk levels, and the results of the study may improve control of PWN disease spread.

T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is a key element of the cryosphere and sensitive to climate change. High-resolution permafrost map is important to environmental assessment, climate modeling, and engineering application. In this study, to estimate high-resolution Xing'an permafrost map (up to 1 km(2)), we employed the surface frost number (SFN) model and ground temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model for the 2001-2018 period, driven by remote sensing data sets (land surface temperature and land cover). Based on the comparison of the modeling results, it was found that there was no significant difference between the two models. The performances of the SFN model and TTOP model were evaluated by using a published permafrost map. Based on statistical analysis, both the SFN model and TTOP model efficiently estimated the permafrost distribution in Northeast China. The extent of Xing'an permafrost distribution simulated by the SFN model and TTOP model were 6.88 x 10(5) km(2) and 6.81 x 10(5) km(2), respectively. Ground-surface characteristics were introduced into the permafrost models to improve the performance of models. The results provided a basic reference for permafrost distribution research at the regional scale.

TI  - Correlation Analysis between Land-Use/Cover Change and Coastal Subsidence in the Yellow River Delta, China: Reviewing the Past and Prospecting the Future
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, noticeable subsidence depressions have occurred along the coastal zone of the Yellow River Delta. Consistent with these changes, dramatic human modifications within the coastal zone stand out, and the coastline is altered from an undisturbed natural area to an artificial coastline. However, very few studies have attempted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between subsidence depression and human activities. Here, the subsidence characteristics of the different land-use types in the Yellow River Delta are examined, and their spatiotemporal trends are quantified using a long-term satellite-observed time series of 30 years (1984-2017) regarding the land use map in combination with the InSAR-derived vertical ground deformations during three typical periods (P1: 1992-2000, P2: 2007-2010, and P3: 2016-2017). Noticeably, the highest subsidence rates were observed in areas where substantial human activities were observed, such as the subsidence in the salt fields ranging from 13 mm/year to 32 mm/year to 453 mm/year, respectively. Moreover, through the land-use prediction of Land Change Modeler (LCM), it is found that the salt field area will be further expanded in the future. The ecological vulnerability of the Yellow River Delta coastal zone should receive more attention in the future in terms of planning environmental protection strategies.

TI  - Accuracy Evaluation on Geolocation of the Chinese First Polar Microsatellite (Ice Pathfinder) Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice Pathfinder (Code: BNU-1), launched on 12 September 2019, is the first Chinese polar observation microsatellite. Its main payload is a wide-view camera with a ground resolution of 74 m at the subsatellite point and a scanning width of 744 km. BNU-1 takes into account the balance between spatial resolution and revisit frequency, providing observations with finer spatial resolution than Terra/Aqua MODIS data and more frequent revisits than Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI. It is a valuable supplement for polar observations. Geolocation is an essential step in satellite image processing. This study aims to geolocate BNU-1 images; this includes two steps. For the first step, a geometric calibration model is applied to transform the image coordinates to geographic coordinates. The images calibrated by the geometric model are the Level1A (L1A) product. Due to the inaccuracy of satellite attitude and orbit parameters, the geometric calibration model also exhibits errors, resulting in geolocation errors in the BNU-1 L1A product. Then, a geometric correction method is applied as the second step to find the control points (CPs) extracted from the BNU-1 L1A product and the corresponding MODIS images. These CPs are used to estimate and correct geolocation errors. The BNU-1 L1A product corrected by the geometric correction method is processed to the Level1B (L1B) product. Although the geometric correction method based on CPs has been widely used to correct the geolocation errors of visible remote sensing images, it is difficult to extract enough CPs from polar images due to the high reflectance of snow and ice. In this study, the geometric correction employs an image division and an image enhancement method to extract more CPs from the BNU-1 L1A products. The results indicate that the number of CPs extracted by the division and image enhancements increases by about 30% to 182%. Twenty-eight images of Antarctica and fifteen images of Arctic regions were evaluated to assess the performance of the geometric correction. The average geolocation error was reduced from 10 km to similar to 300 m. In general, this study presents the geolocation method, which could serve as a reference for the geolocation of other visible remote sensing images for polar observations.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of net primary productivity of spruce-fir forest at high altitudes and the driving forces in Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spruce -fir forests at their upper distribution ( above 1400 m) in Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve showed growth decline and die -off, but the decline pattern and underlying mechanism are unclear. In this study, based on Landsat data from 1994 to 2019, we calculated the net primary productivity (NPP) by CASA model and analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of NPP in spruce -fir forests at their upper distribution in Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve. Results showed that: (1) NPP of spruce -fir forest varied within 111.96-182.19 g C . m(-2) . a(-1), with a mean value of 141.85 ( 18.43) g C . m(-2) " a(-1). From 1994 to 2019, the maximum and minimum NPP in spruce -fir forest occurred in 1996 (182.19 g C . m(-2) . a(-1)) and 2018 (111.96 g C . m(-2) . a(-1)) respectively. (2) The NPP of spruce -fir forest was negatively correlated with elevation and slope, and there was no significant difference in its distribution among different aspects. In the range of 1600-1650 m, the change rate of NPP was close to zero, while NPP at lower and higher altitudes was decreasing. The decreases of NPP of spruce -fir forest were the most obvious when the slope was within the range of 0-10, and the variation trend of NPP decreased with increasing slope. The increases of NPP showed a trend of decline on shady slope and semi shady slope, but tended to be stable on sunny slope and semi -sunny slope. ( 3) The NPP of spruce -fir forest was positively correlated with precipitation, but not related with temperature. The decrease in NPP was partly related to tourism activities in the protected areas. Our results indicated that there was no consistent, large -area decline in the high -altitude spruce -fir forest, and the variation of NPP was mainly affected by site factors, precipitation, and human activities.

TI  - Wind Direction Retrieval Using Support Vector Machine from CYGNSS Sea Surface Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the difficulty of wind direction retrieval in the case of the large space and time span of the global sea surface, a method of sea surface wind direction retrieval using a support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. This paper uses the space-borne global navigation satellite systems reflected signal (GNSS-R) as the remote sensing signal source. Using the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) satellite data, this paper selects a variety of feature parameters according to the correlation between the features of the sea surface reflection signal and the wind direction, including the Delay Doppler Map (DDM), corresponding to the CYGNSS satellite parameters and geometric feature parameters. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) is selected, and parameter optimization is performed through cross-validation based on the grid search method. Finally, the SVM model of sea surface wind direction retrieval is established. The result shows that this method has a high retrieval classification accuracy using the dataset with wind speed greater than 10 m/s, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the retrieval result is 26.70 & DEG;.

TI  - Short and Medium-Term Prediction of Winter Wheat NDVI Based on the DTW-LSTM Combination Method and MODIS Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important agricultural parameter that is closely correlated with crop growth. In this study, a novel method combining the dynamic time warping (DTW) model and the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network model was developed to predict the short and medium-term winter wheat NDVI. LSTM is well-suited for modelling long-term dependencies, but this method may be susceptible to overfitting. In contrast, DTW possesses good predictive ability and is less susceptible to overfitting. Therefore, by utilizing the combination of these two models, the prediction error caused by overfitting is reduced, thus improving the final prediction accuracy. The combined method proposed here utilizes the historical MODIS time series data with an 8-day time resolution from 2015 to 2020. First, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to decompose the time series into two parts. The first part reflects the inter-annual and seasonal variation characteristics of winter wheat NDVI, and the DTW model is applied for prediction. The second part reflects the short-term change characteristics of winter wheat NDVI, and the LSTM model is applied for prediction. Next, the results from both models are combined to produce a final prediction. A case study in Hebei Province that predicts the NDVI of winter wheat at five prediction horizons in the future indicates that the DTW-LSTM model proposed here outperforms the LSTM model according to multiple evaluation indicators. The results of this study suggest that the DTW-LSTM model is highly promising for short and medium-term NDVI prediction.

TI  - GAN-GL: Generative Adversarial Networks for Glacial Lake Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a powerful tool that provides flexibility and scalability for monitoring and investigating glacial lakes in High Mountain Asia (HMA). However, existing methods for mapping glacial lakes are designed based on a combination of several spectral features and ancillary data (such as the digital elevation model, DEM) to highlight the lake extent and suppress background information. These methods, however, suffer from either the inevitable requirement of post-processing work or the high costs of additional data acquisition. Signifying a key advancement in the deep learning models, a generative adversarial network (GAN) can capture multi-level features and learn the mapping rules in source and target domains using a minimax game between a generator and discriminator. This provides a new and feasible way to conduct large-scale glacial lake mapping. In this work, a complete glacial lake dataset was first created, containing approximately 4600 patches of Landsat-8 OLI images edited in three ways-random cropping, density cropping, and uniform cropping. Then, a GAN model for glacial lake mapping (GAN-GL) was constructed. The GAN-GL consists of two parts-a generator that incorporates a water attention module and an image segmentation module to produce the glacial lake masks, and a discriminator which employs the ResNet-152 backbone to ascertain whether a given pixel belonged to a glacial lake. The model was evaluated using the created glacial lake dataset, delivering a good performance, with an F1 score of 92.17% and IoU of 86.34%. Moreover, compared to the mapping results derived from the global-local iterative segmentation algorithm and random forest for the entire Eastern Himalayas, our proposed model was superior regarding the segmentation of glacial lakes under complex and diverse environmental conditions, in terms of accuracy (precision = 93.19%) and segmentation efficiency. Our model was also very good at detecting small glacial lakes without assistance from ancillary data or human intervention.

TI  - The Spatial Distribution and Prediction of Soil Heavy Metals Based on Measured Samples and Multi-Spectral Images in Tai Lake of China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil is an important natural resource. The excessive amount of heavy metals in soil can harm and threaten human health. Therefore, monitoring of soil heavy metal content is urgent. Monitoring soil heavy metals by traditional methods requires many human and material resources. Remote sensing has shown advantages in the field of monitoring heavy metals. Based on 971 heavy metal samples and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images in Tai Lake, China, we analyzed the correlation between six heavy metals (Cd, Hg, As, Pb, Cu, Zn) and spectral factors, and selected As and Hg as the input factors of inversion model. The correlation coefficient of the best model of As was 0.53 (p < 0.01), and of Hg was 0.318 (p < 0.01). We used the methods of partial least squares regression (PLSR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) to establish inversion models with different combinations of spectral factors by using 649 measured samples. In addition, 322 measured samples were used for accuracy evaluation. Compared with the PLSR model, the BP neural network builds the model with higher accuracy, and B1-B4 combined with LnB1-LnB4 builds the model with the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the best model was verified, with an average error of 19% for As and 45% for Hg. Analyzing the spatial distribution of heavy metals by using the interpolation method of Kriging and IDW. The overall distribution trend of the two interpolations is similar. The concentration of As elements tends to increase from north to south, and the relatively high value of Hg elements is distributed in the east and west of the study area. The factories in the study area are distributed along rivers and lakes, which is consistent with the spatial distribution of heavy metal enrichment areas. The relatively high-value areas of heavy metal elements are related to the distribution of metal products factories, refractory porcelain factories, tile factories, factories and mining enterprises, etc., indicating that factory pollution is the main reason for the enrichment of heavy metals.

TI  - Multi-Stage Fusion and Multi-Source Attention Network for Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Image Segmentation
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of sensor technology, lots of remote sensing data have been collected. It effectively obtains good semantic segmentation performance by extracting feature maps based on multi-modal remote sensing images since extra modal data provides more information. How to make full use of multi-model remote sensing data for semantic segmentation is challenging. Toward this end, we propose a new network called Multi-Stage Fusion and Multi-Source Attention Network ((MS)(2)-Net) for multi-modal remote sensing data segmentation. The multi-stage fusion module fuses complementary information after calibrating the deviation information by filtering the noise from the multi-modal data. Besides, similar feature points are aggregated by the proposed multi-source attention for enhancing the discriminability of features with different modalities. The proposed model is evaluated on publicly available multi-modal remote sensing data sets, and results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Mapping a Paddy Rice Area in a Cloudy and Rainy Region Using Spatiotemporal Data Fusion and a Phenology-Based Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate mapping of paddy rice is important to ensure food security and to protect the environment for sustainable development. Existing paddy rice mapping methods are often remote sensing technologies based on optical images. However, the availability of high-quality remotely sensed paddy rice growing area data is limited due to frequent cloud cover and rain over the southwest China. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a paddy rice field mapping method by combining a spatiotemporal fusion algorithm and a phenology-based algorithm. First, a modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator (MNSPI) time series approach was used to remove clouds on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI images in 2020. A flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) model was used to fuse Sentinel-2 data and MODIS data to obtain multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images. Then, the fused remote sensing data were used to construct fusion time series data to produce time series vegetation indices (NDVI\LSWI) having a high spatiotemporal resolution (10 m and & LE;16 days). On this basis, the unique physical characteristics of paddy rice during the transplanting period and other auxiliary data were combined to map paddy rice in Yongchuan District, Chongqing, China. Our results were validated by field survey data and showed a high accuracy of the proposed method indicated by an overall accuracy of 93% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.85. The paddy rice planting area map was also consistent with the official data of the third national land survey; at the town level, the correlation between official survey data and paddy rice area was 92.5%. The results show that this method can effectively map paddy rice fields in a cloudy and rainy area.

TI  - Transferable Deep Learning from Time Series of Landsat Data for National Land-Cover Mapping with Noisy Labels: A Case Study of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale land-cover classification using a supervised algorithm is a challenging task. Enormous efforts have been made to manually process and check the production of national land-cover maps. This has led to complex pre- and post-processing and even the production of inaccurate mapping products from large-scale remote sensing images. Inspired by the recent success of deep learning techniques, in this study we provided a feasible automatic solution for improving the quality of national land-cover maps. However, the application of deep learning to national land-cover mapping remains limited because only small-scale noisy labels are available. To this end, a mutual transfer network MTNet was developed. MTNet is capable of learning better feature representations by mutually transferring pre-trained models from time-series of data and fine-tuning current data. An interactive training strategy such as this can effectively alleviate the effects of inaccurate or noisy labels and unbalanced sample distributions, thus yielding a relatively stable classification system. Extensive experiments were conducted by focusing on several representative regions to evaluate the classification results of our proposed method. Quantitative results showed that the proposed MTNet outperformed its baseline model about 1%, and the accuracy can be improved up to 6.45% compared with the model trained by the training set of another year. We also visualized the national classification maps generated by MTNet for two different time periods to quantitatively analyze the performance gain. It was concluded that the proposed MTNet provides an efficient method for large-scale land cover mapping.

TI  - Spatial Variability and Temporal Heterogeneity of Surface Urban Heat Island Patterns and the Suitability of Local Climate Zones for Land Surface Temperature Characterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated monthly variations of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) and the applicability of the local climate zones (LCZ) scheme for land surface temperature (LST) differentiation within three spatial contexts, including urban, rural and their combination, in Shenyang, China, a city with a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate. The monthly SUHII and LST of Shenyang were obtained through 12 LST images, with one in each month (within the period between 2018 and 2020), retrieved from the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) 10 in Landsat 8 based on a split window algorithm. Non-parametric analysis of Kruskal-Wallis H test and a multiple pairwise comparison were adopted to investigate the monthly LST differentiations with LCZs. Overall, the SUHII and the applicability of the LCZ scheme exhibited spatiotemporal variations. July and August were the two months when Shenyang underwent strong heat island effects. Shenyang underwent a longer period of cool than heat island effects, occurring from November to May. June and October were the transition months of cool-heat and heat-cool island phenomena, respectively. The SUHII analysis was dependent on the definition of urban and rural boundaries, where a smaller rural buffering zone resulted in a weaker SUHI or surface urban cool island (SUCI) phenomenon and a larger urban area corresponded to a weaker SUHI or SUCI phenomenon as well. The LST of LCZs did not follow a fixed order, where in July and August, the LCZ-10 (Heavy industry) had the highest mean LST, followed by LCZ-2 (Compact midrise) and then LCZ-7 (Lightweight low-rise). In comparison, LCZ-7, LCZ-8 (Large low-rise) and LCZ-9 (Sparsely built) had the highest LST from October to May. The LST of LCZs varied with urban and rural contexts, where LCZ-7, LCZ-8 and LCZ -10 were the three built LCZs that had the highest LST within urban context, while LCZ-2, LCZ-3 (Compact low-rise), LCZ-8, LCZ-9 and LCZ-10 were the five built LCZs that had the highest LST within rural context. The suitability of the LCZ scheme for temperature differentiation varied with the month, where from July to October, the LCZ scheme had the strongest capability and in May, it had the weakest capability. Urban context also made a difference to the suitability, where compared with the whole study area (the combination of urban and rural areas), the suitability of built LCZs in either urban or rural contexts weakened. Moreover, the built LCZs had a higher level of suitability in an urban context compared with a rural context, while the land-cover LCZs within rural had a higher level of suitability.

TI  - Harbor Aquaculture Area Extraction Aided with an Integration-Enhanced Gradient Descent Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the harbor aquaculture area tested is Zhanjiang coast, and for the remote sensing data, we use images from the GaoFen-1 satellite. In order to achieve a superior extraction performance, we propose the use of an integration-enhanced gradient descent (IEGD) algorithm. The key idea of this algorithm is to add an integration gradient term on the basis of the gradient descent (GD) algorithm to obtain high-precision extraction of the harbor aquaculture area. To evaluate the extraction performance of the proposed IEGD algorithm, comparative experiments were performed using three supervised classification methods: the neural network method, the support vector machine method, and the maximum likelihood method. From the results extracted, we found that the overall accuracy and F-score of the proposed IEGD algorithm for the overall performance were 0.9538 and 0.9541, meaning that the IEGD algorithm outperformed the three comparison algorithms. Both the visualized and quantitative results demonstrate the high precision of the proposed IEGD algorithm aided with the CEM scheme for the harbor aquaculture area extraction. These results confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed IEGD algorithm in harbor aquaculture area extraction from GF-1 satellite data. Added to that, the proposed IEGD algorithm can improve the extraction accuracy of large-scale images and be employed for the extraction of various aquaculture areas. Given that the IEGD algorithm is a type of supervised classification algorithm, it relies heavily on the spectral feature information of the aquaculture object. For this reason, if the spectral feature information of the region of interest is not selected properly, the extraction performance of the overall aquaculture area will be extremely reduced.

TI  - Retrieval of All-Weather 1 km Land Surface Temperature from Combined MODIS and AMSR2 Data over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most valuable variables for applications relating to hydrological processes, drought monitoring and climate change. LST from satellite data provides consistent estimates over large scales but is only available for cloud-free pixels, greatly limiting applications over frequently cloud-covered regions. With this study, we propose a method for estimating all-weather 1 km LST by combining passive microwave and thermal infrared data. The product is based on clear-sky LST retrieved from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared measurements complemented by LST estimated from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Version 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature to fill gaps caused by clouds. Terrain, vegetation conditions, and AMSR2 multiband information were selected as the auxiliary variables. The random forest algorithm was used to establish the non-linear relationship between the auxiliary variables and LST over the Tibetan Plateau. To assess the error of this method, we performed a validation experiment using clear-sky MODIS LST and in situ measurements. The estimated all-weather LST approximated MODIS LST with an acceptable error, with a coefficient of correlation (r) between 0.87 and 0.99 and a root mean square error (RMSE) between 2.24 K and 5.35 K during the day. At night-time, r was between 0.89 and 0.99 and the RMSE was between 1.02 K and 3.39 K. The error between the estimated LST and in situ LST was also found to be acceptable, with the RMSE for cloudy pixels between 5.15 K and 6.99 K. This method reveals a significant potential to derive all-weather 1 km LST using AMSR2 and MODIS data at a regional and global scale, which will be explored in the future.

TI  - Optimal Estimate of Global Biome-Specific Parameter Settings to Reconstruct NDVI Time Series with the Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS) Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial remote sensing data products retrieved from radiometric measurements in the optical and thermal infrared spectrum such as vegetation spectral indices can be heavily contaminated by atmospheric conditions, including cloud and aerosol layers. This contamination results in gaps or noisy observations. The harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) has been widely used for time series reconstruction of remote sensing imagery in recent decades. To use HANTS model, a series of parameters, such as number of frequencies (NF), fitting error tolerance (FET), degree of over-determinedness (DoD), and regularization factor (Delta), need to be defined by users. These parameters provide flexibilities, but also make it difficult for non-expert users to determine appropriate settings for specific applications. This study systematically evaluated the reconstruction performance of the model under different parameter setting scenarios by simulating pixel-wise reference and noisy NDVI time series. The results of these numerical experiments were further used to identify optimal settings and improve global NDVI reconstruction performance. The results suggested optimal settings for different areas (local optimization). If a user opts to use unique settings for global reconstruction, the setting NF = 4, FET = 0.05, DoD = 5, and Delta = 0.5 can produce the best performance across all setting scenarios (global optimization). In addition, several internal improvements, such as dynamic weighting scheme, polynomial and inter-annual harmonic components, and ancillary attributes of input data can be used to further improve the performance of reconstruction. With these results, future non-expert users can easily determine appropriate settings of HANTS for specific applications in different regions.

TI  - Water Chlorophyll Estimation in an Urban Canal System With High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality, which is a key concern associated with large-scale canal operation and management, is vulnerable to the influences from short-term weather variations and artificial activities. Chlorophyll is one of the key indicators to measure the water quality and usability for drinking and irrigation in the canal system. However, previous research designed the state-of-the-art algorithms regarding water chlorophyll estimation using medium-resolution remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat), which has insufficient resolution to capture canals that are usually narrower than one pixel in such data. High-resolution imageries covering the whole canal network might include only either visible wavebands (i.e., red, green, blue bands) or cost thousands of dollars for an effective investigation on real-time water chlorophyll monitoring. Thus, the strategy designed for water chlorophyll analysis in a canal should consider an appropriate tradeoff among spatial resolution, the spectrum helpful for chlorophyll detection, and the financial burden. This letter presents our efforts on identifying and assessing the extent of the Planet data for measuring chlorophyll degree of canal waters. The experiments show that although Planet can represent the relative variation in water chlorophyll concentration, new algorithms are still necessary for accurate results regarding water chlorophyll variations in a canal system.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Suspended Particles in Qingcaosha Reservoir of the Yangtze River Estuary Based on Landsat-8 OLI
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qingcaosha reservoir at the Yangtze River estuary is an important source of drinking water, and its water quality must be assessed. This paper takes suspended solids in the water body as a key parameter to evaluate water quality and conducts related research using high spatial resources data of Landsat-8 Operation Land Imager (OLI) to objectively and scientifically evaluate the water quality of Qingcaosha reservoir. An inversion algorithm for suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Qingcaosha reservoir was developed using satellite data and field observations. Field observations were used to verify the accuracy of the developed algorithm. The results showed that the correlation coefficient was high and the root mean square error was low, indicating that the algorithm is effective. In addition, the inversion accuracy is hi g h and the inversion result is credible. The Landsat-8 OLI data from 2013 to 2019 were processed using the proposed algorithm to obtain the average spatial distribution and time distribution characteristics of SPM. The SPM concentration in Qingcaosha reservoir was found to be the lowest in the estuary. The difference of SPM concentration in the reservoir' s upper part is the largest in winter and the smallest in spring. The concentration of SPM in the reservoir's middle and lower parts is low, and the change is small. According to the research results, the Qingcaosha reservoir at the Yangtze River estuary is clean and has good water quality.

TI  - Quick Detection of Field-Scale Soil Comprehensive Attributes via the Integration of UAV and Sentinel-2B Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing can be used to estimate soil properties; however, little is known regarding the effects of UAV and satellite remote sensing data integration on the estimation of soil comprehensive attributes, or how to estimate quickly and robustly. In this study, we tackled those gaps by employing UAV multispectral and Sentinel-2B data to estimate soil salinity and chemical properties over a large agricultural farm (400 ha) covered by different crops and harvest areas at the coastal saline-alkali land of the Yellow River Delta of China in 2019. Spatial information of soil salinity, organic matter, available/total nitrogen content, and pH at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm layers were obtained via ground sampling (n = 195) and two-dimensional spatial interpolation, aiming to overlap the soil information with remote sensing information. The exploratory factor analysis was conducted to generate latent variables, which represented the salinity and chemical characteristics of the soil. A machine learning algorithm (random forest) was applied to estimate soil attributes. Our results indicated that the integration of UAV texture and Sentinel-2B spectral data as random forest model inputs improved the accuracy of latent soil variable estimation. The remote sensing-based information from cropland (crop-based) had a higher accuracy compared to estimations performed on bare soil (soil-based). Therefore, the crop-based approach, along with the integration of UAV texture and Sentinel-2B data, is recommended for the quick assessment of soil comprehensive attributes.

TI  - Research of the Dual-Band Log-Linear Analysis Model Based on Physics for Bathymetry without In-Situ Depth Data in the South China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current widely used bathymetric inversion model based on multispectral satellite imagery mostly relies on in-situ depth data for establishing a liner/non-linear relationship between water depth and pixel reflectance. This paper evaluates the performance of a dual-band log-linear analysis model based on physics (P-DLA) for bathymetry without in-situ depth data. This is done using WorldView-2 images of blue and green bands. Further, the pixel sampling principles for solving the four key parameters of the model are summarized. Firstly, this paper elaborates on the physical mechanism of the P-DLA model. All unknown parameters of the P-DLA model are solved by different types of sampling pixels extracted from multispectral images for bathymetric measurements. Ganquan Island and Zhaoshu Island, where accuracy evaluation is performed for the bathymetric results of the P-DLA model with in-situ depth data, were selected to be processed using the method to evaluate its performance. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the Ganquan Island and Zhaoshu Island results are 1.69 m and 1.74 m with the mean relative error (MREs) of 14.8% and 18.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, the bathymetric inversion is performed with in-situ depth data using the traditional dual-band log-linear regression model (DLR). The results show that the accuracy of the P-DLA model bathymetry without in-situ depth data is roughly equal to that of the DLR model water depth inversion based on in-situ depth data. The results indicate that the P-DLA model can still obtain relatively ideal bathymetric results despite not having actual bathymetric data in the model training. It also demonstrates underwater microscopic features and changes in the islands and reefs.

TI  - Spectral Probability Distribution of Closed Connected Water and Remote Sensing Statistical Inference for Yellow Substance
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike traditional remote sensing inversion, this study proposes a new distribution-distribution scheme, which uses statistical inferences to estimate the probability distribution of in-water components based on the probability distribution of the observed spectra. The distribution-distribution scheme has the advantages that it rapidly gives the statistical information of the water of interest, assists the traditional scheme in improving models, and provides more valuable information for water classification and aquatic environment analysis. In this study, based on Landsat-8 images, we analyzed the spectral probability distributions of 688 global waters and found that many of them were normal, log normal, and exponential distributions with diverse patterns in distribution parameters such as the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Using simulated and field-measured data, we propose a bootstrap-based distribution-distribution scheme and develop some simple remote sensing statistical inference models to estimate the distribution parameters of yellow substance in water.

TI  - Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound for Precise Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Women with Early Breast Cancer: A Preliminary Study
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), as a common method for axillary staging of early breast cancer, has gradually attracted people's attention to the false-negative rate and postoperative complications. The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical value of preoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for intraoperative SLNB in early breast cancer patients. Methods: A total of 201 patients scheduled for SLNB from September 2018 to April 2021 were collected consecutively. Preoperative CEUS was used to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and lymphatic drainage in breast cancer patients. Results: The SLN identification rate of CEUS was 93.0% (187/201) and four lymphatic drainage patterns were found: single LC to single SLN (70.0%), multiple LCs to single SLN (8.0%), single LC to multiple SLNs (10.2%), and multiple LCs to multiple SLNs (11.8%). The Sen, Spe, PPV, NPV, AUC of CEUS, US and CEUS + US in diagnosis of SLNs were 82.7%, 80.4%, 73.8%, 87.4%, 0.815; 70.7%, 77.7%, 68.0%, 79.8%, 0.742; and 86.7%, 77.7%, 72.2%, 89.7%, 0.822, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the diagnostic performance of CEUS and CEUS + US (p = 0.630). Conclusions: CEUS can be used to preoperatively assess the lymphatic drainage patterns and the status of the SLNs in early breast cancer to assist precision intraoperative SLNB.

TI  - Effect of Microstructure and Horizontal Inhomogeneity of Broken Cirrus Clouds on Mean Solar Radiative Fluxes in the Visible Wavelength Region: Results of Numerical Simulation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the results from statistical simulation of the albedo and diffuse transmission of the atmosphere in the visible wavelength region in the presence of overcast and broken cirrus clouds. The main numerical experiments were performed using the third version of the model proposed by B.A. Baum, P. Yang, A.J. Heymsfield et al. (a mixture of particles of different shapes and sizes with a very rough surface). To estimate the effects of the random cloud geometry on the solar radiative transfer in the atmosphere, we used the method of closed equations, proposed by G.A. Titov, and developed within the model based on the Poisson point fluxes on straight lines. Analysis of how the microstructure of cirrus clouds influences the ensemble-averaged albedo and diffuse transmission at moderate cloud fractions showed that the average value of the uncertainty due to the lack of information on the particle shape and size is within similar to +/- 2%. This value is comparable to the effect of the random geometry in optically thin clouds; while in optically dense clouds the range of errors, caused by the neglect of the horizontal inhomogeneity, increases and is similar to +/- 5% in albedo calculations, with underestimation of diffuse transmission by similar to 10-20%.

TI  - Where does subcutaneous lymph from the chest wall flow into after mastectomy?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Changes of the lymph flow from the chest wall after mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (Ax) has yet to be understood. This study aimed to investigate the effect of axillary surgery on lymphatic flow from the chest wall in patients who have undergone mastectomy, including those have undergone breast reconstruction and vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT).Methods: Following mastectomy in 100 breasts, the directions of lymph flow from the chest wall was compared between the SLNB omission, SLNB, Ax, and Ax followed by VLNT groups using indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography in cross-sectional study. Lymph flow on the deep epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap was also investigated.Results: Lymph flow directing to the ipsilateral axilla was observed more frequently after SLNB than Ax (48% vs. 12.5%; p = 0.005); however, no significant difference was observed in the frequency of contralateral axillary route adoption between them (8% vs. 15%; p =0.65). In the VLNT group, lymph flow to the ipsilateral axilla was not observed at a significantly higher frequency than in the Ax group (12.5% vs. 12.5%, p = 1.00). On the transferred DIEP flap, the lymph flowed anterograde or retrograde parallel to the anatomic course of the lymphatic vessels.Conclusion: To visualize the direction of lymph flow of the chest following mastectomy, ICG lymphography may be useful to discern the direction in which malignant neoplasms, including lymphoma, are transported and to plan for lymph flow restoration.

TI  - Assessing the palaeohydrology of the lost Saraswati River in the Punjab-Haryana plains, Northwest India from satellite data
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been suggested over a century ago that the Saraswati was a large river that flowed in the Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve, a region that is now devoid of any such large river system. This large river was commonly related to the Saraswati River described in the Rig-veda, and was correlated with the discovery of several Harappan sites in the region. Presently, there is only the ephemeral Ghaggar River that flows here with its limited discharge along the abandoned course of the 'lost' Saraswati. Also, it was hypothesised earlier that this region was drained by the waters from the drainage basins of both the glacier/monsoon-fed Sutlej and Yamuna rivers. It therefore stands to reason that this region should preserve evidence of the record of the past discharge variability that impacted this region prior to the major drainage reorganisation. This study is an attempt to reconstruct the palaeohydrology of the Saraswati River. We investigate the hypothesis, that the ancient Saraswati River used to carry a combined flow of the Sutlej, Ghaggar and Yamuna river catchments. To examine this important question, we use the channel belt width, catchment area and average annual discharge of different rivers presently flowing on Indus-Ganga-Brahmaputra plains in the Himalayan Foreland. We use these variables to establish the empirical scaling relationships between the channel belt width and average annual discharge to the catchment area. We observed rivers having a larger catchment usually carry a higher discharge and have a wider channel belt. Finally, we use these empirical scaling relationships to estimate the channel belt width and average annual discharge of the lost Saraswati River at the time when it possibly carried the combined flow of the Sutlej, Ghaggar, and Yamuna rivers catchments. We obtained the average annual discharge of the Saraswati River of an order of 3000 m3s- 1 and channel belt width of about 11 km at the location downstream of the postulated confluence of the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers at Suratgarh.

TI  - Role of Space-Borne Sea Surface Winds on the Simulation of Tropical Cyclones Over the Indian Seas
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of space-based sea surface winds on the simulation of tropical cyclones that formed over two distinct basins of the northern Indian Ocean during October-November 2019 is investigated in this study. Observing system experiments (OSEs) using the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) Unified Model (NCUM) assimilation and forecast system were designed to simulate the characteristics of the cyclones "Kyarr", which formed over the Arabian Sea (24 October to 3 November 2019), and "Bulbul" over the Bay of Bengal (4-11 November 2019) by including the sea surface winds derived from the scatterometer on board the MetOp-A, MetOp-B, ScatSat-1 and microwave radiometer aboard WindSat satellites. Approximately 3% of the sea surface winds received were assimilated in the NCUM system during both cyclone cases, and the two MetOp scatterometers contributed the most significant fraction. Assimilation of sea surface winds improved the cyclone characteristics in the analysis compared to a baseline experiment, which denied all the sea surface winds. Sea surface wind assimilation improved the surface wind analysis by 2-7% and reduced the root mean square differences by similar to 10% when compared against ERA5 reanalysis. Better simulation of cyclone track in the higher lead time suggests that the sea surface wind information is critical in the analysis during the cyclone's initial stage. The estimated track and intensity errors were larger for the Kyarr than the Bulbul cyclone. This could be due to the nature of the cyclones, Kyarr being a super cyclone which dissipated over the ocean, whereas Bulbul was a severe cyclone that dissipated after landfall. An improvement in the post-landfall track of Bulbul due to the assimilation of sea surface winds is also noted.

TI  - A repeatable change detection approach to map extreme storm-related damages caused by intense surface runoff based on optical and SAR remote sensing: Evidence from three case studies in the South of France
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most flood hazards are induced either by river overflowing or intense overland flow following heavy rainfall, causing land surface damages under many forms. Until now, fine-scale detection of damages caused by intense rainwater runoff beyond the direct vicinity of major waterways has been scarcely explored using satellite remote sensing. In this work, three extreme storms in the Aude and Alpes-Maritimes departments in the South of France were investigated based on ground truths and very high resolution optical imagery (Pl ' eiades satellite, IGN orthophotos). Plot delineation and land use information were combined to high revisit frequency and high resolution optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) open-source data to test a simple automatic and replicable change detection method to locate damaged plots using supervised classification. Based on a unique training sample from the Aude floods of October 2018, combinations of plot-based spectral indicators allowed reaching overall detection accuracies greater than 85% on independent validation samples for all three events. A simple land use inter-class demeaning pre-processing used to account for land-specific seasonal variations improved event and site repeatability by lowering false detection rates down to a maximum of 13%. The benefits of introducing SWIR channel in addition to visible and near-infrared indices were limited to a few percentage points. SAR-derived proxies of soil moisture and roughness in weakly vegetated areas were consistent with the presence of degradations, with VV being the most sensitive polarization. However, classification accuracy was not significantly increased with Sentinel-1 data as compared to the exclusive use of Sentinel-2. Additional tests revealed that should the closest available optical images be rather distant in time because of persistent cloud cover, the method is reasonably robust as long as stable ground conditions were observed before the event. The need for images close in time was however emphasized through cross-site training. Indeed, efficient replicability from one site to another relied on using unaffected learning plots with slightly more inherent variability in time variations of spectral indices compared to the test site. Beyond the investigation of three case studies, this work demonstrates the performance and repeatability potential of a new probabilistic change detection method to expose various kinds of extreme rainfall-related disturbances, in particular those occurring far from the main hydrographic network. Should spatially accurate rainfall products be available, comprehensive mapping of intense stormwater runoff hazards using this original plot-based approach will then allow improving the understanding of overland flow generation mechanisms in hydrological models.

TI  - Dynamics and Characterization of Aeolian Dust Deposition from a Burned Shrubland at Chubut Coastal Patagonia in Argentina
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to evaluate the dynamics of dust deposition and characterize its elemental composition in case study at Chubut coastal Patagonia in Argentina after a shrubland fire. On 22 December 2016, a fire took place (42 degrees 20 ' S-65 degrees W) covering similar to 30 thousand hectares (300 km(2)) of shrublands. Immediately after the fire (2 January 2017), monthly deposition of dust was recorded using passive collectors in burned and control regions until December 2017. The dust plume of the burned region, visible from MODIS imagery, reached more than 150 km from the coast toward the marine area. In the burned region, dust deposition rates peaked in February (84.75 mg/day m(-2)), decreased until May (mean value = 12 mg/day m(-2)), and afterward remained constant (mean value = 10 mg/day m(-2)) above background level during the studied period. In the control region, dust deposition was constant and significantly lower (mean value = 0.19 mg/day m(-2)). Overall, the dust elemental composition was mainly Si and O corresponding to silicate minerals. Material from the burned region presented peaks of C. On the other hand, C signals were not present in the dust from the control region. The presence of C, suggests a direct consequence of the burned vegetation. The burned region may become a significant source of dust due to the reduced vegetation coverage, and may constitute an additional input of C into the marine ecosystem. The present study is the first report that provides insights that a burned region in Patagonia may act as a dust source.

TI  - General Coastline Extraction Based on an Improved Active Contour Model in Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao, China, from 1990 to 2018 Using Landsat Satellite Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline is located at the junction of the sea and the land, and it is essential for ecological environment. However, most existing methods can extract the coastline with obvious boundaries and cannot obtain the general coastline, including an intertidal zone and salt field. Accordingly, a new general coastline extraction method is proposed on the basis of an improved active contour model to extract the general coastline from remote sensing images. An improved active contour model was proposed to extract the water area by introducing aiming energy of water from the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index information. Then, mathematical morphology was applied to obtain the seawater area based on the extracted water area. Finally, the coastline was refined and generated by the improved active contour model in a buffer zone of the seawater boundary. Landsat images over Jiaozhou Bay in Shandong Province, China, from 1990 to 2018 were used to extract the general coastline. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively extract the general coastline, which is close to the reference coastline. The length of the coastline decreased from 234.64 km in 1990 to 221.21 km in 2000. This value significantly increased to 255.05 km from 2000 to 2010. The main reason is that Hongdao Island merged with the mainland due to reclamation. The length of the coastline slightly decreased by approximately 12 km from 2010 to 2018 due to environmental protection measures and the reclamation prohibition.

TI  - Squamous cell carcinoma of the external ear: 170 cases treated with Mohs surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Squamous cell carcinoma of the ear (SCC-E) shows high rates of local recurrence (LR) and lymph node metastases (NM). SCC-E is the leading cause of death from nonmelanoma skin cancer.Objective: To determine the LR and NM rates and survival after Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).Patients and methods: We treated 170 invasive SCC-E with MMS with a mean follow up of 48 months. Mean age was 76 years, 93.2% were male patients, mean size: 1.5 cm, and 61.8% of the tumours were well differentiated.Results: We observed 5 LRs, 2 locoregional recurrences, and 16 NMs in 23 patients. LR and NM rates were 4.1% and 10.6%, respectively. Only 3/25 recurrences occurred after 2 years of follow up. We observed 1(0.6%) distant metastasis (DM) in a patient who also presented LR + NM. Six out of seven cases with LR and 8/18 with NM died of disease, regardless of aggressive surgical rescue with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. Five-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival were 81%, 82.6%, and 89.7%, respectively.Conclusions: Undeniably, the outcome in SCC-E is determined by locoregional control. DM are sporadic and rarely the cause of death. Systematic reviews and retrospective studies show a solid trend in favor of MMS vs surgical excision. The LR rate of this series (4.1%) is one of the lowest published to date with regard to SCC-E, and confirms this assertion.We observed 10.6% NMs according to other series that treated the whole spectrum of SCC-E. Almost 2/3 of patients with NMs die after therapeutic rescue. We believe that it is essential to identify prognostic factors to select patients for one of the following: close surveillance (ultra-sonography) during the first 2 years after surgery, sentinel node biopsy, or elective treatment of the nodes (surgery or radiotherapy).

TI  - Lymph node dissections in cutaneous malignancy: Where are we now? A review of 10 years' experience at a tertiary centre
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - The surgical management of cutaneous malignancies has evolved over recent years with the introduction of novel medical therapies and an increasing emphasis upon early adjuvant systemic therapy. As such, completion lymph node dissection (cLND) is now no longer recommended following a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in melanoma. We evaluated our ten-year practice at a regional tertiary centre, assessing the change in lymph node dissection (LND) caseload volume, anatomical distribution, and indication for the procedure.A retrospective search was carried out of all LNDs performed by the Plastic Surgery department at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, UK from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019. Case notes were retrospectively analysed for each procedure, with the site and pathology recorded.A total of 491 LNDs were performed over the 10-year period. Surgical volume peaked in 2015 with 67 cases, followed by a decline to 41 cases in 2019. The number of neck dissections increased over the decade, as well as the proportion of cases due to macroscopic nodal disease. We sub-analysed the number of LNDs in three contiguous 18-month intervals, corresponding to changes in practice due to evidence from the DeCOG and MSLT-II Trials. We found a 41.67% reduction in LNDs caseload between July 2018-Dec 2019, compared to a similar period prior to trial evidence (July 2015-Dec 2016) (p = 0.0.14).In summary, the surgical volume of LNDs has decreased significantly since 2018, reflecting emerging evidence and changes to national guidelines. This will require ongoing monitoring for workforce planning and surgical training. (C) 2021 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sensitivity of Remotely Sensed Vegetation to Hydrologic Predictors across the Colorado River Basin, 2001-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In water-limited regions, it is important to understand the response of vegetation to hydrologic predictors for fire management and water resource planning. We present a novel spatially distributed analysis of ecohydrological interactions in the semi-arid Colorado River Basin (CRB) over 18 years, 2001-2019. The hydrologic predictors used include precipitation from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM, 0- to 10-cm-depth surface soil moisture (SSM) estimations from the National Land Data Assimilation System, and newly available 0- to 40-cm depth Soil MERGE root zone soil moisture (RZSM) estimations. These are evaluated using time-lagged correlations with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We demonstrate that EVI response is strongest and most immediate to the hydrologic predictors in the hot and dry southwestern CRB, with lag times of 0-32 days. RZSM was expected to provide the best predictor of EVI, but we found SSM to be a superior predictor of EVI with interquartile range correlations of 0.20-0.37 across the CRB. RZSM had slightly lower interquartile range correlations of 0.15-0.35, and precipitation was the least effective predictor of EVI with interquartile range correlations of 0.11-0.26. Plotting these cross-correlations provides a spatially explicit overview of temporal dependence between SSM, RZSM, precipitation, and EVI with publicly available datasets.

TI  - A ship navigation information service system for the Arctic Northeast Passage using 3D GIS based on big Earth data
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on Arctic passages has mainly focused on navigation policies, sea ice extraction models, and navigation of Arctic sea routes. It is difficult to quantitatively address the specific problems encountered by ships sailing in the Arctic in real time through traditional manual approaches. Additionally, existing sea ice information service systems focus on data sharing and lack online calculation and analysis capabilities, making it difficult for decision-makers to derive valuable information from massive amounts of data. To improve navigation analysis through intelligent information service, we built an advanced Ship Navigation Information Service System (SNISS) using a 3D geographic information system (GIS) based on big Earth data. The SNISS includes two main features: (1) heuristic algorithms were developed to identify the optimal navigation route of the Arctic Northeast Passage (NEP) from a macroscale perspective for the past 10 years to the next 100 years, and (2) for key sea straits along the NEP, online local sea-ice images can be retrieved to provide a fully automatic sea ice data processing workflow, solving the problems of poor flexibility and low availability of real sea ice remote sensing data extraction. This work can potentially enhance the safety of shipping navigation along the NEP.

TI  - Multi-scale evaluation of ecological restoration effects in the riparian zone using Landsat series images from 1980 to 2019
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative evaluation of ecological restoration effects (EREs) is essential to provide operational feedback and implement adaptive management for future riparian restoration. This manuscript aims to develop a multi-scale evaluation method of EREs based on remote sensing observations, which uses the composite index of physical structural integrity (PSI) to indicate riparian condition. The riparian EREs were quantitatively assessed by comparing the post-restoration PSI values with the ecological reference status derived from pre-restoration surveys. In addition, ecological partitioning was adopted to identify the vulnerable riparian areas and explore the influence indicators of ecological restoration. In this paper, we used the case study of the Liaohe River, the first protected area aimed to recover the riparian ecosystem in China, to evaluate the riparian EREs at three spatial scales using Landsat time series images from 1980 to 2019. Results indicated that: (1) the pre-restoration riparian ecosystem exhibited an clear degradation trend and ecological conservation was urgent; (2) riparian restoration is a continuous and heterogeneous ecological process, the project had not yet met its objectives in 2016 with a low ERE value of 49.1 (Poor), while achieved a significant success in 2019 with the ERE value of 68.8 (Very good); (3) the limited restoration partitions with a ERE value below 60 accounted for 42.8% of riparian zones, which were the fragile riparian ecosystems and mainly distributed in reach D and F; and (4) the dominant factors for riparian restoration were canopy coverage, human disturbance and natural vegetation percent. This study is expected to provide a practical and feasible approach for evaluating the riparian EREs and supporting the future river management, in particular for rivers lack of long-term monitoring data.

TI  - Application of L-band SAR for mapping tundra shrub biomass, leaf area index, and rainfall interception
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid shrub expansion has been observed across the Arctic, driving a need for regional-scale estimates of shrub biomass and shrub-mediated ecosystem processes such as rainfall interception. Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been shown sensitive to vegetation canopy characteristics across many ecosystems, thereby potentially providing an accurate and cost-effective tool to quantify shrub canopy cover. This study evaluated the sensitivity of L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) data to the aboveground biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI) of dwarf birch and alder in the Trail Valley Creek watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada. The sigma degrees VH /sigma degrees VV ratio showed strong sensitivity to both LAI (R2 = 0.72 with respect to in-situ measurements) and wet aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.63) of dwarf birch. Our ALOS-2-derived maps revealed high variability of birch shrub LAI and biomass across spatial scales. The LAI map was fed into the sparse Gash model to estimate shrub rainfall interception, an important but under-studied component of the Arctic water balance. Results suggest that on average across the watershed, 17 +/- 3% of incoming rainfall was intercepted by dwarf birch (during summer 2018), highlighting the importance of shrub rainfall interception for the regional water balance. These findings demonstrate the unexploited potential of L-band SAR observations from satellites for quantifying the impact of shrub expansion on Arctic ecosystem processes.

TI  - Real World Data of Penile Cancer Treatment at a High-Volume Center in South America: Insights and Survival Trends
T2  - UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To report survival trends and oncological outcomes of penile cancer surgically treated patients, at a high-volume center, treating more than 25 patients each year, in a high incidence country.METHODS Clinical charts of all patients that underwent surgical management for penile cancer were reviewed. The primary end points were cancer specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival, and local recurrence free survival. Kaplan-Meier plots were used for survival analyses. Multivariate analysis was performed using cox proportional hazard age-adjusted models to determine the effect of pN, pT, lymphovascular invasion for CSS.RESULTS A total of 209 patients were identified, with a median follow up of 96 months (IQR 49-133). Organ-sparing surgerywas performed in 72.7%, 56.9% underwent dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy, 110 patients underwent inguinal lymph node dissection, and 45 (21.5%) pelvic lymph node dissection. A total of 75 (35.8%) of patients relapsed, median time to relapse of 12 months (IQR 6-25). Overall estimates of CSS showed an 8-year CSS of 68.9%. Eight-year CSS was 90.5% for N0, and 32.8% in pN3 (P<.001). The Cox proportional hazard model showed that pN1-3, pT2-4, lymphovascular invasion and positive dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy were the variables associated with worse 8-year CSS.CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, we report one of the largest cohorts on the survival outcomes of penile cancer surgical treatment, in a single institution, over a long period of time, were most patients are referred with high-risk, locally advanced or nodal disease.

TI  - Predictors of sentinel lymph node metastasis in Chinese women with clinical T1-T2 N0 breast cancer and a normal axillary ultrasound
T2  - ACTA RADIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The clinicopathological predictors of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in clinical T1-T2 N0 (cT1-T2 N0) patients with a normal axillary ultrasound (AUS) are unclear. Purpose To assess the association between clinicopathological characteristics of a primary tumor and SLN metastasis in cT1-T2 N0 patients with a normal AUS. Material and Methods Patients who were diagnosed with cT1-T2 N0 invasive breast cancer and who obtained normal AUS results between October 2016 and September 2018 in a single hospital were included. Clinicopathological data were collected to explore the predictors of SLN metastasis using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results SLN metastasis occurred in 26 patients (18.4%) among 141 AUS-normal patients, of which 24 cases (17.0%) had one or two nodal involvements. In the univariate analysis, tumor location, estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were significantly associated with SLN metastasis (P < 0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that tumor location in the upper outer quadrant (odds ratio [OR] = 4.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.63-12.37; P = 0.004), positive PR status (OR = 13.35, 95% CI = 1.60-111.39; P = 0.017), and positive LVI (OR = 8.66, 95% CI = 2.20-34.18; P = 0.002) were independent high-risk factors for SLN metastasis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the regression model was 0.787 (95% CI = 0.694-0.881; P < 0.001). Conclusion Tumor location in the upper outer quadrant, positive PR, and LVI status were found to be significantly high-risk factors for SLN metastasis among cT1-T2 N0 breast cancer patients with a normal AUS result.

TI  - The 2010-2020 'megadrought' drives reduction in lake surface area in the Andes of central Chile (32° - 36°S)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Andes central Chile (32 degrees S-36 degrees S) / LakesStudy focus: Mountain lakes play a key role in the terrestrial freshwater reservoir, both for storage of snow melt and precipitation. Although lakes are sensitive to climate variability, the effect of global warming on water availability remains uncertain. Semiarid regions are especially sensitive to relatively small changes in temperature and precipitation as these have disproportionately large impacts on lake hydrologic budgets. Here, we mapped 12 lakes from the Andes of central Chile (32 degrees-36 degrees S) using Landsat mission and Sentinel-2 satellites images from 1984 to 2020 and compared these results with the available climate data (precipitation, temperature, and evaporation).New hydrological insights for the region: This approach provides a high-resolution temporal and spatial analysis for changes in lake surface over the last 36 years. Our results indicate that the number of lakes and respective surface area decrease latitudinally from south to north across central Chile, which is consistent the present-day rainfall gradient. Over the study period, lake surface areas decreased significantly between 7% and 25% during the so-called 'megadrought' (2010-2020). As lakes continue to dry up, the implications for freshwater availability are of considerable societal and environmental importance. Our results can assist with water manage-ment decisions and improve our understanding of future water availability across the region.

TI  - A global-scale analysis of the MISR Level-3 aerosol optical depth (AOD) product: Comparison with multi-platform AOD data sources
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses the applicability of the recently released Level-3 (L3) daily and monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) products (version F15_0032) over land retrieved from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument. For this purpose, daily AOD data from 427 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites worldwide during 2001-2018 and 39 China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) sites across China during 2002-2014 were selected for comparison. Also, MISR-based size-segregated AODs were collected to compare with the coarse- and fine-mode AODs retrieved from AERONET to reveal the particles size modes that mainly contribute to the offset of MISR total AOD relative to observations. By comparing with five other monthly AOD datasets, including two MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) retrieval products, a multisatellite merged product, and two aerosol reanalysis, MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) and CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service), we then explored the applicability of MISR for characterizing the climatology, interannual variations, and long-term (2003-2017) trends in regional aerosol loadings over the 12 regions of interest. Overall, about 80% (60%) of the daily AOD values retrieved by MISR fall within expected error bounds of (+/- [0.05 + 0.2 x AOD] (+/-[0.03 + 0.1 x AOD])), with a high correlation (R = 0.87). Our comparison results show that although the V23 algorithm addresses several issues in L2 AOD retrieval relative to the previous version, the L3 data aggregated from L2 data tends to on average overestimate low AOD values and underestimate high AOD values. These offset relative to observations are mainly attributed to the overestimation of coarse-mode AOD and the underestimation of fine-mode AOD by MISR. Intercomparison of 2003-2017 AOD trends from multiple data sources indicate that MISR can capture well the increases occurring in South Asia, as well as the decreases occurring in Eastern China, Eastern United States, and Western Europe. Our study confirmed that MISR L3 product performs reliably at regional scales, particularly in typically polluted areas, but caution is still needed when applied to areas where sparse sampling is encountered.

AB  - Diameter frequency distributions provide essential information for estimating timber assortment, monitoring carbon stocks, and formulating forest management measures. In this study, we estimated diameter distribution utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (ULS) data by applying three Weibull distribution modeling methods: (1) parameter prediction method (PPM); (2) moment-based parameter recovery method (PRMM); and (3) percentile-based parameter recovery method (PRMP). The variables used in Weibull distribution modeling methods were combined with stand density as response groups to be modeled with ULS metrics. Considering the hierarchical structure of ULS data and the autocorrelation among sub-models, mixed-effects seemingly unrelated regression (SURM) were applied to take into account both spatial and cross-model correlations. The experiments were conducted for 11 sites of larch plantations using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The diameter distribution was estimated and calibrated by the observed stand density considering the correlations of submodels' random-effects. The results demonstrated that applying a relatively small number of plots (1 to 6) and estimated best linear predictor (EBLUP) for local calibration could improve the prediction performance. The optimal results were obtained from PRMM with six calibrated plots, and the average Reynolds error index was 45.30. Furthermore, simulation applications with different pulse densities were applied and suggested that calibration could also improve the estimation performance but brought little improvement on estimation stability, far lesser than the impact of point cloud density. This study provides an improved approach for diameter distribution estimation and benefits for operational forest applications using remote sensing data.

TI  - Impacts of water resources management on land water storage in the North China Plain: Insights from multi-mission earth observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural conditions of surface water bodies and groundwater aquifers in the North China Plain (NCP) have been altered to meet the ever-growing human water demands. Several water resources management measures have been implemented in recent decades to alleviate groundwater depletion, maintain ecological resilience, and sustain agricultural production. This study aims to investigate their impacts on land water storage, and thus obtain a picture of the spatio-temporal variation of water resources over the NCP. Based on multi-mission earth observation datasets, i.e., altimetry (Sentinel-3), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and spectral imagery (Sentinel-1/2), gravimetry (GRACE/-FO), and microwave sensors (IMERG), as well as reanalysis datasets, we investigate surface water storage (SWS), soil moisture water storage (SMS), and total water storage (TWS) changes. Groundwater storage (GWS) change is subsequently estimated as the residual of the total storage equation.Results show that TWS declined significantly over the past decades (-1.04 +/- 0.05 cm/yr in 2004 to 2020), while SMS rebounded after a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2014. The spatial pattern of TWS variations depicts a particularly severe depletion along provincial boundaries. The SWS dynamics reveal that the volumes of three major NCP reservoirs (Guanting, Miyun, and Danjiangkou) increased significantly since around 2014 when the operation of the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route project (SNWDP-MR) started. Moreover, GWS maintained a depletion rate of 1.05 +/- 0.08 cm/yr during 2004-2014 over the whole NCP, while the depletion rate accelerated during 2015-2020 (-1.88 +/- 0.38 cm/yr). We also found that the GWS depletion in Beijing (-1.20 +/- 0.10 cm/yr during 2004-2014 and 0.79 +/- 0.44 cm/yr during 2015-2020) and its surrounding areas has been lowered possibly because of the SNWDP-MR. This study shows how multi-mission satellite earth observation products can be combined to monitor water resources at a regional scale and provide spatiotemporally resolved estimates of the impacts of human-induced changes in the inland water cycle.

TI  - Resection of the upper paracervical lymphovascular tissue should be an integral part of a pelvic sentinel lymph node algorithm in early stage cervical cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To investigate the prevalence of lymph nodes and lymph node metastases (LNMs) in the upper paracervical lymphovascular tissue (UPLT) in early stage cervical cancer. Methods. In this prospective study consecutive women with stage IA1-IB1 cervical cancer underwent a pelvic lymphadenectomy including identification of sentinel nodes (SLNs) as part of a nodal staging procedure in conjunction with a robotic radical hysterectomy (RRH) or robotic radical trachelectomy (RRT). Indocyanine green (ICG) was used as tracer. The UPLT was separately removed and defined as "SLN-parametrium" and, as all SLN tissue, subjected to ultrastaging and immunohistochemistry. Primary endpoint was prevalence of lymph nodes and metastatic lymph nodes in the UPLT. Secondary endpoints were complications associated with removal of the UPLT. Results. One hundred and forty-five women were analysed. Nineteen (13.1%) had pelvic LNMs, all identified by at least one metastatic SLN. In 76 women (52.4%) at least one UPLT lymph node was identified. Metastatic UPLT lymph nodes were identified in six women of which in three women (2.1% of all women and 15.8% of node positive women) without lateral pelvic LNMs. Thirteen women had lateral pelvic SLN LNMs with either no (n = 5) or benign (n = 8) UPLT lymph nodes. No intraoperative complications occurred due to the removal of the UPLT. Conclusion. Removal of the UPLT should be an integral part of the SLN concept in early stage cervical cancer.

TI  - Water clarity in Brazilian water assessed using Sentinel-2 and machine learning methods
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi Disk Depth (Z(sd)) is one of the widely used water quality measurements. Controlled by variations in Optically Active Constituents, it is a key index of overall water quality. In-situ measurements of Z(sd) lacks spatiotemporal coverage which could be solved using remote sensing data, such as from the Sentinel-2/MSI. However, inland waters have highly variable optical properties, and that is still a challenge for the state-of-art algorithms of Z(sd) retrieval. One of the most promising approaches for dealing with this challenge is the use of Machine Learning methods. Moreover, predicting Z(sd) for large areas using high-resolution remote sensing imagery requires a high computational effort, which could be solved using Cloud-Computing platforms. Therefore, this study evaluates the use of Machine Learning (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines) and Semi-Analytical algorithms (SAA) for Z(sd) retrieval focused on Sentinel-2 imageries available in the Google Earth Engine platform to assess the clarity of the Brazilian inland waters. Machine Learning methods were calibrated and validated using a comprehensive dataset (N = 1492) collected in the last 20 years in Brazil. The results were compared with semi-analytical approaches. After evaluation with in-situ data, the best algorithm was implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform to generate Z(sd) maps. The calibration with in-situ data demonstrated that the Machine Learning methods outperform the SAA, with the Random Forest presenting the best results (errors lower than 22%). The results showed that when SAA were applied to the environment in which they were calibrated, the results were closer to that of machine learning methods, indicating that SAA could also be used for Z(sd) retrieval. The application of Random Forest to the Sentinel-2 atmospherically corrected imagery had errors of 28%, demonstrating the feasibility of the algorithm and atmospheric correction methods for predicting Z(sd).

TI  - First multi-year assessment of Sentinel-1 radial velocity products using HF radar currents in a coastal environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct sensing of total ocean surface currents with microwave Doppler signals is a growing topic of interest for oceanography, with relevance to several new ocean mission concepts proposed in recent years. Since 2014, the spaceborne C-band SAR instruments of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) mission routinely acquire microwave Doppler data, distributed to users through operational S1 Level-2 ocean radial velocity (L2 OCN RVL) products. S1 L2 RVL data could produce high-resolution maps of ocean surface currents that would benefit ocean observing and modelling, particularly in coastal regions. However, uncorrected platform effects and instrument anomalies continue to impact S1 RVL data and prevent direct exploitation.In this paper, a simple empirical method is proposed to calibrate and correct operational S1 L2 RVL products and retrieve two-dimensional maps of surface currents in the radar line-of-sight. The study focuses on the German Bight where wind, wave and current data from marine stations and an HF radar instrumented site provide comprehensive means to evaluate S1 retrieved currents. Analyses are deliberately limited to Sentinel-1A (S1A) ascending passes to focus on one single instrument and fixed SAR viewing geometry. The final dataset comprises 78 separate S1A acquisitions over 2.5 years, of which 56 are matched with collocated HF radar data. The empirical corrections bring significant improvements to S1A RVL data, producing higher quality estimates and much better agreement with HF radar radial currents.Comparative evaluation of S1A against HF radar currents for different WASV corrections reveal that best results are obtained in this region when computing the WASV with sea state rather than wind vector input. Accounting for sea state produces S1 radial currents with a precision (std of the difference) around 0.3 m/s at similar to 1 km resolution. Precision improves to similar to 0.24 m/s when averaging over 21 x 27 km(2), with correlations with HF radar data reaching up to 0.93. Evidence of wind-current interactions when tides and wind align and short fetch conditions call for further research with more satellite data and other sites to better understand and correct the WASV in coastal regions.Finally, 1 km resolution maps of climatological S1A radial currents obtained over 2.5 years reveal strong coastal jets and fine scale details of the coastal circulation that closely match the known bathymetry and deep-water coastal channels in this region. The wealth of oceanographic information in corrected S1 RVL data is encouraging for Doppler oceanography from space and its application to observing small scale ocean dynamics, atmosphere and ocean vertical exchanges and marine ecosystem response to environmental change.

TI  - Assessment of spatio-temporal changes of land surface temperature (LST) in Kanchenjunga Biosphere Reserve (KBR), India using Landsat satellite image and single channel algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is known as skin temperature of the earth surface and it is used for analyzing the energy balance and thermal flux of the earth surface. The rise of surface temperature is a major environmental concern at present day. The present study analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern and changes of LST in Kanchenjunga Biosphere reserve (KBR) of Sikkim Himalaya, India from 1994 to 2019. Single channel algorithm has been used to estimate the LST from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite imageries. Correlation analysis was carried out to understand the correlation of LST with altitude, vegetation indices, snow index and water index. The result shows there is bilinear correlation between LST with altitude, vegetation indices (NDVI, PV and EVI), snow index (NDSI) and water index (NDWI). Vegetation indices positively correlated with LST whereas NDSI and NDWI negatively correlated with LST. To understand the spatial association of LST, Moran's spatial autocorrelation method has been used which reveals that there is strong positive spatial uniformity of LST. Local Moran's I index was used to detect spatio-temporal cluster pattern and outlier of LST from 1994 to 2019. Spatial mean method used to understand the spatio-temporal changes of LST in the study area. From this analysis, it is clear that there is significant spatio-temporal change of LST observed in the study area.

TI  - A review of machine learning in processing remote sensing data for mineral exploration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The decline of the number of newly discovered mineral deposits and increase in demand for different minerals in recent years has led exploration geologists to look for more efficient and innovative methods for processing different data types at each stage of mineral exploration. As a primary step, various features, such as lithological units, alteration types, structures, and indicator minerals, are mapped to aid decision-making in targeting ore deposits. Different types of remote sensing datasets, such as satellite and airborne data, make it possible to overcome common problems associated with mapping geological features. The rapid increase in the volume of remote sensing data obtained from different platforms has encouraged scientists to develop advanced, innovative, and robust data processing methodologies. Machine learning methods can help process a wide range of remote sensing datasets and determine the relationship between components such as the reflectance continuum and features of interest. These methods are robust in processing spectral and ground truth measurements against noise and uncertainties. In recent years, many studies have been carried out by supplementing geological surveys with remote sensing datasets, which is now prominent in geoscience research. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the implementation and adaptation of some popular and recently established machine learning methods for processing different types of remote sensing data and investigates their applications for detecting various ore deposit types. We demonstrate the high capability of combining remote sensing data and machine learning methods for mapping different geological features that are critical for providing potential maps. Moreover, we find there is scope for advanced methods such as deep learning to process the new generation of remote sensing data that provide high spatial and spectral resolution for creating improved mineral prospectivity maps.

TI  - Soil salinity: A global threat to sustainable development
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Soil is a vital resource for feeding the burgeoning global population, and it is also essential for realizing most of the 'United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)'. For example, it is vital to realizing the 'Zero hunger (SDG2), Good health and well-being (SDG3), Clean water and sanitation (SDG6), and Life on land (SDG15)'. Excess salts present in the soil make it saline, and it poses a significant threat to agricultural production and environmental health. Soil salinity is an extensive problem and spreads over one billion hectares extended over 100 countries. This paper presents a comprehensive review of global soil salinity management through the applications of remote sensing and GIS. All possible sources of relevant and current literature were accessed and more than 260 publications were collected and carefully analysed, for this review. The rationale and severity of the salinity problem are provided. The impact of salinity on plant yield and the effect of climate change on soil salinity are detailed. The salinity indicators and salinity monitoring and mapping are provided, and the global cases of soil salinity management through remote sensing and GIS applications under different agro-hydro-climatic environments are discussed, followed by a summary of conclusions and challenges along with future research directions. The analysis of past investigations showed that remote sensing strategy might be a practical approach to adequately assess plant response such as evapotranspiration under diverse salinity environments, yet it additionally has various difficulties. The lower spatial and temporal resolution of imagery may reason errors because of subpixel heterogeneity. However, with the improvement of the better-resolution thermal infrared remote method, there is the possibility to spot spatial variations at a smaller scale.

TI  - From FIGO-2009 to FIGO-2018 in women with early-stage cervical cancer; Does the revised staging reflect risk groups?
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. We aimed to evaluate if the revised staging according to FIGO-2018 in early-stage cervical cancer correctly predicts the risk for nodal metastases. Methods. We reallocated 245 women with early-stage cervical cancer from FIGO-2009 to FIGO-2018 stages using data from a national, prospective cohort study on sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. We used univariate and multivariate binary regression models to investigate the association between FIGO-2018 stages, tumor char-acteristics, and nodal metastases. Results. Stage migration occurred in 54.7% (134/245) (95% CI 48.2-61.0), due to tumor size or depth of inva-sion (71.6%, 96/134) and nodal metastases (28.4%, 38/134). Imaging preoperatively upstaged 7.3% (18/245); seven had nodal metastatic disease on final pathology. Upstaging occurred in 49.8% (122/245) (95% CI 43.4-56.2%) and downstaging to FIGO-2018 IA stages in 4.9% (12/245) (95% CI 2.6-8.4). The tumor size ranged from 3.0-19.0 mm in women with FIGO-2018 IA tumor characteristics, and none of the 14 women had nodal metastases. In multivariate analysis, risk factors significantly associated with nodal metastases were FIGO-2018 >= IB2 (RR 5.01, 95% CI 2.30-10.93, p < 0.001), proportionate depth of invasion >2/3 (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.05-3.35, p = 0.033), and lymphovascular space invasion (RR 5.56, 95% CI 2.92-10.62, p < 0.001). Conclusions. The FIGO-2018 revised staging system causes stage migration for a large proportion of women with early-stage cervical cancer. Women who were downstaged to FIGO-2018 IA stages did not have nodal metastatic disease. The attention on depth of invasion rather than horizontal dimension seems to correctly reflect the risk of nodal metastases. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Comparison of radio-isotope method with 99m technetium and near-infrared fluorescent imaging with indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We aimed to compare the detection rate of pelvic sentinel lymph node between the radio-isotope with 99m technetium (Tc-99m)-labeled phytate and near-infrared fluorescent imaging with indocyanine green in patients with endometrial cancer.Methods: This study included 122 patients who had undergone sentinel lymph node mapping using 99mTc and indocyanine green. In the radio-isotope method, sentinel lymph nodes were detected using uterine cervix Tc-99m injections the day before surgery. Following injection, the number and locations of the sentinel lymph nodes were evaluated by lymphoscintigraphy. In addition, indocyanine green was injected into the cervix immediately before surgery.Results: The overall pelvic sentinel lymph node detection rate (at least one pelvic sentinel lymph node detected) was not significantly different between Tc-99m (95.9% [117/122]) and indocyanine green (94.3% [115/122]). Similarly, the bilateral sentinel lymph node detection rate was not significantly different between Tc-99m (87.7% [107/122]) and indocyanine green (79.5% [97/122]). More than two sentinel lymph nodes per unilateral pelvic lymph node were found in 12.3% (15/122) and 27% (33/122) of cases with Tc-99m and indocyanine green, respectively, in the right pelvic side, and 11.5% (14/122) and 32.8% (40/122) of cases with Tc-99m and indocyanine green, respectively, in the left pelvic side. indocyanine green showed that there were significantly more than two sentinel lymph nodes in either the left or right pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (P < 0.0001). There was a significant difference in the mean number of total pelvic sentinel lymph nodes between Tc-99m (2.2) and indocyanine green (2.5) (P = 0.028) methods.Conclusion: Although indocyanine green is useful for sentinel lymph node identification, we believe it is better to use it in combination with Tc-99m until the surgeon is accustomed to it.

TI  - Perceptions, Knowledge, and Attitudes about Human Trafficking Questionnaire: Extending Its Utility with Social Work Students
T2  - SOCIAL WORK RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study, a two-site, cross-sectional survey of university students (n = 321 at site 1; n = 201 at site 2), extends the development and utility of the Perceptions, Knowledge, and Attitudes about Human Trafficking Questionnaire by generating factor-based scales and scores to represent values for its three factors (Self-Appraisal of Knowledge/Skills, Worldview of Human Trafficking, and Help-Seeking Behavior/Personal Beliefs) in order to examine their relationship to background criterion variables and assess differences between social work and non-social work students and between subgroups of social work students. Across both samples, the background variables of human trafficking training and professional responsibilities related to addressing human trafficking were predictive of self-appraisal of knowledge/skills. Additionally, social work students had higher scores than non-social work students on the worldview of human trafficking and help-seeking behavior/personal beliefs factor-based scales, suggesting that social work students perceived human trafficking to be more of a social problem and held fewer misperceptions of the help-seeking behavior of and a greater willingness to provide social services to persons who are trafficked than non-social work students. Implications for social work education, practice, and research are presented.

TI  - Machine-learning algorithms for land use dynamics in Lake Haramaya Watershed, Ethiopia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and human-induced drivers within the constraints of multiple socioeconomic and political conditions have intensified the extent of land use and land cover (LULC) change at different scales. Hence, up-to-date spatial and statistical information about LULC change is of utmost importance for the development and implementation of appropriate Earth resource management strategies and monitoring environmental changes. With the increased availability of remotely sensed data from various Earth observation satellite and continuous advances in computing technology, these pieces of information are commonly retrieved based on automated digital image classification algorithms. However, in-depth quantitative evaluation of different classification algorithms is critical to select an efficient classifier or multiple ways to obtain more accurate land use maps. Taking selected hydrological catchments of the Lake Haramaya Watershed in the East Hararghe Ethiopian highland as an example, we statistically compared the land use classification performance of three nonlinear machine-learning algorithms (MLAs), namely: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) using open-source Landsat-8 satellite images. At the same time, the classification accuracy was assessed using sample points from high spatial resolution Google-Earth Pro image. The confusion matrix analysis has indicated that the generated land use maps had a divergent classification accuracy. However, the SVM achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (94%) compared to the RF (92%) and the ANN (89%). On the contrary, the OBIA classifier achieved the least overall accuracy (75%) compared to the former. Thus, the results presented here reveal that though all supervised MLAs can be considered robust classifiers, the SVM algorithm was found to be the best classifier to improve the classification accuracy at an individual land use class level.

TI  - Upward range shift of a dominant alpine shrub related to 50 years of snow cover change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pronounced climate warming has resulted in a significant reduction of snow cover extent, as well as poleward and upslope shifts of shrubs in Arctic and alpine ecosystems. However, it is difficult to establish links between changes in snow cover and shrub distribution changes due to a lack of in situ and long-term snow records in relation to abundance shifts of shrubs at their leading (i.e., cold) and trailing (i.e., warm) edges. We used remote sensing to extract long-term changes in both snow cover and shrub distributions in response to climate change in the alpine tundra of the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China. First, we analyzed spatio-temporal changes in snow cover during the snowmelt period (April 1st to June 15th) over the past 54 years (1965-2019). Then, we analyzed distribution changes of the dominant evergreen alpine shrub, Rhododendron aureum, using 31 years (1988-2019) of Landsat NDVI archives. We applied a novel approach by analyzing NDVI data from autumn only, when R. aureum is green yet most of the surrounding plants are already brown. Finally, we tested the relationship between snowmelt date and the distribution of R. aureum. We found that the fraction cover of R. aureum experienced greater loss than gain in the last 30 years. R. aureum expanded at the leading edge, establishing in snow-rich habitats, yet retracted further at the trailing edge due to loss of snow habitats. We identified the preferred snowmelt regime (habitats with snowmelt date of 20 April or later) of this shrub species and found that further advances in snowmelt dates would lead to the upward range shift of R. aureum in a warming climate. Our results indicate that spring snow cover change affected distribution changes of R. aureum. Our study highlights that long-term changes in snow cover due to climate change have already had marked impacts on plant species distributions in alpine ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluation of the Lake Titicaca's surface water temperature using LST MODIS time series (2000-2020)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the LST MODIS product (v006, level 3) which provides the daytime and nighttime land surface temperature was used to evaluate the space-temporal variation of the water surface temperature (LWST) of Lake Titicaca, during the period 2000-2020. The Mann-Kendall tests and the Sen's method were applied to determine the statistical significance and the rates of change of the maximum air and water temperatures. The results show that the average annual LWST cycles of Lake Titicaca fluctuate between 12.3 degrees C (August) and 13.8 degrees C (April) in region A (Major Lake), and between 10.6 degrees C (July) and 14.8 degrees C (November) in region B (Minor Lake). In addition, there is a general increasing trend of the average LWST during the coldest time (winter) of the year, with more intense warming effects in some shallow areas and in coastal areas. In Major Lake, the significant increasing trend of daytime and nighttime LWST was maintained at a rate of 0.30 [0.14, 0.401 degrees C/decade and 0.34 [0.18, 0.451 degrees C/decade respectively. Also, the maximum local air temperature trend during the austral winter (JJA) shows a significant increasing trend of 0.52 [0.16, 0.871 degrees C/decade between 1983 and 2013. This fact could be responsible for the change in trend in the surface temperature of Lake Titicaca.

TI  - Unintended dose to the lower axilla in adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer: Differences between tangential beam and VMAT
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: To evaluate dosimetric differences in unintended dose to the lower axilla between 3D-standard (3DCRT), tangential beam forward intensity modulated radiotherapy (F-IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). The objective is to evaluate whether results of clinical trials, such as the ACOSOG-Z011 trial, that evaluated omission of axillary clearance can be extrapolated towards more conformal techniques like VMAT.Materials and methods: Twenty-five consecutive patients treated with whole breast radiotherapy alone (WBRT) using a F-IMRT technique were identified. Three additional plans were created for every patient: one plan using a single 270 degrees arc (VMAT 1x270 degrees), another using two small <90 degrees opposing arcs (VMAT 2x < 90 degrees) and thirdly a 3DCRT plan without F-IMRT. Axillary levels I-II were contoured after the treatment plans were made.Results: The volume of the axilla level I that was covered by the 50% isodose (V50%) was significantly higher for VMAT 2x < 90 degrees (71.3 cm(3), 84% of structure volume, p < 0.001) and VMAT 1x270 degrees (68.8 cm(3), 81%, p < 0.01) compared to 3DCRT (60.3 cm(3), 71%) and F-IMRT (60.8 cm(3), 72%). The V50% to the axilla level II, however, was low for all techniques: 12.3 cm3 (12%); 8.9 cm(3) (9%); 4.3 cm(3) (4%); 4.4 cm(3) (4%) for VMAT 2x < 90 degrees, VMAT 1x270 degrees, 3DCRT, F-IMRT, respectively. For the higher doses (V90% and above), no clinically relevant differences were seen between the different modalities.Conclusion: WBRT treatments with VMAT do not lead to a significant reduction of the unintended axillary dose in comparison with a tangential beam setup. Hence, concerning tumor control, VMAT can be applied to clinical situations similar to the Z0011 trial. The intermediate axillary dose is higher with VMAT, but the clinical consequence of this difference on toxicity is unknown. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A TIR forest reflectance and transmittance (FRT) model for directional temperatures with structural and thermal stratification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is listed as an essential climate variable (ECV) and supports quantitative estimates of the energy budget while serving as a proxy for measuring the effects of climate change and extreme events. Forested areas are considered a major land unit impacted by temperature rise; therefore, thorough monitoring is mandatory. An accuracy assessment of the LST of forests must consider their directional anisotropy (DA). This latter can be well depicted by thermal infrared (TIR) radiative transfer models, but the problem is complex for forests because many of the shaded areas generate multiscale gradients of temperature. In this paper, we adapted a mature and widely used visible and near-infrared (VNIR) radiative transfer model called forest reflectance and transmittance (FRT) to enhance the characterization of the DA of forest temperature. In the FRT model, the vertical heterogeneity of the forest is quantified by using the discrete elements of multilayer scene components (i.e., the tree crown, trunk, understory vegetation, and soil), thus inferring vertical thermal gradients. The Planck function and spectral-invariant theory are considered to assess the thermal emissions of the scene components and their multiple scattering processes. The FRT model is validated using directional forest brightness temperatures (BT) measured from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and simulated by using the three-dimensional ray-tracing LESS (large-scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework over heterogeneous 3D scenes) model. The results show that FRT behaves reliably since the root mean square error (RMSE) is lower than 1.0 degrees C for UAV measurements obtained at 09:20 and 13:10 and with coefficients of determination (R2) larger than 0.74 and 0.56, respectively; these results are better than the simulated results by existing models. Moreover, the comparison with ray-tracing simulations was also deemed satisfactory. According to the analysis, large variations in BT DAs may appear for different forests and seasonal changes staged by structural and thermal stratification, thus indicating the necessity of using the FRT model for complex and dynamic forest canopies.

TI  - Satellite sensing night-time lights-A South African spatial econometric application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated how economic activity in one location may affect economic activities in adjacent locations. This study applies several statistical models to determine the economic activity effect of neighbouring locations within the South African context during the period 2012 to 2019, using data from satellite imagery. Decentralised gross domestic product (GDP) per location maps, i.e. to generate a gross domestic dataset at a very granular level was therefore developed. The level is a one km(2) representation per location. The gross domestic product for each location is estimated using the night-time light remote sensing data derived from the Suomi National Polar Partnership (SNPP) infrared imaging satellite radiometer suite (VIIRS). This study illustrates how spatial correlations can be determined, and how to measure them using explanatory spatial data analysis. The essence of the spatial analysis revealed that "space does indeed matter", as economic activity in one location is related to activity in neighbouring locations. Not only do spatial relationships exist, but economic activity seems to be fundamentally related to its own unique location.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The routine use of surgical safety checklists can reduce perioperative complications. Generic surgical safety checklists are insufficient for cesarean delivery because each cesarean delivery involves 2 patients (the mother and the fetus or newborn), each with separate care teams and health and safety considerations. To address the added complexity of care coordination and communication inherent in cesarean delivery, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine presents sample standard surgical safety checklists for cesarean delivery that include elements of care for both the mother and newborn. In addition, we present an alternative checklist for time-critical emergency cesarean deliveries in which there is no time to safely perform the standard checklist and a sample preoperative checklist for use before moving the patient to the operating room. We also recommend steps for implementation of the checklists at individual facilities.

TI  - A cost-effective method to monitor vegetation changes in steppes ecosystems: A case study on remote sensing of fire and infrastructure effects in eastern Mongolia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is a major environmental and social issue in temperate steppes. It is commonly determined from vegetation cover using remote sensing techniques. Steppes in eastern Mongolia are subject to resource extraction activities, such as mining and oil extraction, which affect land degradation. Recent technological progress in remote sensing has facilitated the acquirement of high-resolution data by, for example, the CubeSat satellite or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), providing data for detailed maps of vegetation cover and plant functional groups (PFGs). Traditional methods for monitoring vegetation cover often face typical scale issues, such as the upscaling of vegetation parameters if plot-scale field measurements are integrated to satellite data. Here, we studied the spatial distribution of PFG using machine learning and a combination of field measurements, UAV imagery (spatial resolution: 2 cm), and PlanetScope multi-temporal imagery. We provide two products at two spatial resolutions: one for UAV data, which is restricted to comparatively small areas around field measurements, and one for PlanetScope, which covers large parts of northeastern Mongolia. The results showed that the overall accuracies of UAV classification were 91-95%, whereas those of PlanetScope were 78-95%. In integrating the classified UAV data to the PlaneScope data, our proposed model minimized the scale issue that often impedes classification. Importantly, our findings revealed that the ecological effects of dirt road and railroad extended up to 60-120 m into the adjacent, otherwise less degraded steppe vegetation. A comparison between burned and unburned areas in different years indicates that wildfires affect the composition of PFG in reducing the fractional cover of graminoids and forbs, and that increasing cover of bare ground leads to a distinct and patchy mosaic of different vegetation types.

TI  - Synergistic analysis of satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle, terrestrial laser scanner data and process-based modelling for understanding the dynamics and morphological changes around the snout of Gangotri Glacier, India
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciated areas of the Himalaya often experience mass movement, glacial lake outburst flood and other associated hazards, posing threat to the communities and infrastructure in the downstream areas. A large debris flow occurred during July 16-19, 2017 near the present snout of the Gangotri Glacier in the Garhwal Himalaya, India resulting in significant geomorphological changes in the vicinity. The present study assesses the applicability of multi-source remote sensing data from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) along with process-based modelling to understand and quantify glacier snout dynamics and morphological changes around Gangotri Glacier in the Garhwal Himalaya of India. We show that retreat rates of Gangotri Glacier snout along the lateral flowlines are (left flowline 29.6 m year(-1); right flowline 60.5 m year(-1)) are significantly higher compared to the central flowline (18.2 m year(-1)) during 2010-2020 leading to total loss in glacial ice area of 0.11 +/- 0.015 km(2). The snout dynamics and evolution of the new channel from the terminus of the adjoining Meru Glacier, connecting the moraine-dammed glacial lake and the Bhagirathi River, suggest that retreat of the Gangotri Glacier, intense precipitation and excessive seepage from the glacial lake were the important drivers of the debris flow in July 2017. The accumulated debris occupied an area of similar to 0.25 km(2) near the snout of the Gangotri Glacier and shifted Bhagirathi River by 36-200 +/- 9.35 m towards northeast. The synergistic analysis of pre-and post-event satellite, UAV and TLS-based digital elevation models (DEMs) and satellite images indicate that about similar to 8 +/- 0.066 x 10(6) m(3) of sediments were generated by the debris flow. The results from remote sensing data suggest that a significant portion (similar to 60%) of the deposited debris has been transported to the downstream areas between July 16-19, 2017 and October 2, 2017. Regular monitoring of the area is recommended, especially in light of climate change using earth observation data and ground measurements. The multi-source integrated framework implemented in this study is generic and can be applied for any debris flow or landslide studies in glaciated terrain. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A methodology to quantitate the thermal influence of different land use types: A case study in Beijing, China
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we proposed a new methodology of urban thermal environment based on LANDSAT8 data, to quantitate the influence of various LUTs on the ambient land surface temperature (LST). In this methodology, we developed an urban thermal environment contribution index based on the sliding spatial adaptative window (SSAW-CI), to better quantitate the thermal contribution of each LUT. Two basic assumptions of this methodology are that the influence of the same LUT varies on different LUTs and that the LUT with higher LST may not have a greater heating effect. Thus, we divided each pixel into 7 categories and these 7 LUTs were combined in 49 different ways (including the influence among same LUTs). A case study for Beijing showed that: a) The influence of 73% LUTs on ambient LST reached a relatively stable distance and the distance can be quantitated. b) It was remarkably different in influence intensity among the LUTs with a stable influence range. c) Water body, vegetation, and bare soil had the cooling effect on built-up area of Beijing. All the artificial objects had the heating effect.

TI  - Sailing through the waves: Ecclesiological experiences of the Gereja Protestan Maluku in Maluku
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The archipelago context of Maluku represents the living dynamics of Christian communities in that area, which becomes an ecclesiological foundation of the Gereja Protestan Maluku (GPM). Christianity, the embryo of the GPM, is the fruit of the evangelical works by European missionaries, particularly Dutch missions from the 18th century onwards. The Dutch-type Christianity had been adapted into models so that the form of institution and Protestant teachings in Maluku moved dynamically following socio-political and cultural changes along with the colonial and the post-colonial history of Indonesian and Malukan society. It attempts to describe the manifestation of the Calvinism-model of Christianity that is continuously being contextualised through absorbing various elements of worldview, tradition, and the religiosity of the archipelago society. Cultural hermeneutics is used to interpret the socio-cultural phenomena in which the church lives in and to construct its theological understanding about Christian identity. The ecclesiological construction of GPM, in turn, is structured by plural social orders. The reality also influences the perspective about GPM from many different worldviews of the Malukan archipelago society. The contextual ecclesiological perspective, therefore, is constructed based on intermingled understandings that theology of the church can only be built by considering multifold dimensions of a particular society. The result of this research pertains to the constructive understanding of a specific ecclesial context of the GPM in their struggles for theologising their existence as God's people and, at the same time, as an integral part of certain society in Maluku and Indonesia. Contribution: As the living contextual church that struggles for proclaiming God's love, the GPM has a theological responsibility to conduct its church mission based on its ecclesiological understanding and practices contextually. The article contributes to the enrichment of the theological discourse on the crucial roles of a church in Maluku, in the eastern part of Indonesia.

TI  - The composition of mixed-species flocks of birds in and around Chitwan National Park, Nepal
T2  - AVIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mixed-species flocks (MSFs) have been well sampled in the South Asia, but there has been as yet surprisingly little work on MSFs of Nepal, despite a diverse and well-studied avifauna. We surveyed MSFs in two forest types in and around the Important Bird Area of Chitwan National Park in Nepal, between 150 and 800 m a.s.l., to provide a first description of the composition of MSFs in this area. We also aimed to understand which species should be considered 'nuclear species', important to forming MSFs or leading them forward. Results In total, we collected records on 222 MSFs that included 100 species, and 6097 individuals. The MSFs were similar to worldwide patterns in being dominated by leaf-gleaning, non-terrestrial insectivores. However, the MSFs were more dominated by canopy species than usual, and did not have a clear gregarious, understory leading species. Rather drongos (Family Dicruridae) and minivets (Family Campephagidae, Genus Pericrocotus) acted as leaders, and a cluster analysis of composition showed one group of large body size MSFs particularly characterized by the presence of the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus paradiseus). Conclusions Drongos are known to provide both costs and benefits to other flock participants: they are aggressive birds that can steal food, and manipulate other species with their vocalizations, but at the same time they are 'sentinel species' that produce information about predation risk other species can use. This study demonstrates that drongos can be considered nuclear species for some types of MSFs, despite the potential costs of their presence. MSFs led by sentinel species thus may form in Asia, as well as in the Neotropics.

TI  - VEILND (Video Endoscopic Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection) with Florescence Indocyanine Green (ICG): A Novel Technique to Identify the Sentinel Lymph Node in Men with ≥pT1G2 and cN0 Penile Cancer
T2  - CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. In men with >= pT1G2 cN0, penile cancer lymph node sampling is recommended with either (1) scintigraphically labelled Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSLNB) or (2) modified inguinal lymph node dissection (MILND). Although DSLNB is a minimally invasive technique, the false negative rate can be about 10%, and a further operative procedure is required if positive. Open MILND is a diagnostic and therapeutic option but has a much higher morbidity. A potential compromise is the technique of LND-VEILND (video endoscopic inguinal LND) that can be combined with ICG florescence marking of sentinel lymph node (SLN). We present a pilot study of ICG-VEILND. The aim was to validate the applicability of a combination ICG marking of SLN in VEILND (to increase probability to excise SLN) and determine the optimal timing and dosage of ICG. Materials and Methods. 15 patients with VEILND (24 groins) underwent ICG application with fluorescence near-infrared (NIR 803.830 nm) detection. ICG is applied subcutaneously adjacent to the penile cancer or residual stump of penis or suprapubic region (in a history of total penectomy: 5 cases). The dose of 1.25 mg (ICG) was applied in one case with invisible SLN, the dose of 2.5 mg in 1 mL in 8 cases, and 5 mg in the remaining 6 patients (10 groins). Results. Failure of marking SLN with ICG occurred in 25.0% of cases (6/24): due to application of 1.25 mg ICG, extensive metastasis to SLN, in 4 cases, the cause was unknown (16.7%, 4/24). In the short follow-up period, no local recurrence was seen in the pN0 ICG group. Conclusion. Fluorescence infrared image with ICG dye increases the probability of removal of the SLN during VEILND. The dose of ICG is 2.5 (5) mg diluted in 1 ml and can be applied preoperatively even in the suprapubic region in men with a history of total penectomy, with an unexplainable failure of ICG marking in 16.7%.

AB  - Articulate language is a form of communication unique to humans. Over time, a spectrum of researchers has proposed various frameworks attempting to explain the evolutionary acquisition of this distinctive human attribute, some deploring the apparent lack of direct evidence elucidating the phenomenon, whilst others have pointed to the contributions of palaeoanthropology, the social brain hypothesis and the fact that even amongst contemporary humans, social group sizes reflect brain size. Theologians have traditionally (largely) ignored evolutionary insights as an explanatory paradigm for the origin of humankind. However, an increasing number are, of late, contributing to a worldview of humanity which accommodates both the epistemological realities of evolutionary biology as well as insights from theology. This includes reviewing and assessing the origins of articulate language and the physiological attributes necessary for its development. It is in this sense that the evolution of language is relevant from a theological perspective. The association between mental capacity and articulate language, already noted by Darwin, is relevant in explaining the larger group sizes found amongst humans, as is the incipient role played by the evolution of laughter in triggering the neuroendocrine system promoting bonding, to the eventual development of articulate language. Our aim is to review a selection of contemporary perspectives on the evolution of language, amongst others, reasons for the ease with which young children acquire language competency, and whether we may be hardwired for language from birth. Further reading is suggested in the footnotes. Contribution: This article is part of a special collection reflecting on the evolutionary building blocks of our past, present and future. It is based on historical thought and contemporary research with regards to the evolutionary emergence of language. It fits well with the intersectional and trans-disciplinary nature of this collection and journal.

TI  - The Role of Time-Series L-Band SAR and GEDI in Mapping Sub-Tropical Above-Ground Biomass
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Physics-based algorithms estimating large-scale forest above-ground biomass (AGB) from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data generally use airborne laser scanning (ALS) or grid of national forest inventory (NFI) to reduce uncertainties in the model calibration. This study assesses the potential of multitemporal L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data to improve forest AGB estimation using the three-parameter water cloud model (WCM) trained with field data from relatively small (0.1 ha) plots. The major objective is to assess the impact of the high uncertainties in field inventory data due to relatively smaller plot size and temporal gap between acquisitions and ground truth on the AGB estimation. This study analyzes a time series of twenty-three ALOS-2 dual-polarized images spanning 5 years acquired under different weather and soil moisture conditions over a subtropical forest test site in India. The WCM model is trained and validated on individual acquisitions to retrieve forest AGB. The accuracy of the generated AGB products is quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE). Further, we use a multitemporal AGB retrieval approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated AGB. Changes in precipitation and soil moisture affect the AGB retrieval accuracy from individual acquisitions; however, using multitemporal data, these effects are mitigated. Using a multitemporal AGB retrieval strategy, the accuracy improves by 15% (55 Mg/ha RMSE) for all field plots and by 21% (39 Mg/ha RMSE) for forests with AGB less than 100 Mg/ha. The analysis shows that any ten multitemporal acquisitions spanning 5 years are sufficient for improving AGB retrieval accuracy over the considered test site. Furthermore, we use allometry from colocated field plots and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L2A height metrics to produce GEDI-derived AGB estimates. Despite the limited co-location of GEDI and field data over our study area, within the period of interest, the preliminary analysis shows the potential of jointly using the GEDI-derived AGB and multi-temporal ALOS-2 data for large-scale AGB retrieval.

TI  - Lymph node staging in breast cancer: is it starting to be insignificant?
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in breast cancer. However, systemic adjuvant treatment decisions are increasingly based on tumor biology and predictive factors. This relates particularly to triple negative and HER2 positive tumors that require chemotherapy independent of lymph node status. In luminal B tumors gene expression profiles are increasingly employed, making the omission of chemotherapy feasible even in some subsets of patients with node-positive disease. Although the rate of patients whose adjuvant treatment decision is based on lymph node status is declining, it still needs to be determined in some subsets of patients, particularly premenopausal women with luminal B disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy is strongly based on lymph node status. This relates to the target volume in breast conserving therapy and the indication for irradiation of the chest wall after mastectomy or the extraaxillary lymph nodes. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) the ypN status is rarely decisive for postneoadjuvant systemic treatment decisions. Axillary staging, however, plays an important role for locoregional treatment planning. The omission of axillary staging after NACT appears only feasible in a small subset of patients. In view of the declining role of surgical axillary staging in patients that undergo upfront surgery, selective staging that anticipates potential subsequent treatment decisions appears sensible.

TI  - How can spatial structural metrics improve the accuracy of forest disturbance and recovery detection using dense Landsat time series?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance and recovery detection is vital for assessing ecosystem resilience and service to further establish the sustainable ecosystem development. Time series analyses of remote sensing data provide essential and effective methods in such research. Some studies have incorporated spatial structural characteristics to improve the spatial accuracy of detecting forest abrupt disturbances, however, few of them paid attention to the detection of recovery during ecosystem dynamics. To more comprehensively detect forest disturbance and re-covery and explore the effectiveness of incorporating spatial structural metrics in dense Landsat temporal analysis, this study performed the LandTrendr algorithm using the normalized burn ratio (NBR) and the NBR-based spatial structural metrics time series. The spatial structural metrics (i.e., texture metrics) were calculated using the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based on the spatial neighbor of NBR. The methodology was tested using all available Landsat images in a subtropical region in China from 1986 to 2018 on the Google Earth Engine platform. The temporal accuracy of the recovery detection was improved from approximately 20% to 63% after incorporating the GLCM-based texture metrics compared to that using the pixel-based NBR time series. Additionally, the change patterns of forest composition and structure (closed forest to shrub or closed forest to cropland) and changes in the edge pixels in landscape patches can be well depicted by incorporating spatial metrics in dense temporal analyses. Our results highlight that the spatial structural metrics can be integrated to develop more robust detection indicators for the monitoring of forest dynamics and to determine the charac-teristics that are meaningful to ecological assessment and management.

TI  - Georg Simmel's political thought: Socialism and Nietzschean aristocratism
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLASSICAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Georg Simmel's political position has rarely been discussed explicitly - perhaps because many scholars have assumed that Simmel was 'apolitical' before 1914. The present article shows that even before 1914 Simmel held a distinct political position, to wit a peculiar kind of liberal-Nietzschean aristocratic individualism. This individualism is the result of a passage through 'the hard school' of egalitarian socialism in order to reach true individuality. It is closely related to Simmel's central theorem of the so-called 'individual law'. After a socio-historical contextualisation of Simmel's political thought, the article follows this motif in detail through his diagnosis of the times, his theory of socio-cultural development, his engagement in cultural politics, his ideal of personality formation and his engagement in the bourgeois women's movement. Simmel's thought culminates in a conception of 'dialectic aristocratism'. In this respect, the normative core of Simmel's political standpoint is very close to Max Weber's position. The last section argues that Simmel's war writings do not mark a break in his political thinking, but rather apply the same theorem of the 'individual law' to the German state. Through its various stages, the article shows that Simmel's political orientation, linked to key theoretical concepts, is deeply rooted in the educated bourgeoisie's worldview and habitus.

TI  - Extraction of crop information through the spatiotemporal fusion of OLI and MODIS images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal data fusion algorithms have been developed to fuse satellite imagery from sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions and generate predicted imagery. In this study, we compare the predictions of three spatiotemporal data fusion algorithms in blending Landsat-8/OLI and Terra-Aqua/MODIS images for mapping soybean and corn under five classification scenarios. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), and Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) algorithms were compared to generate images for the 2016/2017 summer crop-year. Classifications including phenological metrics extracted from FSDAF- and STARFM-predicted EVI time series had overalls accuracies higher than the other scenarios, 93.11% and 91.33%, respectively. The results show that phenological metrics extracted from predicted images are an interesting alternative to overcome cloud cover frequency limitations for soybean and corn mapping in tropical areas.

TI  - Remote sensing annual dynamics of rapid permafrost thaw disturbances with LandTrendr
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is warming globally which leads to widespread permafrost thaw. Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1 x 106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very highresolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at largescale for 2001-2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158 ha, 2001-2019: 66,699 ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatiotemporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.

TI  - Usefulness of histological superstudy of sentinel node detected with radioisotope in colon cancer
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) significally reduces the rate of relapse in +pN (stage III) colon cancer and in some pN0 (stage II) with risk factors such as pT4, vascular invasion Vi, perineural invasion Pn1, and complicated tumors. However, unexpectedly, 20-30% of pN0 present a relapse in the follow-up, which may suggest that the lymph node involvement was not discovered in the conventional histological study (CS), and its finding with a superstudy (SS) could increase the number of patients who would benefit from neoadjuvant CT. It is not possible to perform this SS in every lymph node (LN) from the specimen, but it is possible in a small group of LN which are representative of the N status (definition of sentinel node SN). The aim of our work is to state the representativeness of the SN and to analyze de number of patients who are suprastaged after the SS of the SN.Material and methods: Prospective study of a series of patients who have undergone curative surgery for colon cancer, to whom we perform selective biopsy of sentinel node. Identification of SN was carried out with in vivo injection of the radiotracer, with ex vivo isolation of SN. Once the specimen is out, we take pictures of the surgical bed to rule out the presence of aberrant drainage routes, out of the routine oncological resection area. We performed the histological CS (hematoxilin-eosin stain in conventional sections) in the rest of the LN from the mesocolon. In the SN we performed the CS and a SS with hematoxilin-eosin in serial sections, immunohistochemistry (INC) and molecular study with One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA). Diagnostic validity study od selective biopsy of sentinel node was carried out, defining the false negative (FN) as the negativity of the SN while other LN are positive (N+), as well as a valuation of the suprastaging due to the SS of the SN.Results: We performed lymphatic map in 72 patients, finding the SN in 62 of them (87.3%). The 9 identification failures happened in the first 17 cases. We have not found aberrant drainage routes. A total of 1.164 LN were studied in the 62 patients (18.8 LN/ patient), from which 145 are SN (2,34 SN/ patient), having found 103 positive LN with the CS and 112 positive with the SS of SN (9 +LN more in 8 patients than detected with the CS). Positivity after CS in the SN group is 17.24% (25/145), while it is 8.53% in the rest (87/1.019) (p<.001). With the CS, 50% of the patients (31/62) were pN+ (4 are N+ exclusively in the SN), and after the SS of the SN, only 1 of the 31 pN0 patients (3.2%) becomes pN1a, with a definitive 51.6% of N+ in the whole series (32 N+ in the 62 patients) ( 5 are N+ exclusively in the SN).Exclusively with the SS of the SN, FN rate ("-SN, +others", meaning patients who are N+ having -SN) is 54.8% (17/31). With the SS of the SN, 8 of the 62 patients (12.9%) increase their total number of +LN: apart from the patient who turns from pN0 to pN1a, suprastaging from IIA to IIIB (and therefore increasing the total number of pN+ to 32), 5 of the 17 FN in the CS turns into positive (2 change the pN subindex and one is suprastaged from IIIB to IIIC), decreasing FN to 37.5% (12/32 cases). Besides, 2 patients whose SN is already positive in the CS increase the number of +SN after the SS of the SN, therefore both changing their pN subindex and one of them suprastaging from IIIB to IIIC. In summary, 8 patients increase the total number of positive SN after the SS (8/62,12.9%), 5 of them changing the pN subindex (5/62, 12.9%), even if only 3 of them get suprastaged (3/62, 4.8%), among them the one who turns from pN0 to pN1a.Conclusion: Technique is valid and reproducible, with a high detection rate even with a high learning curve. It globally increases the number of affected LN in 12.9% of patients, having prognostic implications in 4.8% (suprastaging rate). Only 3.2% of pN0 patients in the CS turn to be +pN after the SS of the SN, with its therapeutic implications (prescription of adjuvant CT), which could be relevant when extrapolated to a big number of patients. The high FN rate ( 37.5%) prevents us from accepting the representativeness of SN as the global N status, but it is not clinically relevant in colon cancer, as its aim is not to avoid lymphadenectomy, which remains mandatory (opposite to breast cancer or melanoma in which SN detection decides upon whether to perform or not the lymphadenectomy), but to decide which patients would benefit from adjuvant CT.

TI  - Autophagy is induced and modulated by cholesterol depletion through transcription of autophagy-related genes and attenuation of flux
T2  - CELL DEATH DISCOVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Perturbations to cellular homeostasis, including reduction of the cholesterol level, induce autophagy, a self-digestion process of cellular constituents through an autophagosomal-lysosomal pathway. In accord with its function as a membrane organizer and metabolic sentinel, the cellular response to cholesterol depletion comprises multiple phenomena, including the activation of transcriptional responses, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of stress-related signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol depletion regulates autophagy and the putative involvement of transcriptional responses, ROS and/or stress-related signaling in autophagy regulation in this biological context are not fully understood. Here, we find that cholesterol depletion regulates autophagy at three different levels. First, employing RNA-seq, we show that cholesterol depletion increases the expression of autophagy-related genes independent of ROS or JNK activity. Second, analysis of LC3 lipidation and intracellular localization, and of p62 levels and degradation kinetics, reveals that cholesterol depletion mediates autophagy induction while interfering with autophagic flux. Of note, only the latter depends on ROS accumulation and JNK activity. In view of the common use of cholesterol-reducing drugs as therapeutic agents, our findings have important implications for multiple cellular settings in which autophagy plays a prominent role.

TI  - Combining remote sensing and field data to assess recovery of the Chilean Mediterranean vegetation after fire: Effect of time elapsed and burn severity
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been debated if Chilean sclerophyllous vegetation can recover after fire of different severity and short and long term. We evaluated the resiliency of this vegetation type after single-occurrence fires of different severities that occurred 30, 20 and 10 years in Central Chile before the study. Two approaches were followed: satellite image analysis and vegetation sampling. Wildfires that occurred between 1985 and 2015 were identified based on Landsat images. We selected 30 sites burned by a single fire in either 1985, 1995 or 2005, and that was not converted to another land use by 2015, then determined the percentage cover by vegetation type. We recorded or estimated the independent variables of burn severity, slope, altitude, pre-fire vegetation type and latitude of the sites. Composition, richness, and abundance of adult and regeneration of woody vegetation and herbaceous cover were sampled. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effect of the independent variables and the time elapsed since the fire on vegetation recovery. The proportion of dense vegetation forest cover was significantly higher with more time elapsed since the fire, while semi-dense forest/shrubland and open shrubland vegetation cover returned to pre-fire levels more quickly. The richness and abundance of regenerated woody species was significantly greater with more time elapsed since the fire. However, no relationship was found between species richness and abundance of adult woody species and time elapsed post-fire. We found that vegetative recovery over time was not related to burn severity. Forested and mixed forest/shrubland cover is reached 10-20 years after the fire, if no further intervention occurs. Richness and species abundance was similar to that of unburned sites after 20 or more years post-fire. This study provided evidence that forest vegetation in the Chilean Mediterranean ecosystem is resilient to fires of at least low and medium intensities.

TI  - The need for apologetic equipment already in preschool catechesis
T2  - IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
M3  - Article
AB  - From a young age, children are busy making sense of the world around them. Their worldview is formed by influences and/or guidance and their own intrinsic participation. With the availability of information provided by the media in the 21st century, Christian children are exposed to not only a Christian worldview, but also to other dominating worldviews. This exposure can have a negative effect on the formation of a Christian worldview if not treated correctly. When leading Christian researchers assume the prerequisite that pre-school children do not have the ability to grasp aspects of faith due to their so-called inability for abstract thoughts, the results will be the underemphasis, neglect and even disapproval of equipment in terms of a Christian biblical worldview. The result of this view is that non-biblical worldviews will dominate and shape Christian children's thoughts from an early age, while there is little to no equipment guiding them. This occurs notwithstanding that the Word of God demands believers to educate their children and to equip them from an early age with the necessary foundational tools and resources. Apologetical equipment in the understanding of God, man and the world ought to be part of this education in faith that leads to a biblical and Christian worldview from a young age.Contribution: In their first six years, children form important concepts and presuppositions that could influence and affect the rest of their lives. Especially also through the stories they watch and listen to, they are confronted with conflicting ideas and concepts from which they must make sense. Sufficient apologetic and catechetical resources on the cognitive level of preschool children should be provided to parents and educators of these children. These materials of which worldviews should be an integral part of, can and should guide these young believers in the consideration of conflicting ideas and even the defence of what they believe.

TI  - Development of constructed wetlands in agricultural landscapes using remote sensing techniques
T2  - ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sweden, drainage and the construction of water infrastructure have influenced agriculture in the last few centuries both positively and negatively. Recently, a trend has set in where wetlands are constructed to retain water, retain and reduce nutrients and to enhance the biodiversity. This study aimed to use remote sensing techniques to study landscape water retention over time. In this pilot study, water retention structures in Gotland (57 degrees 28'35.0 '' N18 degrees 29' 13.9 '' E) and Kalmar Lan (56 degrees 39'41 '' N16 degrees 21'46 '' E) for 2000/2001 and 2020 were identified and analyzed using Landsat data. In this study, it was found that the number of water retention structures (>0.8 ha) increased from 44 to 101 for Gotland Lan and from 44 to 127 for Kalmar Lan. Most water retention structures were <4 ha and were located in mid- and downstream areas. A comparison of the remote sensed results with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) database showed a disagreement of the spatial coordinates of the wetlands in the database with the water retention structures. This pilot study has shown that remote sensed data can be used to identify water retention structures, although higher resolution imagery would be highly advisable in these kinds of studies.

TI  - Monitoring Sea Ice in Liaodong Bay of Bohai Sea during the Freezing Period of 2017/2018 Using Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to monitor sea ice for relieving and preventing sea ice disasters. In this paper, the growth and development of sea ice in Liaodong Bay of Bohai Sea in China were monitored using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data during the freezing period from January to March in 2018. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the spectral characteristics of seawater and sea ice in visible bands, supplemented by the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we proposed a new method based on decision tree classification for extracting sea ice types in Liaodong Bay of Bohai Sea. Using the remote sensing data of eight satellite overpasses acquired from Sentinel-2A/B satellites, the distribution and area of the different sea ice types in Liaodong Bay during the freezing period of 2017/2018 were obtained. Compared with the maximum likelihood (ML) classification method and the support vector machine (SVM) classification method, the proposed method has higher accuracy when discriminating the sea ice types, which proved the new method proposed in this paper is suitable for extracting sea ice types from Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data in Liaodong Bay. And its classification accuracy reaches 88.05%. The whole process of evolution such as the growth and development of sea ice in Liaodong Bay during the freezing period from January to March in 2018 was monitored. The maximum area of sea ice was detected on 27 January 2018, about 10,187 km(2). At last, the quantitative relationship model between the sea ice area and the mean near-surface temperature derived by MODIS data in Liaodong Bay was established. Through research, we found that the mean near-surface temperature was the most important factor for affecting the formation and melt of sea ice in Liaodong Bay.

TI  - Quantification of glacier mass budgets in the Karakoram region of Upper Indus Basin during the early twenty-first century
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water supply contributed by glacier and snow melt is of particular significance and play a key role for social stability in the Karakoram region of Upper Indus Basin (UIBKK). Based on the SRTM DEM, TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images and ZY3-02 stereo images, the spatiotemporal pattern of glacier mass budgets in the UIBKK have been estimated for the early 21st century (2000-2019) period in this study. A comparison of the total area in 2000 with that in 2019 shows that glacier area remained stable in the early 21st century, with a slight expansion of 56.3 km(2) (0.4%). Glaciers in the UIBKK experienced a balanced or slight negative mass budget of -0.08 +/- 0.07 m w.e. a(-1) in the early 21st century. The spatial variability of mass budget in the UIBKK showed that glacier mass budgets shifted from negative to positive from West to East, respectively, along longitude. Glacier mass loss decelerated from 0.12 +/- 0.16 m w.e. a(-1) in 2000-2013 to 0.03 +/- 0.21 m w.e. a(-1) in 2013-2019. No significant differences were observed in thinning rates on debris-covered glaciers (>= 19% area covered by debris) and clean-ice glaciers (<19% area covered by debris) in the early 21st century (0.06 m a(-1) vs 0.04 m a(-1)). The overall homogeneous mass budgets for surge and non-surge glaciers indicated that glacier surges seem not have a notable impact on glacier-wide mass budget over short time scales. The spatiotemporal variability of glacier mass budgets in the UIBKK are consistent with the tendencies of winter precipitation and summer temperature. Climate warming may play more important role in glacier changes in the UIBKK.

TI  - The Status Quo and Attribution of Wildlife Crimes: A Study of Cases in China From the Perspective of Ecological Economic Ethics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, which has ravaged the world, has led to a rethinking of the relationship between humans and nature and the cliches of the economic-centered model. Thus, the ecological economy has been reviewed, especially from an ethical worldview. This paper uses statistical methods to retrieve and categorize 3,646 wildlife crime cases for analysis and quantitative research. It adopts legal and ethical perspectives to analyze the subject and the subjective, incidence, and sentencing factors of wildlife crimes and uses the ecological economic ethical model to measure wildlife crimes. We argue that the existing judicial system fails to answer the difficulties of the economic ethics of wildlife crimes. It is recommended that ecological and economic ethical awareness be internalized. We suggest calling for comprehensive legislation on wildlife crimes from the perspective of ecological economic ethics to effectively prevent and reduce wildlife crime and eventually promote public health.

TI  - Accuracy comparison and driving factor analysis of LULC changes using multi-source time-series remote sensing data in a coastal area
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) products derived from remote sensing data are fundamental to the earth's surface ecological environment studies. Various LULC products have different data sources with large uncertainties and varying spatio-temporal resolutions. In this study, our objectives are to understand the accuracy of the current LULC products at the coastal area of Tianjin city. We conducted accuracy verification and comparative analysis of the LULC datasets available from different sources, MCD12Q1, CGLS-LC100, FROM_GLC, GLC_FCS30 and GlobeLand30 for the years of 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2020, at varying spatial resolutions 500-100-30-10 m. Using land cover dataset for these years, we conducted time-series analysis of land cover changes and driving factors. Results showed that GLC_FCS30-2020 has the highest classification accuracy (72.57%), followed by GlobeLand30-2020 (72.23%) and GlobeLand30-2010 (70.10%). The classification accuracy is related to the spatial resolution of original data source and the classification system. The verification accuracies of all products are found to be lower than their official announcements. Additionally, the accuracy comparison among different land types indicated that the classification accuracy of agricultural land, impervious surface, and water bodies is high, while that of forest, grassland, and shrubs is low. According to the spatio-temporal pattern analysis of land cover changes in Tianjin during 2010-2020, the area of agricultural land is slowly decreasing, and construction land is increasing, and the increase results mainly from the conversion of agricultural land and grassland. The rapid population growth, economic development and policy guidance are the main driving factors.

TI  - The Evolution of Peteroa Volcano (Chile-Argentina) Crater Lakes Between 1984 and 2020 Based on Landsat and Planet Labs Imagery Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major challenges in the understanding of the crater lakes dynamics and their connection with magmatic/hydrothermal processes is the continuous tracking of the physical behavior of lakes, especially in cases of remote and poorly accessible volcanoes. Peteroa volcano (Chile-Argentina border) is part of the Planchon-Peteroa-Azufre Volcanic Complex, one of the three volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes with crater lakes. Peteroa volcano is formed by a similar to 5 km diameter caldera-type crater, which hosts four crater lakes and several fumarolic fields. Peteroa volcano has a large history of eruptive activity including phreatic-and-phreatomagmatic explosions and several episodes of strong degassing from its crater lakes. Here, we used TIR and SWIR bands from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images available from October 1984 to December 2020 to obtain thermal parameters such as thermal radiance, brightness temperature, and heat fluxes, and Planet Labs Inc. images (RapidEye and PlanetScope) available between May 2009 and December 2020 to obtain physical parameters such as area, color, and state (liquid or frozen) of the crater lakes. We reviewed the historical eruptive activity and compared it with thermal and physical data obtained from satellite images. We determined the occurrence of two eruptive/thermal cycles: 1) Cycle 1 includes the formation of a new fumarolic field and two active craters during a short eruptive period, which includes thermal activity in three of the four crater lakes, and a strong degassing process between October 1998 and February 2001, coincident with a peak of volcanic heat flux (Q(volc)) in two craters. The cycle finished with an eruptive episode (September 2010-July 2011). 2) Cycle 2 is represented by the thermal reactivation of two crater lakes, formation and detection of thermal activity in a new nested crater, and occurrence of a new eruptive episode (October 2018-April 2019). We observed a migration of the thermal and eruptive activity between the crater lakes and the interconnection of the pathways that feed the lakes, in both cases, partially related to the presence of two deep magma bodies. The Q(volc) in Peteroa volcano crater lakes is primarily controlled by volcanic activity, and seasonal effects affect it at short-term, whilst at long-term, seasonal effects do not show clear influences in the volcanic heat fluxes. The maximum Q(volc) measured between all crater lakes during quiescent periods was 59 MW, whereas during unrest episodes Q(volc) in single crater lakes varied from 7.1 to 38 MW, with Peteroa volcano being classified as a low volcanic heat flux system. The detection of new thermal activity and increase of Q(volc) in Peteroa volcano previous to explosive unrest can be considered as a good example of how thermal information from satellite images can be used to detect possible precursors to eruptive activity in volcanoes which host crater lakes.

TI  - The normalised Sentinel-1 Global Backscatter Model, mapping Earth's land surface with C-band microwaves
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We present a new perspective on Earth's land surface, providing a normalised microwave backscatter map from spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. The Sentinel-1 Global Backscatter Model (S1GBM) describes Earth for the period 2016-17 by the mean C-band radar cross section in VV- and VH-polarisation at a 10 m sampling. We processed 0.5 million Sentinel-1 scenes totalling 1.1 PB and performed semi-automatic quality curation and backscatter harmonisation related to orbit geometry effects. The overall mosaic quality excels (the few) existing datasets, with minimised imprinting from orbit discontinuities and successful angle normalisation in large parts of the world. Regions covered by only one or two Sentinel-1 orbits remain challenging, owing to insufficient angular variation and not yet perfect sub-swath thermal noise correction. Supporting the design and verification of upcoming radar sensors, the obtained S1GBM data potentially also serve land cover classification and determination of vegetation and soil states. Here, we demonstrate, as an example of its potential use, the mapping of permanent water bodies and evaluate against the Global Surface Water benchmark.

TI  - From the Heart of the Father to the Ends of the Earth: The Participation of the Church and the Baptized in the Mission of Jesus
T2  - LINACRE QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mission has its origin in the inner life of God; their relationships with one another define the Persons of the Trinity. The Son is eternally generated by the Father, eternally proceeding from Him. When he becomes human, this identity becomes mission. Those united to Jesus through Baptism share in his missionary personality, not only corporately as the whole Church but individually as well. Beginning with the Second Vatican Council, and developed by subsequent papal teaching, the Church has rediscovered her missionary nature with clearer reference to Christ and the Gospel, and in more direct relation to the world and its needs. The Church's proclamation is most compelling when it is embodied by witnesses who have verified by experience the fulfillment of their humanity in a lived Christianity. This proposal is never a one-sided matter, but always involves an awareness of solidarity and reciprocity, an experience of encounter and discovery, and so becomes a journey of accompaniment and conversion for the bearer of the message. This is the rationale for widespread participation in missionary activities in the Church. Because of its affinity with the healing ministry of Jesus, medicine offers a unique possibility in this regard. Precisely because of the good they can accomplish and the challenges they can provoke, medical missions present a privileged opportunity for witness and generosity, but also for a new perspective and a changed heart for the participants. Together with those whom they serve, missionary disciples have the joy of joining the triumphal procession of Christ back into the heart of the Father.

TI  - Maybe, Maybe Not: Racial Discourse and Worldview in Interracial Relationships
T2  - COUPLE AND FAMILY PSYCHOLOGY-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a multidimensional understanding of race, the present study investigated whether racial worldview informs the initiation of discussions of race within interracial relationships. Two hundred three individuals in interracial relationships completed measures to assess their perceptions of the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and institutional implications of race and ethnicity and indicated whether they discussed race with their romantic partner. Responses to open-ended questions were coded using consensual qualitative research methods. Using K-means cluster analysis, participants were grouped based on racial worldview and differences in the prevalence of themes were tested. Findings revealed differences in whether race was discussed and the content of the discussion (e.g., differences in culture, intrarelationship difficulties, or institutional discrimination) by worldview. Individuals' multifaceted understanding of race impacts their discussion of race within their relationship. Racial worldview is a promising concept for a proximal assessment of the influence of race in interracial relationships and interactions across race more broadly.

TI  - Spatial configuration of seagrass community attributes in a stressed coastal lagoon, southeastern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Terminos Lagoon is the largest coastal lagoon in the southern Gulf of Mexico and is a highly biodiverse and productive system that supports important seagrasses. These key habitats are under significant stress due to anthropic activities around and inside the lagoon. Considering the lack of updated information about their distribution, cover, and ecological condition, the objectives of this study were to assess the current morphological and seascape conditions of seagrass meadows in Terminos Lagoon and to evaluate their morphological changes in almost one decade (2010-2018). We combined remote sensing and fieldwork to assess environmental parameters (sea surface temperature and a light attenuation index), quantify seascape metrics, evaluate morphometric variables of seagrasses, and quantify organic carbon budgets. Three species of seagrasses (Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme and Halodule wrightii) were distributed in the lagoon and showed the highest densities and cover in sheltered zones, where shallow and more transparent water conditions occurred. In general, the seascape-cover diversity was regularly distributed in the study area, with the highest meadow connectivity mainly along the inner littoral region of the island. While the values we recorded for T. testudinum leaf length ((K) over tilde = 18.6 cm), shoot densities ((K) over bar = 249.5 m(-2)) and total biomass ((K) over bar = 195.2 g DW m(-2)) were consistent with other recent studies, they were lower compared with other coastal systems in southeastern Gulf of Mexico and different between 2010 and 2018 in the lagoon, presumably associated with strong anthropic influences in the region. Finally, we provide a spatially explicit baseline information on morphology, seascape configuration and the first sensitivity map for one of the most important coastal lagoons in Mexico.

TI  - Bankfull shear velocity predicts embeddedness and silt cover in gravel streambeds
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Excess fine sediment (<2 mm) deposition on gravel streambeds can degrade habitat quality for stream biota. Two measures of fine sediment deposition include embeddedness and silt cover (<62.5 mu m). Embeddedness measures fine sediment in interstitial pore spaces, whereas silt cover, primarily deposited during low flows, measures fine sediment draped on the streambed's surface. Here, we demonstrate that a baseline level of embeddedness and a maximum value of silt cover can be predicted from bankfull shear velocity, which can be estimated from river channel and streamflow characteristics, independently of knowing the sediment supply. We derive an equation for bankfull shear velocity that only requires knowing bankfull flow, channel width, and channel slope, which can be readily obtained in the United States from freely available, remotely sensed data. We apply this methodology to data collected at 30 sites in the Piedmont region of Virginia and North Carolina. This work is an important step in developing statistical models of stream ecosystems in which geophysical variables can predict embeddedness and silt cover, which commonly limit biotic assemblages.

TI  - Updating land cover map based on change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal high-resolution land cover (LC) information is of great significance to landscape monitoring, environmental assessment, and local climate change. Given the LC map in the former phase, an automatic LC updating approach based on change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images is proposed. First, object-based change detection is implemented combining spectral bands, normalized difference vegetation index, and normalized difference water index. Second, the changed objects are classified using training samples generated from the unchanged area, and the LC labels of the training samples were transferred from the LC map in the former phase. Finally, as the updated objects with abnormal area (AREA) or perimeter-area ratio (PARA) are recognized as slivers or spurious stretches, and removed using specifically designed rules, an AREA-PARA-based updating method is proposed to update the LC map. Two pairs of GaoFen-1 panchromatic and multispectral sensor images acquired in 2013 and 2015 of two areas in Jiangsu, China, were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and the comparisons with two other updating methods manifested the superiority of the APU method in reducing abnormal LC fragmentation and shape complexity, and maintaining LC consistency between two phases.

TI  - Snow cover detection in mid-latitude mountainous and polar regions using nighttime light data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - ABS T R A C T Traditional optical remote sensing data have been widely used for snow cover detection and monitoring. However, they are limited to daytime detection and often suffer from large data gaps due to frequent cloud obscuration. This is in particular a serious challenge for high-latitude and polar regions where long nights prevail during the winter. Nighttime light sensors have a strong capability of sensing the low-level reflected moonlight. They potentially provide a new way to detect snow cover. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the moonlight intensity for snow detection and developed a Minimum Error Thresholding (MET) algorithm to detect snow cover from the data collected by Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (S-NPP VIIRS) satellite data. For the two case study sites, Abisko in the sub-Arctic zone and the Tibetan Plateau, our analysis results suggest that the moonlight provides sufficient illumination to map snow cover for approx-imately 10 days in a lunar month. Our nighttime snow cover detection method was quantitatively evaluated by comparing our S-NPP VIIRS DNB snow cover estimates with in situ station observations, Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow cover products, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products over Abisko region and the Tibetan Plateau during the 2017-2018 snow season. The overall accuracy of S-NPP VIIRS snow cover estimates was approximately 80.3% in Abisko region and 76.7% in the Tibetan Plateau. The data gaps in our S-NPP VIIRS DNB snow cover estimates were smaller than those of the MODIS snow cover products by 22.1% and 5.1% over Abisko region and the Tibetan Plateau, respectively. Further, we found that nearly 92.8% and 74.6% of data gaps in the MODIS snow-cover product can be filled up by incorporating our S-NPP VIIRS DNB snow cover estimates in Abisko region and the Tibetan Plateau. The total accuracy of daily MODIS snow cover products can be improved to 91.0% in the Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that S-NPP VIIRS DNB nighttime satellite data can provide reliable snow products over polar regions and mid-latitude mountainous areas, which is complementary to the standard MODIS snow cover products.

TI  - Aerosol Loading and Radiation Budget Perturbations in Densely Populated and Highly Polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain by COVID-19: Influences on Cloud Properties and Air Temperature
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols emitted in densely populated and industrialized Indo-Gangetic Plain, one of the most polluted regions in the world, modulate regional climate, monsoon, and Himalayan glacier retreat. Thus, this region is important for understanding aerosol perturbations and their resulting impacts on atmospheric changes during COVID-19 lockdown period, a natural experimental condition created by the pandemic. By analyzing 5 years (2016-2020) data of aerosols and performing a radiative transfer calculation, we found that columnar and near-surface aerosol loadings decreased, leading to reductions in radiative cooling at the surface and top of the atmosphere and atmospheric warming during lockdown period. Further, satellite data analyses showed increases in cloud optical thickness and cloud-particle effective radius and decrease in lower tropospheric air temperature during lockdown period. These results indicate critical influences of COVID-19 lockdown on regional climate and water cycle over Indo-Gangetic Plain, emphasizing need for further studies from modeling perspectives.Plain Language Summary The COVID-19 control measures constrained human activities, reducing anthropogenic emissions around the world, including Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), one of the global aerosol hotspots. Aerosols emitted in the IGP can affect regional climate, water cycle, Himalayan glacier retreat, etc. Thus, understanding the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown in aerosol field and other associated components of the atmosphere over IGP is important for better understanding the roles of aerosols on climate and water cycle of South Asia and its vicinity. This study suggests reductions of both near-surface and columnar aerosol loadings by lockdown measures further reduced radiative cooling at the surface and top of the atmosphere and atmospheric warming. The effects were also noted in the cloud field by increasing cloud optical thickness and cloud-particle effective radius and in the meteorological field by reducing air temperature in the lower troposphere. These manifold impacts over this important source region indicate broad influences of COVID-19 on the regional climate and water cycle, underscoring further investigations.Key PointsAerosols reduced by COVID-19 lockdown perturbed atmospheric heat budget over the Indo-Gangetic PlainCloud optical thickness and cloud-particle effective radius increased during COVID-19 lockdown periodAir temperature in the lower troposphere decreased during COVID-19 lockdown period

TI  - Annual dynamic dataset of global cropping intensity from 2001 to 2019
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The cropping intensity has received growing concern in the agriculture field in applications such as harvest area research. Notwithstanding the significant amount of existing literature on local cropping intensities, research considering global datasets appears to be limited in spatial resolution and precision. In this paper, we present an annual dynamic global cropping intensity dataset covering the period from 2001 to 2019 at a 250-m resolution with an average overall accuracy of 89%, exceeding the accuracy of the current annual dynamic global cropping intensity data at a 500-m resolution. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of MOD13Q1 as the database via a sixth-order polynomial function to calculate the cropping intensity. The global cropping intensity dataset was packaged in the GeoTIFF file type, with the quality control band in the same format. The dataset fills the vacancy of medium-resolution, global-scale annual cropping intensity data and provides an improved map for further global yield estimations and food security analyses.

TI  - Characterizing bracken fern phenological cycle using time series data derived from Sentinel-2 satellite sensor
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bracken fern is an invasive plant that has caused serious disturbances in many ecosystems due to its ability to encroach into new areas swiftly. Adequate knowledge of the phenological cycle of bracken fern is required to serve as an important tool in formulating management plans to control the spread of the fern. This study aimed to characterize the phenological cycle of bracken fern using NDVI and EVI2 time series data derived from Sentinel-2 sensor. The TIMESAT program was used for removing low quality data values, model fitting and for extracting bracken fern phenological metrics. The Sentinel-2 satellite-derived phenological metrics were compared with the corresponding bracken fern phenological events observed on the ground. Findings from our study revealed that bracken fern phenological metrics estimated from satellite data were in close agreement with ground observed phenological events with R-2 values ranging from 0.53-0.85 (p < 0.05). Although they are comparable, our study shows that NDVI and EVI2 differ in their ability to track the phenological cycle of bracken fern. Overall, EVI2 performed better in estimating bracken fern phenological metrics as it related more to ground observed phenological events compared to NDVI. The key phenological metrics extracted in this study are critical for improving the precision in the controlling of the spread of bracken fern as well as in implementing active protection strategies against the invasion of highly susceptible rangelands.

TI  - Interference of CDOM in remote sensing of suspended particulate matter (SPM) based on MODIS in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea coastal waters has remained challenging to understand among researchers. Here, for the first time in the region, we parametrized SPM concentration in the study area utilizing derived remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) values from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), using 555 and 667 nm wavelengths. Likewise, the findings showed that the developed optical model based on the optical ratio of Rrs (667)/Rrs (555) was sensitive to the concentration of Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the seawater, within the visible wavelengths less than 600 nm. Comparing the new estimates of the SPM concentration with in situ measurements by Spearman's Rank correlation for validation revealed that the association between estimated and measured SPM concentration would be considered statistically significant (rho up to 0.86, p < 0.05). This study increased the average accuracy of the estimates up to 73%.

TI  - Evidence of Cascading Subglacial Water Flow at Jutulstraumen Glacier (Antarctica) Derived From Sentinel-1 and ICESat-2 Measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Migration of subglacial water underneath thick Antarctic ice is difficult to observe directly but is known to influence ice flow dynamics. Here, we analyze a 6-year time series of displacement maps from differential Sentinel-1 SAR interferometry (DInSAR) in the upstream region of Jutulstraumen Glacier. Our results reveal short-term (between 12 days and 1 year) interconnected subsidence- and uplift events of the ice surface, which we interpret as a pressure response to the drainage and filling of subglacial lakes. This indicates an episodic cascade-like water transport with longer quiescent phases in a dynamically stable glacial setting. Abrupt events appear in the DInSAR time series and are confirmed by ICESat-2 altimetry. The events can be traced for a 1-year period along a similar to 175 km flow path. We are able to observe the migration of subglacial water with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, providing a new observational baseline to further develop subglacial hydrological models.Plain Language Summary Subglacial lakes and the movement of subglacial water play an important role in the way how ice flows in the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The drainage and filling of subglacial lakes is reflected in subsidence and uplift at the ice surface, which can be monitored by satellite based elevation measurements. In this study, we detect these elevation changes of the ice surface at the onset of Dronning Maud Land's largest glacier (Jutulstraumen Glacier, Antarctica). We register a number of connected events which show us where and when subglacial water moves downstream. We find that the water flows similarly to a self-tipping swimming pool bucket: water beneath the ice is localized and abruptly moves from one place to another after some time has passed. Using airborne radar-sounding techniques, we find that the water flows along preferential flowpaths in the subglacial system. These are the first confirmed subglacial water movements in central Dronning Maud Land, an area where no subglacial water flow has been observed previously. The episodic nature of water flow is a new observation that will help us to understand how the subglacial water forms its own pluming system beneath these large glaciers.Key PointsSentinel-1 DInSAR estimates reveal a similar to 175 km flow path of a cascade-like chain of subglacial water propagation over a 1-year periodHigh-resolution ultra-wideband radar data show no characteristic lake bed reflections and suggests water transport via a local trough systemWe find evidence of highly dynamic water transport in a static glacial stetting providing a benchmark dataset to improve modeling results

TI  - Vegetation Angular Signatures of Equatorial Forests From DSCOVR EPIC and Terra MISR Observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In vegetation canopies cross-shading between finite dimensional leaves leads to a peak in reflectance in the retro-illumination direction. This effect is called the hot spot in optical remote sensing. The hotspot region in reflectance of vegetated surfaces represents the most information-rich directions in the angular distribution of canopy reflected radiation. This paper presents a new approach for generating hot spot signatures of equatorial forests from synergistic analyses of multiangle observations from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on Terra platform and near backscattering reflectance data from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). A canopy radiation model parameterized in terms of canopy spectral invariants underlies the theoretical basis for joining Terra MISR and DSCOVR EPIC data. The proposed model can accurately reproduce both MISR angular signatures acquired at 10:30 local solar time and diurnal courses of EPIC reflectance (NRMSE < 9%, R-2 > 0.8). Analyses of time series of the hot spot signature suggest its ability to unambiguously detect seasonal changes of equatorial forests.

TI  - Examining the performances of true color RGB bands from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and UAV as stand-alone data for mapping artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional satellite sensors provide periodic data for monitoring Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM). Incorporating Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensors in monitoring ASM can increase data availability and also mitigate the challenge of cloud cover that causes data gaps in satellite data availability. However, most UAV sensors measure only in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) bands and the utility of RGB for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping is still in the preliminary stages. This study contributes to research by examining the accuracies of true color RGB images for mapping ASM, using the Birim Basin in Ghana as a case study. The study first compared Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) full reflective bands for LULC mapping of the basin. The study then used true color RGB from UAV, L8 and S2 to map a subsection of the basin where there was active ASM. A test experiment was also performed in which other band combinations, single band, and indices were used to map ASM. From the results, the L8 and S2 full reflective bands attained Overall accuracy (OA) and User Accuracy (UA) over 97%, with less than 1% difference between their accuracies. All stand-alone RGB precisely mapped ASM with accuracies of 90% and above, indicating their fit for mapping ASM. However, the effect of image resolution caused differences in the surface area of the ASM estimated from the different sensors. Also, the different band combinations and indices could not accurately map ASM. Nonetheless, the results of the study showed increased scientific grounds for using UAV for mapping ASM. The overall results showed the capabilities of remote sensors in providing frequent and sustainable data for mapping ASM. Additionally, the results from the three images (L8, S2 and UAV) reavelaed much destruction of the forest cover due ASM. These results would be relevant in monitoring and managing the natural resources, which will help achieve environmental sustainability in meeting the SDG goals in 2030.

TI  - "Soldiers of the Faith": A Comparative Analysis of White Power Songs and Islamic State Nasheeds
T2  - DEVIANT BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - he nonviolent activities of extremists have the capacity to shed important light on how such groups think and frame the world around them. This paper provides a comparative insight into the framing activities of Islamic State and white power (WP) groups through an analysis of the song lyrics that have emerged from these scenes. In doing so, we seek to understand the role that culture, particularly music, plays in constructing the worldview of both white supremacists and jihadists. Through analyzing song lyrics we explain how those writing and performing the music can shape the contexts in which participants operate. What emerges is that despite differences in the stated belief systems of Islamic State and white supremacists, the ways in which the underlying worldview is constructed is similar. Both focus on highlighting grievances and see their own in-group as facing real and prominent threats, often due to liberal values. Both see Jewish people as a corrupting force in the world, and both have a clear direction on overcoming such threats with direct calls to action. Both groups tap into global narratives against multiculturalism, globalization, and the global international order, which they view as inherently damaging to their own group interests.

TI  - A Novel Method for Gaining New Insight on Flows Over Inundated Landscapes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel approach for detecting surface water flows over flooded terrain. The approach requires a minimum of three stage measurements and can be applied to any inundated surface, across a range of temporal and spatial scales. This method creates new and robust opportunities for field observation and for validation of numerical simulations and remote sensing analyses. In this proof-of-concept study, we found that floodplain free surface gradients were particularly variable during sub-bankfull inundation, including abrupt current reversals. Also, flow direction varied with stage and the rate of change in stage. The "triangular facet" approach provides a new type of mesoscale insight of flow processes over inundated landscapes, highlighting flow complexity. Moreover, the approach provides information on floods that represent a compromise between point velocimeter measurements and satellite remote sensing and it can provide substantial benefits to society by aiding in flood hazard and mitigation assessment and planning.Plain Language Summary We present a new approach for estimating flow direction and speed over a flooded terrain using sets of three water level recorders arranged in a triangular configuration. The approach can be applied to any inundated surface and scaled as needed. The triangular facet method provides valuable field observations that can be used to assess the performance of numerical models or remote sensing data. In our application over an inundated floodplain, the approach revealed complex flow patterns in space and time, and it shows that flow configurations for a given water stage are not necessarily repeatable. In particular, during lower inundation depths, the flow directions were highly variable, including abrupt changes in flow direction. This work helps fill a knowledge gap with respect to circulation during floods that is critical to understanding hazard planning and mitigation, material cycling and floodplain processes, and functions and habitat sustainability.Key PointsThree depth sensors define an inundation free surface; the maximum gradient of the plane defines flow direction and magnitudeAnalysis of high-resolution flows helps fill a knowledge gap with temporal and spatial dynamics of floodplain inundationThe controlling factors of floodplain flow dynamics are stage, rate of change of stage, and inundation process

TI  - Climate Signatures on Lake And Wetland Size Distributions in Arctic Deltas
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how thermokarst lakes on arctic river deltas will respond to rapid warming is critical for projecting how carbon storage and fluxes will change in those vulnerable environments. Yet, this understanding is currently limited partly due to the complexity of disentangling significant interannual variability from the longer-term surface water signatures on the landscape, using the short summertime window of optical spaceborne observations. Here, we rigorously separate perennial lakes from ephemeral wetlands on 12 arctic deltas and report distinct size distributions and climate trends for the two waterbodies. Namely, we find a lognormal distribution for lakes and a power-law distribution for wetlands, consistent with a simple proportionate growth model and inundated topography, respectively. Furthermore, while no trend with temperature is found for wetlands, a statistically significant decreasing trend of mean lake size with warmer temperatures is found, attributed to colder deltas having deeper and thicker permafrost preserving larger lakes.Plain Language Summary Arctic river deltas are landscapes facing significant risk from climate change, in part due to their unique permafrost features. In particular, thermokarst lakes in ice-rich permafrost are expected to both expand and drain under warming-induced permafrost thaw, reconfiguring deltaic hydrology and impacting the arctic carbon cycle. A limitation in understanding how thermokarst lake cover might be changing is the significant interannual variability in water cover in flat regions such as deltas, which makes it difficult to distinguish between perennially inundated, thermally relevant waterbodies, and ephemerally inundated waterbodies. Here, we present a pan-Arctic study of 12 arctic deltas wherein we classify observed waterbodies into perennial lakes and ephemeral wetlands capitalizing on the historical record of remote sensing data. We provide evidence that thermokarst lake sizes are universally lognormally distributed and that historical temperature trends are encoded in lake sizes, while wetland sizes are power law distributed and have no temperature trend. These findings pave the way for quantitative insight into lake cover changes on arctic deltas and associated carbon and hydrologic cycle impacts under future climate change.Key PointsLake areas in arctic deltas exhibit a lognormal distribution associated with a simple mechanistic growth processWetland areas exhibit a power law distribution consistent with inundated topographyColder arctic deltas have larger average lake sizes, likely due to thicker permafrost restricting sub-lake hydrologic connectivity

T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone of China has experienced large increases in population, economy and urbanization since the early 1980s. Many studies have reported the loss, degradation and fragmentation of coastal wetlands in China at local to regional scales. To date, at the national scale, our knowledge of the spatial distribution, inter-annual variation and multi-decadal trends of coastal wetlands in China remains very limited. Here we analysed -62,000 Landsat-5, -7 and -8 images over the period 1984-2018 and generated maps of coastal wetlands for individual years in China at 30-m spatial resolution. We found that coastal wetland area significantly decreased between 1984 and 2011. We also found a substantial increase in saltmarsh area and a stable trend of tidal flat area since 2012, driven by reduced anthropogenic activities and increased conservation and restoration efforts. These coastal wetland maps for the period 1984-2018 are invaluable for improvement of coastal wetland management and sustainability in China.

TI  - Active Fire Dynamics in the Amazon: New Perspectives From High-Resolution Satellite Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon region is expected to become an amplified fire-prone system, but the mechanism of fire occurrence is not fully understood. Here, we employed more than 300,000 Sentinel-2 images acquired during 2016-2019 and compiled a high-resolution inventory of active fires (AFs) over the Amazon. We found that the fire activities in the Amazon in 2019 did not stand out compared with those in 2017 as a whole. However, the number of fires increased in 2019 in the absence of an exceptional drought, suggesting increased human disturbance in the Amazon. The high-resolution AF inventory further demonstrated that over 90% of detected AFs were associated with humans clearing deforested fields on forest fringes for agricultural land expansion. Additionally, our inventory indicated that satellite sensors with coarser spatial resolution could miss considerable small fires, especially at the sensitive agriculture-forest interface, which therefore should be targeted as a priority conservation area.Plain Language Summary The Amazon region is a globally important biodiversity hotspot and carbon reservoir. In the context of increasing deforestation in the Amazon, high-resolution satellite monitoring is essential for detecting small spatially fragmented fires and for developing more targeted forest conservation strategies. Here, we compiled a high-resolution active fire inventory by processing more than 300,000 Sentinel-2 images. First, we found that most fires burn over shrublands, grasslands, and croplands near the fringes of the rainforest. Second, the headline-grabbing fires in 2019 did not stand out compared with those in 2017 as a whole. However, the 2019 fires occurred in the absence of droughts, and more fires were observed deeper in the forest, suggesting that human disturbance was increasing in the Amazon. Finally, our inventory allows spatially explicit matches with fire-affected land covers. Evidence from high-resolution observations indicated that the fires in the Amazon are closely interlinked with deforestation and agricultural land expansion and form an interactive circle. This leads to forest fragmentation and stimulates more fragmented fires in turn. Our findings improve the understanding of fire-climate-land cover change interactions at a fine spatial resolution.Key PointsThe fire dynamics in 2019 without an exceptional drought indicated an increase in human disturbance in the AmazonOver 90% of detected fires were associated with human clearing deforested fields on the forest fringes for agricultural purposesSmall fires are well recorded in Sentinel-2 images, providing a vital supplement to active fire products from coarser resolution sensors

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Winds and Inflow Angle Asymmetry From SAR Imagery
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a morphological model for Tropical Cyclone (TC) wind and inflow angle asymmetry based on sea surface wind fields derived from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The model extracts the standard TC morphological information (center, intensity, and radius of the maximum wind) and decomposes the SAR-derived winds into vortex rotation winds and motion vector, making the reconstruction of the entire TC structure reliable, even in areas not mapped by SAR. The derived wind speeds and inflow angles are verified with aircraft measurements by stepped-frequency microwave radiometer and dropsondes, obtaining root-mean-square errors of 4.32 m/s and 16.04 degrees, respectively. A systematic analysis of 130 SAR TCs images, collected by RADARSAT-2 and SENTINEL-1, reveals that the model can capture the main asymmetrical TC structure. Both TC asymmetry and eye size decrease as TC intensity increases.Plain Language Summary Tropical Cyclone (TC) movement is essential in creating asymmetry in its surface winds. TCs include hurricanes and typhoons. However, the relations between asymmetrical TC surface wind field and TC movement are limited because of the lack of adequate observations. This study proposes an idealized model to investigate TC inflow angle asymmetry in the surface winds. The model has applied to 130 spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images over a large variety of different TCs. This model can detect the asymmetrical surface wind structure, TC surface motion vectors and the associated inflow angles, and other standard morphological information such as center locations, symmetrical intensities, and radius of maximum winds. The model results are validated by comparing the wind speeds and inflow angles to measurements from the airborne stepped-frequency microwave radiometer and dropsondes, obtaining a root-mean-square error of 4.32 m/s and 16.04 degrees, respectively. We compose TC surface wind speed distributions mapped by SAR and reconstructed by the model. They are shown to be similar in any TC category. The asymmetrical features are related to the storm intensity both in SAR winds and model results. In either the SAR observations or the model results, the maximum winds occur in the northeast quadrant.Key PointsA Tropical Cyclone (TC) inflow angle asymmetry model is developed to decompose synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived TC winds into rotation speeds and motion vectorValidation against aircraft data shows the model-reconstructed wind speeds, and inflow angles are accurate even in areas not covered by SARA systematic analysis of 130 SAR TC images using the model reveals that TC asymmetry and eye size decrease as TC intensity increases

TI  - Sensitivity of phytoplankton to climatic factors in a large shallow lake revealed by column-integrated algal biomass from long-term satellite observations
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There are some uncertainties of using chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations in water surface to address phytoplankton dynamics, especially in large shallow lakes, because of the dramatic vertical migration of phytoplankton. The column-integrated algal biomass (CAB) can reflect the whole water column information, so it is considered as a better indicator for phytoplankton total biomass. An algal biomass index (ABI) and an empirical algorithm were proposed previously to measure algal biomass inside and outside euphotic zone from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. A long-term CAB time series was generated in this study to clarify the temporal and spatial changes in phytoplankton and address its sensitivity to climatic factors in Lake Chaohu, a shallow eutrophic lake in China, from 2000 to 2018. Overall, the CAB for Lake Chaohu showed significant temporal and spatial dynamics. Temporally, the annual average CAB (total CBA within the whole lake) was increased at rate of 0.569 t Chla/y, ranging from 62.06 +/- 8.89 t Chla to 76.03 +/- 10.01 t Chla during the 19-year period. Seasonal and periodic variations in total CAB presented a bimodal annual cycle every year, the total CAB was highest in summer, followed by that in autumn, and it was the lowest in winter. The pixel-based CAB (total CAB of a unit water column), ranging from 112.42 to 166.85 mg Chla, was the highest in the western segment, especially its northern part, and was the lowest in the central parts of eastern and central segments. The sensitivity of CAB dynamics to climatic conditions was found to vary by region and time scale. Specifically, the change of pixel-based algal biomass was more sensitive to the temperature change on the monthly and annual scales, while wind speed impacted directly on the short-term spatial-temporal redistribution of algal biomass. High temperature and low wind speed could prompt the growth of total CAB for the whole lake, and the hydrodynamic situations affected by wind and so on determined the spatial details. It also indicated that Lake Chaohu may face more severe challenges with the future climatic warming. This study may serve as a reference to support algal bloom forecasting and early warning management for other large eutrophic lakes with similar problems.

TI  - Geological Characteristics and Targets of High Scientific Interest in the Zhurong Landing Region on Mars
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We used imaging, laser altimeter and thermal infrared data to map a 0.5 by 0.5 degrees area containing the landing site of the Zhurong rover of the Tianwen-1 mission. We analyzed the regional topography and thermophysical characteristics, and identified and characterized cones, impact craters, polygonal troughs, ridges and aeolian bedforms. An absolute model age of 757 66 Ma was obtained for the major unit dominating the study area, younger than previous geological mapping results. We propose several targets of high scientific interest for Zhurong and a stratigraphic model composed of five layers (from bottom to top: Noachian basement, Early Hesperian volcanic ridged plains, Vastitas Borealis Formation materials, rocky materials and loose materials). The geomorphic features identified, the proposed stratigraphy and the regional geological evolution scenario set the stage for the Zhurong rover to continue to carry out its exploration of Mars.Plain Language Summary Tianwen-1 is China's first independent Mars mission. It consists of an orbiter and a lander and a rover (Zhurong). The Zhurong rover successfully touched down on the surface of Mars on May 15, 2021. The landing site lies in southern Utopia Planitia, in the northern lowlands of Mars. We identified various geomorphologic features within an area of 0.5 by 0.5 degrees centered around the landing site of the Zhurong rover using image, elevation and temperature remote sensing data. We propose a history and geological evolution of the region to set the stage for the Zhurong rover exploration and analysis.Key PointsWe conducted detailed geological mapping of the Zhurong landing region on MarsHigh scientific interest targets for Zhurong rover including cones, pitted-wall craters, aeolian bedforms, polygons, and ridges are proposedA middle Amazonian surface age is suggested and a five-layer stratigraphic model of the Zhurong landing region is proposed

TI  - Determinizing the contributions of human activities and climate change on greening in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - China accounts for 25% of the global greening. There are temporal and spatial differences of China's greening and intrinsic driving forces. Thus, it is crucial to determinize the contributions of human activities and climate change on greening at region scale. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region (BTHR) is one of the most active areas with human activities in China. It is necessary to explore negative or positive impacts of human activities on the regional greening or browning under climate change. A time series of annual vegetation coverage from satellite data was selected to quantify regional greening in the BTHR from 2000 to 2019 and their responses to climate change and human activities. Results showed generally widespread greening over the last 20 years at an average increased rate of 0.036 decade(-1) in vegetation coverage (P<0.01). Overall warmer and wetter climate across the BTHR were positively correlated with regional greening. The positive effects of human activities on greening accounted for 48.4% of the BTHR, especially the benefits of ecological restoration projects and the agricultural activities. Increases in vegetation coverage had resulted from the combined effects of climate change and human activities. Climate change had a stronger influence on vegetation coverage than human activities. Contributions of climate change to greening and browning was about 74.1% and<20%, respectively. The decrease in vegetation coverage was mainly the results of the inhibition of human activities. More detailed socioeconomic and anthropogenic datasets are required for further analysis. Further research consideration would focus on the nonlinear responses of vegetation to climate change.

TI  - How healthcare workers respond to COVID-19: The role of vulnerability and social support in a close relationships defense mechanism
T2  - ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthcare workers play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. Based on Terror Management Theory (TMT), the present research examined whether a close relationships defense mechanism reduces anxiety among healthcare workers (N = 729) in China. Our results suggest that this defense mechanism, as indexed by relationship satisfaction, serves as an effective terror management source after exposure to reminders of death (MS; mortality salience). These findings extend TMT by identifying two moderating variables: vulnerability and social support. In a low objective vulnerability group, healthcare workers who subjectively believed themselves as less vulnerable to COVID-19 showed a stronger defense mechanism after a MS manipulation as compared to those who felt more vulnerable. Further, healthcare workers with higher levels of social support reported more relationship satisfaction. These findings have practical implications for guiding healthcare workers on how to buffer death-related anxiety and maintain their mental health in the fight against COVID-19.

TI  - A closer look on the variety and abundance of the faecal resistome of wild boar
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious problem for public and animal health, and also for the environment. Monitoring and reporting the occurrence of AMR determinants and bacteria with the potential to disseminate is a priority for health surveillance programs around the world and critical to the One Health concept. Wildlife is a reservoir of AMR, and human activities can strongly influence their resistome. The main goal of this work was to study the resistome of wild boar faecal microbiome, one of the most important game species in Europe using metagenomic and culturing approaches. The most abundant genes identified by the high-throughput qPCR array encode mobile genetic elements, including integrons, which can promote the dissemination of AMR determinants. A diverse set of genes (n = 62) conferring resistance to several classes of antibiotics (ARGs), some of them included in the WHO list of critically important antimicrobials were also detected. The most abundant ARGs confer resistance to tetracyclines and aminoglycosides. The phenotypic resistance of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were also investigated, and together supported the metagenomic results. As the wild boar is an omnivorous animal, it can be a disseminator of AMR bacteria and ARGs to livestock, humans, and the environment. This study supports that wild boar can be a key sentinel species in ecosystems surveillance and should be included in National Action Plans to fight AMR, adopting a One Health approach.

TI  - Birds of a feather: brand attachment through the lens of consumer political ideologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In today's world of heightened sociopolitical issues, consumer political ideologies may determine the nature of consumer-brand relationships. Consumers seek out self-affirming agents (e.g. friends, family and community) to bolster their beliefs, which help develop their sense of self. Increasingly, they also choose brands that fit into and support their worldview alongside other agents. Yet, little is known about the role of consumer political ideologies in shaping consumer behavior and consumer-brand relationships. This study aims to address this gap by exploring alternative political ideologies for market segmentation and brand attachment analysis. Design/methodology/approach This research uses an online survey for data collection that generated 819 usable responses. Respondents answered questions about their political orientations and then rated their attachment to 66 unique brands. This research uses cluster analysis to establish market segments using libertarian, authoritarian, conservative and liberal political ideologies, then between-group analyzes are used to determine significant differences in brand attachment. Findings Analysis reveals three clusters of consumers termed, conservative-libertarian, liberal-authoritarian and moderates. In 53% of the brands evaluated, the market segments' degree of brand attachment differed significantly. Meanwhile, moderates demonstrate an overall stronger average brand attachment than the other market segments. Research limitations/implications Findings suggest that shared political ideology provides a viable means to segment a market adding to the psychographic tools already available to brand managers. Findings also suggest that consumer political ideologies help inform brand attachment levels. Practical implications Given the ability to segment a market on political ideology, it is found that different segments demonstrate varying levels of brand attachment. In practical terms, using political ideology as a segmenting tool helps define a market segment and has a differentiable effect on attraction toward the brand. Thus, political ideology may be considered as brands position themselves and engage in corporate sociopolitical activism. Originality/value This research provides unique insights into consumer political ideology as an alternative segmentation tool and its role in understanding brand attachment.

TI  - Stream flow dynamics under current and future land cover conditions in Atsela Watershed, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to detect land cover change for the last three decades and estimate its impact on stream flow dynamics under the current and future scenarios. Landsat satellite imageries were used for land cover classification for selected years (1987, 2002 and 2017). The effect of land cover change on stream flow was evaluated using SWAT model, and its performance was tested. The findings indicated significant land cover changes in the last three decades. Coverage of cultivated land (17%) and bare land (1%) in 1987 increased rapidly to 43 and 17% in 2017. Furthermore, there was 70% agreement between observed and simulated stream flow in both the calibration and validation phases. The stream flow of the watershed was changing significantly in response to land cover dynamics. The evaluation of hydrological response due to land cover change showed a monthly mean stream flow decrease by 12.7 m(3)/s (-38%) in 1987 and 2017 in dry months. Nevertheless, it showed a monthly mean stream flow increase by 53.06 m(3)/s (23%) in wet months. Similarly, between the years 2017 and 2047, the stream flow was estimated to increase by 42.84 m(3)/s (15%) for wet months and a decrease by 13.52 m(3)/s (-66%) for dry months. Generally, it can be concluded that land cover changes have significant impact on stream flow. Hence, establishing strong land use and water resource policies is an essential means for better evaluation and monitoring of water resource in the study area.

TI  - Ultrastaging of 'negative' pelvic lymph nodes in patients with low- and intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer who developed non-vaginal recurrences
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective Evidence on micrometastases and isolated tumor cells as factors associated with non-vaginal recurrence in low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer is limited. The goal of our study was to investigate risk factors for non-vaginal recurrence in low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. Methods Records of all patients with endometrial cancer surgically managed at the Mayo Clinic before sentinel lymph node implementation (1999-2008) were reviewed. We identified all patients with endometrioid low-risk (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, grade 1 or 2 with myometrial invasion <50% and negative peritoneal cytology) or intermediate-risk (FIGO stage I, grade 1 or 2 with myometrial invasion >= 50% or grade 3 with myometrial invasion <50% and negative peritoneal cytology) endometrial cancer at definitive pathology after pelvic and para-aortic lymph node assessment. All pelvic lymph nodes of patients with non-vaginal recurrence (any recurrence excluding isolated vaginal cuff recurrences) underwent ultrastaging. Results Among 1303 women, we identified 321 patients with low-risk (n=236) or intermediate-risk (n=85) endometrial cancer (median age 65.4 years; 266 (82.9%) stage IA; 55 (17.1%) stage IB). Of the total of 321, 13 patients developed non-vaginal recurrence (Kaplan-Meier rate 4.7% by 60 months; 95% CI 2.1% to 7.2%): 11 hematogenous/peritoneal and two para-aortic and distant lymphatic. Myometrial invasion and lymphovascular space invasion were univariately associated with non-vaginal recurrence. In these patients, the original hematoxylin/eosin slides review confirmed all 646 pelvic and para-aortic removed lymph nodes as negative. The ultrastaging of 463 pelvic lymph nodes did not identify any occult metastases (prevalence 0%; 95% CI 0% to 22.8% considering 13 patients; 95% CI 0% to 0.8% considering 463 pelvic lymph nodes). Conclusion There were no occult metastases in pelvic lymph nodes of patients with low- or intermediate-risk endometrial cancer with non-vaginal recurrence. Myometrial invasion and lymphovascular space invasion appear to be associated with non-vaginal recurrence.

TI  - Temporal air quality (NO2, O-3, and PM10) changes in urban and rural stations in Catalonia during COVID-19 lockdown: an association with human mobility and satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, changes in air quality by NO2, O-3, and PM10 in Barcelona metropolitan area and other parts of Catalonia during the COVID-19 lockdown with respect to pre-lockdown and to previous years (2018 and 2019) were evaluated. Selected air monitoring stations included 3 urban (Gracia, Vall d'Hebron, and Granollers), 1 control site (Fabra Observatory), 1 semi-urban (Manlleu), and 3 rural (Begur, Bellver de Cerdanya, and Juneda). NO2 lockdown levels showed a diminution, which in relative terms was maximum in two rural stations (Bellver de Cerdanya, -63% and Begur, -61%), presumably due to lower emissions from the ceasing hotel and ski resort activities during eastern holidays. In absolute terms and from an epidemiologic perspective, decrease in NO2, also reinforced by the high amount of rainfall registered in April 2020, was more relevant in the urban stations around Barcelona. O-3 levels increased in the transited urban stations (Gracia, +42%, and Granollers, +64%) due to the lower titration effect by NOx. PM10 lockdown levels decreased, mostly in Gracia, Vall d'Hebron, and Granollers (-35, -39%, and -39%, respectively) due to traffic depletion (-90% in Barcelona's transport). Correlation among mobility index in Barcelona (-100% in retail and recreation) and contamination was positive for NO2 and PM10 and negative for O-3 (P < 0.001). Satellite images evidenced two hotspots of NO2 in Spain (Madrid and Barcelona) in April 2018 and 2019 that disappeared in 2020. Overall, the benefits of lockdown on air quality in Catalonia were evidenced with NO2, O-3, and PM(10 )levels below WHOAQG values in most of stations opposed to the excess registered in previous years.

TI  - Risk Factors of Influenza-Associated Respiratory Illnesses Reported to a Sentinel Hospital of Lahore, Pakistan: 2015-2016
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES & MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Epidemiological data about determinants of influenza A virus (IAV) in the Pakistani population is scarce. We aimed to conduct a prospective hospital-based active surveillance study from October 2015 to May 2016 to identify potential risk factors associated with IAV infection among patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). Surveillance was conducted in Lahore General Hospital, selected as a sentinel site in Lahore District, Pakistan. Nasal/throat samples were collected along with epidemiological and clinical data from enrolled patients. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed to identify IAV and its subtypes (H1N1pdm09, H3N2). Data were analyzed to determine risk factors and risk markers associated with IAV infections. A total of 311 suspected ILI and SARI cases were enrolled in the study, and among these 50 were IAV-positive. Of these 50 confirmed cases of IAV, 14 were subtyped as H1N1pdm09 and 15 were H3N2; the remaining 21 were untyped. A final multivariable model identified four independent risk factors/markers for IAV infection: exposure history to ILI patients within last 7 days and gender being male were identified as risk factors of IAV infection, while use of antibiotics prior to hospital consultation and presence of fever were identified as risk markers. We concluded that adopting nonpharmaceutical interventions like hand hygiene, masks, social distancing, and where possible, avoiding identified risk factors could decrease the risk of IAV infection and may prevent imminent outbreaks of IAV in the community.

TI  - Darkening of the Svalbard Fjords Waters Observed With Satellite Ocean Color Imagery in 1997-2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is not often discussed in the context of light availability within the water column. However, the light regimes in the Arctic Ocean are controlled by three factors that are influenced by climate changes which are the sea ice albedo feedback, glacial meltwater runoff and marine primary production. Based on a satellite data series acquired during time period 1997 - 2019, we inspected long-term changes of the three commonly used optical characteristics Chla, a(tot)(443), and K-d(490) within the Svalbard fjords and on the West Spitsbergen Shelf. We revealed evident positive trends in summer (July - September) in the Isfjorden, the Kongsfjorden, the Hornsund fjord, and the Bellsund. Moreover, between 1997 and 2019 at the majority of locations we observed a regime shift toward darker waters. We showed that light availability has changed in the Svalbard fjords since 1997, which may be a symptom of transformations in the environment that should be further investigated and monitored.

TI  - Seasonal variation in material exchange through the Bohai Strait
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal variation in material exchange through the Bohai Strait (BS) was examined using the climatological mean outputs from the Regional Ocean Modelling Systems and in-situ observations from two acoustic Doppler current profilers at two typical stations in the Strait from July 2017 to June 2018. The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was retrieved from ocean color remote sensing data. The long-term mean numerical results and the one-year observations suggest that the volume and suspended sediment flux in the BS section exhibit distinct seasonal variations. The annual mean net outflow of the suspended sediment through the BS section is estimated to be 15.8 Mt/yr in the climatological state. The observations further reveal the circulation structure, with inflow in the north and outflow in the south. Freshwater from the Yellow Sea discharged sediment into the Bohai Sea in the deep northern channel at a rate of 0.4 Mt/yr, whereas turbid water discharged sediment into the Yellow Sea in the shallow southern channel at a rate of 0.19 Mt/yr. Several factors determine the seasonal variation in the sediment flux. In the winter half-year, variation in SSC plays a dominant role, while in summer, the primary influence on sediment flux is current velocity. Moreover, SSC significantly influences the southern shallow and deep northern channels, while the current velocity is dominant in the central channel. In addition, the meridional wind displays a close relationship with the seasonal variation of the sediment exchange through the BS by dominating both the current and SSC.

TI  - Contextualizing Organizational Change Management in Africa: Incorporating the Core Values of Ubuntu
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the business models and theories available to assist organizations in adapting their strategies to today's dynamic business environment are based on the Anglo-Saxon worldview. Yet most scholars acknowledge that these theories have limited application in cultures outside of the Anglo-Saxon world. There is a dearth of research that infuses Western conceived theories of management with indigenous ontologies. To close this gap, this paper discusses managing change from an African perspective with specific reference to sub-Saharan Africa. It utilizes the philosophy Ubuntu that pervades the subcontinent as the bedrock on which change management can be anchored, asserting that embracing the Ubuntu values offers the best outcomes for managing organizations in Africa. Using Kurt Lewin's change management model, the paper shows how incorporating the indigenous ontologies based on ubuntu in its execution can lead to sustainable change management in the sub-continent.

TI  - Biomass Burning Over the United States East Coast and Western North Atlantic Ocean: Implications for Clouds and Air Quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning (BB) aerosol events were characterized over the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda over the western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO) between 2005 and 2018 using a combination of ground-based observations, satellite data, and model outputs. Days with BB influence in an atmospheric column (BB days) were identified using criteria biased toward larger fire events based on anomalously high AERONET aerosol optical depth (AOD) and MERRA-2 black carbon (BC) column density. BB days are present year-round with more in June-August (JJA) over the northern part of the East Coast, in contrast to more frequent events in March-May (MAM) over the southeast U.S. and Bermuda. BB source regions in MAM are southern Mexico and by the Yucatan, Central America, and the southeast U.S. JJA source regions are western parts of North America. Less than half of the BB days coincide with anomalously high PM2.5 levels in the surface layer, according to data from 14 IMPROVE sites over the East Coast. Profiles of aerosol extinction suggest that BB particles can be found in the boundary layer and into the upper troposphere with the potential to interact with clouds. Higher cloud drop number concentration and lower drop effective radius are observed during BB days. In addition, lower liquid water path is found during these days, especially when BB particles are present in the boundary layer. While patterns are suggestive of cloud-BB aerosol interactions over the East Coast and the WNAO, additional studies are needed for confirmation.

TI  - Validation of CHIRPS satellite-based precipitation data against the in situ observations using the Copula method: a case study of Kosar Dam basin, Iran
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study compares the daily and monthly precipitation estimates of the CHIRPS satellite data with the in situ measurements at four stations scattered over the Kosar Dam basin in southwestern Iran. The uncertainty of the satellite precipitation estimates was calculated through simulation with the Copula functions. For this purpose, 55% of the stations, daily and monthly rainfall data relative to the 1987-2012 period were used for training (simulation), and the other 45% were used for testing (validation) the performance of the Copula model. First, the daily, monthly, and annual satellite precipitation estimates were statistically compared with precipitation observed at the stations and the whole basin using the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), and Bias statistics. The computed CC between the areal average of observed and satellite precipitation estimation at the basin is 0.49, 0.82, and 0.33 for daily, monthly, and annual time scales, respectively. The difference (biases) between the satellite estimates and in situ measurements was then calculated for daily, monthly, and annual time scales over the training period. The obtained biases were subsequently fitted with the General Extreme Value distribution function coupled with the Gaussian Copula model to generate a series of similar random biases for all precipitation events. Then, the generated random biases were summed with the original satellite estimates to correct the associated biases. The bias-corrected precipitation for the training period was then compared to the original estimates of the satellite at the stations and the whole basin using the P-factor, R-factor, Bias, RMSE, and CC statistics. The statistics show that the random biases generated by the Copula method for the monthly CHIRPS satellite data relative to the 14-year training period have reduced the error rate of the satellite data by 74 to 95 percent when compared to observations. The satellite precipitation estimates of the 11-year test period were also corrected using the generated random biases in the training period. The results show that the bias correction considerably improved the monthly estimates and reduced the error rate of the satellite estimation by about 76 percent. In general, the simulation of the satellite precipitation with the Gaussian Copula model was performed satisfactorily at the monthly time scale, but it was less efficient at the daily time scale.

TI  - Downscaling MODIS spectral bands using deep learning
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS sensors are widely used in a broad range of environmental studies, many of which involve joint analysis of multiple MODIS spectral bands acquired at disparate spatial resolutions. To extract land surface information from multi-resolution MODIS spectral bands, existing studies often downscale lower resolution (LR) bands to match the higher resolution (HR) bands based on simple interpolation or more advanced statistical modeling. Statistical downscaling methods rely on the functional relationship between the LR spectral bands and HR spatial information, which may vary across different land surface types, making statistical downscaling methods less robust. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on deep learning to downscale 500 m and 1000 m spectral bands of MODIS to 250 m without additional spatial information. We employ a superresolution architecture based on an encoder decoder network. This deep learning-based method uses a custom loss function and a self-attention layer to preserve local and global spatial relationships of the predictions. We compare our approach with a statistical method specifically developed for downscaling MODIS spectral bands, an interpolation method widely used for downscaling multi-resolution spectral bands, and a deep learning superresolution architecture previously used for downscaling satellite imagery. Results show that our deep learning method outperforms on almost all spectral bands both quantitatively and qualitatively. In particular, our deep learning-based method performs very well on the thermal bands due to the larger scale difference between the input and target resolution. This study demonstrates that our proposed deep learning-based downscaling method can maintain the spatial and spectral fidelity of satellite images and contribute to the integration and enhancement of multi-resolution satellite imagery.

TI  - Zika virus infection and microcephaly: spatial analysis and socio-environmental determinants in a region of high <i>Aedes aegypti</i> infestation in the Central-West Region of Brazil
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background More than 5 years after the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, Zika infection remains a major concern in regions with high Aedes infestation. The objectives of this study were (i) to identify clusters of ZIKV infection and microcephaly, and/or central nervous system (CNS) alterations associated with congenital infection during the epidemic peak in 2016 and subsequently, in 2017 and 2018; (ii) to measure the non-spatial correlation between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection; and (iii) to analyse the sociodemographic/economic, health, and environmental determinants associated with the incidence of ZIKV in a region of high infestation by Aedes aegypti in the Central-West Region of Brazil. Methods This ecological study analysed 246 municipalities in the state of Goias (6.9 million inhabitants). The data were obtained from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (ZIKV cases) and the Public Health Event Registry (microcephaly and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection). Incidence rates and prevalence of ZIKA infection were smoothed by an empirical Bayesian estimator (LEbayes), producing the local empirical Bayesian rate (LEBR). In the spatial analysis, ZIKV infection and microcephaly cases were georeferenced by the municipality of residence for 2016 and grouped for 2017 and 2018. Global Moran's I and the Hot Spot Analysis tool (Getis-Ord Gi* statistics) were used to analyse the spatial autocorrelation and clusters of ZIKV infection and microcephaly, respectively. A generalised linear model from the Poisson family was used to assess the association between ecological determinants and the smoothing incidence rate of ZIKV infection. Results A total of 9892 cases of acute ZIKV infection and 121 cases of microcephaly were confirmed. The mean LEBR of the ZIKV infection in the 246 municipalities was 22.3 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2016, and 10.3 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2017 and 2018. The LEBR of the prevalence rate of microcephaly and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection was 7 cases/10,000 live births in 2016 and 2 cases/10,000 live births during 2017-2018. Hotspots of ZIKV infection and microcephaly cases were identified in the capital and neighbouring municipalities in 2016, with new clusters in the following years. In a multiple regression Poisson analysis, ZIKV infection was associated with higher population density, the incidence of dengue, Aedes larvae infestation index, and average rainfall. The important determinant of ZIKV infection incidence reduction was the increase in households attended by endemic disease control agents. Conclusions Our analyses were able to capture, in a more granular way, aspects that make it possible to inform public managers of the sentinel areas identified in the post-epidemic hotspots.

TI  - Serosurvey of antibodies against zoonotic pathogens in free-ranging wild canids (<i>Cerdocyon thous and Lycalopex gymnocercus</i>) from Southern Brazil
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of urbanization on natural areas is increasing contact between human populations with wild animals. Wild carnivores can act as sentinel hosts or environmental health indicators. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the exposure of two major species of wild canids from Southern Brazil to selected pathogens. For that, we live-trapped free-ranging Cerdocyon thous and Lycalopex gymnocercus in five localities and determined the frequency of animals with antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania infantum, Neospora caninum, and Leptospira spp. Among the canids sampled, 23% (12/52) (95%CI: 13-36%) had antibodies against T. gondii, with titers ranging from 64 to 512. For T. cruzi, 28% (15/52) (95%CI: 18-42%) of sampled canids were seropositive, with titers ranging from 8 to 64. Concerning the protozoan pathogen N. caninum, a total of 5% (3/52) (95%CI: 2-15%) of wild canids had antibodies against it. None of the sampled canids showed the presence of antibodies against L. infantum. On the other hand, 44% (23/52) (95%CI: 31-57%) of the wild canids showed antibodies against Leptospira spp. The set of results presented here, show that freeranging neotropical wild canids are exposed and have antibodies against to T. gondii, T. cruzi, Leptospira spp., and to a lesser degree to N. caninum. We found no evidence of L. infantum circulation among the studied populations. These results highlight some of the major pathogens which may represent risks for populations of these wild canids.

TI  - Decision Support System for Hyperspectral Remote-Sensing Data of Yellow River Estuary, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many wetland resources in the area where the Yellow River enters the sea. This area has good ecological and economic value. Therefore, wetlands are precious resources. The accuracy of traditional wetland classification methods is low (for example, based on the support machine method). In order to explore ways to improve the accuracy of wetland classification, this paper selected the wetland at the mouth of the Yellow River as the study area. And, we used the hyperspectral data of "Zhuhai No. 1" as the research data. Then, we used the logarithmic transformation method to enhance the spectral characteristics of remote-sensing images. Finally, we used Markov random field method (MRF) and support vector machine method (SVM) to finely classify the wetlands in the Yellow River estuary area. We used these experiments to explore wetland classification methods for hyperspectral data. The results showed that the settings of the coupling coefficient and the initial value in the Markov model had a greater impact on the classification results. We found that the best result was when the initial classification number is 50 and the coupling coefficient is 0.5. Compared with the SVM classification method, the overall classification accuracy of our proposed method was improved by 3.9672%, and the Kappa coefficient was improved by 0.042.

TI  - A Genetic Algorithm-Assisted Deep Neural Network Model for Merging Microwave and Infrared Daily Sea Surface Temperature Products
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important factor in the global ocean-atmosphere system, being vital in a variety of climate analyses and air-sea interaction research studies. However, estimating daily SST with both high precision and high spatial completeness remains a challenge. This article attempts to solve this problem by merging two complementary daily SST products, that is, the 25 km-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) SST and 4 km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST, using a genetic algorithm-assisted deep neural network model (GA-DNNM). The merged SST with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 1 day is achieved. Experiments in the Asia and Indo-Pacific Ocean (AIPO) region in 2005 were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method. Results showed that the spatial coverages of the original MODIS SST and AMSR-E SST are ranging from 25.0 to 48.1%, and 31.5 to 47.6%, respectively, while the merged SST achieves a spatial coverage ranging from 56.1 to 73.1%, with improvements ranging from 50.2 to 131.7% relative to the original MODIS SST. Comparisons with drifting buoy observations indicate that the merged SST is accurate, with an average bias of 0.006 degrees C and an average RMSE of 0.502 degrees C, in places where the MODIS SST data are missing before being merged in the AIPO area, and with an average bias of -0.082 degrees C, and an average RMSE of 0.603 degrees C for the merged SST in the whole study area.

TI  - The impact of lockdown on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over Central Asian countries during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the main air pollutants, formed due to both natural and anthropogenic processes, which has a significant negative impact on human health. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted countries to take various measures, including social distancing or stay-at-home orders. This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) changes in Central Asian countries. Data from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, as well as meteorological data, make it possible to assess changes in NO2 concentration in countries and major cities in the region. In particular, the obtained satellite data show a decreased tropospheric column of NO2. Its decrease during the lockdown (March 19-April 14) ranged from - 5.1% (Tajikistan) to - 11.6% (Turkmenistan). Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that limitations in anthropogenic activities have led to improvements in air quality. The possible influence of meteorology is not assessed in this study, and the implied uncertainties cannot be quantified. In this way, the level of air pollution is expected to decrease as long as partial or complete lockdown continues.

TI  - Index-based insurance and hydroclimatic risk management in agriculture: A systematic review of index selection and yield-index modelling methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - In this study we systematically reviewed the available literature on weather index insurance design between 2001 and 2020. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in ex-ante studies of index-based insurance as a financial risk management tool for agricultural risks. New and improved indices have emerged, and new methods for quantifying the yield-index relationship have been explored to minimise basis risk in contract design. Our review indicated that rainfall-followed by temperature-based indices were most prevalent, while indices based on droughts and floods, vegetation, soil moisture, humidity, and sunshine hours were underrepresented despite their demonstrated potentials. Ordinary least square-based correlation and linear regression methods dominated yield-index modelling, while methods addressing extremes such as quantile regression and copulas have increased prominence in developed countries recently. We highlighted several new research trends to guide future research studies, in particular, the use of remote sensing data and hydrological and crop modelling to address data scarcity, geographical basis risk, and climate change.

TI  - Management of patients with pulmonary mycobacteriosis in France: a multicenter retrospective cohort study
T2  - BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recent studies report very low adherence of practitioners to ATS/IDSA recommendations for the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD), as well as a great variability of practices. Type of management could impact prognosis. Methods To evaluate management and prognosis of patients with NTM-PD cases with respect to ATS recommendations, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study (18 sentinel sites distributed throughout France), over a period of six years. We collected clinical, radiological, microbiological characteristics, management and outcome of the patients (especially death or not). Results 477 patients with NTM-PD were included. Respiratory comorbidities were found in 68% of cases, tuberculosis sequelae in 31.4% of patients, and immunosuppression in 16.8% of cases. The three most common NTM species were Mycobacterium avium complex (60%), M. xenopi (20%) and M. kansasii (5.7%). Smear-positive was found in one third of NTM-PD. Nodulobronchiectatic forms were observed in 54.3% of cases, and cavitary forms in 19.1% of patients. Sixty-three percent of patients were treated, 72.4% of patients with smear-positive samples, and 57.5% of patients with smear-negative samples. Treatment was in adequacy with ATS guidelines in 73.5%. The 2-year mortality was 14.4%. In the Cox regression, treatment (HR = 0.51), age (HR = 1.02), and M. abscessus (3.19) appeared as the 3 significant independent prognostic factors. Conclusion These findings highlight the adequacy between French practices and the ATS/IDSA guidelines. Treatment was associated with a better survival.

TI  - Utility of indocyanine green as a single tracer for sentinel node biopsy in endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Our study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of sentinel lymph node biopsy using indocyanine green (ICG) for the surgical staging of early-stage endometrial cancer in comparison to technetium-99 m use. Methods We conducted an observational retrospective study with patients diagnosed of endometrial cancer and FIGO stages I-II. All participants were injected technetium-99m the day prior to the surgery and underwent lymphoscintigraphy along with single-photon emission computed tomography. In addition, all patients were administered intraoperatively ICG injection to detect sentinel lymph node biopsy. The surgical staging was then completed according to the European Society for Medical Oncology preoperative risk category. Data obtained from the analysis of technetium-99m detection was compared to ICG detection. Results A total of 53 women with endometrial cancer were included in the study, 49 (92.5%) of them showed drainage preoperatively in the single-photon emission computed tomography and/or lymphoscintigraphy. The intraoperative bilateral detection rate for technetium-99 m was 26 (49.1%) patients compared to 40 (75.5%) patients with ICG (p = 0.013). We observed a 42.5% increase in the mean number of lymph nodes retrieved by ICG compared to technetium-99m (2.85 vs 2,0 nodes; p = 0.002). We intraoperatively identified 164 lymph nodes, 104 (63.4%) located in both obturator areas and external iliac vessels. Conclusion The use of ICG for the performance of sentinel node biopsy in patients with endometrial cancer seems safe and could be superior to technetium-99 m, since it offers a higher bilateral detection rate and nodal retrieval, resulting in the possibility to perform safely less full staging lymphadenectomies.

TI  - The National Cancer Database: Survival Between Head and Neck Melanoma and Melanoma of Other Regions
T2  - OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Primary site is considered an important prognostic factor for cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM); however, opinions vary regarding its influence on survival. This study compares overall survival between head and neck melanoma (HNM) and melanoma of other regions (MOR), as well as between melanoma of the scalp and neck (MSN) and melanoma of other head regions (MOHR). Study Design Level III retrospective cohort study. Setting Patients from Commission on Cancer-accredited cancer programs affiliated to the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Methods Patients with HNM (MSN and MOHR included) and MOR, stages I to IV (n = 39,754), and their linked survival data using the NCDB were identified. Survival was analyzed using propensity score matching methods. Results After matching using propensity scores, allowing this observational study to mimic a randomized controlled trial, subjects with HNM showed a 22% increased mortality when compared to MOR (P < .01). Among those with HNM, hazard was not proportional over time. Overall, subjects with MSN in the first 3.5 years of follow-up (75% of subjects) showed a 15% increased mortality when compared to MOHR (P < .01); however, after 3.5 years, no difference in survival was noted (P = .5). Conclusion Patients with HNM showed a higher mortality when compared to MOR. The risk of death of primary sites within the head and neck varies over time, showing a higher risk of mortality for scalp and neck during the first 3.5 years of follow-up. This increased risk was not evident after the 3.5-year threshold. Further research is needed to evaluate additional patient factors or differences in treatment approaches.

TI  - Brief communication: Evaluation of the snow cover detection in the Copernicus High Resolution Snow & Ice Monitoring Service
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The High Resolution Snow & Ice Monitoring Service was launched in 2020 to provide near-real-time, pan-European snow and ice information at 20 m resolution from Sentinel-2 observations. Here we present an evaluation of the snow detection using a database of snow depth observations from 1764 stations across Europe over the hydrological year 2016-2017. We find a good agreement between both datasets with an accuracy (proportion of correct classifications) of 94 % and kappa of 0.81. More accurate (+6 % kappa) retrievals are obtained by excluding low-quality pixels at the cost of a reduced coverage (-13 % data).

TI  - Characterizing Derawan seagrass cover change with time-series Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, seagrass ecosystems are declining globally. Providing spatial information of seagrasses has become growing needs in which data from satellite remote sensing platforms are proven to be useful. While multi-temporal archives of commercial and open access imagery are available, monitoring activity is rarely done frequently, limiting the information of seagrass dynamics particularly in tropical region. Here, we utilized time-series Sentinel-2 images to map seagrass percentage cover at intra-annual basis in two years' time frame based on empirical method, while also compared maximum likelihood and random forest classifier to map dominant benthic cover type and determined seagrass spatial extent. We found that random forest classifier outperformed maximum likelihood classifier. Furthermore, a pattern of seagrass percentage cover change was present. Our results demonstrate how freely available Sentinel-2 images and limited field data could be useful in monitoring seagrasses at dense time. We anticipate this study to be a starting point for more complicated seagrass change analysis at denser time and link potential change drivers spatially. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been reported among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) globally including GBM with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HIV-negative GBM, particularly those using HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In Australia, HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment (DAA) was government-funded from 2016. Large implementation studies of PrEP also began in 2016. We examined HCV incidence among GBM to assess whether HCV incidence has changed since 2015. Methods Data were drawn from the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance. We included GBM who tested HCV antibody negative at their first test and had >= 1 subsequent test. Generalized linear modeling (Poisson distribution) was used to examine HCV incidence from 2009 to 2019 stratified by HIV status, and among HIV-negative GBM prescribed PrEP from 2016 to 2019. Results Among 6744 GBM with HIV, HCV incidence was 1.03 per 100 person-years (PY). Incidence declined by 78% in 2019 compared to 2015 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.22 [95% confidence interval {CI}: .09-.55]). Among 20 590 HIV-negative GBM, HCV incidence was 0.20/100 PY, with no significant change over time. Among 11 661 HIV-negative GBM prescribed PrEP, HCV incidence was 0.29/100 PY. Compared to 2016, incidence among GBM prescribed PrEP declined by 80% in 2019 (IRR, 0.20 [95% CI: .06-.64]). Conclusions HCV incidence among GBM living with HIV declined following DAA availability. There was no observed change in HCV incidence among HIV-negative GBM overall. Among GBM prescribed PrEP, incidence declined since the early years of PrEP implementation in Australia. Australia is on track to eliminate HCV among GBM before global 2030 targets.Since the availability of direct-acting antiviral treatment and HIV preexposure prophylaxis in Australia, hepatitis C incidence declined among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men with HIV and remained stable among those who are HIV negative.

TI  - Reciprocal circulation pattern of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses during the influenza seasons 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 in the Bavarian Influenza Sentinel (Germany)
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread around the world. The pandemic overlapped with two consecutive influenza seasons (2019/2020 and 2020/2021). This provided the opportunity to study community circulation of influenza viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in outpatients with acute respiratory infections during these two seasons within the Bavarian Influenza Sentinel (BIS) in Bavaria, Germany. From September to March, oropharyngeal swabs collected at BIS were analysed for influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In BIS 2019/2020, 1376 swabs were tested for influenza viruses. The average positive rate was 37.6%, with a maximum of over 60% (in January). The predominant influenza viruses were Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 202), Influenza A(H3N2) (n = 144) and Influenza B Victoria lineage (n = 129). In all, 610 of these BIS swabs contained sufficient material to retrospectively test for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detectable in any of these swabs. In BIS 2020/2021, 470 swabs were tested for influenza viruses and 457 for SARS-CoV-2. Only three swabs (0.6%) were positive for Influenza, while SARS-CoV-2 was found in 30 swabs (6.6%). We showed that no circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in BIS during the 2019/2020 influenza season, while virtually no influenza viruses were found in BIS 2020/2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Gift bags from the sentinel cells of the immune system: The diverse role of dendritic cell-derived extracellular vesicles
T2  - JOURNAL OF LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional APCs of the immune system that continuously sample their environment and function to stimulate an adaptive immune response by initiating Ag-specific immunity or tolerance. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), small membrane-bound structures, are released from DCs and have been discovered to harbor functional peptide-MHC complexes, T cell costimulatory molecules, and other molecules essential for Ag presentation, immune cell regulation, and stimulating immune responses. As such, DC-derived EVs are being explored as potential immunotherapeutic agents. DC-derived EVs have also been implicated to function as a trafficking mechanism of infectious particles aiding viral propagation. This review will explore the unique features that enable DC-derived EVs to regulate immune responses and interact with recipient cells, their roles within Ag-presentation and disease settings, as well as speculating on a potential immunological role of apoptotic DC-derived EVs.

TI  - NIH Tobacco Research and the Emergence of Tobacco Regulatory Science
T2  - NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction This study explores how the emergence of FDA-funded Tobacco Regulatory Science (TRS) research complements and perhaps influenced the direction of tobacco research supported by NIH. Aims and Methods New NIH- and FDA-funded tobacco projects awarded in fiscal years (FY) 2011-2020 were identified using internal NIH databases of awarded grants. Project abstracts and research aims were coded by the authors to characterize research domains and tobacco products studied. Results Between FY 2011 and 2020, NIH funded 1032 and FDA funded 322 new tobacco projects. For the years and grant activity codes studied, the number of new NIH tobacco projects declined while FDA's increased; combined the number of new projects held steady. Much of NIH research included smoking combustibles (43.7%). The most common products in FDA research were cigarettes (74.8%) and e-cigarettes/ENDS (48.1%). Most NIH (58.6%) and FDA (67.7%) projects included research on the determinants of tobacco use. Another area of apparent overlap was health effects (29.5% NIH and 30.1% FDA). Projects unique to NIH included treatment interventions (33.3%), disease pathology/progression (17.8%) and neurobiology (18.9%). A minority of both NIH and FDA projects included populations particularly vulnerable to tobacco product use. Conclusions In total, support for new tobacco research supported by NIH and FDA combined remained steady for the time period covered, though there was a concomitant decline in NIH tobacco projects with the increase in FDA-funded TRS projects for the activity codes studied. Despite the apparent overlap in some areas, both NIH and FDA support research that is unique to their respective missions. Implications NIH continues to support tobacco research that falls within and outside of FDA's regulatory authorities. This research still is needed not only to bolster the evidence base for regulatory decisions at the national and state levels, but also to advance a comprehensive scientific agenda that can inform multiple levels of influence on tobacco control, use and addiction. It will be important to continue monitoring FDA-funded TRS and NIH-funded tobacco research portfolios to ensure that the level of support for and focus of the research is sufficient to address the burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Effectiveness of SPECT/CT Imaging for Sentinel Node Biopsy Staging of Primary Cutaneous Melanoma and Patient Outcomes
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Coregistered SPECT/CT can improve accuracy of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for staging melanoma. This benefit has implications for pathology services and surgical practice with increased diagnostic and surgical workload. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of SPECT/CT imaging. Methods SNB data were collected over a 10-year period. Preoperative SLN mapping was performed by using planar lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) for all patients (n = 1522) and after October 2015, patients underwent a second co-registered SPECT/CT scan (n = 559). The patients were stratified according to the imaging protocol. The number of nodes and nodal basins were assessed. The reasons for cancellation also were assessed. Results A total of 95% (1446/1522) of patients underwent a successful SNB procedure. Significantly more sentinel nodes were identified by the SPECT/CT protocol (3 vs. 2; p < 0.0001). More patients were cancelled in the SPECT/CT cohort (9.3% vs. 2.5%; p < 0.0001). Head & neck, lower limb, and AJCC IB primaries were significantly less likely to proceed to SNB. SPECT/CT identified significantly more positive SNBs (20.9% vs. 16.5%; p = 0.038). SPECT/CT imaging was associated with improved disease-free (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-1.0); p = 0.048) and disease-specific survival (HR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.3-0.78; p = 0.003). Patients who did not proceed to SNB had a significantly increased nodal relapse rate (23.5% vs. 6.8%; HR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.9-6.2; p < 0.0001) compared with those who underwent SNB. Conclusions This large cohort study confirms the increased accuracy of SPECT/CT for identifying SLN metastases, which would appear to have a significant therapeutic benefit, although an increased risk of cancellation of the SNB procedure on the day of surgery.

TI  - Multi-station calibration strategy for evaluation and sensitivity analysis of the snowmelt runoff model using MODIS satellite images
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the snowmelt runoff model (SRM) was employed to estimate the effect of snow on the surface flow of Aji-Chay basin, northwest Iran. Two calibration techniques were adopted to enhance the calibration. The multi-station calibration (MSC) and single-station calibration (SSC) strategies applied to investigate their effects on the modeling accuracy. The runoff coefficients ( c (s) and c (r) ) were selected as calibration parameters because of their uncertainty in such an extended basin. To determine the most substantial input of the model which is the snow-covered area (SCA) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor imagery, MOD10A2 images were collected with spatial and temporal resolutions of 500 meters and 8 days, respectively. The results show an average of 15% improvement in the model performance in the MSC strategy from the data period of 2008-2012. Also, an appropriate agreement with physical characteristics of the study area could be seen for the calibration parameters. The contribution of snowmelt in the river flow reaches its peak in April and May, then with increasing temperature, the contribution decreased gradually. Furthermore, analysis of parameters indicates that the SRM is sensitive to recession coefficient and runoff coefficients.

TI  - The "ideal" spectrograph for atmospheric observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectroscopy of scattered sunlight in the near-UV to near-IR spectral ranges has proven to be an extremely useful tool for the analysis of atmospheric trace gas distributions. A central parameter for the achievable sensitivity and spatial resolution of spectroscopic instruments is the etendue (product of aperture angle and entrance area) of the spectrograph, which is at the heart of the instrument. The etendue of an instrument can be enhanced by (1) upscaling all instrument dimensions or (2) by changing the instrument F number, (3) by increasing the entrance area, or (4) by operating many instruments (of identical design) in parallel. The etendue can be enhanced by (in principle) arbitrary factors by options (1) and (4); the effect of options (2) and (3) is limited.We present some new ideas and considerations of how instruments for the spectroscopic determination of atmospheric gases could be optimized using new possibilities in spectrograph design and manufacturing. Particular emphasis is on arrays of massively parallel instruments for observations using scattered sunlight. Such arrays can reduce size and weight of instruments by orders of magnitude while preserving spectral resolution and light throughput. We also discuss the optimal size of individual spectrographs in a spectrograph array and give examples of spectrograph systems for use on a (low Earth orbit) satellite, including one with sub-kilometre ground pixel size.

TI  - The role of sentinel lymph node mapping in colon cancer: detection of micro-metastasis, effect on survival, and driver of a paradigm shift in extent of colon resection
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Unlike in breast cancer and melanoma, sentinel lymph node mapping in colon cancer is primarily used as an aid to the pathologist for accurate nodal staging. The study was undertaken to review the incidence of micro-metastasis and its impact on survival when treated with chemotherapy. The study was also undertaken to see if SLNM could guide limited colon resection in early T stage tumor as a paradigm shift. SLNM was done by subserosal injection of a blue dye. SLNs were ultra-staged by multilevel sectioning and remaining Specimen was then examined by conventional method. For the last 245 patients the specimen was divied ex vivo into two segments as segment A containing the tumor bearing portion of the colon and SLNs with attached mesentery, while segment B include distal part of the colon with attached mesentery. Nodal staging was separately examined. Of the 354 Pts, SLNM was successful in 99.9% of Pts with an average no of SLN/ Pt = 2.8 and total nodes 17.8/pt. Survival was directly related negatively with stage and nodal status. Pts with +ve LN did much better with chemotherapy than without chemotherapy. With 245 Pts, specimen A Vs B, no Pts had +ve node in specimen B with -ve LN in specimen A. SLNM results in more node/Pt, more positive node/Pt ,and more micro-metastasis who when treated with chemotherapy survive longer. Limited segmental resection in early T stage is possible when done with guidance by SLNM without compromising biology.

TI  - On the use of spherical harmonic series inside the minimum Brillouin sphere: Theoretical review and evaluation by GRAIL and LOLA satellite data
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Spherical harmonic expansions are the most popular parametrisation of the gravitational potential and its higher-order spatial derivatives in global geodetic, geophysical, and planetary science applications. The convergence domain of external spherical harmonic expansions is the space above the minimum Brillouin sphere, nevertheless, these series are commonly employed inside this bounding surface without correcting. Justification of this procedure has been debated for several decades, but conclusions among scholars are indefinite and even contradictory.In this article, we discuss the use of spherical harmonic expansion for the gravitational field modelling inside the minimum Brillouin sphere. In the theoretical part, we systematically summarise the mathematical apparatus of internal and external spherical harmonic series for the gravitational potential, gravitational gradient components, and second-order gravitational tensor components. We also derive analytical downward continuation errors for these quantities in the spectral form. In the experimental part, we evaluate the internal and external spherical harmonic series inside the minimum Brillouin sphere by employing the most recent LOLA topographic and GRAIL gravitational observations of the Moon. We first analyse line-of-sight gravitational accelerations from GRAIL and their forward-modelled counterparts. We next examine seven GRAIL-derived and four forward-modelled global gravitational field models. We further investigate in detail spectral and spatial (signal/error) characteristics from two forward-modelled global gravitational fields - one using the internal and the other employing the external spherical harmonic parametrisation.Notable findings of this study are: (1) GRAIL measurements taken at low altitudes, below the minimum Brillouin sphere, provide the observational evidence of the divergence in the existing spherical harmonic solutions of the global gravitational field models. (2) Power laws applied at high-frequencies of GRAIL-derived global gravitational field models are too strong. (3) Signal powers of the respective orthogonal components of the gravitational gradient and those of the second-order gravitational tensor are identical above the minimum Brillouin sphere, but may be different inside this bounding surface. (4) Analytical downward continuation of the external spherical harmonic series provides an inhomogeneous gravitational potential spectrum. (5) Vertical-vertical component of the second-order gravitational tensor inside the minimum Brillouin sphere depends on the density and may significantly differ from its equivalent neglecting the density.Most importantly, we unambiguously confirm that all lunar global gravitational field models based on the external spherical harmonic parametrisation do not correspond to the true counterpart inside the minimum Brillouin sphere. Also, analytically downward continued fields tend to diverge at high frequencies. Therefore, the present gravitational field models of the Moon using external spherical harmonic series must be applied only above the minimum Brillouin sphere (10.2 km above the mean lunar sphere).The theoretical part represents a rigorous methodological basis for the gravitational field modelling by the internal and external spherical harmonic series. This theory is complete up to the second-order gravitational tensor and holds for any planetary body. The experimental part reveals intricate aspects for the lunar gravitational field. Except for the Moon, however, these practicalities will have substantial implications on future gravitational field determinations of other planetary bodies.

TI  - The changing face of AU Mic b: stellar spots, spin-orbit commensurability, and transit timing variations as seen by CHEOPS and TESS
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - AU Mic is a young planetary system with a resolved debris disc showing signs of planet formation and two transiting warm Neptunes near mean-motion resonances. Here we analyse three transits of AU Mic b observed with the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), supplemented with sector 1 and 27 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry, and the All-Sky Automated Survey from the ground. The refined orbital period of AU Mic b is 8.462995 +/- 0.000003 d, whereas the stellar rotational period is P-rot = 4.8367 +/- 0.0006 d. The two periods indicate a 7:4 spin-orbit commensurability at a precision of 0.1%. Therefore, all transits are observed in front of one of the four possible stellar central longitudes. This is strongly supported by the observation that the same complex star-spot pattern is seen in the second and third CHEOPS visits that were separated by four orbits (and seven stellar rotations). Using a bootstrap analysis we find that flares and star spots reduce the accuracy of transit parameters by up to 10% in the planet-to-star radius ratio and the accuracy on transit time by 3-4 min. Nevertheless, occulted stellar spot features independently confirm the presence of transit timing variations (TTVs) with an amplitude of at least 4 min. We find that the outer companion, AU Mic c, may cause the observed TTVs.

TI  - Channel morphology and prediction of mid-line channel migration in the reach of Ganga River using GIS and ARIMA modeling during 1975-2020
T2  - H2OPEN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic nature of meandering poses several challenges in a river. The river Ganga shows severe bank erosion in many of its stretches which creates insecurity to the habitats. In the present study, channel morphology and lateral mid-line migration for 1975 to 2020 in 5 years intervals have been studied. The prediction of lateral mid-line migration from 2020 to 2050 by using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images was made by using the ARIMA model. The river reach was divided into 8 bends and 48 cross-sections were identified. The channel length was observed as 224.35 km in 1975 which reduces to 199.96 km in 2020. A decreasing trend was observed for the mean of channel length and meander ratio, and an increasing trend was noted in the mean of sinuosity ratio and tortuosity ratio. A total of 11 cross-sections showed the rightward shifting and 36 cross-sections showed the leftward shifting. Observed and predicted values showed a good R-2 value of 0.90 and 0.89 at CS-24 and CS-25, respectively. The results may be used for planning and management of various river training work and understanding the river system dynamics.

TI  - Substantial Reduction in Particulate Matter Air Pollution across Europe during 2006-2019: A Spatiotemporal Modeling Analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution poses the largest environmental health risk in Europe. Particulate matter (PM) concentrations are the most harmful pollutants representing the main air quality indicator in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The air quality surveillance in Europe is based on a monitoring network that is too coarse for a comprehensive evaluation of the air pollution burden. We link raw pollutant data with remotely sensed products using Bayesian geostatistical models and for the first time estimate pan-European near-surface concentrations of both fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particles at 1 km(2) spatial resolution during 2006-2019. We evaluate the compliance with the air quality thresholds set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) and assess country-wise trends. The results show that during the last 14 years, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations declined by 36.5% (95% credible interval: 30.3, 41.9%) and 39.1% (26.6, 50.5%), respectively. The number of people exposed to PM10 levels above the WHO thresholds decreased from 78.3% (52.6, 91.8%) in 2006 to 28.4% (16.2, 43.7%) in 2019; for PM2.5, the decrease was smaller: from 91.0% (61.3, 99.1%) exposed in 2006 to 53.6% (33.5, 76.3%) in 2019. Although there is a clear improvement in the overall picture, stricter measures are needed to ensure compliance with the WHO guidelines.

TI  - Dust source susceptibility mapping in Tigris and Euphrates basin using remotely sensed imagery
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to develop an applicable, robust, and generalizable approach building on the integration of machine learning classifiers into dust source susceptibility mapping. Five machine learning classifiers were used for this purpose, including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Network. The study area includes the Tigris-Euphrates river basin, considered one of the world's largest active dust sources during the last two decades. A total of 411 active dust sources (i.e. hotspots) were identified as ground truth via visual interpretation of sub-daily MODIS-Terra/Aqua time-series imagery from 2000 to 2020 and then used to train and validate the classifiers. The main environmental drivers of dust formation were incorporated based on remote sensing data/products, including Tasseled Cap components, Soil Crust Index, Modified Fournier Index, and the Sentinel-5 Absorbing Aerosol Index. Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory was used to merge the results from all classifiers to obtain an accurate susceptible dust sources map of the region. Each of the five classifiers and the final integrated D-S model were assessed using the ROC curve, AUC, and Calibration Plot. The mean prediction accuracy of all five classifiers was 87.7% and 86.3% for dust sources susceptible and non-susceptible classes, respectively. The D-S increased the classification accuracy in susceptible and non-susceptible classes by 7.5% and 12.6%, respectively. Finally, the wind erosion thresholds, as a limiting environmental factor in the emission of dust, were applied over the D-S-based susceptible dust sources map to measure the degree of susceptibility in the identified dust sources.

TI  - Blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer: Are we ready for reflex testing in men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen?
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: There is no consensus on the role of biomarkers in determining the utility of prostate biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA). There are numerous biomarkers such as prostate health index, 4Kscore, prostate cancer antigen 3, ExoDX, SelectMDx, and Mi-Prostate Score that may be useful in this decision-making process. However, it is unclear whether any of these tests are accurate and cost-effective enough to warrant being a widespread reflex test following an elevated PSA. Our goal was to report on the clinical utility of these blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer screening.Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies published between January 2000 and October 2020 to report the available parameters and cost-effectiveness of the aforementioned diagnostic tests. We focus on the negative predictive value, the area under the curve, and the decision curve analysis in comparing reflexive tests due to their relevance in evaluating diagnostic screening tests.Results: Overall, the biomarkers are roughly equivalent in predictive accuracy. Each test has additional clinical utility to the current diagnostic standard of care, but the added benefit is not substantial to justify using the test reflexively after an elevated PSA.Conclusions: Our findings suggest these biomarkers should not be used in binary fashion and should be understood in the context of pre-existing risk predictors, patient's ethnicity, cost of the test, patient life-expectancy, and patient goals. There are more recent diagnostic tools such as multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, polygenic single-nucleotide panels, IsoPSA, and miR Sentinel tests that are promising in the realm of prostate cancer screening and need to be investigated further to be considered a consensus reflexive test in the setting of prostate cancer screening.

TI  - Comparison of Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Light Use Efficiency Models for Gross Primary Productivity Estimation on Three Mid-latitude Grassland Sites in North America
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a novel technique for gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation, which has great potential to track seasonal and inter-annual changes in GPP in different ecosystems. Currently, the key problem is the scale mismatch between traditional coarse-resolution SIF measurements and the GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers. Using SIF data acquired by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) of three grassland sites in Kansas, Minnesota, and Arizona in USA, the relationship between the SIF and GPP was analyzed in detail on the basis of the different SIF bands, timescales, observation modes, and viewing zenith angles (VZAs). According to the results, the OCO-2 SIF and GPP had a strong positive correlation. Furthermore, SIF757 was more highly correlated with GPP than SIF771 was, and the correlation at the daily scale was higher than the correlation at the instantaneous (overpass) scale. The different VZAs had a strong impact on the correlation between SIF and GPP, especially when the zenith angle was greater than 40 degrees. Compared to the vegetation index, SIF can more efficiently track the absorbed light during vegetation photosynthesis and represent the impact of environmental stress on the grassland GPP. Finally, the tower GPP (GPP_EC) was used to validate the estimated GPP produced by the SIF757, vegetation index model (VI), and vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). The results showed that the estimated GPP produced by SIF757 had the highest accuracy, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.845 and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 1.58 g C m (-2) day (-1), which illustrates that the data product of the OCO-2 SIF has great potential for estimating the grassland ecosystem GPP.

TI  - Devil Is Fine, Devil Is Kind: Slave Spirituals, Satanic Black Metal, and Cultural Appropriation in the Music of Zeal & Ardour
T2  - COMPARATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the relationship between cultural appropriation, musical protest, and African American history, as foregrounded in the music of avant-garde metal band Zeal & Ardour. Under the leadership of mixed-race Swiss-American multi-instrumentalist Manuel Gagneux, the band gained prominence in 2016 for combining the influences of Satanism and Scandinavian black metal with African American spirituals and blues. Such a combination has allowed Zeal & Ardour to creatively engage the violence of African American historical experience and sonically and conceptually explore the possibilities of an alternative account of African American experience under the influence of individualism and self-determination as promoted in Satanic philosophies. This proposition becomes complicated, however, when the Satanic worldview espoused in Scandinavian black metal articulates not only an aggressive critique of Christianity, but also, in a number of instances, the promotion of white supremacist and national socialist worldviews. The resultant combination of these clashing influences is a complex interlinking of musical traditions and ideological positions through which Zeal & Ardour explores cultural appropriation as a form of protest, and ultimately embraces jarring juxtapositions and messy fusion as a necessary mode of artistic expression amid the racial tensions and culture wars of the early twenty-first century.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Rice Fields: Towards Assessing Water Saving Irrigation Management Practices
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice cultivation is one of the largest users of the world's freshwater resources. The contribution of remote sensing observations for identifying the conditions under which rice is cultivated, particularly throughout the growing season, can be instrumental for water, and crop management. Data from different remote sensing platforms are being used in agriculture, namely to detecting anomalies in crops. This is attempted by calculating vegetation indices (VI) that are based on different vegetation reflectance bands, especially those that rely on the Red, Green, and near-infrared bands, such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Green Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI). However, particular features of different crops and growing conditions justify that some indices are more adequate than others on a case-to-case basis, according to the different vegetation's spectral signatures. In recent years, a vegetation index related to the Red Edge reflectance band, the Normalised Difference Red Edge (NDRE) has shown potential to be used as a tool to support agricultural management practices; this edge band, by taking a transition position, is very sensitive to changes in vegetation properties. This work, focusing on the rice crop and the application of different irrigation practices, explores the capability of several VIs calculated from different reflectance bands to detect variability, at the plot scale, in rice cultivation in the Lower Mondego region (Portugal). The remote sensing data were obtained from satellite Sentinel-2A imagery and using a multispectral camera mounted on an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS). By comparing several vegetation indices, we found that NDRE is particularly useful for identifying non-homogeneities in irrigation and crop growth in rice fields. Since few satellite sensors are sensible in the Red Edge band and none has the spatial resolution offered by UAS, this study explores the potential of UAS to be used as a useful support information tool in rice farming and precision agriculture, regarding irrigation, and agronomic management.

TI  - Field scale spatial wheat yield forecasting system under limited field data availability by integrating crop simulation model with weather forecast and satellite remote sensing
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: An accurate crop yield forecast with sufficient lead time is critical for various applications, such as crop management, resources mobilization, agri-commodity trading, crop insurance, etc. Accurate yield fore-casting well ahead of harvest at field scale with minimal field input data remains a challenge.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a novel prototype wheat yield forecasting system by assimilating remote sensing (RS) derived crop parameters and weather forecast into InfoCrop-Wheat crop simulation model (CSM), using minimum field measurements.METHODS: The CSM was calibrated and validated at both research farm and farmers' fields. The crop LAI was retrieved through inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model from Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 images and validated using in-situ LAI measurements. The CSM was modified to test assimilation of RS derived LAI through "Ensemble Kalman Filtering" (EnKF) and "Forcing" strategies at multiple time-steps. The RS derived LAI was not only used to correct/replace model simulated LAI but other model state variables were also adjusted accordingly. A major challenge of adjusting crop phenology based on RS derived LAI was also attempted. The WRF weather forecast was bias-corrected and incorporated into the modified model-LAI assimilation framework. Generic crop management inputs were specified to the model. Finally, the study demonstrated a workable prototype of a field scale wheat growth and yield forecasting system under limited field data availability.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The inversion of PROSAIL showed an RMSE of 0.56 m(2)/m(2) in LAI retrievals. Model validation with measured inputs showed normalized error (NE) of 6--8% in grain yield. The proposed framework showed only 2%, 5%, 3% and 1% higher NE in simulating days to anthesis, days to physiological maturity, dry matter and grain yield, respectively, than with measured inputs. The "EnkF" outperformed "Forcing" for predicting crop yield as well as phenology and growth of wheat using generic management inputs. The system showed acceptable accuracy in forecasting phenology, dry matter and yield of wheat at field scale when weighted adaptive bias-correction of weather forecast was incorporated with a 15 days lead time.SIGNIFICANCE: The prototype can be scaled-up for wheat and other crops for predicting real-time crop condition and yield losses at farmers' field for a range of applications, notably, crop-insurance, resources allocation, targeted agro-advisories and triggering contingency plans. It offers considerable potential for objective assessment of crops in the marginal and smallholder systems supporting the smart farming paradigm.

TI  - Vietnam's growing agency in the twenty-first century
T2  - PACIFIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The world is witnessing a dual process of power shift from West to East and power diffusion from the major states to the lower layers of the global power structure. However, inadequate scholarly endeavour is devoted to exploring the foreign policy thinking and practices of weaker states amid these dynamics. This paper analyses the changing patterns of Vietnam's post-Cold War worldview, its engagement with the regional security order, particularly its current threat perception and strategic response to regional challenges such as China's rise and the South China Sea disputes. It will trace how Vietnam, previously perceived as a small to medium country, has increased its agency in the twenty first century to the extent that an emerging middle power can maneuver in a multifaceted and fluid world. It argues from the case of Vietnam that weaker states are not merely dictated by structural developments but may now have greater agency in contributing to shaping regional or world orders. Such investigation will help enrich both the existing Western-dominated and structure-oriented accounts on small and middle powers.

TI  - Using inpatient electronic medical records to study influenza for pandemic preparedness
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We assessed the ability to identify key data relevant to influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance in a large-scale US-based hospital electronic medical record (EMR) dataset using seasonal influenza as a use case. We describe characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized influenza cases across three seasons. Methods We identified patients with an influenza diagnosis between March 2017 and March 2020 in 140 US hospitals as part of the US FDA's Sentinel System. We calculated descriptive statistics on the presence of high-risk conditions, influenza antiviral administrations, and severity endpoints. Results Among 5.1 million hospitalizations, we identified 29,520 hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis; 64% were treated with an influenza antiviral within 2 days of admission, and 25% were treated >2 days after admission. Patients treated >2 days after admission had more comorbidities than patients treated within 2 days of admission. Patients never treated during hospitalization had more documentation of cardiovascular and other diseases than treated patients. We observed more severe endpoints in patients never treated (death = 3%, mechanical ventilation [MV] = 9%, intensive care unit [ICU] = 26%) or patients treated >2 days after admission (death = 2%, MV = 14%, ICU = 32%) than in patients treated earlier (treated on admission: death = 1%, MV = 5%, ICU = 23%, treated within 2 days of admission: death = 1%, MV = 7%, ICU = 27%). Conclusions We identified important trends in influenza severity related to treatment timing in a large inpatient dataset, laying the groundwork for the use of this and other inpatient EMR data for influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance.

TI  - Modeling relationship between land surface temperature anomaly and environmental factors using GEE and Giovanni
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover changes are two indicators of landscapes in a region. The relationship between LST anomalies, elevation, vegetation, and urban growth is significant to conservation. This study addresses this issue using night-time satellite imagery, kernel methods (points aggregation), and the trend analysis for a long-term period (2001-2017) in Iran. Variables for two seasons (summer and winter) in urban and natural land uses were derived using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and NASA's Giovanni. Point data derived from raster maps were quantified using statistical kernel and trend analysis. As result, it was observed that LST rise in various elevations, seasons, and land uses. The LST was analyzed through kernels (point aggregation in scatter graphs), which shifted to the right. The LST anomaly in the daytime had the highest maximum value (> 4 degrees C) and lowest minimum value (<-5 degrees C) in forests and mountains and metropolises with the highest population growth rate. Summer and winter seasons had positive trends in LST for forest and mountain land uses. All seasons had positive trends in EVI in the mountain, and desert land uses. This warming and increasing LST can increase vulnerability to drought, dust storms, floods, avalanches, and natural fires. The EVI is increasing over the years due to government projects in green spaces and urban parks. There is a need to protect urban and natural environments to prevent natural disasters and unplanned population growth.

TI  - Spatial trends of surface urban heat island in Bathinda: a semiarid city of northwestern India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising global temperature coupled with the urban heat island has considerable adverse impacts on urban inhabitants and ecological integrity. An attempt has been made in the present study to monitor the surface urban heat island effect for the Bathinda District of Punjab, India. The surface urban heat island effect was monitored for the period of 5 years (2015-2019) using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data. The surface temperature distribution pattern was investigated by spatial extension and statistical analysis of land surface temperature dataset. The spatial autocorrelation among the data was analyzed using Moran's Index and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics. Besides, the impact of land use land cover on land surface temperature was examined using correlation, covariance and multivariate analysis between land surface temperature and spectral indices. The results revealed that the vegetated and water surfaces accounted for low surface temperature (19.98-30.45 degrees C), while built-up areas with high temperature (26.47-44.01 degrees C) had amplified the heat island effect. The spatial autocorrelation with Moran's Index (above 0.5) confirmed the spatial clustering with low p values (< 0.001) and high z values (> 2.58). Further, the hot spot analysis validated that the higher-temperature pixels lie in urban areas with dense infrastructure, while vegetated areas exhibit clusters with low-temperature values. Hence, the study inferred the occurrence of surface urban heat island with the urban heat island index of 0.7-1 for the urban cluster. The correlation between spectral indices and land surface temperature urges the need of adequate urban planning with vital urban greening, in order to achieve the urban sustainable development goals.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Risk factors of recurrence and distant metastasis in primary cutaneous melanoma in Taiwan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Risk factors of recurrence and distant metastasis of acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) are of great interest for the high percentage of ALM in cutaneous melanoma in Asian populations. This single-center retrospective cohort including 177 patients with localized melanoma diagnosed from 2004 to 2020 aims to identify adverse predictors in cutaneous melanoma in Taiwan, with a focus on ALM. The relationship between clinicopathological features and outcomes, including incidences of recurrence and distant metastasis in 5 years from diagnosis, was analyzed. This study included 124 patients (70.1%) with ALM and 53 (29.9%) with non-ALM melanoma. Regarding clinicopathological characteristics, ALM patients were diagnosed at an older age and received sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBs) more often, while adjacent melanocytic nevi were more prevalent in non-ALM patients. With respect to prognostic implications of clinicopathological features, in ALM, implementation of SLNB was associated with a lower 5-year distant metastasis rate. Thickness of melanoma lesions over 4 mm, ulceration, and neurotropism, were related to both higher 5-year recurrence and distant metastasis rates. With regard to non-ALM patients, diagnoses made at or over 65 years old was linked to a higher 5-year recurrence rate, whereas ulceration was associated with both higher 5-year recurrence and distant metastasis rates. In conclusion, several clinicopathological characteristics have been identified to be associated with poor prognosis of cutaneous melanoma, especially ALM.

TI  - Eco-Economic Environment Coupling Based on Urban RSEI Theory
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Ecological environment is the foundation of social and economic development, and the coordinated development of social economy and ecological environment is one of the hotspots in urban sustainable development research. Traditional ecological economic measurement methods usually have problems such as difficulty in data acquisition and difficulty in pasteurization. In recent years, with the rise of global remote sensing technology, remote sensing has also been used to observe human social and economic activities. Remote sensing data have been created for the limitations of traditional statistical data with the advantages of being independent in the field of ecological and economic measurement. Methodology. This paper uses luminous remote sensing technique to obtain the visible-near-infrared electromagnetic wave information emitted from the surface at night under cloudless conditions and MODIS data combined with urban RSEI theory to quantitatively invert the ecological environment quality of the study area in 2019 based on a remote sensing perspective, taking a certain urban agglomeration in China as the research area. And it is continuous in time and space. Therefore, the coordination degree of remote sensing data should be fully explored in quantitative research. For proper analysis, regression was used. Research Content and Results. 2019 MODIS data were used to retrieve the six vegetation-related ecological environment factors in the study area and combine the urban RSEI theory to construct the remote sensing ecological comprehensive index of the study area, and the vegetation ecological environment quality and spatial agglomeration characteristics were evaluated. The results showed that vegetation coverage, leaf area index, total primary productivity, and surface moisture make positive contributions to the ecosystem of the study area. Based on the theoretical basis of coupling coordination theory, ecological economic theory, and sustainable development, we measured the degree of coordinated development between the social economic system and the ecological environment system in the study area from 2018 to the future period and combined the research results with the study area. The actual situation explores the practice path of benign coupling of the ecological economy. Conclusion. This paper is completely based on the research ideas of remote sensing data to measure the socioeconomic level and ecological environment quality and proves that remote sensing data and urban RESI theory are efficient and reliable new tools for the coordinated development of ecological economics. The research results can provide a development plan for urban agglomeration.

TI  - Hourly Mapping of the Layer Height of Thick Smoke Plumes Over the Western US in 2020 Severe Fire Season
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of huge smoke plume events from the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history has occurred in 2020. Here, a research algorithm was modified to retrieve the aerosol optical centroid height (AOCH) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) measurements. The research focus is to gain insights of the algorithm's feasibility in heavy smoke conditions to study the diurnal variation of AOCH; this is only made possible via EPIC due to its unique position at Lagrange-1 point and its equipment of O2 B-band at which the vegetated surface reflectance is low. Vicarious calibration is applied to the EPIC 443, 680 and 688 nm channels based on the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observation. This new calibration leads to a better agreement of AOCH values between EPIC retrievals and the counterparts derived from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol extinction vertical profile. The hourly variation of AOCH up to 0.45 km on September 7 is shown to have important implications for estimating hourly change of surface PM2.5, although more quantitative studies are needed in the future.

TI  - FY-3A/MERSI precipitable water vapor reconstruction and calibration using multi-source observation data based on a generalized regression neural network
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a key element in the water and energy transfer between the surface and the atmosphere, especially in the Three-River Headwaters (TRH), which exhibits sensitive climate and hydrology. To overcome the limitations of missing data and poor accuracy of the moderate resolution spectral imager (MERSI) on-board the second-generation polar-orbiting satellite FengYun-3A (FY-3A) in the TRH region, a model for FY3A/MERSI PWV reconstruction, based on generalized regression neural network (GRNN) using meteorological factors, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM), is established, and then, a method for daily systematic error of MERSI PWV calibrating based on global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-derived PWV is proposed. The root mean square (RMS), standard deviation (Std), and bias values of the reconstructed PWV are 0.57, 0.52, and 0.02 mm compared with the original MERSI PWV. The RMS, Std and bias of the calibrated MERSI PWV are 2.42, 1.92 and 0.14 mm compared with GNSS-derived PWV, and the correlation coefficient between MERSI and GNSS-derived PWV is improved from 0.78 to 0.95, which is satisfactory. Compared with the original MERSI PWV, the proposed reconstruction and calibration model can fill the missing data and effectively improve the accuracy of the MERSI PWV products. The proposed method can provide a basic PWV data ensuring for hydrological and ecological research in the TRH region.

TI  - Detecting the Great Pacific Garbage Patch floating plastic litter using WorldView-3 satellite imagery
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a direct and proxy-based approach to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively observe floating plastic litter in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) based on a survey in 2018 using very high geo-spatial resolution 8-waveband WorldView-3 imagery. A proxy for the plastics was defined as a waveband difference for anomalies in the top-of-the-atmosphere spectra. The anomalies were computed by subtracting spatially varying reflectance of the surrounding ocean water as background from the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance. Spectral shapes and magnitude were also evaluated using a reference target of known plastics, The Ocean Cleanup System 001 Wilson. Presence of 'suspected plastics' was confirmed by the similarity in derived anomalies and spectral shapes with respect to the known plastics in the image as well as direct observations in the true color composites. The proposed proxy-based approach is a step towards future mapping techniques of suspected floating plastics with potential operational monitoring applications from the Sentinel-2 that recently started regular imaging over the GPGP that will be supported or validated by numerical solutions and net trawling survey.

TI  - Association Between Local Anesthetic Dosing, Postoperative Opioid Requirement, and Pain Scores After Lumpectomy and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy with Multimodal Analgesia
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Multimodal analgesia (MMA) during breast surgery reduces postoperative pain and opioid requirements, but the relative contribution of local anesthetic dosing as a component of MMA is not well defined among patients undergoing lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Patients and Methods We identified consecutive patients who underwent lumpectomy and SLNB with MMA from 1/2019 to 4/2020. Univariable and multivariable linear and logistic regression were used to examine associations between local anesthetics, opioid requirements in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and pain scores in the PACU and on postoperative day (POD) 1. Results In total, 1603 patients [median tumor size, 14 mm (interquartile range 8-20 mm)] were included. The median PACU opioid requirement was 0 morphine milligram equivalents (interquartile range 0-5). PACU maximum pain was none or mild in 58% of patients and moderate to severe in 42%; among 420 survey respondents, 56% reported no or mild pain and 44% reported moderate to severe pain on POD 1. On multivariable analysis that adjusted for routine components of MMA, increasing doses of 0.5% bupivacaine were associated with reduced PACU opioid requirements (beta -0.04, 95% confidence interval -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.011) and lower odds of moderate to severe pain (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.97-0.99, p < 0.001). Local anesthetics were not associated with pain scores on POD 1. Conclusions Higher amounts of local anesthetics reduce acute postoperative pain and opioid requirement after lumpectomy and SLNB. Maximizing dosing within weight-based limits is a low-risk, cost-effective pain control strategy that can be used in diverse practice settings.

TI  - 25 years of multiple stressors driving the coral-algae phase shift in Akumal, Mexico
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interactions between multiple stressors (climate change, pollution, and overfishing) can erode ecological thresholds and trigger a phase shift from a coral-dominated reef state to less desired benthic states. Akumal Reef located in the North of the Mexican Caribbean is an important case study to quantify the ecological changes of coral reefs affected by multiple stressors. Here we used both field data (benthic cover, coral condition, fish biomass), together with satellite data of the main stressors (degree heating weeks, chlorophyll a, and urban area), to (i) reconstruct the timeline of stressors that have affected Akumal Reef from 1995 to 2019; (ii) describe the changes in coral reef components (benthic cover, bleaching, coral diseases, and fish biomass) in this period; and (iii) propose a model integrating coral benthic changes and the significant stressors influencing those changes through time while taking into account stressors interactions and partial effects. Our results show that between 1995 and 2019, hard coral cover suffered an average absolute loss of 84%. This loss contrasted with an average absolute gain in total algae cover of 74% and was negatively associated with an increase of 290% in the urban area. During the study period, there has been no signal of positive recovery in hard coral cover, and increasingly available space has been occupied alternatively by filamentous algae or macroalgae after acute stressor events, such as bleaching or disease, which are more frequent, and persistent in the last decade. Our integrative model highlights interactions between urban area, maximum degree heating weeks, and chlorophyll a as main drivers of hard coral decrease, as well as interactions between urban area and precipitation, related to total algae increase. Akumal Reef degradation trend must be rapidly addressed by implementing management tools integrated into a comprehensive coastal planning model, which must reduce pollution and overfishing, allowing the recovery of its structure and function, and providing persistence of ecosystem services in a context of global changes and ecological 'surprises'.

AB  - The space-borne CALIOP lidar data has been used to better understand the dust transport mechanism from the Mesopotamian region to the atmosphere of Zanjan, a city in the Northwest Iran Plateau. The level 2 aerosol profile data product of the CALIOP has been studied for 142 overpasses during 2006-2018. The mean values of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and particulate depolarization ratio (PDR) at 532 nm, extracted from 142 cases, are 0.23 and 0.17, respectively. Moreover, 32 dust events (23% of all) have been recorded. For these cases, the mean values of AOD and PDR reach 0.53 and 0.21, respectively. The monthly-mean values of AOD and PDR confirm previous studies that dust particles are the dominant type of aerosols in the atmosphere of Zanjan, and their concentrations are remarkably increased in dry and warm months, especially between April to August. Based on the vertical profiles of PDR and extinction coefficients, the altitude range of about 1-3.5 km AGL is the most probable range of dust layer distribution in the studied area. Also, some dust events have been studied in more detail using the CALIOP data, sunphotometer data, ECMWF and HYSPIT meteorological models, and AOD product of the MODIS. Based on the results, dust particles originated from the Tigris-Euphrates basin, rise from the surface of Mesopotamia, move eastward, pass above the Zagros Mountains (the barrier between Mesopotamia and Iran Plateau), and finally reach the atmosphere of the studied area and cause dust events. It seems that it is the most probable mechanism of dust transport to the Northwest Iran Plateau.

TI  - Cytologic features of small cell melanoma
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small cell melanoma (SCM) is an aggressive variant of malignant melanoma (MM), which has been rarely described in the cytology literature. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and cytologic features of a series of cases of metastatic SCM with discussion of the differential diagnosis of metastatic SCM diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). A retrospective review of cases was performed, identifying two FNA cases and one core biopsy with touch preparation of metastatic SCM. Clinical presentation, cytomorphology features, ancillary tests, and final diagnoses were documented and analyzed. Patients ranged in age from 69 to 85 years-old. Cytomorphologic features included the presence of a monomorphic population of dispersed small round blue cells, with scant cytoplasm, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, dense nuclear chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Acinar like arrangement (n = 2) and nuclear molding (n = 1) were also present. All cases showed diffuse positivity for the melanocytic markers SOX10 and Melan A by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Expression of neuroendocrine markers was variable. Diagnosing metastatic SCM at unusual anatomic sites by FNA cytology is a challenging task, especially in patients without known prior history of melanoma. Cytomorphology of SCM is unique, differing from conventional MM in many aspects, including the presence of acinar formations and a lack of typical melanoma features, such as large cells, intracytoplasmic melanin, and macronucleoli. IHC is critical for establishing the diagnosis of SCM.

TI  - Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water body of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir using Landsat-5/7/8 imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Xiaolangdi Reservoir is a key control project to control the water and sediment in the lower Yellow River, and a timely and accurate grasp of the reservoir's water storage status is essential for the function of the reservoir. This study used all available Landsat images (789 scenes) and adopted the modified normalized difference water index, enhanced vegetation index, and normalized dif-ference vegetation index to map the surface water from 1999 to 2019 in Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud plat-form. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the surface water body area changes in the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in the past 21 years are analyzed from the water body type division, area change, type conversion, and the driving force of the Xiaolangdi water body area changes was analyzed. The results showed that (1) the overall accuracy of the water body extraction method was 98.86%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.96; (2) the maximum water body area of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir varies greatly between inter-annual and intra-annual, and seasonal water body and permanent water body have uneven spatiotemporal distribution; (3) in the conversion of water body types, the increased seasonal water body area of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir from 1999 to 2019 was mainly formed by the conversion of permanent water body, and the reduced permanent water body area was mainly caused by non-water conversion; and (4) the change of the water body area of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir has a weak negative correlation with natural factors such as precipitation and temperature, and population. It is positively corre-lated with seven indicators such as runoff and regional gross domestic product (GDP). The findings of the research will provide necessary data support for the management and planning of soil and water resources in the Xiaolangdi Reservoir.

TI  - Parallel Multistage Wide Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning networks have achieved great success in many areas, such as in large-scale image processing. They usually need large computing resources and time and process easy and hard samples inefficiently in the same way. Another undesirable problem is that the network generally needs to be retrained to learn new incoming data. Efforts have been made to reduce the computing resources and realize incremental learning by adjusting architectures, such as scalable effort classifiers, multi-grained cascade forest (gcForest), conditional deep learning (CDL), tree CNN, decision tree structure with knowledge transfer (ERDK), forest of decision trees with radial basis function (RBF) networks, and knowledge transfer (FDRK). In this article, a parallel multistage wide neural network (PMWNN) is presented. It is composed of multiple stages to classify different parts of data. First, a wide radial basis function (WRBF) network is designed to learn features efficiently in the wide direction. It can work on both vector and image instances and can be trained in one epoch using subsampling and least squares (LS). Second, successive stages of WRBF networks are combined to make up the PMWNN. Each stage focuses on the misclassified samples of the previous stage. It can stop growing at an early stage, and a stage can be added incrementally when new training data are acquired. Finally, the stages of the PMWNN can be tested in parallel, thus speeding up the testing process. To sum up, the proposed PMWNN network has the advantages of: 1) optimized computing resources; 2) incremental learning; and 3) parallel testing with stages. The experimental results with the MNIST data, a number of large hyperspectral remote sensing data, and different types of data in different application areas, including many image and nonimage datasets, show that the WRBF and PMWNN can work well on both image and nonimage data and have very competitive accuracy compared to learning models, such as stacked autoencoders, deep belief nets, support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), LeNet-5, RBF network, recently proposed CDL, broad learning, gcForest, ERDK, and FDRK.

TI  - Heavy rainfall drives slow-moving landslide in Mazhe Village, Enshi to a catastrophic collapse on 21 July 2020
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Following extremely heavy rainfall, a catastrophic landslide occurred in Mazhe Village, Enshi, China, on 21 July 2020. In this study, we use C-band Sentinel-1A Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements and Sentinel-2 optical imagery to retrieve the ground deformation evolution before this landslide and the aftermath. Optical imagery reveals that part of the slope body collapsed completely, while the mean normalized difference vegetation of the stable part drops from 0.703 to 0.514. Time series InSAR results show that the central and western parts of the slope body area have already undergone slow moving over the past years, which exhibited apparent seasonal variations with maximum changes when the accumulated rainfall reached its peak during the revisit period. The correlation between slope deformation and rainfall in the rainy season has been increasing, reaching over - 0.8 in 2020. The total deformation rate of the rainy season has a significantly strong correlation with the total precipitation, and the correlation coefficients at the two monitoring points reach - 0.9995 and - 0.9446, respectively, and the average value of the slope reaches - 0.8523. Multiple heavy rainfall events with short intervals are more tend to cause greater deformation. In addition, through the time-series InSAR analysis of the whole Qingjiang River in Enshi, another three creeping landslides are detected, and all show a linear trend with remarkable fluctuations in summer.

TI  - A stochastic model explains the periodicity phenomenon of influenza on network
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza is an infectious disease with obvious periodic changes over time. It is of great practical significance to explore the non-environment-related factors that cause this regularity for influenza control and individual protection. In this paper, based on the randomness of population number and the heterogeneity of population contact, we have established a stochastic infectious disease model about influenza based on the degree of the network, and obtained the power spectral density function by using the van Kampen expansion method of the master equation. The relevant parameters are obtained by fitting the influenza data of sentinel hospitals. The results of the numerical analysis show that: (1) for the infected, the infection period of patients who go to the sentinel hospitals is particularly different from the others who do not; (2) for all the infected, there is an obvious nonlinear relationship between their infection period and the visiting rate of the influenza sentinel hospitals, the infection rate and the degree. Among them, only the infection period of patients who do not go to the sentinel hospitals decreased monotonously with the infection rate (increased monotonously with the visiting rate), while the rest had a non-monotonic relationship.

TI  - Shallow Structure Fault and Fracture Mapping in Jaboi Volcano, Indonesia, Using VLF-EM and Electrical Resistivity Methods
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The area surrounding Jaboi volcano, Indonesia, has been planned for geothermal energy development with capacity of similar to 50 Mwe. Geophysical surveys can contribute to the understanding of the hydrogeology of the area because they can provide information without interferences, which could potentially react to the flow of hot water. In many cases, the occurrence of a hot spring is closely related to its local fault system, which permits the flow of thermal fluid to its surface. This research applied the very low-frequency electromagnetic (VLF-EM) method and then compared it with electrical resistivity data to map fractures, faults, and geological aspects in the Jaboi volcano manifestation area. In tropical areas such as Indonesia, the VLF-EM method has been applied widely in studying subsurface structures. However, it is rarely used in volcanic areas with high terrain conditions even though the mobility of VLF methods is simpler than the electrical resistivity method. At the west side of the volcano, the 2D models from both VLF-EM and electrical resistivity showed the conductive zone (log 0.5-1.5 ohm m) found as a response to the manifestation, which has a similar direction with a local fault known as the Ceuneuhot fault. At the east side, the 2D models from both methods showed a similar conductive zone at depths of 15-25 m, which is caused by the existence of bedrock (> log 2.5 ohm m). The bedrock at depths of 0-10 m inhibits the rise of fluid to the surface so that there is no geothermal manifestation in the other local fault known as the Leumomate fault. In addition, the 2D models from the two methods showed the contrast of some fracture zones as entry and exit points of fluid in the Jaboi volcano. In addition, analysis of Landsat 8 optical images also showed high-temperature values and low vegetation indices in several active craters as indicators of volcanic activity. Based on the processed data, it is concluded that VLF-EM can be used as a fast and accurate method to provide information about near-surface structures in a geothermal field, and it can be used safely to suggest a location for drilling programs or to give contributions to protect geothermal springs.

TI  - Multi-predictor mapping of soil organic carbon in the alpine tundra: a case study for the central Ecuadorian paramo
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Soil organic carbon (SOC) affects essential biological, biochemical, and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, water retention, water distribution, and soil structure stability. The Andean paramo known as such a high carbon and water storage capacity ecosystem is a complex, heterogeneous and remote ecosystem complicating field studies to collect SOC data. Here, we propose a multi-predictor remote quantification of SOC using Random Forest Regression to map SOC stock in the herbaceous paramo of the Chimborazo province, Ecuador. Results Spectral indices derived from the Landsat-8 (L8) sensors, OLI and TIRS, topographic, geological, soil taxonomy and climate variables were used in combination with 500 in situ SOC sampling data for training and calibrating a suitable predictive SOC model. The final predictive model selected uses nine predictors with a RMSE of 1.72% and a R-2 of 0.82 for SOC expressed in weight %, a RMSE of 25.8 Mg/ha and a R-2 of 0.77 for the model in units of Mg/ha. Satellite-derived indices such as VARIG, SLP, NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, EVI2, WDRVI, NDSI, NDMI, NBR and NBR2 were not found to be strong SOC predictors. Relevant predictors instead were in order of importance: geological unit, soil taxonomy, precipitation, elevation, orientation, slope length and steepness (LS Factor), Bare Soil Index (BI), average annual temperature and TOA Brightness Temperature. Conclusions Variables such as the BI index derived from satellite images and the LS factor from the DEM increase the SOC mapping accuracy. The mapping results show that over 57% of the study area contains high concentrations of SOC, between 150 and 205 Mg/ha, positioning the herbaceous paramo as an ecosystem of global importance. The results obtained with this study can be used to extent the SOC mapping in the whole herbaceous ecosystem of Ecuador offering an efficient and accurate methodology without the need for intensive in situ sampling.

TI  - How might Indigenous decolonization agendas inform Anthropocene historiography?
T2  - RETHINKING HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many Indigenous and post-development commentators view the hegemony of western conceptions of 'development' as profoundly implicated in the Anthropocene's global ecological crises and underpinned by modernity's extractivist and anthropocentric worldview and sensibilities. Meanwhile, as Kothari et al. note, secular modernity's defenders persist in the presumption that modern science affords the definitive account of nature and reality, while the worldviews of Indigenous peoples are frequently delegitimised as unsophisticated or mere superstition. Accordingly, many Indigenous critics call for today's Indigenous movements globally to challenge the dominance of western 'heteropatriarchal' styles of thinking. They suggest modernity needs to learn from Indigenous movements and traditions, not least for insights into ethical relationality with the animate Earth. Likewise, Arturo Escobar insists that contemporary academic 'theory' needs re-enlivening: bringing it closer to life and the Earth and to the work of those who struggle to defend them. This paper asks how Indigenous decolonization agendas, which struggle in defense of life and the Earth, might inform historiography in the Anthropocene. For example, Beverley Southgate has suggested that history has a utopian and therapeutic purpose - helping us escape the thrall of the past and orientate ourselves towards emancipatory futures. This paper suggests - in an era of ecological emergency - that history's utopian imaginaries will need to be commensurate with that vivid experience of sensed ethical reciprocity with nature, to which indigenous traditional ecological knowledges (ITEK) bear witness. Some western historians question whether a coherent story for humanity is possible, given how systems thinking suggests global feedback and radical uncertainty condition our future. However, systems thinking also highlights the hierarchical nature of human-ecological systems and suggests that the deepest level for intervening in any human-ecological system is at the level of a society's 'mental models' and 'worldview'. This is the level at which interventions have the greatest leverage for radical system transformation and is the level that this essay focuses upon.

TI  - Improving AMSR2 total precipitable water vapour model using metaheuristic algorithms
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating total precipitable water vapour (TPWV) from advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) measurements with reasonable accuracy is challenging. Therefore, this study aims to improve the AMSR2 TPWV algorithm using metaheuristic algorithms for the first time. Radiosonde observations of six stations in the western part of Iran during 2020 were used as reference data. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, including land surface temperature and cloud mask, were used in the TPWV extracting algorithm and in selecting clear-sky days, respectively. Five metaheuristic methods - genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and bat algorithm (BA) - were used, due to the ability of metaheuristic methods in modelling complicated issues such as AMSR2 TPWV estimation. The WOA, GWO, and PSO showed the best performance. Therefore, metaheuristic algorithms can be used to improve the AMSR2 TPWV algorithm with reasonable performance on a local scale.

TI  - Time Series Analysis of Land Surface Temperature and Drivers of Urban Heat Island Effect Based on Remotely Sensed Data to Develop a Prediction Model
T2  - APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The local climate of cities is changing, and one of the primary reasons for this change is rapid urbanization. The Lahore district is situated in the Punjab province of Pakistan and is mainly comprised of Lahore city. This city is among the fastest expanding cities in Pakistan. Due to this rapid urbanization, the natural land surfaces are being altered, harming the local environment and thus causing the urban heat island (UHI) effect. For the analysis of the UHI effect, the fundamental and essential step is assessing the land surface temperature (LST). Therefore, the current investigation assessed LST to evaluate the UHI effect of the Lahore district. This study used the remote sensing data retrieved from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Different new generation algorithms were initially used, but a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was used based on the accuracy. The model was developed by utilizing the past 19 years' LST values along with elevation, road density (RD), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as input parameters for analyzing and predicting the LST. The LST data of the year 2020 was used for the validation of the outcomes of the CNN model. Among the model predicted LST and observed LST, a high correlation was noticed. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) for the considered two different periods (January and May) were also computed for both the training and validation processes. The prediction error for most parts of the district was within 0.1 K of the observed values. Hence, the formulated CNN model can be utilized as an essential tool for analyzing and predicting LST and thus for the evaluation of the UHI effect at any location.

TI  - Quantifying glacial elevation changes in the central Qilian Mountains during the early 21<SUP>st</SUP> century
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the central Qilian Mountains provide important water resources for the arid Hexi corridor and Qaidam Basin; however, changes in these glaciers interact with climate change. Twenty-four bi-static image pairs of TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) data, in addition to a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission-C/X band digital elevation model, and the technology of iterative differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry were used to carry out glacier elevation change analysis in the central Qilian Mountains in China during 2000-2014. Glacier elevation changed with an average rate of (-0.47 +/- 0.06) m yr(-1), while changes in elevation of (-0.51 +/- 0.06) m yr(-1) and (-0.44 +/- 0.06) m yr(-1) were found in the northern (including the Zoulangnan, Tuolai, and Tuolainan mountains) and southern (including the Shulenan and Hark mountains) regions, respectively. Summer mean temperature has risen by 0.51 degrees C (10 yr) (-1) in the northern region and 0.48 degrees C (10 yr) (-1) in the southern region during 1989-2014; however, the change in amplitude of annual precipitation was 2.69 mm yr(-1) in the northern region and 4.77 mm yr(-1) in the southern region for the same period. These changes can be ascribed as major driving factors for the differences in the changes in glacial elevation in the northern and southern regions. Four types of glaciers existed in the region when considering the change in elevation of the glacial tongue and variation in the position of the glacial terminus: surging, advancing, intensively retreating, and slightly retreating glaciers. If elevation decreased more than 20 m on the part of glacier tongue, the glacier terminus position had commonly retreated more than 100 m.

How to identify the best procedures for subsidence areas, which are scattered on a variety of lands rather than a single location? Our research proposes a new 'evaluation + clustering' methodology and took 95 subsidence areas in Jixi as an example. LANDSAT-8 images and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were used to identify the status of collapsed area water bodies. Reuse suitability evaluations were done in terms of ecological protection, urban construction, and agricultural production using a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) based on a geographic information system (GIS). Then k-means clustering was used to classify the areas to identify their reuse pattern and model. The results show that the degree of subsidence is low with 78.25% of land scarcely wet. The suitability assessment values for rehabilitation as construction and agriculture are high, indicating the lands are suitable for reuse. 619.12 hm(2) of subsidence areas located in a convenient place and surrounded by different kinds of lands are suitable for multiple uses, 1000.48 hm(2) of those are appropriate for ecological reuse, namely water, land or forestry, their subsidence being severe and most of them located on mountains or near to the edge of built-up areas. An estimated 630.18 hm(2) located near the main road and inside the planning land boundary are suitable for parks, industrial land, and other construction lands. A further 11,176.94 hm(2) could be used for farmland and other agricultural lands.

TI  - A pilot trial of vaccination with Carcinoembryonic antigen and Her2/neu peptides in advanced colorectal cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Checkpoint-blockade therapy (CBT) is approved for select colorectal cancer (CRC) patents, but additional immunotherapeutic options are needed. We hypothesized that vaccination with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Her2/neu (Her2) peptides would be immunogenic and well tolerated by participants with advanced CRC. A pilot clinical trial (NCT00091286) was conducted in HLA-A2(+) or -A3(+) Stage IIIC-IV CRC patients. Participants were vaccinated weekly with CEA and Her2 peptides plus tetanus peptide and GM-CSF emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant for 3 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded per NIH Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3. Immunogenicity was evaluated by interferon-gamma ELISpot assay of in vitro sensitized peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymphocytes from the sentinel immunized node. Eleven participants were enrolled and treated; one was retrospectively found to be ineligible due to HLA type. All 11 participants were included in AEs and survival analyses, and the 10 eligible participants were evaluated for immunogenicity. All participants reported AEs: 82% were Grade 1-2, most commonly fatigue or injection site reactions. Two participants (18%) experienced treatment-related dose-limiting Grade 3 AEs; both were self-limiting. Immune responses to Her2 or CEA peptides were detected in 70% of participants. Median overall survival (OS) was 16 months; among those enrolled with no evidence of disease (n = 3), median OS was not reached after 10 years of follow-up. These data demonstrate that vaccination with CEA or Her2 peptides is well tolerated and immunogenic. Further study is warranted to assess potential clinical benefits of vaccination in advanced CRC either alone or in combination with CBT.

TI  - Spatial prediction of soil surface properties in an arid region using synthetic soil image and machine learning
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of spatial variability and mapping of soil properties is critical for sustainable agricultural production in arid lands. The main objectives of the present study were to spatialize soil organic carbon (SOC), soil particle size distribution(clay, sand, and silt contents), and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) by integrating multisource environmental covariates, including digital elevation model (DEM) and remote sensing data by machine learning (Cubist, Cu and random forest, RF) in an arid region of Iran. Additionally, Synthetic Soil Images (SySI) were achieved from multi-temporal images of bare soil pixels based on Landsats 4, 5, 7, 8, and a DEM. Three hundred topsoil samples (0-30 cm depth) were collected based on the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) approach in Afzar district, Fars province, southern Iran. The models were calibrated and validated by the 10-fold cross-validation approach, and the performance was evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE), the ratio of the performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ), and coefficient of determination (R-2). Also, the prediction accuracy was assessed by the relative RMSE (rRMSE). The performance of the best models based on the RPIQ index showed that the model for predicting clay (1.89) had a good prediction, for sand (1.64), SOC (1.55), and CCE (1.59) had a fair prediction, while the model for silt (1.13) performed poorly. We found that the Cu and RF models had the highest and lowest prediction accuracies for CCE (rRMSE = 14.31%) and SOC (rRMSE = 43.93%), respectively. We discovered that a combination of high-quality RS data (SySI) and variables derived from DEM were reasonably able to predict soil properties. We revealed a strong promise to enhance the accuracy of digital soil mapping, especially in regions with limited soil data. Moreover, the application of RS data can reduce the soil sampling cost and, accordingly, soil mapping.

TI  - A Study of Rocket Exhaust Plume in the Lower Atmosphere using Geo-Imaging High Resolution Camera (GHRC) On-board Indian Geostationary Satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rocket exhaust plumes in atmosphere are remarkable phenomena that can be clearly seen from both the Earth's surface and space. A huge number of dispersed particles within the exhaust plume provide sufficient scattering of solar radiation that can be registered by photographic cameras from ground or space. In the present study, we have analysed rocket exhaust plumes from the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) MK-II F11 carrying the Geostationary SATellite (GSAT)-7A payload using the Geo-imaging High Resolution Camera (GHRC) on-board GSAT-29 satellite for the purpose of probing atmospheric states. This study deals with analysing the initial rocket plume produced by the GSLV vehicle launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota on 19 December, 2018. Approximately 2211 frames acquired by the GHRC instrument at similar to 1.5 frames per second around the time of GSAT-7A launch were processed, rocket exhaust plume was detected and motion vectors of exhaust plume were traced to estimate horizontal components of wind velocity at different altitudes. GHRC estimated U component of wind ranged from - 7.1 m/s at 200 hPa to + 4.0 m/s at 100 hPa with lower values close to surface. V component of wind ranged from - 4.8 m/s at 900 hPa to + 8.6 m/s at 400 hPa with intense shear between 200 and 100 hPa levels. Comparative analysis of results obtained from satellite data with Weather Research and Forecasting modelled wind fields showed a good match. For the first time in India, we analysed the dynamics of rocket exhaust plume in the troposphere and lower stratosphere using satellite-mounted imaging camera on a geostationary platform and demonstrate its application in obtaining atmospheric wind profile. This study also demonstrates the unique high-temporal capability of GHRC for its use in large-scale smoke/plume detection.

TI  - Watching North Korea from the sky: Remote sensing and documenting human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
T2  - POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - For organisations committed to documenting human rights abuses in North Korea, gathering data is an ongoing challenge. Faced with the lack of access to the country, as well as the problems inherent in verifying testimonies from North Korean escapees, some organisations have turned to hybrid methodologies, including pairing remote sensing (RS) technologies with testimonial data to better understand the people, places and institutions associated with human rights violations. In the case of North Korea, to date, remote sensing has been used primarily to monitor nuclear weapons and missile development sites. This work has at times sparked controversy, given the scope for analytical error and the high stakes associated with flawed analysis. Against this backdrop, this article discusses the application of remote sensing to augment human rights abuse investigations and calls for greater attention to the potential of remote sensing data to both assist in eliciting information in research interviews, and to generate data that may be used to support the pursuit of accountability for alleged violations of international law. Specifically, it considers the work of an ongoing project developed in South Korea using satellite imagery and Geographic Information Systems technology together with witness testimonies to document sites of state-led killings and burials in North Korea. The paper cites advantages to be had from developing hybrid methods of data-gathering in this context and describes some of the key methodological considerations involved, as well as the possible applications of the data in seeking justice and remedy in the future.

TI  - Annual satellite-based NDVI-derived land cover of Europe for 2001-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover plays an important role in the Earth's climate as it affects multiple biochemical cycles and is critical for food security and biodiversity. As land cover is continuously evolving, influenced by anthropogenic and other factors, the availability of temporally varying land cover data sets of large spatial domains is integral to understanding, monitoring, and informing environmental management efforts. Here we use classification trees to generate annual land cover maps of the European continent for 2001 to 2019 on a-250 m resolution. The classification trees are trained using gap-filled and smoothed MODIS normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) satellite data, as well as CORINE reference land cover data. We apply the bagging ensemble technique on oversampled NDVI data, with an additional majority vote for overlapping segments over the continent-wide domain. We distinguish between 39 land cover classes, with a total classification accuracy of 75% and average precision of 76%. The accuracy varies between the classes, with common classes (e.g. agricultural and forest classes) performing better than rarer ones (e.g. artificial land cover). Over the entire continent, we find that artificial land cover, wetlands, and forests have increased on average by 0.76, 0.50 and 0.22%/year respectively, while the agricultural area has decreased by 0.21%/year. We also quantify these changes in land cover on a national and metropolitan level. Given the near-real-time availability of global NDVI data, we note the potential of the presented approach for generating 'near-real-year' annual land cover data sets of large geographic domains, for the continuous monitoring of land cover change and the effects of interventions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution and influencing factors of <i>Ulva prolifera</i> and <i>Sargassum</i> and their coexistence in the South Yellow Sea, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine ecological disasters occurred frequently in recent years and raised widespread concerns about the ecological health of the ocean. We analyzed the spatiotemporal distributions of Ulva prolifera and Sargassum from April to July each year between 2016 and 2020 in the South Yellow Sea using multisource (GF-1 and HJ-1A/1B) remote sensing images, combined with the MODIS sea surface temperature (SST) data, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data, and Quick SCAT sea surface wind (SSW) data, to explore the potential influencing factors. The results show that (1) U. prolifera and Sargassum appeared mainly from May to July and April to June, respectively; (2) U. prolifera showed an impact in larger spatial scope than that of Sargassum. U. prolifera originated in the shoal area of northern Jiangsu and finally disappeared in the sea near Haiyang-Rongcheng area. The spatial scope of the impact of Sargassum tended to expand. Sargassum was first detected in the ocean northeast of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River estuary and disappeared near 35 degrees N; and (3) correlation analysis showed that the SST influenced the growth rate of U. prolifera and Sargassum. PAR had varied effects on U. prolifera and Sargassum at different times. A moderate light conditions could accelerate the growth and reproduction of U. prolifera and Sargassum. High irradiance levels of ultraviolet radiation may cause photoinhibition and damage on U. prolifera and Sargassum. The southeast monsoon and surface currents promoted the drift of U. prolifera and Sargassum from the southeast to the northwest and north. Therefore, the spatial and temporal similarities and differences between U. prolifera and Sargassum were influenced by a combination of factors during their growth processes.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 impact on industrial production could improve the estimation of the economic loss and sustainable work resumption policies in cities. In this study, assuming and checking a correlation between the land surface temperature (LST) and industrial production, we applied the BEAST algorithm and linear regression models on multi-temporal MODIS data to derive monthly time-series deviation of LST with a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km, to quantificationally explore the fine-scale spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 control measures impact on industrial production, within Wuhan city. The results demonstrate that (1) the trend of time-series LST could partly reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on industrial production, and the year-around industrial production was less than expectations, with a fall of 14.30%; (2) the most serious COVID-19 impact on industrial production appeared in Mar. and Apr., then, after the lifting of lockdown, some regions (approximate 4.90%) firstly returned to expected levels in Jun, and almost all regions (98.49%) have completed the resumption of work and production before Nov.; (3) the southwest and south-central had more serious impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximate twice as much as that in the north and suburban, in Wuhan. The results and findings elaborated the spatiotemporal distribution and their changes during 2020 within Wuhan, which could provide a beneficial support for assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of resumption plans for sustainable development.

TI  - Insights for improving bacterial blight management in coffee field using spatial big data and machine learning
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae, the causal agent of coffee disease bacterial blight, causes losses in nurseries and coffee fields. In this work, the objective was to evaluate integrated bacterial blight management in a coffee (Coffea arabica L.) field based on disease spatial pattern and ecological variables. The coffee field was composed by 85 georeferenced sample points, containing 5 plants representing a georeferenced point, being the spatial support of the experiment. Disease intensity classes were predicted in the field by machine learning algorithms fitted to big data on surface reflectance and spectral indices derived from digital image processing of Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS, as well as morphometric and hydrological attributes determined by geocomputation algorithms. Geostatistical modeling was used to characterize the spatial pattern and map the disease to gain epidemiological knowledge and precisely manage bacterial blight. Random forest algorithm enabled to detect the importance of relief morphometry associated with bacterial blight spatial progress in the coffee field, mainly according to the altitude and flow line curvature of the terrain. Probabilistic information on disease spatial pattern, modeled considering external trend effects of the topography variation, can be useful information for disease spatial prediction and integrated management based on georeferenced disease sampling. Multiple environmental variables may be carefully considered to evaluate mechanisms of interactions of bacterial blight with coffee plants and the physical environment.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover change is having an enduring link with climatic factors. This study was designed to study the impact of forest cover change in the Western Ghats on meteorological parameters like rainfall and land surface temperature (LST) between 2000 and 2019 using Landsat images. Land use land cover (LULC) data were extracted from Landsat images, and rainfall data of 53 stations were obtained from tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data. Mann-Kendall trend test, a nonparametric test, was adopted to evaluate the long-run trends in rainfall for North East (NE) and South West (SW) monsoon during the selected time period. The test results indicate that 19 stations in the North of Kerala show a positive trend in SW monsoon and 3 stations show a negative trend in NE monsoon. The breakpoint analysis of the rainfall dataset with time and with the elevation from mean sea level (MSL) is performed and the results show a breakpoint in the rainfall for the year 2008 and at 47 m elevation (MSL) from the coast of the Arabian Sea. Forest cover data show that there is a loss of 12.65% in the region for two decades span and also a significant increase in minimum LST from 8.308 to 9.208 degrees C and increase in maximum LST from 41.51 to 46.29 degrees C during the selected time period. Forest cover loss could be an important factor responsible for the increase in LST. The research outcomes would help the policymakers in improvising the measures for land management policies including plantation and urbanization.

TI  - Assessment and mapping of soil salinity using electromagnetic induction and Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing data in an irrigated olive orchard under semi-arid conditions
T2  - SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinisation threatens the sustainability of irrigated olive orchards in Tunisia. Electromagnetic induction measurements and soil spectral index calculations could help to survey the soil salinity. This study aimed to map changes in the soil salinity spatial pattern using geostatistical techniques and soil spectral index regression. The study area is located in Sminja, Tunisia. It is a 665 ha olive orchard, landscaped in ridges and furrows and managed following a very high-density planting system (1.5 x 4 m(2)). Electromagnetic readings measured in situ with an electromagnetic device (EM38) that was fitted, in turn, to the electrical conductivity of the saturated paste of five soil depths namely: 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm and to the average electrical conductivity of the saturated paste of the 0-100 cm soil depth. Both the ordinary kriging and universal kriging performed similarly and well in mapping the soil salinity. (R-2=0.86 and 0.89 for the 0-20 cm and the 0-100 cm depths, respectively). Our results prove that mapping the soil salinity based on electromagnetic induction and kriging methods is an effective approach, which allows one to monitor the soil salinity within permanent croplands in semi-arid conditions. Salinisation that reaches intolerable values by olive trees, is especially accumulated on the top of the ridges, where the drippers are installed. Furthermore, based on two Landsat 8 images acquired on April 30, 2019 and May 16, 2019, respectively, we calculated seven soil spectral indices. Nevertheless, multiple regression models between the electromagnetic readings and various combinations of soil spectral indices were poor. In the coming investigations, under permanent land cover, spectral index regression models should integrate not only the soil, but also vegetation indices.

A total of 1656 men (mean age +/- SD=73.1yrs +/- 13.2) and 1653 women (79.3yrs +/- 13.0) were admitted with acute stroke (83.3% ischaemic, 15.7% intracranial haemorrhagic), 1.0% unspecified) in four major UK hyperacute stroke units (HASU) between 2014 and 2016. Four categories from cardiovascular disease Congestive heart failure, Atrial fibrillation, pre-existing Stroke and Hypertension (CASH). were constructed: CASH-0 (no coexisting CVD); CASH-1 (any one coexisting CVD); CASH 2 (any two coexisting CVD); CASH-3 (any three or all four coexisting CVD). These were tested against outcomes, adjusted for age and sex. Results: Compared to CASH-0, individuals with CASH-3 had greatest risks of in-hospital mortality (11.1% vs 24.5%, OR=1.8, 95%CI=1.3-2.7) and disability (modified Rankin Scale score >= 4) at discharge (24.2% vs 46.2%, OR=1.9, 95%CI=1.4-2.7), urinary tract infection (3.8% vs 14.6%, OR=3.3, 95%CI=1.9-5.5), and pneumonia (7.1% vs 20.6%, OR=2.6, 95%CI=1.7-4.0); length of stay on HASU >14 days (29.8% vs 39.3%, OR=1.8, 95%CI=1.3-2.6); and joint-care planning (20.9% vs 29.8%, OR=1.4, 95%CI=1.0-2.0). Conclusions: We present a simple tool for estimating the risk of adverse outcomes of acute stroke including death, disability at discharge, nosocomial infections, prolonged length of stay, as well as any joint care planning. CASH-0 indicates a low level and CASH-3 indicates a high level of risk of such complications after stroke.

TI  - A new approach to quantify propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Of particular importance in a world of increasing water scarcity is the temporal and spatial relationship between a shortage in rainfall-meteorological drought-and a shortage in available water, or hydrological drought. Propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought should be calculated at a higher (sub-monthly) temporal resolution with considerations for spatial expansion. A new framework for propagation time calculation from one index to another is established that uses the run theory, high-resolution remote sensing data on a daily time step. The framework is demonstrated using standardized drought indices representing precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture in the Central Asian subcontinent to measure the temporal shift (propagation time) in affected drought area, bringing a new perspective to contemporary drought analysis. Several variables from the water cycle are chosen to provide hydrological context for different propagation times. Correlation analyses for propagation time are shown to be ambiguous in interpretation and precision when compared to the temporal shift, which is clearly defined and calculated on a daily time step. Moreover, the results of temporal shift analyses indicate that deficits in evapotranspiration and runoff can precede deficits in precipitation, while soil moisture deficit almost always follows, highlighting the effects of additional influencing factors aside from precipitation on types of hydrological drought. While it is limited by current understanding of drought definition techniques, availability and quality of remote sensing products, and selection of characteristics for observation, use of the temporal shift over the correlation analysis provides a sub-monthly estimate of drought propagation time that may prove useful for detailed analyses, particularly in rapidly developing flash drought events.

TI  - Utilizing unsupervised learning, multi-view imaging, and CNN-based attention facilitates cost-effective wetland mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of Unmanned/Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data and deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offers robust new tools for precision land cover mapping. However, its successful application is highly dependent on local experiences that are rarely documented, resulting in practical limitations during implementation. Cost-effective deep learning frameworks for fast deployment are required. This study presents a deep learning adaptation framework, named Auto-UNet++, trying to streamline wetland mapping tasks (including training data labeling and organizing). The framework treats mapping tasks as an intact semantic segmentation pipeline and then integrates automatic strategies into each step to reduce human intervention. These automatic strategies are achieved by standard computer vision techniques, including multi-view (MV) imaging-highly overlapped UAV images over an area (for labeling/voting), unsupervised clustering (for labeling), multi-scale CNN (for feature extraction), and attention mechanism-a CNN design used to select informative features from input (for feature exploration/selection). The framework was tested on playa wetland mapping in the Rainwater Basin, Nebraska, USA, with multispectral UAV datasets. Generally, the multi-scale CNN mapping task achieved a high of 87% overall accuracy and over 90% accuracy in water delineation. The results indicate that the multi-view and attention strategies have the potential to improve segmentation performance, and together with unsupervised learning, save considerable labor/expertise. Interestingly, evidence shows that the band/scale attention (weight) is adaptively associated with the land cover percentages per input image, indicating spatial contexts captured. This finding highlights the potential usages of the attention rule in automatic feature exploration, selection, and model interpretation. The framework illustrating a highly automated deep learning deployment on small MV datasets facilitates cost-effective wetland cover mapping. Although limitations exist, the study demonstrated the possibility of where/how conventional segmentation pipelines can be improved in typical UAV wetland mapping tasks. The framework and findings are useful for similar applications (including non-UAV studies) that only have limited time, labor, and expertise to implement sophisticated semantic segmentation models.

TI  - Kohelet - Hebrew or Hellenist?: A Survey of the Debate
T2  - EXPOSITORY TIMES
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay provides a comprehensive survey of two centuries of scholarly debate regarding the extent to which Kohelet, the author of the book of Ecclesiastes, was influenced by currents of Greek philosophy and literature. This essay first considers Kohelet's possible Hebraic, Babylonian, and Egyptian sources of influence, before moving on to address its main topic. It surveys the broad spectrum of scholarly debate on this issue, and explores the strength and plausibility of each position on this spectrum. Finally, it concludes that while no certain conclusions can be reached, the evidence seems to reject the more extreme ends of this spectrum of opinion, while at the same time underscoring the uniqueness and irreducability of Kohelet's worldview.

TI  - Predicting potential locations of ancient settlements using GIS and Weights-Of-Evidence method (case study: North-East of Iran)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the GIS and the Weight-Of-Evidence method, this research prepared a potential map of ancient sites for North-East of Iran. First, some related criteria were selected, and then, using statistical methods, the importance of each causative factor was determined. For example, the slope direction was not statistically significant in the study area. Finally, six combinations with mutually conditional independent variables were chosen. The combination included slope, elevation, and distance from vegetated areas has the highest predictive value of 84.75% for training and 84.12% for test points. In other words, the potential map with the most predictive value can be extractable in the North-East of the country, using the three criteria obtained from the remote sensing data. According to the calculations, the rivers and villages positively affect finding archaeological sites within 1000 and 1500 m. However, the chance of finding ancient points is decreased going farther than 600 m from vegetated areas and slopes greater than 13 degrees.

TI  - Mowing event detection in permanent grasslands: Systematic evaluation of input features from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of land use and management in permanent grasslands affects both biodiversity and important ecosystem services. Comprehensive knowledge about these intensities is a crucial factor for sustainable decisionmaking in landscape policy. For meadows, the management intensity can be described by proxies such as the mowing frequency, usually, a higher number of cuts indicate higher intensities. Dense time series of medium resolution (10-30 m) remote sensing data are suitable for the detection of mowing events. However, existing studies revealed a general lack of consensus about the most appropriate input data set for a consistent and reliable mowing detection. We systematically evaluated the synergistic use of acquisitions from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to detect the occurrence, frequency, and date of mowing events as an indicator of grassland management intensity. Dense time series of NDVI (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8), gamma 0 backscatter, backscatter cross-ratio, backscatter secondorder texture metrics as well as 6-day interferometric coherence (Sentinel-1) were used as input features. All possible combinations of input features were tested to train a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which enables enhanced exploitation of the temporal domain of the data. The evaluation was conducted on 64 meadows for an overall of 257 mowing events from 2017 to 2019 in Germany. Our results revealed that the combination of input features improves the detection performance. The highest overall accuracy was reached by a combination of NDVI, backscatter cross-ratio, and interferometric coherence with an F1-Score of 0.84. The mowing frequency was predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.38 events per year, while the date of the events was missed by 3.79 days on average. NDVI time series alone mostly underperformed in comparison to optical/SAR combinations but clearly outperformed input-sets that were solely based on SAR features. The proposed model performed well for meadows with low to medium management intensities but further testing is recommended for highly intensive managed parcels. The results clearly demonstrate the additional value of fusing time series of the three present Earth observation systems that deliver a freely available global coverage of the land surface at medium resolution.

TI  - Spatiotemporal imputation of MODIS land surface temperature using machine learning techniques (Case study: New Mexico's Lower Rio Grande Valley)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the main factors in the physical processes of land surface energy and water balance at the global scale. The importance of LST is being progressively increased in a variety of water resource fields. However, the time series of LST observations regularly have missing values because of various reasons such as cloudiness. Missing value imputation is a technique to use a realistic value to estimate or replace the missing value. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare the potential of machine learning (ML) models including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for spatiotemporal imputation of LST satellite images in New Mexico's Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) where LST is a critical variable for water resource studies. The cross-validation approach was applied to obtain the optimized parameters for each model separately. The model comparison results showed that the SVR model is the most accurate model compared to other models from missing ratio 0.1 to 0.8 (0.24 < mean RMSE (degrees C) < 0.33). The BRT and ELM models showed the same performance level in general with almost the same mean CV-RMSE of 0.5 degrees C. However, the ELM imputed maps showed noisy estimations particularly when the missing ratios were increased. The BRT model showed a better performance compared to ELM with a lower missing ratio from 0.1 to 0.5. The KNN model found to be the least reliable ML model for spatiotemporal imputation of LST among the all models with mean RMSE of 0.982 degrees C. Also, blurring effects were more obvious in the KNN imputed maps than other models particularly in larger missing ratios. Overall, the findings confirmed the superiority of the SVR and BRT over the ELM and KNN for spatiotemporal imputations of LST.

TI  - Lymph node staging in genital carcinomas-Where does the journey lead to?
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphogenic metastasis is an important diagnostic and prognostic parameter of genital carcinomas; however, the therapeutic value of surgical lymph node resection is increasingly being discussed. In addition, systematic lymph node resection has a significant risk of morbidity, which is why the indications should be carefully verified. The importance of sentinel lymph node biopsies (SNB) has been increasing for years as it often enables adequate lymph node staging with a low risk of complications. According to the state of the art, systematic lymph node resection does not improve the survival rates in advanced ovarian cancer and endometrial carcinomas. Systematic pelvic lymph node resection in advanced vulvar neoplasms is also controversially discussed. The SNB in endometrial and vulvar cancers was extensively investigated and should be clinically applied with appropriate indications. In early cervical cancer SNB can also be an adequate treatment option. Within the next years the results of the SELLY study concerning SNB in early ovarian cancers are expected. The diagnostic relevance of systematic lymph node resection in cervical carcinomas currently remains high. In the case of pelvic lymph node metastases, chemoradiotherapy is usually applied instead of radical hysterectomy. This article presents the current state of knowledge concerning lymph node resection in genital carcinomas.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Change of Glacier Surging and Glacier-dammed Lake Formation in Karakoram Pakistan
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the northern part of Pakistan are the major source of water to the main river systems in Pakistan. These reservoirs of freshwater are under threat due to a continuous increase in the global mean temperature. The present study investigates two selected (Khordopin and Passu) glaciers surge and resultant induce glacier lakes and lake area change in terms of time and space. Observed temperature and precipitation data obtained from three high-altitude weather stations are also analyzed to examine the recent climate change in the region. The Khordopin glacier has shown an advancing behavior with an average surge of around 15-18 m/day for April-May 2017; it shows reduced velocity to 10 m/day during May-June 2017 as computed to the monthly Sentinel 2 and Landsat OLI images for the study area. During a field campaign, its velocity was recorded 2 m/day from 2 km above stream level of the glacier flow. However, the glacier shows different surge behaviors at different locations and altitudes. The Khordopin and the associated glacial lake show the best example of a surging glacier and formation of a Glacier dammed lake in the region. On the other hand, Passu Glacier indicates glacier retreating behavior. From the analysis of meteorological data (1995-2010), the maximum and minimum temperatures increase at a rate of 0.07 degrees C/year and 0.08 degrees C/year, respectively, while annual precipitation increases at 0.18 mm/year during the observational period. The MODIS snow data show an increasing trend in maximum snow-covered from 2000 onward, while the decreasing trend in minimum snow-covered from 2000 to 2008.

TI  - Impacts of Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes on Water-Borne Soil Erosion Using Geospatial Technologies and RUSLE Model over Chimbel Watershed of Upper Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation in the form of soil erosion is one of the major environmental problems in the highlands of Ethiopia. This research was aimed to estimate the effects of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) on water-borne soil erosion in the Chimbel watershed of the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. The spatial and temporal LULC changes were analyzed using Landsat 5 TM 1989 and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS 2019 images following a supervised classification technique with the Maximum-Likelihood Classification (MLC) algorithm. Soil erosion was estimated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The result reveals that cultivated land and built-up area increased by 11.3 and 7%, respectively, while grassland (6.9%), forest (6.4%), bush/shrubland (4.9%), and water body (0.2%) were reduced between 1989 and 2019 periods. Consequently, the mean soil erosion rates estimated from the entire watershed were 24.0 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 1989 and 28.3 t ha(-1) year(-1)in 2019, which are higher than the tolerable soil loss (1-6 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and soil formation (10-14 t ha(-1) year(-1)) rates of the study region. Hence, applying a land management intervention to reverse the trend of LULC changes and thereafter its soil erosion is suggested for environmental improvement of the region.

TI  - Dependability of rainfall to topography and micro-climate: an observation using geographically weighted regression
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dependability of rainfall to topography and micro-climate of the region in an eco-sensitive Western Ghats of India is evaluated using the geographically weighted regression method. The correlation between rainfall and topographical features, namely, elevation, slope, Terrain Ruggedness Index, topography, and distance from the coast/ridge, varies seasonally with consistent variation across the years. The Normalized Differential Vegetation Index and rainfall have an inverse relationship due to the adverse effect of high spell rainfall on vegetation growth in the monsoon season. The rainfall negatively correlates with maximum land surface temperature and conversely with a minimum land surface temperature in the windward side of the Ghats other than monsoon season. The connection between rainfall and other variables differs significantly throughout space, with vast differences on the mountain's windward and leeward sides, as well as in the Ghats' southern and northern regions. The effect of the terrain is amplified in the broad, gradually sloping intermediate rough mountain that is close to the coast. The maximum rainfall depends on the mountain's steepness on the windward side; at isolated mountains, maximum rainfall occurs at an elevation range of 500-800 m and in cascaded mountain ranges at 800-1200 m along with the influence of other driving factors. Also, the control exerted by the ridge of the mountain on the rain-bearing wind is prominent until 120 km from the mountain ridge. These results are useful in understanding the reliance of rainfall on topographic and micro-climatic parameters and can be used in hydro-geological applications.

TI  - The moderating role of mystical-type experiences on the relationship between existential isolation and meaning in life
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mystical-type experiences (MTEs) are unique phenomenological experiences that are often reported to induce significant and persisting changes in the experiencer's worldview. Previous research suggests that higher levels of existential isolation (EI) are associated with lower levels of meaning in life (MIL). This study examines the hypothesis that people who have had an MTE (compared with those who have not) will not show such a relationship between EI and MIL. Data from two samples (N = 2055) support the idea that those who have not had an MTE show a negative relationship between EI and MIL while those who have had an MTE show no relationship between EI and MIL. Implications and future directions are discussed.

TI  - Head and neck melanoma: outcome and predictors in a population-based cohort study
T2  - HEAD & FACE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To evaluate predictive clinico-pathological characteristics on outcome in head and neck melanoma (HNM) in a population-based study with particular emphasis on the prognostic effect of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and distinct tumor localisations. Methods Here we primarily describe a retrospective multicenter population-based cohort study with 402 patients having undergone resection with curative intent of HNM between 2010 and 2017. SLNB was used in the diagnosis of 79 HNM patients. Outcome was analyzed, focusing on SLNB, CCI as well as tumor localisation. Overall survival (OAS) und recurrence free survival (RFS) was examined by uni- and multivariate analysis. Results Histopathologically verified lymph node metastasis according to SLNB was associated with impaired RFS in HNM patients (p = 0.004). Especially in higher tumor stages, the sole implementation of SLNB improved survival significantly in the present cohort (p = 0.042). With most of the HNM being located in the face, melanoma of the scalp and neck could be linked to deteriorated patient's outcome in uni- as well as multivariate analysis (p = 0.021, p = 0.004). Conclusions SLNB is a useful tool in predicting development of distant metastasis after HNM resection with curative intent. Especially in higher tumor stages, performing a SLNB ameliorated survival of HNM patients. Additionally, CCI as well as a distinct tumor localisations in HNM were identified as important risk factors in our population-based cohort study.

TI  - Regression is significantly associated with outcomes for patients with melanoma
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The prognostic significance of regression in melanoma is debated. We present a large multicenter study correlating regression with sentinel lymph node metastasis and melanoma-specific survival. Methods: The Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group database was reviewed from 1993 to 2018. Patients with known regression and sentinel lymph node status were included. Clinicopathologic factors were correlated with regression, sentinel lymph node status, and melanoma-specific survival. Results: There were 4,790 patients; median follow-up was 39.6 months. Regression was present in 1,081 (22.6%) cases, and 798 (16.7%) patients had sentinel lymph node metastases. On multivariable analysis, male sex, truncal tumors, and decreasing thickness were significantly associated with regression (P < .05), whereas head/neck or leg tumors had lower rates of regression (P < .05). Regression was signifi-cantly correlated with a decreased risk of sentinel lymph node disease on multivariable analysis (odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.85; P = .0008). Multivariable analysis also showed that increasing age, male sex, increasing thickness, ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, microsatellitosis, and sentinel lymph node metastasis were significantly (P < .05) associated with worse melanoma-specific survival, while regression was significantly associated with better melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.99; P = .043). Conclusion: This large study shows that regression is significantly associated with better outcomes in patients with melanoma and is correlated with a lower risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis and a better melanoma-specific survival.

TI  - The IDeaS initiative: pilot study to assess the impact of rare diseases on patients and healthcare systems
T2  - ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Rare diseases (RD) are a diverse collection of more than 7-10,000 different disorders, most of which affect a small number of people per disease. Because of their rarity and fragmentation of patients across thousands of different disorders, the medical needs of RD patients are not well recognized or quantified in healthcare systems (HCS). Methodology We performed a pilot IDeaS study, where we attempted to quantify the number of RD patients and the direct medical costs of 14 representative RD within 4 different HCS databases and performed a preliminary analysis of the diagnostic journey for selected RD patients. Results The overall findings were notable for: (1) RD patients are difficult to quantify in HCS using ICD coding search criteria, which likely results in under-counting and under-estimation of their true impact to HCS; (2) per patient direct medical costs of RD are high, estimated to be around three-fivefold higher than age-matched controls; and (3) preliminary evidence shows that diagnostic journeys are likely prolonged in many patients, and may result in progressive, irreversible, and costly complications of their disease Conclusions The results of this small pilot suggest that RD have high medical burdens to patients and HCS, and collectively represent a major impact to the public health. Machine-learning strategies applied to HCS databases and medical records using sentinel disease and patient characteristics may hold promise for faster and more accurate diagnosis for many RD patients and should be explored to help address the high unmet medical needs of RD patients.

TI  - Comparison of sentinel 2A MSI and Landsat 8 OLI for soil organic matter inversion in southwestern Shandong province, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - It remains to be explored whether some new multispectral satellite images with more available bands and higher spatial resolution have better inversion capability for soil organic matter (SOM). Taking southwestern Shandong Province of China as the research area, this article compared the performance of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel 2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data for SOM quantitative inversion. The results indicate that, the model including red-edge 1 band of Sentinel 2A MSI was determined as the best model, as the validation R-2 increased by 0.106, the RMSE decreased by 0.565 g/kg, and RPD increased by 0.163 compared with the model on Landsat 8 OLI image. The SOM distribution characteristics inversed on the best model were consistent with that on the measured samples. Therefore, the Sentinel 2A MSI can obtain better results than Landsat 8 OLI for the regional SOM inversion in the southwestern Shandong Province of China.

TI  - Unaffirmed and color-blind: Racial worldview and stigma experienced in interracial relationships
T2  - PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marginalization as an interracial couple has been associated with poorer relationship functioning and poorer mental health outcomes. However, what contributes to whether interracial relationship (IR) partners perceive their relationship as stigmatized is not fully understood. Using a racially diverse sample of over 200 participants in IRs, this study addresses group and individual differences in the experience of IR stigma. Results suggest that, despite literature on related constructs such as stigma consciousness (the extent to which one is aware that they face marginalization or discrimination), there were no race-based group differences in reports of experienced stigma. Instead, a more nuanced account of a person's understanding of the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and institutional impact of race, a novel concept called racial worldview, offers an important step forward in understanding the perception of stigma. Racial worldview has implications for the continued study of interracial romantic relationships as an alternative for race-based group comparisons and a meaningful alternative to comparative studies with intraracial or same-race relationships.

TI  - A deep learning <i>approach</i> for automatic mapping of poplar plantations using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poplars are one of the most widespread fast-growing tree species used for forest plantations. Owing to their distinct features (fast growth and short rotation) and the dependency on the timber price market, poplar plantations are characterized by large inter-annual fluctuations in their extent and distribution. Therefore, monitoring poplar plantations requires a frequent update of information - not feasible by National Forest Inventories due to their periodicity - achievable by remote sensing systems applications. In particular, the new Sentinel-2 mission, with a revisiting period of 5 days, represents a potentially efficient tool for meeting this need. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach for mapping poplar plantations using Sentinel-2 time series. A reference dataset of poplar plantations was available for a large study area of more than 46,000 km(2) in Northern Italy and served as training and testing data. Two classification methods were compared: (1) a fully connected neural network (also called multilayer perceptron), and (2) a traditional logistic regression. The performance of the two approaches was estimated through bootstrapping procedure with a confidence interval of 99%. Results indicated for deep learning an omission error rate of 2.77%+/- 2.76%, showing improvements compared to logistic regression, omission error rate = 8.91%+/- 4.79%.

TI  - Joint VSWIR-TIR retrievals of earth's surface and atmosphere
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote spectroscopy of terrestrial ecosystems generally falls into one of two categories: UV, Visible and Short Wave InfraRed (VSWIR) methods measuring reflected solar illumination, and Thermal InfraRed (TIR) methods measuring radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. Both interpret the measured radiance with inversion algorithms that estimate surface reflectance, emissivity, surface temperatures, and the atmospheric state. However, the two regimes have traditionally used independent inversion methods. Here we present the first simultaneous inversion of the upwelling radiance spectrum from the UV through the VSWIR and the Thermal Infrared. Maximum A Posteriori estimation determines the surface and atmosphere state that is most consistent with measured radiance across the entire range. We find that the complementary information in the two intervals improves estimates of atmospheric properties, surface emissivity, and surface temperature. Posterior uncertainty is 40% lower in surface temperature and 60% in air temperature. Spurious correlations between atmospheric and surface state are also reduced, with 90% lower correlated uncertainty between total column water vapor and both surface and air temperature. Temperature-emissivity separation also improves, with a 33% reduction in correlated posterior uncertainty between the parameters. We demonstrate the method on coincident data from the Classic Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) operating in the VSWIR range, and the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) in the TIR range, during flights on NASA's high-altitude ER-2 aircraft. Measurements spanning 0.4 to 12 microns can improve estimates of surface and atmospheric properties, significantly advancing studies in terrestrial ecosystems, geology, agriculture, and urban management.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Change on Blue and Green Water Resources in the Xiangjiang River Basin of the Yangtze River, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Green water resources, which are fundamental for plant growth and terrestrial ecosystem services, reflect precipitation that infiltrates into the unsaturated soil layer and returns to the atmosphere by plant transpiration and soil evaporation through the hydrological cycle. However, green water is usually ignored in water resource assessments, especially when considering future climate impacts, and green water modeling generally ignores the calibration of evapotranspiration (ET), which might have a considerable impact on green water resources. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variations in blue and green water resources under historical and future climate change scenarios by applying a distributed hydrological model in the Xiangjiang River Basin (XRB) of the Yangtze River. An improved model calibration method based on remotely sensed MODIS ET data and observed discharge data is used, and the results show that the parallel parameter calibration method can increase the simulation accuracy of blue and green water while decreasing the output uncertainties. The coefficients (p-factor, r-factor, KGE, NSE, R ( 2 ), and PBIAS) indicate that the blue and green water projections in the calibration and validation periods exhibit good performance. Blue and green water account for 51.9 and 48.1%, respectively, of all water resources in the historical climate scenario, while future blue and green water projections fluctuate to varying degrees under different future climate scenarios because of uncertainties. Blue water resources and green water storage in the XRB will decrease (5.3-21.8% and 8.8-19.7%, respectively), while green water flow will increase (5.9-14.7%). Even taking the 95% parameter prediction uncertainty (95 PPU) range into consideration, the future increasing trend of the predicted green water flow is deemed satisfactory. Therefore, incorporating green water into future water resource management is indispensable for the XRB. In general, this study provides a basis for future blue and green water assessments, and the general modeling framework can be applied to other regions with similar challenges.</p>

TI  - Intercropping With Peppermint Increases Ground Dwelling Insect and Pollinator Abundance and Decreases <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> in Fruit
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercropping can be used to reduce pest insects within agricultural systems, e.g., through deterring pests directly or by increasing habitat for their natural enemies. For example, plant produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can deter or confuse host-finding by insects through olfactory disruption. Drosophila suzukii is an invasive fruit fly of agricultural concern as it can lay its eggs in both ripening and fresh fruits and, uses olfactory cues to identify its wide range of host plants. Peppermint plants (Mentha x piperita) produce high levels of VOCs while growing and may, therefore, be suitable as an intercrop to reduce D. suzukii infestations in the field, as peppermint essential oil VOCs have previously been shown to deter D. suzukii in olfactory trials. We conducted a field intercropping experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of peppermint plants compared to traditional ryegrass/clover mixes in reducing D. suzukii oviposition in the field, and the effect of peppermint intercrops on other invertebrates. In the field, we monitored sentinel fruit baits weekly for D. suzukii infestation. Additionally, we monitored intercropping effects on the invertebrate community through weekly pitfall trap collection and through a pollinator point survey. We monitored for local, farm level presence of D. suzukii through apple cider vinegar traps within crop fields and along hedgerows and found high abundance of D. suzukii (>3,000 individuals trapped). Peppermint intercrops had fewer D. suzukii emerge from fruit baits and supported greater beneficial insect abundance (predators and pollinators) compared to ryegrass/clover. However, levels of D. suzukii were low across both intercrop types. Overall, we found that peppermint intercrops could be a potential aromatic intercrop used to reduce D. suzukii adult emergence from fruit compared to conventional ryegrass/clover mixes, however this trial should be replicated over multiple growing seasons, geographic locations, and host fruits. Furthermore, further study should determine the effects of the intercrop on the focal crop of interest.

T2  - LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Haig HA, Chegoonian AM, Davies J-M, Bateson D, Leavitt PR. 2021. Marked blue discoloration of late winter ice and water due to autumn blooms of cyanobacteria. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Continued eutrophication of inland waters by nutrient pollution can combine with unprecedented atmospheric and lake warming to create emergent environmental surprises. Here we report the first known occurrence of marked blue discoloration of ice and water in highly eutrophic prairie lakes during late winter 2021. Intense blue staining was reported first to governmental agencies by ice fishers in early March 2021, then communicated widely through social media, resulting in First Nations and public concern over potential septic field release, toxic spills, urban pollution, and agricultural mismanagement. Analysis of water from stained and reference sites using ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that the blue color arose from high concentrations (similar to 14 mg/L) of the cyanobacterial pigment C-phycocyanin that was released after an unexpected bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in late October 2020 was frozen into littoral ice. Remote sensing using the Sentinel 3 A/B OLCI and Sentinel 2 A/B MSI satellite platforms suggested that blue staining encompassed 0.68 +/- 0.24 km(2) (4.25 +/- 1.5% of lake surface area), persisted over 4 weeks, and was located within 50 m of the lakeshore in regions where fall blooms of cyanobacteria had been particularly dense. Although toxin levels were low (similar to 0.2 mu g microcystin/L), high concentrations of C-phycocyanin raised public concern over eutrophication, pollution, and climate change, and resulted in rapid governmental and academic response. Given that climate change and nutrient pollution are increasing the magnitude and duration of cyanobacterial blooms, blue staining of lake ice may become widespread in eutrophic lakes subject to ice cover.

TI  - Global trends in vegetation fractional cover: Hotspots for change in bare soil and non-photosynthetic vegetation
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation Fractional Cover (VFC) is an important indicator of the condition of the terrestrial surface of the Earth. The dynamics of bare soil (BS), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and photosynthetic vegetation (PV) fractions reveal patterns of growth, senescence, dormancy and regeneration. The dynamics also reveal trends in land cover and land use management across the globe. Analysis of satellite data has indicated increasing greenness of the land surface however the dynamics of the NPV and BS fractions are equally important indicators of many elements of ecosystem function and sustainability. In this study, we provide a comprehensive assessment of trends in VFC for the global terrestrial land surface based on a trend analysis over the period 2001-2018 using the Global Vegetation Fractional Cover Product. Trends were analysed by Mann-Kendell regressions over 18 years for each month of the year. Monthly maps of significant trend areas were aggregated to provide seasonal assessments. Areas and percentage areas of positive and negative trends were compiled for United Nations Subregions, Countries and Ecoregions. Significant negative trends in BS occurred across 20 M km2 of the terrestrial land surface. Although the areas of negative trends in BS were largest in China and India, the top 24 countries by area were widely distributed across the world. However, BS increased significantly across more than 11 M km2. Eleven of the top 24 ranked countries for area of increasing BS were in Africa. Substantial areas exhibited negative trends in NPV split between China and India where PV was increasing, and drylands in Asia and Africa where BS was increasing. Analysis of covariate factors at country scale inferred an association between significant increase in BS and long-term drought and increases in livestock populations. The positive trends in BS and negative trends in NPV are indicators of current and future risk for soil erosion, habitat change, and reduction in ecosystem health across heavily populated regions of the developing world.

TI  - Contributions of genetic and nongenetic sources to variation in cooperative behavior in a cooperative mammal
T2  - EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of cooperative behavior is a major area of research among evolutionary biologists and behavioral ecologists, yet there are few estimates of its heritability or its evolutionary potential, and long-term studies of identifiable individuals are required to disentangle genetic and nongenetic components of cooperative behavior. Here, we use long-term data on over 1800 individually recognizable wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) collected over 30 years and a multigenerational genetic pedigree to partition phenotypic variation in three cooperative behaviors (babysitting, pup feeding, and sentinel behavior) into individual, additive genetic, and other sources, and to assess their repeatability and heritability. In addition to strong effects of sex, age, and dominance status, we found significant repeatability in individual contributions to all three types of cooperative behavior both within and across breeding seasons. Like most other studies of the heritability of social behavior, we found that the heritability of cooperative behavior was low. However, our analysis suggests that a substantial component of the repeatable individual differences in cooperative behavior that we observed was a consequence of additive genetic variation. Our results consequently indicate that cooperative behavior can respond to selection, and suggest scope for further exploration of the genetic basis of social behavior.

TI  - Radar remote sensing as a novel tool to assess the performance of an agri-environment scheme in coastal grasslands
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal grasslands are semi-natural habitats used for agriculture, but they are also vital habitats for many taxa, such as waders. The importance of this habitat for wildlife has found recognition in the policies of the European Union, resulting in the implementation of biodiversity-friendly agri-environment schemes (AES) to ensure the sustainable management of these areas. However, the performance of AESs has often been questioned and data to analyse their effectiveness is mostly lacking.To fill this knowledge gap, we used freely available European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and ground truth data to describe the vegetation height based habitat suitability of coastal grasslands as breeding sites for waders at a country-wide scale in Estonia, where the main threat to this habitat is overgrowing with high sward plant species.We show that satellite remote sensing can be used as a straight-forward and reliable tool to estimate the grazed coastal grassland habitat suitability for breeding waders in terms of vegetation height in two broad classes.We demonstrate that the AES applied on Estonian coastal grasslands is important for improving the suitability of this habitat for the breeding wader community: compared to 24% of suitable habitat in areas where no agricultural subsidies are paid, 60% of the land under the targeted AES is suitably managed for breeding waders. The highest proportion of habitat suitability (76%) is achieved in areas receiving targeted top-up subsidy for wader conservation.Continued monitoring of the performance of the AES is essential for taking timely and targeted conservation actions and we strongly recommend the wider use of remotely sensed data for this purpose. We promote the continuation of the AES scheme applied on Estonian coastal grasslands while improving its efficiency through carefully raised stocking rates and increased uptake of the top-up scheme.

TI  - Analysis and prediction of the impact of technological parameters on cutting force components in rough milling of AZ31 magnesium alloy
T2  - ARCHIVES OF CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper presents the results of experimental study of the AZ31 magnesium alloy milling process. Dry milling was carried out under high-speed machining conditions. First, a stability lobe diagram was determined using CutPro software. Next, experimental studies were carried out to verify the stability lobe diagram. The tests were carried out for different feed per tooth and cutting speed values using two types of tools. During the experimental investigations, cutting forces in three directions were recorded. The obtained time series were subjected to general analysis and analysis using composite multiscale entropy. Modelling and prediction were performed using Statistica Neural Network software, in which two types of neural networks were applied: multi-layered perceptron and radial basis function. It was observed that milling with high cutting speed values allows for component values of cutting force to be lowered as a result of the transition into the high-speed machining conditions range. In most cases, the highest values for the analysed parameters were recorded for the component F-x, whereas the lowest were recorded for F-y. Additionally, the paper shows that a prediction (with the use of artificial neural networks) of the components of cutting force can be made, both for the amplitudes of components of cutting force F-amp and for root mean square F-rms.

TI  - A Comprehensive Molecular and Epidemiological Characterization of Influenza Viruses Circulating 2016-2020 in North Macedonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza viruses know no boundaries, representing an example of rapid virus evolution combined with pressure exerted by the host's immune system. Seasonal influenza causes 4-50 million symptomatic cases in the EU/EEA each year, with a global death toll reaching 650,000 deaths. That being the case, in 2014 North Macedonia introduced the sentinel surveillance in addition to the existing influenza surveillance in order to obtain more precise data on the burden of disease, circulating viruses and to implement timely preventive measures. The aims of this study were to give a comprehensive virological and epidemiological overview of four influenza seasons (2016-2020), assess the frequency and distribution of influenza circulating in North Macedonia and to carry out molecular and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) from ILI and SARI patients. Our results showed that out of 1,632 tested samples, 46.4% were influenza positive, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 accounting for the majority of cases (44%), followed by influenza B (32%) and A(H3N2) (17%). By comparing the sentinel surveillance system to the routine surveillance system, we showed that the newly applied system works efficiently and gives great results in the selection of cases. Statistically significant differences (p = < 0.0000001) were observed when comparing the number of reported ILI cases among patients aged 0-4, 5-14, 15-29, and 30-64 years to the reference age group. The phylogenetic analysis of the HA sequences unveiled the resemblance of mutations circulating seasonally worldwide, with a vast majority of circulating viruses belonging to subclade 6B.1A. The PROVEAN analysis showed that the D187A substitution in the receptor binding site (RBS) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 HA has a deleterious effect on the its function. The A(H3N2) viruses fell into the 3C.2a and 3C.3a throughout the analyzed seasons. Molecular characterization revealed that various substitutions in the A(H3N2) viruses gradually replaced the parental variant in subsequent seasons before becoming the dominant variant. With the introduction of sentinel surveillance, accompanied by the advances made in whole-genome sequencing and vaccine therapeutics, public health officials can now modify their approach in disease management and intervene effectively and in a timely manner to prevent major morbidity and mortality from influenza.</p>

TI  - Brief communication: Detection of glacier surge activity using cloud computing of Sentinel-1 radar data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - For studying the flow of glaciers and their response to climate change it is important to detect glacier surges. Here, we compute within Google Earth Engine the normalized differences between winter maxima of Sentinel-1 C-band radar backscatter image stacks over subsequent years. We arrive at a global map of annual backscatter changes, which are for glaciers in most cases related to changed crevassing associated with surge-type activity. For our demonstration period 2018-2019 we detected 69 surging glaciers, with many of them not classified so far as surge type. Comparison with glacier surface velocities shows that we reliably find known surge activities. Our method can support operational monitoring of glacier surges and some other special events such as large rock and snow avalanches.

TI  - Three-dimensional and long-term landslide displacement estimation by fusing C- and L-band SAR observations: A case study in Gongjue County, Tibet, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a large number of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has been introduced into landslide in-vestigations with the growing launch of new SAR satellites, such as ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1. Therefore, it is appropriate to develop new approaches to retrieve three-dimensional (3D) displacements and long-term (> 10 years) displacement time series to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution and creep behavior of landslides. In this study, a new approach for the estimation of 3D and long-term displacement time series of landslides, based on the fusion of C-and L-band SAR observations, is presented. This method is applied to map 3D and long-term dis-placements (nearly 12 years) of the landslides in Gongjue County, Tibet in China; four sets of SAR images from different platforms (i.e., L-band ascending ALOS/PALSAR-1, C-band descending ENVISAT, and C-band ascending and descending Sentinel-1 SAR datasets) covering the period of January 2007 to November 2018 were collected and exploited. First, the assumption that the landslide moves parallel to its ground surface is used to produce 3D displacement rates and time series by fusing ascending and descending Sentinel-1 SAR images, from which the optimal sliding direction for each pixel of the slope is well estimated. Then, the long-term displacement time-series of the landslide between January 2007 and October 2018 in the estimated sliding direction is recovered by fusing L-band ALOS/PALSAR-1 and C-band Sentinel-1 SAR images. In order to fill the time gap of nearly four years between ALOS/PALSAR-1 and Sentinel-1 SAR images, the Tikhonov regularization (TR) method is developed to establish the observational equation. Moreover, to solve the problem arising from ALOS/PALSAR-1 and Sentinel-1 images with different wavelengths, incidence angles and flight directions, the measurements from ALOS/PALSAR-1 and Sentinel-1 images are both projected to the estimated optimal sliding direction to achieve a unified displacement datum. Our results from ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images suggest that the maximum displacement rates of the study area in the vertical and east-west directions from December 2016 to October 2018 were greater than 70 and 80 mm/year, respectively, and 2D displacement results reveal that the displacement patterns and movement characteristics of all the detected landslides are not identical in the study area. Specifically, the 3D displacement results successfully revealed the spatiotemporal displacement patterns and movement direction of each block of the Shadong landslide, and long-term displacement time series showed for the first time that the maximum cumulative displacement exceeds 1.3 m from January 2007 to October 2018. Moreover, the kinematic evolution and possible driving factors of landslides were investigated using 2D and 3D and long-term displacement results, coupled with hydrological factors and unidimensional constitutive models of the rocks.

TI  - Do industrial parks generate intra-heat island effects in cities? New evidence, quantitative methods, and contributing factors from a spatiotemporal analysis of top steel plants in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial parks emit large amounts of anthropogenic heat and aggravate the urban heat island effect, which has become a severe environmental problem worldwide. Few studies explored if the warming effect generated by concentrated industrial facilities (i.e., steel plants in this study) produces an intra-heat island effect in urban built-up areas. Sufficient evidence of an industrial heat island (IHI) effect is lacking, and new quantitative methods are urgently needed to address these issues. Therefore, we proposed a new scheme to quantify the warming effect of large, heat-emitting urban objects versus complex surroundings, and the IHI effect was accordingly defined at a finer scale. This study separated the industrial park from other artificial lands and comprehensively estimated the IHI effects' spatiotemporal variation. The IHI intensities were measured based on varied natural and urbanized references, which provided new evidence for the existence of the IHI effect over space and seasons. The land surface temperature (LST) profiles delineated the downward trend in LST variation from inside to surroundings in the IHI cases on both spatial and temporal scales. The time-series analysis revealed that the IHI effects demonstrated more significant disparities regarding the LSTs between the industrial parks and their surrounding backgrounds during warm seasons than in cold seasons. And a more severe IHI effect was observed in spring and summer, and the weakest IHI intensity occurred in winter. Moreover, the IHI intensity is positively associated to the anthropogenic heat, indicating that the industrial activities contribute to the increased LSTs of the industrial park to a great extent. The rationale of the IHI effect can broaden insight for understanding how urban industrial heat sources influence the regional thermal environment, especially at a finer scale.

TI  - RIPK3 and AXL Expression Study in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma Unmasks AXL as Predictor of Sentinel Node Metastasis: A Pilot Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant melanoma (MM) is the most lethal skin cancer. AXL is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in several oncogenic processes and might play a role in blocking necroptosis (a regulated cell death mechanism) in MM through the downregulation of the necroptotic-related driver RIPK3. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of the expression of AXL and RIPK3 in 108 primary cutaneous MMs. Association between AXL and RIPK3 immunoreactivity and clinical-pathological variables, sentinel lymph node status, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was assessed. Immunoreaction in tumor cells was detected in 30 cases (28%; range, 5%-80%) and in 17 cases (16%; range, 5%-50%) for AXL and RIPK3, respectively. Metastases in the sentinel lymph nodes were detected in 14 out of 61 patients, and these were associated with AXL-positive immunoreactivity in the primary tumor (p < 0.0001). No association between AXL and TILs was found. RIPK3 immunoreactivity was not associated with any variables. A final logistic regression analysis showed Breslow and AXL-positive immunoreactivity as the stronger predictor for positive sentinel node status [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96]. AXL could be a potential new biomarker for MM risk assessment, and it deserves to be further investigated in larger studies.

TI  - Estimation of air temperature and the mountain-mass effect in the Yellow River Basin using multi-source data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative studies of the multiple factors influencing the mountain-mass effect, which causes higher temperatures in mountainous than non-mountainous regions, remain insufficient. This study estimated the air temperature in the Yellow River Basin, which spans three different elevation ranges, using multi-source data to address the uneven distribution of regional meteorological stations. The differences in mountain-mass effect for different geomorphic regions at the same altitude were then compared. The Manner-Kendall nonparametric test was used to analyse time series changes in temperature. Moreover, we employed the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, with MODIS land-surface and air-temperature data, station-based meteorological data, vertical temperature gradients corresponding to the 2000-2015 period, and elevation data, to estimate the correlation between monthly mean surface temperature and air temperature in the Yellow River Basin. The following major results were obtained. (1) The GWR method and ground station-based observations enhanced the accuracy of air-temperature estimates with an error of only +/- 0.74 degrees C. (2) The estimated annual variations in the spatial distributions of 12-month average temperatures showed that the upper Tibetan Plateau is characterised by low annual air temperatures with a narrow spatial distribution, whereas north-eastern areas upstream of the Inner Mongolia Plateau are characterised by higher air temperatures. Changes in the average monthly air temperature were also high in the middle and lower reaches, with a narrow spatial distribution. (3) Considering the seasonal variation in the temperature lapse rate, the mountain-mass effect in the Yellow River Basin was very high. In the middle of each season, the variation of air temperature at a given altitude over the Tibetan Plateau was higher than that over the Loess Plateau and Jinji Mountain. The results of this study reveal the unique temperature characteristics of the Yellow River Basin according to its geomorphology. Furthermore, this research contributes to quantifying mountain-mass effects.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this research is to verify the activity state of landslides provided by an existing landslide inventory map using Persistent Scatterers (PS) Interferometry (PSInSAR). The study was conducted in the Malopolskie municipality, a rural setting with sparse urbanization in the Polish Flysch Carpathians. PSInSAR has been applied using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel 1A/B with different acquisition geometries (ascending and descending orbit) to increase PS coverage and mitigate the geometric effects due to layover and shadowing. The Line-Of-Sight PSInSAR measurements were projected to the steepest slope, which allowed to homogenize the results from diverse acquisition modes and to compare the displacement velocities with different slope orientations. Additionally, landslide intensity (motion rate) and expected damage maps were generated and verified during field investigations. A high correlation between PSInSAR results and insitu damage observations was confirmed. The activity state and landslide-related expected damage maps have been confirmed for 43 out of a total of 50 landslides investigated in the field. The short temporal baseline provided by both Sentinel satellites (1A/B data) increases the PS density significantly. The study substantiates the usefulness of SAR based landslide activity monitoring for land use and land development, even in rural areas.

T2  - BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of generalist predators has long been considered an important component of mortality for many agricultural pests but can be difficult to quantify. We present the use of digital imaging as a means of both identifying key stink bug egg predators and measuring their relative impact on egg survivorship. Brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys and bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris, two exotic stink bugs new to California, are now widely distributed throughout the state. A survey was conducted to identify resident natural enemies of their eggs. A field camera aided in the identification of arthropods attacking these eggs and their relative impact. Predation of BMSB eggs, which are naturally oviposited onto plant foliage, was less than for eggs of bagrada bug, which oviposit onto and into soil. The top ranked predators of BMSB eggs were the carabid Laemostenus complanatus (Coleoptera) the European earwig Forficula auricularia and ring-legged earwig Euborellia annulipes (Dermaptera), the oriental cockroach Blatta orientalis (Orthoptera), and the spider Trachelas spp. (Araneae). The two most common and important predators of bagrada bug were two ant species (Formicidae), Solenopsis xyloni and Monomorium ergatogyna, and species of Collembola (Entomobryidae). A Predation Index was developed to compare the relative importance of BMSB egg predators. Lastly, two striking, unanticipated results are reported: an apparent synergistic interaction between the spider Trachelas spp. and native ant M. ergatogyna in causing damage to sentinel eggs of BMSB, and the predaceous role for Collembola on bagrada bug sentinel eggs.

TI  - Integrating InSAR and deep-learning for modeling and predicting subsidence over the adjacent area of Lake Urmia, Iran
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR processing is vastly used for land deformation monitoring from the space. Machine learning methods are known as strong tools for data modeling as well as predicting. In this study, we are going to model and predict the future behavior of land subsidence by InSAR processing and leveraging deep learning methods over the lands in the vicinity of Lake Urmia (located in the northwest of Iran). Accordingly, Sentinel-1 data over 56 months from November 2014 to June 2019 and small baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR methods were utilized. Several regions with a high rate of subsidence were identified (maximum monthly subsidence of 13.3 mm). Furthermore, environmental factors affecting subsidence were considered. Therefore, parameters such as rainfall, groundwater, and lake area variations were measured using TRMM, GRACE, and MODIS satellite data, respectively. In order to determine and assess the relation between land deformations and environmental variations, several machine learning methods were implemented. The environmental parameters were used as the input of models and ground deformations as the target to be predicted. Eventually, ground deformations were estimated using multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, in which each network had strengths and weaknesses on different occasions. Thus, by blending the forecast of the three models, a weighted ensemble was constructed, which outperformed the single models and reached the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation (SD) of 8.2 mm, 6.4 mm, and +/- 5.2 mm, respectively. The result indicated that although each single model had proper accuracy, an ensemble model can improve land deformation anticipation using the strength of networks in various conditions.

TI  - Quantitative and Semi-quantitative Methods for Assessing the Degree of Methylene Blue Staining in Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Dogs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To develop a digital algorithm for quantitative assessment of surface methylene blue staining in whole lymph nodes and validate a semi-quantitative visual scoring method for patient-side use.Methods: Lymph nodes from canine patients with spontaneous tumors undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping were prospectively assessed ex vivo and photographed. Using an open-source computer-based imaging software, an algorithm was developed for quantification of staining based on a signal-to-background ratio. Next, two blinded observers evaluated images and assigned a semi-quantitative visual score based on surface staining (0-no blue stain, 1-1-50% stained, and 2-51-100% stained) and those results were compared to the established quantitative standard.Results: Forty-three lymph nodes were included. Image analysis successfully quantified blue staining and differentiated from normal lymph node tissue in all cases. Agreement between observers using the Kappa coefficient demonstrated strong agreement (k = 0.8581, p < 0.0001) between semi-quantitative visual scoring and image analysis. There was substantial interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the scoring system (k = 0.7340, p < 0.0001 and k = 0.8983, p < 0.0001, respectively).Conclusion: A digital algorithm using an open-source software was simple and straightforward to use for quantification of blue staining. The use of a semi-quantitative visual scoring system shows promise for a simple, objective, repeatable assessment of methylene blue staining at the time of surgery. This study demonstrates reliable and repeatable methods for blue staining quantification thereby providing a novel and objective reporting mechanism in scientific research involving sentinel lymph node mapping.

TI  - Assessment of chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms over Kakinada and Yanam turbid coastal waters along east coast of India using Sentinel-3A OLCI and Sentinel-2A MSI sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton Chlorophyll concentration (Chl-a) is a prominent indicator to understand the health and productivity of marine ecosystems that depend on the spatial distribution of Phytoplankton in the ocean waters. The spatial and temporal variability of Chl-a makes it difficult to monitor the coastal waters using in-situ data alone. This study aims to retrieve the Chl-a distribution in Yanam and Kakinada turbid coastal waters using Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) algorithms from Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI data. The FLH products show moderate correlation with retrieved and in-situ Chl-a data, whereas the MCI products show exceptionally good correlation with both the data. Assessment results show a better correlation between in-situ and retrieved Chl-a derived from Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 satellite data (R-2 = 0.858; R-2 = 0.883). The final results show that the S2MCI product gives the best results compared to S3MCI to retrieve Chl-a in the study area. Analysis results demonstrate that FLH algorithm and models are limited to the coastal area with Chl-a 4 mg/m(3), whereas MCI algorithm is recommended for Chl-a 4 mg/m(3). The S2MCI algorithm shows better performance with root mean square error (RMSE = 0.76) and mean absolute relative error (MARE = 1.14) for Chlorophyll retrieval compared with other algorithms. The MCI algorithm is more effectively used to retrieve the Chl-a in the study area. Moreover, this study also demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data for better observation and retrieval of Chl-a distribution over the turbid coastal waters.

TI  - Persistent impact of spring floods on crop loss in U.S. Midwest
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate extremes threaten global food security, and compound events, such as late spring heavy and warmer rainfall over snow and subsequent flooding, exacerbate this vulnerability. Despite frequent occurrences in recent years, a quantitative understanding of the compound weather events' impacts remains elusive. Here, we use Synthetic Aperture Radar data from Sentinel-1 and normalized difference vegetation index data from MODIS satellites to map the spring 2019 U.S. Midwest flood extent and evaluate its impact on crop loss. We find a statistically significant association between flooded counties and those with plant greenup delay, while the correlation between flood area percent and amount of green-up delay remains weak, albeit reliable. An analysis of the stream gage time series and crop loss records shows that during the past similar to 70 years, similar to 43% of spring large discharges are associated with widespread crop loss. We also find an increase in streams' discharge frequency and magnitude across the Midwest, indicating the possibility of a future increase in crop loss due to spring flooding. This study highlights the importance of Earth-observing satellite data for developing climate adaptation and resilience plans.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Sentinel-2 MSI is one of the core missions of the Copernicus Earth Observation programme of the European Union. This mission shows great potential to map the regional high-resolution spatio-temporal dynamics of land use and land cover. In tropical regions, despite the high revisiting time of 5 days including both Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites, the frequent presence of clouds, cloud-shadows, haze and other atmospheric contaminants are precluding the visibility of the Earth surface up to several months. In this paper we present four annual pan-tropical cloud-free composites computed and exported from Google Earth Engine (GEE) by making use of available Sentinel-2 L1C collection for the period spanning from 2015 to 2020. We furthermore propose empirical approaches to reduce the BRDF effect over tropical forest areas by showing pros and cons of image-based versus swath-based methodologies. Additionally, we provide a dedicated web-platform offering a fast and intuitive way to browse and explore the proposed annual composites as well as layers of potential annual changes as a ready-to-use means to visually identify and verify degradation and deforestation activities as well as other land cover changes.

TI  - Reservoir metrics estimated by remote sensors based on the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial reservoirs produce most of the electric power generated in Brazil, and they are essential for water supply. Hence, sustainable management of water reservoirs, along with constant monitoring of water quality and quantity through effective and low-cost technologies, such as remote sensing, is vital to avoid hydrological stress and prevent water crises. However, monitoring longterm time series of reservoir parameters can be limited by data availability and the computing power of the available machinery. Therefore, the present study proposes a method that combines the use of a digital elevation model (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission [SRTM]) and Landsat images with the Google Earth Engine cloud processing platform to monitor multiple reservoir metrics (surface area, water level, and useful storage). The method was applied to study these metrics between 2009 and 2020 for the Corumba IV water dam, Goias, Brazil, where 24 mosaic images, one for each 6-month period, were obtained by filtering cloudy pixels and selecting pixels of better quality. Composite RGB images of short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and red (SWIR1/NIR/R) bands were transformed to HSV to classify the water pixels and estimate the surface area of the reservoir. Area estimates were then 1) used to assess water level and useful storage through linear fitting (regression method [RM]); and 2) combined with SRTM elevation to obtain water level and useful storage (elevation method [EM]). Metrics of rainy and dry seasons that were calculated using linear RM of surface area estimates produced good results, with a coefficient of determination of 0.74 and 0.78 for determining water level and useful storage, respectively. However, the use of SRTM elevation information (EM) provided an even more efficient estimation method, with coefficients of determination of 0.84 and 0.95 for water level and useful storage estimates, respectively.

TI  - More sentinel lymph node biopsies for thin melanomas after transition to AJCC 8th edition do not increase positivity rate: A Danish population-based study of 7148 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We evaluated the outcome of sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) in patients with thin melanoma before and after the implementation of AJCC 8th edition (AJCC8) and identified predictors of positive sentinel lymph nodes (+SLN). Methods Patients diagnosed with T1 melanomas (Breslow thickness <= 1 mm) during 2016-2017 as per AJCC 7th edition (AJCC7) (n = 3414) and 2018-2019 as per AJCC8 (n = 3734) were identified in the Danish Melanoma Database. Results More SLNBs were performed in the AJCC8 cohort compared to the AJCC7 (22.2% vs. 16.2%, p < 0.001), with no significant difference in +SLN rates (4.7% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.118). In the AJCC7 + SLN subgroup, no melanomas were ulcerated, 94.6% had mitotic rate (MR) >= 1, 67.6% were >= 0.8 mm and 32.4% would be T1a according to AJCC8. In the AJCC8 + SLN subgroup, 10.3% were ulcerated, 74.4% had MR >= 1, 97.4% were >= 0.8 mm and 23.1% would be T1a according to AJCC7. On multivariable analysis younger age and MR >= 1 were significant predictors of +SLN. Conclusion More SLNBs were performed in T1 melanomas after transition to AJCC8 without an increase in +SLN rate. None of the AJCC8 T1b criteria were significant predictors of +SLN. We suggest that mitosis and younger age should be considered as indications for SLNB in thin melanoma.

TI  - Investigation of the Anisotropic Patterns in the Altimeter Backscatter Measurements Over Ocean Wave Surfaces
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article attempts to analyze the influence of the anisotropic effects of the ocean wave surface on SAR altimetry backscatter coefficient (Sigma- 0) measurements, which has not been intensively addressed in publications. Data of Sentinel-3A, Cryosat-2, and Jason-3 altimeters allocated by the WW3 numeric wave model were analyzed, and the patterns of Sigma-0 with respect to the wave direction were acquired under similar to 2m significant wave height. The ocean waves were classified into six categories, among which the moderate swell and short win-wave cases were analyzed intensively. Swell-dominated ocean surface shows less randomness than the wind-wave-dominated ocean surface. Clear and significant sinusoid trends are found in the Sigma-0 and SSB patterns of both operational modes (SAR mode and PLRM mode) of the Sentinel-3A altimeter for the moderate swell case, indicating the sensitivity of Sigma-0 and SSB measurements to the anisotropic features of the altimeter measurements. The anisotropic pattern in the Sentinel-3A PLRM Sigma-0 is somewhat counterintuitive, but the analysis of Jason-3 altimeter data would show similar results. Additionally, by comparing the anisotropic patterns of two orthogonally polarized SAR altimeters (Sentinel-3A and Cryosat-2), we could draw the conclusion that the Sigma-0 measurements are not sensitive to the polarization mode. As for the SSHA patterns, no clear sinusoid could be identified for the moderate swell. A possible explanation is that the SSB pattern may be overwhelmed in the complicated factors that can influence the SSHA pattern.

TI  - GCI30: a global dataset of 30 m cropping intensity using multisource remote sensing imagery
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The global distribution of cropping intensity (CI) is essential to our understanding of agricultural land use management on Earth. Optical remote sensing has revolutionized our ability to map CI over large areas in a repeated and cost-efficient manner. Previous studies have mainly focused on investigating the spatiotemporal patterns of CI ranging from regions to the entire globe with the use of coarse-resolution data, which are inadequate for characterizing farming practices within heterogeneous landscapes. To fill this knowledge gap, in this study, we utilized multiple satellite data to develop a global, spatially continuous CI map dataset at 30m resolution (GCI30). Accuracy assessments indicated that GCI30 exhibited high agreement with visually interpreted validation samples and in situ observations from the PhenoCam network. We carried out both statistical and spatial comparisons of GCI30 with six existing global CI estimates. Based on GCI30, we estimated that the global average annual CI during 2016-2018 was 1.05, which is close to the mean (1.09) and median (1.07) CI values of the existing six global CI estimates, although the spatial resolution and temporal coverage vary significantly among products. A spatial comparison with two satellite-based land surface phenology products further suggested that GCI30 was not only capable of capturing the overall pattern of global CI but also provided many spatial details. GCI30 indicated that single cropping was the primary agricultural system on Earth, accounting for 81.57% (12.28 x 10(6) km(2)) of the world's cropland extent. Multiple-cropping systems, on the other hand, were commonly observed in South America and Asia. We found large variations across countries and agroecological zones, reflecting the joint control of natural and anthropogenic drivers on regulating cropping practices. As the first global-coverage, fine-resolution CI product, GCI30 is expected to fill the data gap for promoting sustainable agriculture by depicting worldwide diversity of agricultural land use intensity. The GCI30 dataset is available on Harvard Dataverse: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/86M4PO (Zhang et al., 2020).

TI  - A comparative mapping of plant species diversity using ensemble learning algorithms combined with high accuracy surface modeling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant species diversity (PSD) has always been an essential component of biodiversity and plays an important role in ecosystem functions and services. However, it is still a huge challenge to simulate the spatial distribution of PSD due to the difficulties of data acquisition and unsatisfactory performance of predicting algorithms over large areas. A surge in the number of remote sensing imagery, along with the great success of machine learning, opens new opportunities for the mapping of PSD. Therefore, different machine learning algorithms combined with high-accuracy surface modeling (HASM) were firstly proposed to predict the PSD in the Xinghai, northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Spectral reflectance and vegetation indices, generated from Landsat 8 images, and environmental variables were taken as the potential explanatory factors of machine learning models including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), ridge regression (Ridge), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF). The prediction generated from these machine learning methods and in situ observation data were integrated by using HASM for the high-accuracy mapping of PSD including three species diversity indices. The results showed that PSD was closely associated with vegetation indices, followed by spectral reflectance and environmental factors. XGBoost combined with HASM (HASM-XGBoost) showed the best performance with the lowest MAE and RMSE. Our results suggested that the fusion of heterogeneous data and the ensemble of heterogeneous models may revolutionize our ability to predict the PSD over large areas, especially in some places limited by sparse field samples.

TI  - Pansharpening approach via two-stream detail injection based on relativistic generative adversarial networks
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of pansharpening technique is to reconstruct a high resolution spectral image (HRMS) from a low spatial resolution multispectral image (MS) and a high spatial resolution single band panchromatic (PAN) image. As the efficacy of such a technique relies upon its capability to reinforce the spatial information of the MS image while conserving its spectral signature, in this paper, we propose DI-GAN, an effective Detail Injection Generative Adversarial Network for remote sensing image pansharpening. DI-GAN employs a deep two-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) generator model to combine the spatial information available on the PAN image and the spectral characteristic belonging to the MS image, in order to predict the high frequency detail to be accurately injected into the MS image to reconstruct the desired HRMS. An original loss function is particularly proposed to encourage the network to predict only high-frequency detail. DI-GAN incorporates in parallel a Relativistic Discriminator that allows the pansharpening products to be more realistic. Experimental results at degraded and full scale on three different datasets were showed that the proposed fusion approach can produce superior pansharpening performances in terms of spatial and spectral fidelities with respect to the literature techniques, including CNN-and GAN-based methods.

TI  - Timescales of magma transport in the Columbia River flood basalts, determined by paleomagnetic data
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood basalts represent major events in Earth History, in part because they are linked to large climate perturbations and mass extinctions. However, the durations of individual flood basalt eruptions, which directly impact potential environmental crises, are poorly constrained. Here we use a combination of paleomagnetic data and thermal modeling to create a magnetic geothermometer (MGT) that can constrain the active transport lifetime of magmatic conduits and intrusions. We apply the MGT technique to eight feeder dike segments of the Columbia River basalts (CRB), demonstrating that some dike segments were actively heating host rocks for less than one month, while other segments may have been active for several years. Results suggest that eruption rates, localized spatially along-strike of dike segments, were as high as 1-8 km(3)day(-1). These results help contextualize field evidence for contrasting CRB eruption durations and suggest a pathway for constraining the tempo of global flood basalt magmatism that is beyond the resolution of geochronology.

TI  - Factors predicting morbidity in surgically-staged high-risk endometrial cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate factors predicting the risk of developing 90-day postoperative complications and lymphatic-specific morbidity in patients undergoing surgical staging for high-risk endometrial cancer. Methods: This is a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study. Patients affected by apparent early-stage high-risk endometrial cancer (endometrioid FIGO grade 3 with deep myometrial invasion and nonendometrioid endometrial cancer) undergoing surgical staging between 2007 and 2019. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Martin criteria were applied to improve quality of complications reporting. Results: Charts of 279 patients were evaluated. Lymphadenectomy, sentinel node mapping (SNM), and SNM followed by back-up lymphadenectomy were performed in 83 (29.7%), 50 (17.9%), and 146 (52.4%) patients, respectively. The former group of patients included 13 patients who had lymphadenectomy after the failure of the SNM technique. Thirteen (4.6%) patients developed severe postoperative events (grade 3 or worse). At multivariate analysis, body mass index (OR: 1.08 (95%CI: 1.01, 1.17)) and open abdominal surgery (OR: 2.27 (95%CI: 1.02, 5.32)) were the two independent factors predictive of surgery-related morbidity. Seven severe lymphatic complications occurred. The adoption of laparoscopic approach (p < 0.001, log-rank test) and SNM (p = 0.038, log-rank test) correlated with a lower risk of developing surgery-related events. Independently, open abdominal surgery was associated with an increased risk of developing lymphatic morbidity (OR: 37.4 (95%CI: 4.38, 319.5); p = 0.001). Conclusion: The adoption of the laparoscopic approach and SNM technique were associated with lower 90-day complication rates than open surgery in high-risk endometrial cancer undergoing staging surgery.

TI  - Assessment of suspended sediment dynamics in a small ungauged badland catchment in the Northern Apennines (Italy) using an in-situ laser diffraction method
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The volumes and dynamics of suspended sediments drained from a watershed are often unknown, especially in small creeks and tributaries where continuous discharge measurements are seldom available. The objective of this study was to assess in a qualitative and quantitative way the sediment dynamics of a small ungauged watershed in the Northern Apennines, Italy. We analysed and correlated the sediment volume concentration and grain-size distribution of the suspended sediments with the precipitation pattern. The study area is a small ungauged watershed (0.15 km(2)) that is dominated by intensive soil erosion processes and related landforms. The basin is oriented East-West with the south-facing slopes characterized by badland erosion processes. The north-facing slopes are cultivated and dominated by rill-interrill erosion phenomena. An morphometrical characterization of the basin was performed using a high-resolution DTM with a 1 x 1 m resolution. Subsequently, the physical characteristics of the topsoil were investigated based on grain size laboratory analysis. A detailed NDVI analysis of the vegetation was performed using Sentinel-2A images. Finally, we assessed the suspended sediments at the outlet of the basin using a laser diffraction technique. The Suspended Sediment Volume Concentration (SSC) and the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of the eroded sediments, provide insights into the morphogenetic processes and the sediment transport dynamics of the basin. The measurements were conducted in autumn 2018 after an intense precipitation period and in spring 2019 after a dry phase. The results show a direct relationship between precipitation and SSC with a delay of about 2 h after the most intense precipitation events. Moreover, we reveal that the SMD values are inversely related to the precipitation due to turbidity effects. The SSC and SMD measurements allow for a detailed assessment of the dynamics between precipitation and suspended sediment load even though discharge volumes were not measured directly.

TI  - Towards the automatic monitoring of deforestation in Brazilian rainforest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is considered one of the main environmental threats to the ecological balance on the planet. At the same time, monitoring changes in forest cover is a major challenge, especially in Brazil, a country with continental dimensions, a vast coverage of tropical forests, and an accelerated ongoing process of illegal deforestation. This study aims to propose and present an integrated automatic methodology for monitoring changes in forest cover, to enable "near real-time" monitoring of vast territorial extensions. Based on the application of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) combined with a logistic growth model, the methodology is aimed at allowing accurate detection of changes in forest cover based on the multitemporal assessment of satellite images. The results show that the combination of the two approaches make the methodology able to pinpoint deforestation processes. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated for the Amazon and Atlantic Rainforest biomes, which are important areas of tropical forests in Brazil. In addition to enabling the agile and accurate identification of forest cover losses and providing efficient computing, the comparative results show that the methodology can be applied to issue alerts of suspected deforestation activity in standalone automatic monitoring systems, and also as a complementary tool to existing systems currently under operation.

TI  - A Review of the Opportunities and Challenges for Using Remote Sensing for Management of Surface-Canopy Forming Kelps
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Surface-canopy forming kelps provide the foundation for ecosystems that are ecologically, culturally, and economically important. However, these kelp forests are naturally dynamic systems that are also threatened by a range of global and local pressures. As a result, there is a need for tools that enable managers to reliably track changes in their distribution, abundance, and health in a timely manner. Remote sensing data availability has increased dramatically in recent years and this data represents a valuable tool for monitoring surface-canopy forming kelps. However, the choice of remote sensing data and analytic approach must be properly matched to management objectives and tailored to the physical and biological characteristics of the region of interest. This review identifies remote sensing datasets and analyses best suited to address different management needs and environmental settings using case studies from the west coast of North America. We highlight the importance of integrating different datasets and approaches to facilitate comparisons across regions and promote coordination of management strategies.</p>

TI  - Field experiment demonstrates the potential utility of satellite-derived reflectance indices for monitoring regeneration of boreal forest communities
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale reforestation efforts require scalable and affordable monitoring technologies to track progress. Boreal forests disturbed by oil and gas development provide an opportunity to utilize ongoing reclamation efforts to assess new monitoring technologies with potential utility to other regions. In this study, we tested the application of reflectance indices derived from high spatial resolution satellite imagery to monitor early-stage reforestation. We installed a randomized nursery experiment in Alberta, Canada wherein the total stocking density and relative abundance of four common boreal tree species were manipulated. Satellite imagery from Maxar's WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellites were collected over the experimental plots annually from 2017 through 2020. From these reflectance data, we calculated one texture index, three greenness indices, and one index that integrated both texture and greenness. Finally, two sets of regression models were developed, one of which included only manipulated stem density while the other set included both the density and the mean height of stems in a given year. In the first year of the experiment, we detected no significant differences in any reflectance index across the range of manipulations. Thereafter, all indices showed significant differences, with the integrated texture-greenness index demonstrating the best relative performance among those tested. Our results illustrate the potential for satellite data to yield information regarding tree density and height during the critical early years of restoration. We suggest specific steps that future researchers could use extend this work to other regions and enable potential adoption of this monitoring approach at scale.

TI  - Radiomics model based on shear-wave elastography in the assessment of axillary lymph node status in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To develop and validate an ultrasound elastography radiomics nomogram for preoperative evaluation of the axillary lymph node (ALN) burden in early-stage breast cancer. Methods Data of 303 patients from hospital #1 (training cohort) and 130 cases from hospital #2 (external validation cohort) between Jun 2016 and May 2019 were enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted from shear-wave elastography (SWE) and corresponding B-mode ultrasound (BMUS) images. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms were used to select ALN status-related features. Proportional odds ordinal logistic regression was performed using the radiomics signature together with clinical data, and an ordinal nomogram was subsequently developed. We evaluated its performance using C-index and calibration. Results SWE signature, US-reported LN status, and molecular subtype were independent risk factors associated with ALN status. The nomogram based on these variables showed good discrimination in the training (overall C-index: 0.842; 95%CI, 0.773-0.879) and the validation set (overall C-index: 0.822; 95%CI, 0.765-0.838). For discriminating between disease-free axilla (N0) and any axillary metastasis (N + (>= 1)), it achieved a C-index of 0.845 (95%CI, 0.777-0.914) for the training cohort and 0.817 (95%CI, 0.769-0.865) for the validation cohort. The tool could also discriminate between low (N + (1-2)) and heavy metastatic ALN burden (N + (>= 3)), with a C-index of 0.827 (95%CI, 0.742-0.913) in the training cohort and 0.810 (95%CI, 0.755-0.864) in the validation cohort. Conclusion The radiomics model shows favourable predictive ability for ALN staging in patients with early-stage breast cancer, which could provide incremental information for decision-making.

TI  - Association among sentinel surveillance, meteorological factors, and infectious disease in Gwangju, Korea
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of new infectious diseases is threatening human survival. Transmission of such diseases is determined by several factors, with climate being a very important factor. This study was conducted to assess the correlation between the occurrence of infectious diseases and climatic factors using data from the Sentinel Surveillance System and meteorological data from Gwangju, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea. The climate of Gwangju from June to September is humid, with this city having the highest average temperature, whereas that from December to February is cold and dry. Infection rates of Salmonella (temperature: r = 0.710**; relative humidity: r = 0.669**), E. coli (r = 0.617**; r = 0.626**), rotavirus (r = - 0.408**; r = - 0.618**), norovirus (r = - 0.463**; r = - 0.316**), influenza virus (r = - 0.726**; r = - 0.672**), coronavirus (r = - 0.684**; r = - 0.408**), and coxsackievirus (r = 0.654**; r = 0.548**) have been shown to have a high correlation with seasonal changes, specifically in these meteorological factors. Pathogens showing distinct seasonality in the occurrence of infection were observed, and there was a high correlation with the climate characteristics of Gwangju. In particular, viral diseases show strong seasonality, and further research on this matter is needed. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine and prevention have become important to block the spread of infectious diseases. For this purpose, studies that predict infectivity through various types of data related to infection are important.

TI  - Ongoing Fen-Bog Transition in a Boreal Aapa Mire Inferred from Repeated Field Sampling, Aerial Images, and Landsat Data
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern aapa mire complexes are characterized by patterned fens with flarks (wet fen surfaces) and bog zone margins with Sphagnum moss cover. Evidence exists of a recent increase in Sphagnum over fens that can alter ecosystem functions. Contrast between flarks and Sphagnum moss cover may enable remote sensing of these changes with satellite proxies. We explored recent changes in hydro-morphological patterns and vegetation in a south-boreal aapa mire in Finland and tested the performance of Landsat bands and indices in detecting Sphagnum increase in aapa mires. We combined aerial image analysis and vegetation survey, repeated after 60 years, to support Landsat satellite image analysis. Aerial image analysis revealed a decrease in flark area by 46% between 1947 and 2019. Repeated survey showed increase in Sphagnum mosses (S. pulchrum, S. papillosum) and deep-rooted vascular plants (Menyanthes trifoliata, Carex rostrata). A supervised classification of high-resolution UAV image recognized the legacy of infilled flarks in the patterning of Sphagnum carpets. Among Landsat variables, all separate spectral bands, the Green Difference Vegetation Index (GDVI), and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) correlated with the flark area. Between 1985 and 2020, near-infrared (NIR) and GDVI increased in the central flark area, and AWEI decreased throughout the mire area. In aapa mire complexes, flark fen and Sphagnum bog zones have contrasting Landsat NIR reflectance, and NIR band is suggested for monitoring changes in flarks. The observed increase in Sphagnum mosses supports the interpretation of ongoing fen-bog transitions in Northern European aapa mires, indicating significant ecosystem-scale changes.

TI  - Climate impact from agricultural management practices in the Canadian Prairies: Carbon equivalence due to albedo change
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is generally accepted that land use and land management practices impact climate change through sequestration of carbon in soils, but modulation of surface energy budget can also be important. Using Landsat data to characterize cropland albedos in Canada's three prairie soil zones, this study estimates the atmospheric carbon equivalent drawdown of albedo radiative forcing for three management practices: 1) moving from conventional tillage to no-till, 2) eliminating summer fallow in crop rotations, and 3) growing crops with higher albedos. In a 50-year time horizon, conversion from conventional tillage to no-till results in a total equivalent atmospheric CO2 (CO2-eq) drawdown of 1.0-1.5 kg m(-2), and conversion from summer fallow to crops results in CO2-eq drawdown of 1.1-2.4 kg m(-2). Conversion of summer fallow to crops results in different magnitudes of CO2-eq drawdown depending on specific crops. Lentils, peas, and canola have relatively higher albedo than that of spring wheat and flax; hence, a larger magnitude of CO2-eq drawdown results when they replace summer fallow in the rotation. For the management changes from 1990 to 2019 for the whole Canadian Prairies, albedo changes induced a CO2-eq drawdown of about 179.3 +/- 20.9 Tg due to increased area of no-till, and 101.6 +/- 9.5 Tg due to reduced area under fallow. The study shows that the magnitudes of CO2-eq drawdown due to albedo change are comparable to that due to soil carbon sequestration. Therefore, it is important to account for cropland albedo changes in assessing the potential of agricultural management practices to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Carbonaceous aerosols and their light absorption properties over the Bay of Bengal during continental outflow
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The marine atmosphere of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) is prone to get impacted by anthropogenic aerosols from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Southeast Asia (SEA), particularly during the northeast monsoon (NEM). In this study, we quantify and characterize carbonaceous aerosols and their absorption properties collected in two cruise campaigns onboard ORV Sindhu Sadhana during the continental outflow period over the BoB. Aerosol samples were classified based on the air mass back trajectory analyses, wherein samples were impacted by the continental air parcel (CAP), marine air parcel (MAP), and mix of both (CAP + MAP). Significant variability in the PM10 mass concentration (in mu g m(-3)) is found with a maximum value for MAP samples (75.5 +/- 36.4) followed by CAP + MAP (58.5 +/- 27.3) and CAP (58.5 +/- 27.3). The OC/EC ratio (>2) and diagnostic tracers i.e. nss-K+/EC (0.2-0.96) and nss-K+/OC (0.11-1.32) along with the absorption angstrom exponent (AAE: 4.31-6.02) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived fire counts suggest the dominance of biomass burning emission sources. A positive correlation between OC and EC (i.e. r = 0.86, 0.70, and 0.42 for CAP, MAP, and CAP + MAP, respectively) further confirmed the similar emission sources of carbonaceous species. Similarly, a significant correlation between estimated secondary organic carbon (SOC) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC; r = 0.99, 0.96, and 0.97 for CAP, MAP, and CAP + MAP, respectively) indicate their similar chemical nature as well as dominant contribution of SOC to WSOC. The absorption coefficient (b(abs-365)) and mass absorption efficiency (MAE(BrC-365)) of the soluble fraction were estimated at 365 nm wherein, b(abs-365) showed a linear relationship with WSOC and nss-K+, signifying the contribution of water soluble brown carbon from biomass burning emissions. The estimated MAE(BrC-365) (0.30-0.93 m(2) g(-1)), during this study, was consistent with the earlier observations over the BoB, particularly during the continental outflow season.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of MODIS and VIIRS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products over regions in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol loading has direct and indirect impacts on radiative forcing and climate; additionally, exposure to high aerosol concentrations has adverse effects on human health. Several inversion algorithms are used to retrieve aerosol properties, primarily aerosol optical depth (AOD). Satellite aerosol products are available from several moderate spatial resolution sensors and provide information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of aerosol concentration. This study provides an evaluation and inter-comparison of multiple aerosol products from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution and Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible-Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) between 2014 and 2018 in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. This evaluation focuses on four MODIS aerosol products including Dark Target (DT) AOD retrievals at 10-km and 3-km spatial resolutions, Deep Blue (DB) AOD retrievals at10-km spatial resolution, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD retrievals at 1-km spatial resolution, and VIIRS DB AOD retrievals at 6-km spatial resolution. Satellite-based AOD retrievals are validated against in-situ AOD measurements from three AERONET ground stations located in urban/land, rural/ coastal, and ocean surfaces.The results show that Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the satellite AOD retrievals and AERONET AOD measurements range between 0.45 and 0.93 whilst the Root-Mean-Squared Errors (RMSE) varies from 0.047 to 0.159 which highlights the reliability of satellite AOD retrievals' in the region. The best performing products over the urban/land surface are the MODIS MAIAC and VIIRS DB aerosol products with the RMSE of 0.048-0.061 and a higher percentage (81%-89%) of retrievals falling within expected error for land. Over the ocean, the MODIS DT aerosol products have the lowest errors (RMSE 0.047-0.061) and the highest percentage (70%-80%) of retrievals falling within the expected error. The performances of all algorithms over the rural/ coastal region are poorer in terms of over-and under-estimations of AOD with a small percentage of retrievals (48%-87%) within expected error. Among the satellite aerosol products, the VIIRS aerosol product performs better over the coastal area in terms of high correlation coefficient (r = 0.88), low error (RMSE = 0.059), and the large percentage of retrievals within expected error (88%). The poor performance found over the more complex coastal regions suggests further improvements are needed in land-water-sediment masks, surface reflectance estimation, and aerosol model assumptions over mixed surface types.The aerosol products show the highest agreement (r-0.77-0.98) over the ocean surface whilst the coastal site aerosol products verified the greatest dissimilarity in aerosol loading variations (r-0.50-0.91). Lastly, the good correlation (r > 0.73) between the VIIRS and MODIS AOD products illustrates the potential of VIIRS to provide aerosol data continuity with MODIS.

TI  - Interannual Variation in the Area and Water Volume of Lakes in Different Regions of the Tibet Plateau and Their Responses to Climate Change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The area and volume changes of 20 lakes that were present during the period 1976-2019 in different parts of the Tibet Plateau were extracted using Landsat remote sensing satellite images on the Google Earth Engine platform. Changes in the water volume of the lakes were analyzed using data from the digital elevation model. Basin scale interpolated meteorological data from the China regional surface meteorological feature dataset and the glacier distribution were used together with GIS technology and spatial statistical methods to reveal the impact of climate change and glacial melting water on the changes occurring in different regions. The results showed that both the area and water volume of the 20 studied lakes were generally stable from 1976-1986, increased significantly from 1986-1991, and decreased significantly from 1991-1995, after which they again began to increase. The increase in both amplitude and rate reached the highest values from 1995-2005, while the rate of increase slowed from 2014-2016. Precipitation and temperature are the main factors that result in the rapid increase of the water volume in closed lakes, but the influence of this phenomenon varies in different areas. The climate is relatively "warm and wet" around the inland enclosed lake areas in the southeast of the plateau where precipitation is the dominant factor and both precipitation and temperature affect the lake water volume in the center of the plateau; however, the climate is comparatively "cold and dry" in the northwest and the increase in glacier meltwater that results from increases in the temperature has a more significant impact.

TI  - Risk of hospitalized depression and intentional self-harm with brand and authorized generic sertraline
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent suggestions of therapeutic inequivalence of brand and generic sertraline have raised concerns about disproportionately higher adverse events among generic users.Objective: To assess the impact of confounding in a comparison of the risks of worsening depression and intentional self-harm (ISH) between users of brand name sertraline and its pharmaceutically equivalent authorized generic (AG).Methods: Using a retrospective new-user cohort design, we identified patients with a diagnosis code for depression aged >= 12 years who were continuously enrolled in a Sentinel Data Partner health plan for >= 180 days before their first sertraline dispensing between June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2015. New use was defined as no evidence of sertraline dispensing in the 180 days before index date. We matched each brand name user to up to 10 AG users using propensity scores (PS) and conducted case-centered logistic regression to assess the risks of hospitalized depression and ISH.Results: Before PS matching, brand name users were significantly less likely to be hospitalized for depression [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-0.94)]. However, in the matched analysis, we observed no statistical difference between brand and AG users [HR = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.59-1.21)]. The risk of ISH did not significantly differ between the exposure groups in unmatched (HR = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.60-1.62) and matched analyses [HR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.49-1.70).Conclusion: In depressed patients receiving brand versus AG sertraline, patient characteristics confounded the association with hospitalization. Baseline differences were ameliorated by PS matching resulting in no statistical difference between brand and AG sertraline users.

TI  - Using Fay-Herriot Models and Variable Radius Plot Data to Develop a Stand-Level Inventory and Update a Prior Inventory in the Western Cascades, OR, United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stands are the primary unit for tactical and operational forest planning. Forest managers can use remote-sensing-based forest inventories to precisely estimate attributes of interest at the stand scale. However, remote-sensing-based inventories typically rely on models relating remote-sensing information to forest attributes for fixed area plots with accurate coordinates. The collection of that kind of ground data is expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, remote-sensing-based inventories provide precise descriptions of the forest when the remote-sensing data were collected, but they inevitably become outdated as the forest evolves. Fay-Herriot (FH), models can be used with ground information from variable radius plots even if the plot coordinates are unknown. Thus, they provide an efficient way to update old remote-sensing-based inventories or develop new ones when fixed radius plots are unavailable. In addition, FH models are well described in the small-area estimation literature and allow reporting estimation uncertainties, which is key to incorporating quality controls to remote-sensing inventories. We compared two scenarios developed in the Willamette National Forest, OR, United States, to produce stand-level estimates of above-ground biomass (AGB), and Volume (V) for natural and managed stands. The first, Case 1, was developed using auxiliary data from a recent lidar acquisition. The second, Case 2, was developed to update an old remote-sensing-based inventory. Results showed that FH models allowed for improvements in efficiency with respect to direct stand-level estimates obtained using only field data for both case scenarios and both typologies of stands. Average improvements in efficiency in natural stands were 37.36% for AGB and 33.10% for Volume for FH models from Case 1 and 20.19% for AGB and 19.25 for V for Case 2. For managed stands, average improvements for Case 1 were 2.29 and 19.92% for AGB and V, respectively, and for Case 2, improvements were 15.55% for AGB and 16.05% for V.

TI  - Land use and cover change dynamics in Zambia's Solwezi copper mining district
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - In Anthropocene, Earth's social-ecological systems are experiencing intense pressure as a result of human-induced resource over-exploitation at a magnitude never seen before. Consequently, land use and cover change (LUCC) dynamics have implications for environment through the resultant land degradation. This study focuses on understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics associated with mining activities in Zambia's Solwezi copper mining district. Landsat-5 (TM), Landsat-8 (OLI and TIRS) satellite images were classified using Supervised Classification and Maximum Likelihood Approach in ERDAS Imagine 2015 for the LUCC detection between 1995 and 2019. The images were categorized into six different classes: water body, mine, agriculture, built-up, barren and forest areas. The results show a rapid reduction of forest cover and water body from 82.32% and 1.88% to 54.14% and 0.47% in 1995 and 2019, respectively. Built-up area on the other hand increased from 2.04% in 1995 to 4.9% in 2019. Mine area increased from 0.02% in 1995 to 1.43% in 2019. Barren and agriculture areas both gradually increased from 8.24% and 5.5% to 19.52% and 19.53% in 1995 and 2019, respectively. Thus, there was progressive LUCC with increase in the mining activities in the study area. The results obtained from this study proffer lessons that will benefit policy and environmental management strategies applicable to mining-dominated landscapes. We suggest that multiple stakeholders make use of such baselines to guide conservation planning and mitigation measures in resource-rich and mining-dominated landscapes. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Zooxanthellae Diversity and Coral-Symbiont Associations in the Philippine Archipelago: Specificity and Adaptability Across Thermal Gradients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Prolonged thermal stress and high levels of solar irradiance can disrupt the coral-algal symbiosis and cause bleaching and lowered overall fitness that lead to the likely death of the cnidarian host. Adaptive bleaching and acclimatization of corals, which posits bleaching as an opportunity for the coral host to switch its currently susceptible endosymbionts to more stress-tolerant taxa, offers hope for survival of reefs amid rapidly warming oceans. In this study, we explored the diversity and distribution of coral-zooxanthellae associations in the context of geospatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) and thermal anomalies across the Philippine archipelago. Thermal clusters based on annual sea surface temperature means and each site's frequency of exposure to heat stress were described using three-decade (1985-2018) remotely sensed data. Haphazard sampling of 628 coral fragments was conducted in 14 reef sites over 3 years (2015-2018). Using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprinting and sequencing of the zooxanthellae ITS2 region, we characterized endosymbiont diversity within four reef-building coral families across archipelagic thermal regimes. Consistency in dominant Symbiodiniaceae taxon was observed in Acropora spp., Porites spp., and Heliopora coerulea. In contrast, the family Pocilloporidae (Pocillopora spp., Seriatopora spp., and Stylophora pistillata) exhibited biogeographic variability in zooxanthellae composition, concordant with inferred occurrences of sustained thermal stress. Multivariate analyses identify two broad Pocilloporidae clusters that correspond with mean SST ranges and frequency of exposure to bleaching-level thermal stress which are largely supported by ANOSIM. Differences in zooxanthellae assemblages may reflect host-specific responses to ecological or environmental gradients across biogeographic regions. Such patterns of variability provide insight and support for the adaptability and potential resilience of coral communities in geographically and oceanographically complex regions, especially amidst the increasing severity of global and local-scale stressors.

TI  - Monitoring the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) short-wave infrared (SWIR) module instrument stability using desert sites
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its launch in 2017, Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on S-5P has provided very high quality data using daily global coverage for a number of key atmospheric trace gases. Over its first 1000 d in operation, the short-wave infrared (SWIR) module has been very stable, and the continuously monitored calibration has remained of high quality. This calibration relies on a combination of extensive pre-launch and post-launch measurements, complemented by regular monitoring of internal light sources and background measurements. In this paper we present a method and results for independent validation of the SWIR module calibration and instrument stability by examining the signal stability of a sample of 23 pseudo-invariant calibration desert sites. The data covers over 2 years of operational data. With a Lambertian surface assumption, the results show that the SWIR module has little to no instrument degradation down to an accuracy of about 0.3% yr(-1), validating results obtained from the internal calibration suite. The method presented here will be used as ongoing validation of the SWIR calibration.

TI  - Semi-automated mapping of glacial lakes - a study in Sikkim Himalayas, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Himalayas, rising number of glacial lakes with increase in area of existing lakes is a matter of serious concern and correct mapping is an important step towards regular monitoring of these glacial lakes. This study used Double Window Flexible Pace Search method to identify an optimal threshold of Normalized Difference Water Index value on multi-spectral Sentinel-2 image of 31(st) October 2020. A threshold value of 0.30 is obtained that resulted in identification of 419 glacial lakes with an estimated total area of about 29.86 +/- 6.85 km(2). The results are found to be in close agreement with previously published research article on Sikkim Himalayas and boundaries of classified lakes are validated by overlaying on high resolution PlanetScope dataset for the same date. Hence, this study presents an effective and simple way for mapping of glacial lakes that may further be extended for regular monitoring of glacial lakes in the region.

TI  - Detection of atmosphere CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> spatio-temporal variations by ground-based high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2, CFC-12), as a synthetic chemical agent, is a main stratospheric ozone-depleting substance in atmosphere. Studies of the detection techniques and the temporal and spatial distribution of CFC-12 have great significance in understanding the variation trend of regional CFCs and their influence on stratospheric ozone. In this study, the method of retrieving the vertical profile and total column for CFC-12 is studied based on ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The spectral window for CFC-12 retrieval is selected as 922.5-923.6 cm(-1), where the interfering gases are H2O, O-3, and CO2. The result of error analysis shows that the average total error is 1.27%, including the systematic error 0.76% and random error 1.02%. The vertical profiles and total columns of atmospheric CFC-12 in Hefei during the period from 2017 to 2020 were retrieved based on the optimal estimation algorithm. The vertical profiles of CFC-12 show that the concentration of atmospheric CFC-12 is high in the troposphere and low stratosphere at the altitude of 0-20 km, and then decreases, very low at height above 40 km. The total column average kernel of retrieved CFC-12 profiles is higher at 15-20 km, and the typical signal degree of freedom of CFC-12 is 1.217. Moreover, the long-term total columns of atmosphere CFC12 observed show obvious seasonal variation in Hefei. Total columns of atmosphere CFC-12 are higher in summer and lower in winter and early spring. The maximum monthly concentration of CFC-12 is about 1.13 x 10(16) mol.cm(-2) in July, and the minimum monthly concentration is 1.00 x 10 16 mol.cm(-2) in March. Also, the annual average total columns of atmospheric CFC-12 decreased slightly from 2017 to 2020, with an increasing rate of -0.68%. This reflects the effect of China's implementation of CFCs control ban policy. Furthermore, in order to verify the accuracy of ground-based FTIR observation, we compare our ground-based observation data with ACE-FTS/ SCISAT satellite version 4.1 level 2 data. There are 16 pairs of matching points between satellite observation and ground observation data, and the correlation coefficient is 0.73 for two CFC-12 partial columns at the height of 16-28 km, showing good agreement between ground-based FTIR data and satellite data. The long-term observations demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of ground-based high-resolution FTIR technology for detecting the vertical distribution and seasonal variation of atmosphere CFC-12.

TI  - Analysis of sentinel lymph node biopsy and non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in invasive ductal and invasive lobular breast cancer: a nationwide cross-sectional study (CSBrS-001)
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Information regarding the implementation of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is scarce, and whether ILC patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) can be omitted from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains controversial. This study aimed to compare involvement of SLNs and non-SLNs between patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ILC. Methods: We retrospectively collected the clinical and pathological data of invasive breast cancer patients from 37 medical centers in China from January 2018 to December 2018. The number of resected SLNs, positive rate of SLNs, and non-SLNs metastasis were compared between patients with IDC and ILC. Results: A total of 6,922 patients were included, comprising 6,650 with IDC (96.1%) and 272 with ILC (3.9%). No difference was observed in the number of resected SLNs between patients with IDC and ILC (IDC: 4.0 +/- 1.9 vs. ILC: 3.9 +/- 1.6, P=0.352). The positive rate of SLNs was significantly higher in patients with IDC than that in patients with ILC (19.3% in IDC vs. 12.9% in ILC, P=0.008). The difference in positive rate of SLNs between IDC and ILC was mainly attributed to macro-metastasis. For patients with positive SLNs who received ALND, and those with 1-2 positive SLNs, the metastatic rate of non-SLNs in the ILC group was higher than that in the IDC group (for patients with positive SLNs: 50.0% in ILC vs. 39.9% in IDC, P=0.317; for patients with 1-2 positive SLNs: 45.4% in ILC vs. 34.8% in IDC, P=0.366), but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Patients with ILC had similar number of resected SLNs and lower positive rate of SLNs compared to those with IDC. In participants with 1-2 positive SLNs, the ILC group had an increased tendency for non-SLNs metastasis compared with the IDC group. Surgeons may need to be more cautious about omitting ALND for ILC patients with 1-2 positive SLNs.

TI  - Cryogenic land surface processes shape vegetation biomass patterns in northern European tundra
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tundra ecosystems have experienced changes in vegetation composition, distribution, and productivity over the past century due to climate warming. However, the increase in above-ground biomass may be constrained by cryogenic land surface processes that cause topsoil disturbance and variable microsite conditions. These effects have remained unaccounted for in tundra biomass models, although they can impact multiple opposing feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere, ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Here, by using field-quantified data from northern Europe, remote sensing, and machine learning, we show that cryogenic land surface processes substantially constrain above-ground biomass in tundra. The three surveyed processes (cryoturbation, solifluction, and nivation) collectively reduced biomass by an average of 123.0 g m(-2) (-30.0%). This effect was significant over landscape positions and was especially pronounced in snowbed environments, where the mean reduction in biomass was 57.3%. Our results imply that cryogenic land surface processes are pivotal in shaping future patterns of tundra biomass, as long as cryogenic ground activity is retained by climate warming.Vegetation in tundra ecosystems is constrained by cryogenic land surface processes, despite the fact that models of future biomass changes rarely take these into account, according to field and remote sensing data from northern Europe.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node in Aged Endometrial Cancer Patients "The SAGE Study": A Multicenter Experience
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe incidence of endometrial cancer is increasing in elderly people. Considering that aging progressively affects lymphatic draining function, we aimed to define its impact on IGC uptake during SLN mapping.</p> MethodsA multicenter retrospective cohort of endometrial cancer patients with apparently early-stage endometrial cancer undergoing complete surgical staging with SLN dissection was identified in four referral cancer centers from May 2015 to March 2021. Patients were classified in Group 1 (<65 years old) and Group 2 (>= 65 years old). The primary endpoint was the assessment of the overall, bilateral, and unsuccessful SLN mapping in the two groups. Secondary outcomes were the evaluation of SLN anatomical distribution and the identification of predictors for mapping failure applying a logistic regression.</p> ResultsA total of 844 patients were enrolled in the study (499 in Group 1 and 395 in Group 2). The overall detection rate, the successful bilateral mapping, and the mapping failure rate of the SLN were 93.8% vs. 87.6% (p = 0.002), 77.1% vs. 66.8% (p = 0.001), and 22.9% vs. 33.2% (p = 0.001), respectively, in Group 1 vs. Group 2. The advanced age affects the anatomical distribution of the SLN leading to a stepwise reduction of "unexpected" mapping sites (left hemipelvis: p < 0.001; right hemipelvis: p = 0.058). At multivariate analysis age >= 65 (OR: 1.495, 95% CI: 1.095-2.042, p = 0.011), BMI (OR: 1.023, 95% CI: 1.000-1.046, p = 0.047), non-endometrioid histotype (OR: 1.619, 95% CI: 1.067-2.458, p = 0.024), and LVSI (OR: 1.407, 95% CI: 1.010-1.961, p = 0.044) represent independent predictors of unsuccessful mapping. Applying binomial logistic regression analysis, there was a 1.280-fold increase in the risk of failed mapping for every 10-year-old increase in age (OR: 1.280, 95% CI: 1.108-1.479, p = 0.001). A higher rate of surgical under-staging (0.9% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.012) and adjuvant undertreatment (p = 0.018) was reported in Group 2.</p> ConclusionsOld age represents a risk factor for SLN mapping failure both intrinsically and in relation to the greater incidence of other independent risk factors such as LVSI, non-endometrioid histotype, and BMI. Surgeons should target the usual uptake along UPP during the SLN dissection in this subgroup of patients to minimize mapping failure and the consequent risk of surgical under-staging and adjuvant undertreatment.</p>

TI  - Effects of the number of removed lymph nodes on survival outcome in patients with sentinel node-negative breast cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the gold standard surgical technique for axillary staging in patients with clinically node-negative. However, it is still uncertain what is the optimal number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) to be removed to reduce the false-negative rate. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with a single negative SLN have a worse prognosis than those with two or more negative SLNs. Methods A retrospective review was conducted on a large series of SLN-negative breast cancer patients. Survival outcomes and regional recurrence rate were evaluated according to the number of removed SLNs. Secondly, the contribution of different adjuvant therapies on disease-free survival was explored. Statistical analysis included the chi-square, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results A total of 1080 patients were included in the study. A first group consisted of 328 patients in whom a single SLN was retrieved, and a second group consisted of 752 patients in whom two or more SLNs were retrieved. There was no relevant difference in median DFS (64.9 vs 41.4) for SLN = 1 vs SLN > 1 groups (HR 0.76, CI 95% 0.39-1.46; p = 0.38). A statistically significant difference in mDFS was showed only for HT-treated patients who were SLN = 1 if compared to SLN > 1 (100.6 months versus 35.3 months). Conclusions There is likely a relationship between the number of resected SNL and mDFS. Our results, however, showed no relevant difference in median DFS for SLN = 1 vs SLN > 1 group, except for a subset of the patients treated with hormone therapy.

TI  - Interdisciplinary HIV Sentinel Case Review: Identifying Practices to Prevent Outbreaks in Philadelphia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: The Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative considers cluster and outbreak response essential. This article describes the design, implementation, and early findings of a Philadelphia-based project to systematically assess sentinel cases among priority populations for improving public health infrastructure and preventing future outbreaks.Methods: Sentinel HIV cases (i.e., early-stage or acute infection or molecular cluster cases) were identified among priority populations (Black and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men, youth aged 18-24 years, and transgender people who have sex with men). Chart abstraction and structured interview data were reviewed to determine themes and service gaps and to identify, prioritize, and implement recommendations. Interdisciplinary review teams included individuals with lived experience, frontline staff, and local agency leadership.Results: Data were collected during July 2019-December 2020 and analyzed for 53 of 126 sentinel cases of HIV diagnosed since July 1, 2018. The majority were men who have sex with men (79.3%), those aged 18-24 years (67.9%), and non-Hispanic Black (67.9%). More than half received sexually transmitted infection and HIV testing <= 3 years preceding HIV diagnosis (56.6% and 54.7%, respectively), had a healthcare visit within 12 months before diagnosis (64.2%), and had no evidence of pre-exposure prophylaxis awareness (58.5%). Project recommendations effectuated actions to improve pre-exposure prophylaxis provision, integrate sexually transmitted infection and HIV testing, and educate primary care providers.Conclusions: HIV sentinel case review is a model for health departments to rapidly respond to recent transmission, identify missed HIV prevention opportunities, strengthen community partnerships, and implement programmatic and policy changes. Such efforts may prevent outbreaks and inform longer-term strategies. (C) 2021 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Physics-based secular variation candidate models for the IGRF
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Each International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model released under the auspices of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy comprises a secular variation component that describes the evolution of the main magnetic field anticipated for the 5 years to come. Every Gauss coefficient, up to spherical harmonic degree and order 8, is assumed to undergo its own independent linear evolution. With a mathematical model of the core magnetic field and its time rate of change constructed from geomagnetic observations at hand, a standard prediction of the secular variation (SV) consists of taking the time rate of change of each Gauss coefficient at the final time of analysis as the predicted rate of change. The last three generations of the IGRF have additionally witnessed a growing number of candidate SV models relying upon physics-based forecasts. This surge is motivated by satellite data that now span more than two decades and by the concurrent progress in the numerical modelling of Earth's core dynamics. Satellite data reveal rapid (interannual) geomagnetic features whose imprint can be detrimental to the quality of the IGRF prediction. This calls for forecasting frameworks able to incorporate at least part of the processes responsible for short-term geomagnetic variations. In this letter, we perform a retrospective analysis of the performance of past IGRF SV models and candidates over the past 35 years; we emphasize that over the satellite era, the quality of the 5-year forecasts worsens at times of rapid geomagnetic changes. After the definition of the time scales that are relevant for the IGRF prediction exercise, we cover the strategies followed by past physics-based candidates, which we categorize into a "'core-surface flow" family and a "dynamo" family, noting that both strategies resort to "input" models of the main field and its secular variation constructed from observations. We next review practical lessons learned from our previous attempts. Finally, we discuss possible improvements on the current state of affairs in two directions: the feasibility of incorporating rapid physical processes into the analysis on the one hand, and the accuracy and quantification of the uncertainty impacting input models on the other hand.

TI  - A parameterization of sub-grid topographical effects on solar radiation in the E3SM Land Model (version 1.0): implementation and evaluation over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography exerts significant influences on the incoming solar radiation at the land surface. A few standalone regional and global atmospheric models have included parameterizations for sub-grid topographic effects on solar radiation. However, nearly all Earth system models (ESMs) that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) use a plane-parallel (PP) radiative transfer scheme that assumes that the terrain is flat. In this study, we incorporated a well-validated sub-grid topographic (TOP) parameterization in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) version 1.0 to quantify the effects of sub-grid topography on solar radiation flux, including the shadow effects and multi-scattering between adjacent terrain. We studied the role of sub-grid topography by performing ELM simulations with the PP and TOP schemes over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Additional ELM simulations were performed at multiple spatial resolutions to investigate the role of spatial scale on sub-grid topographic effects on solar radiation. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was used to compare with the ELM simulations. The results show that topography has non-negligible effects on surface energy budget, snow cover, snow depth, and surface temperature over the TP. The absolute differences in surface energy fluxes for net solar radiation, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux between TOP and PP exceed 20, 10, and 5Wm(-2), respectively. The differences in land surface albedo, snow cover fraction, snow depth, and surface temperature between TOP and PP exceed 0.1, 0.1, 10 cm, and 1 K, respectively. The magnitude of the sub-grid topographic effects is dependent on seasons and elevations and is also sensitive to the spatial scales. Although the sub-grid topographic effects on solar radiation are larger with more spatial details at finer spatial scales, they cannot be simply neglected at coarse spatial scales. When compared to MODIS data, incorporating the sub-grid topographic effects overall reduces the biases of ELM in simulating surface energy balance, snow cover, and surface temperature, especially in the high-elevation and snow-covered regions over the TP. The inclusion of sub-grid topographic effects on solar radiation parameterization in ELM will contribute to advancing our understanding of the role of the surface topography on terrestrial processes over complex terrain.

TI  - Critiquing the Canadian Model of Client-Centered Enablement (CMCE) for Indigenous Contexts Critique du Modele canadien d'habilitation centree sur le client (MCHCC) pour les contextes autochtones
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY-REVUE CANADIENNE D ERGOTHERAPIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada outlines the need for health care professionals to create more welcoming spaces for Indigenous Peoples. The scope of occupational therapy is continually expanding-yet the profession itself is grounded in and derived from a dominant Eurocentric worldview, and practice is designed to serve a homogenous Western populace. Purpose. To critically examine the Canadian Model of Client-Centered Enablement (CMCE) for its value within Indigenous contexts. Key Issues. The CMCE is positioned as a client-centered model, however there is a clear hierarchical client-professional relationship threaded throughout. Concepts such as enable, advocate, educate, coach, and coordinate demonstrate paternalistic authority, lacking reciprocity, knowledge-sharing, and power redistribution. Implications. Reimagining health care relationships as entrenched in social interconnectedness demands critical reflection and action. A model of practice that endorses social change and actively addresses colonial power inequities must root its paradigmatic foundations in postcolonial views of health care as a social relationship.

TI  - Evaluation of terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor level 3 daily sea surface temperature using buoy measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based sea surface temperature data is one of the important sources of information for climate and ecological studies, weather forecasting and simulation of atmospheric models. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites provides sea surface temperature products with various temporal and spatial resolutions. In this study, daily 4 km Terra level 3 sea surface temperature products were evaluated using local observations. For this purpose, measurements of National Data Buoy Center standard buoys were used at 14 different points from 2015 to 2018. After extracting high-quality satellite data corresponding to the place and time of buoy measurement, statistical comparison was performed between these two datasets on both day and night. Time series derived from the Terra satellite during the day and night showed an average correlation of 0.93 and 0.96 with buoy measurements. The results showed that Terra level 3 composite for day and night on average determines the Sea Surface Temperature quantity 0.16 C and 0.24 C less than the buoys, respectively. The mean root mean square error of buoy satellite differences during the day and night were 0.76 C and 0.54 C, respectively. Further, in situ measurements and corresponding values obtained from the satellite products were compared in different seasons. In all seasons, the negative bias values of satellite products were higher at night than during the day. On average, the highest error values of Terra sea surface temperature products are related to the summer season, when this parameter reaches its maximum during the year.

TI  - Can the Morphological Quality Index (MQI) be used to determine the ecological status of lowland rivers?
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stream assessment indices have become increasingly important in quantifying the overall status of river networks to define specific targets for restoration initiatives. Such an assessment is particularly needed in degraded environments, such as agricultural streams. Some of these evaluation tools, for instance the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), are resource intensive because they are field based. Indices that are less dependent on detailed field observations, such as the Morphological Quality Index (MQI), can provide a greater spatial coverage at a lower cost. The objectives of this study are to (1) verify whether a river's morphological quality, quantified using the MQI, can predict the fish habitat quality of a stream determined with the QHEI for eastern Canadian lowland streams, (2) compare the morphological quality, estimated solely from remotely sensed data (RMQI), to the standard MQI, (3) test whether a modified MQI (MMQI) is more appropriate than the original index for the eastern Canadian landscape when comparing with the QHEI fish habitat assessment, and (4) considering the near absence of dams in lowland eastern Canadian streams, compare an MQI where dam-related indicators are optional (MQI-OD) with the QHEI. The hydrogeomorphological and ecological conditions of 118 stream reaches, including 97 in agricultural areas, were assessed across Quebec and southern Ontario using the MQI and QHEI. Each stream was initially evaluated using remotely sensed data: 1-m LiDAR (Quebec) and 5-m DEMs (Ontario), historical aerial photography (1964-2010), and orthophotos. Field assessments were conducted to validate fish habitat and morphological data for both indices. A strong correlation was observed at the reach scale between the MQI and QHEI (r = 0.81) and MQI and RMQI (r = 0.95). Both modified MQI (MMQI and MQI-OD) showed stronger correlation than the standard MQI with the QHEI (r = 0.87), likely because the standard MQI slightly overestimates the current quality status at the habitat scale in the case of small agricultural catchments where main pressures are not always represented by artificial structures. However, because the standard MQI performs generally well in the study area, we suggest using it to ensure consistency and facilitate comparison with other regions. The results from this study demonstrate that the MQI can be used to provide an assessment of ecological (fish habitat) quality. In addition, our results indicate that a remote hydrogeomorphological assessment can be conducted to estimate the overall status of stream networks. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Understanding and modelling the effects of wetland on the hydrology and water resources of large African river basins
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important components of many large river systems. Some basin scale hydrological models do include explicit sub-models to deal with wetland impacts, but one of the key challenges is to estimate appropriate parameter values to represent the channel-wetland exchange processes. A combined modelling approach is applied in this study and involves the use of the detailed, daily time-step, LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model to improve the understanding of channel-wetland exchange dynamics and to quantify the wetland parameters of a basin scale hydrological model. While there remain, many uncertainties associated with a lack of sufficient validation data, the LISFLOOD-FP results largely reflect the physical characteristics of the two floodplains (the Luangwa and Barotse in the Zambezi River basin). The LISFLOOD-FP results were also used to estimate the wetland parameters of the basin scale hydrological model with greater confidence and improved the downstream simulations results (albeit marginally). The results suggest that the influence of the floodplain on the monthly Luangwa flow regime is minimal, whereas the Barotse floodplain significantly attenuates the high flows and regulates the low flows of the Upper Zambezi River. The approach implemented in this study presents an important step towards the improvements of water resource assessments modelling for research and practical purposes in data-scarce river basins, however, further work is required to refine the model setup using additional field information related to exchange dynamics as well as high quality remote sensing data.

TI  - Urbanization-induced changes in extreme climate indices in Thailand during 1970-2019
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Applying the homogenized daily data during 1970-2019, this study examined the urbanization effects on changes in a set of extreme climate indices for large cities across Thailand, where has undergone rapid urbanization in recent decades. Analysis revealed positive urbanization effects on a number of the indices related to hot extremes, providing a consistent picture with the previous studies. Larger and more significant urbanization effects were evident for minimum temperature-related extreme indices, probably resulting from stronger nighttime enhancement of the urban heat island (UHI) intensity. From a sub-regional perspective, the urbanization effects for four clusters contributed, on an average, to half of the total trends of temperature extremes. Another noteworthy finding was marked by significant urbanization-induced increases in the amount, frequency, intensity, and magnitude of rainfall extremes at the urban stations in the Bangkok metropolis and the central part of the country. Analysis showed that most of the rainfall indices in this region exhibited a 100% urbanization contribution. These results highlighted that the Bangkok metropolis and its adjacent urban areas experienced substantial increases in climate extremes, resulting in greater risks from their associated disasters. The mechanisms how urbanization has induced changes in climate extremes in Thailand seem to be complex, depending on many factors including increases in UHI intensity, heat absorption in urban boundary layer, urban-rural roughness, anthropogenic aerosol, and pollutant emissions. However, to better understand their underlying physical processes and mechanisms, climate model-based dynamical experiments and additional analysis of highresolution satellite data are further needed.

TI  - Leaf inclination angle and foliage clumping in an evergreen broadleaf <i>Eucalyptus</i> forest under elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - How leaves are presented affects interaction of atmospheric CO2, energy (light), and plant physiology. Plant productivity is primarily determined by the amount of leaf area, leaf orientation and distribution in space. Not much attention has been paid to possible changes in leaf orientation and distribution with elevated CO2, but its effect on plant growth could alter the proportions of sunlit and shaded leaf areas and feedback on carbohydrate available for further growth. We report on first measurements of leaf inclination angle distribution and foliage clumping in a native evergreen Eucalyptus woodland in ambient CO2 and under +150 ppm elevated CO2. We found that a spherical leaf angle distribution was not an appropriate supposition for present species (Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm.) at this site. Our measurements of leaf inclination angles from imagery indicated an erectophile, highly skewed unimodal leaf inclination angle distribution function. We conclude that despite the measured steeper angles under elevated CO2 concentrations, the leaf angle change is not significant and falls within the expected natural variability and uncertainties connected with the measurement method. The lack of a clear response of leaf orientation and foliage clumping to elevated CO2 concentration indicates that the previously produced datasets of leaf inclination angles and foliage clumping maps with Earth observation data may be suitable while modelling carbon and water cycles under climate change.

TI  - Basin-wide hydromorphological analysis of ephemeral streams using machine learning algorithms
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable river management now encompasses a much wider concept that includes hydromorphological and fluvial habitat studies. In ephemeral streams, the geomorphological characterization of channels is complex due to episodic flows and riparian vegetation dynamics. Stream channel survey and classification at the watershed scale provide the basis for geomorphological conservation, process interpretation, assessing sensitivity to disturbance, and identifying reaches that supply and store sediment. Here, we present a stream classification based on a two-step approach: (1) automatic river segmentation based on spatial variability in channel/valley morphology from topographic measurements (LiDAR, light, detection and ranging), and (2) fluvial landform and vegetation density mapping derived from multispectral open-source satellite images (Sentinel-2) using support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. These analyses provide continuous, quantitative spatial values of geometric (channel/valley width, slope gradient, and route distance), landform (active channel and gravel bars with five densities of vegetation cover), and hydraulic (specific stream power) variables. Four stream types were identified in the Rambla de la Viuda catchment (similar to 1500 km(2)), an ephemeral gravel-bed river in eastern Spain. The spatial distribution of channel types is explained by differences in geometry (active channel width, valley width, and slope gradient) and a hydraulic parameter (specific stream power). The landforms/vegetation patterns provided insight on causal relationships between erosion and deposition processes during high flow periods and the time since the most recent large disruptive flood event. Channel type distribution provided first-order predictions about the location of reaches that supply and store sediment and thus information on sediment continuity along the river. Dam effects on downstream reaches resulted in geomorphological disequilibrium, producing narrowing of the active channel, slope reduction, and a decrease of gravel bar areal extension. The proposed catchment scale analysis provides a comprehensive and replicable methodology for environmental planning in Mediterranean ephemeral streams to guide further hydromorphological surveys at the reach scale.

TI  - From site to system: Approaches for producing system-wide estimates of fish habitat in large rivers
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, many productive rivers are dam-regulated and rely on flow management strategies that must balance support of ecological processes with human water use. One component of evaluating this balance is to understand ecological consequences of alternative flow management strategies, which has often been accomplished by coupling population dynamics models with models that relate streamflow to habitat availability and quality. Numerous methods assign habitat availability to locations within a river basin: These include fine-scale field-measured values that are extrapolated to other locations within the basin having similar physical characteristics or equation-driven values created by functions of model-predicted values of physical characteristics. The array of options for creating habitat models is evolving rapidly as high-resolution remote-sensing data becomes more accessible and computational capacity improves. Our objective was to identify trade-offs among approaches that assign habitat relationships to large rivers and to create a decision support tool to supplement choices of extent and granularity. Using a selection of case studies that represent a breadth of scales and diverse trade-offs, we demonstrate the need for a transparent process of data evaluation and assessment to determine the appropriate fit for model scope or context that best supports management needs and recognize sources of uncertainty. The structured approach proposed here aims at improving future model development and refine population dynamics models that inform the management of rivers.

TI  - Development of total suspended matter prediction in waters using fractional-order derivative spectra
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - More and more hyper-spectral satellites will be used to estimate total suspended matter (TSM) in waters instead of multi-spectral satellites, such as China's Gaofen-5 and Zhuhai-1. Although they have not been widely used because of the consistency of sampling and image time. Hence, the study based on measured hyper-spectroscopy is important for applying to hyper-spectral satellites. Fractional-order derivatives (FODs) considers more detailed spectral information, and it is a better spectral preprocessing method than conventional integer-order derivatives. The application and analysis of FODs for spectra in waters is rare. If FOD is successfully applied to estimate TSM, the TSM mapping with FOD using hyper-spectral satellites will be meaningful. Based on these points, this study aimed to apply FOD to predict TSM and to prove the prediction feasibility of FOD in waters. Different prediction models and eight FOD transformation processes with increment of 0.25 per step for 392 spectral reflectance data from China were used and compared. The prediction models include the optimum models of the single wavelength, ratio index, difference index and TSM index at each FOD order, and the random forest (RF) model with all wavelengths was also used. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used to reduce noise and improve the model accuracy after using FOD. Our results achieved the followings First, FOD enhanced spectral characteristics at 500-600 nm and 800 nm that were affected by TSM. Second, the correlation between TSM and FOD spectra was enhanced (e.g., the correlation coefficients of 19 wavelengths (789-807 nm) of 0.75 order were higher than 0.8 but the original spectra were not). Third, FOD improved the performance of different prediction models, and the RF model from 0.5-order to 1.25-order derivative spectra all led good results (). Fourth, DWT can reduce the noise and improve the performance, and FOD-DWT model of 1.25-order led the R-2 of 0.84, RMSE of 16.30 and MAPE of 78.62 in validation. Overall, our results suggest that FOD can improve the prediction performance for most models, and the optimum order of some models is not integer. Our results also provide a reference for predicting other water quality parameters and mapping these parameters using hyper spectral satellites. The accurate estimation of TSM is helpful for protecting ecological and social environments.

T2  - Zhonghua yi xue za zhi

AB  - Objective: To investigate the different tracer materials in identifying the axillary reverse mapping(ARM) lymph nodes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical and pathological data of 478 breast cancer female patients(mean age: 50.5±8.0) under axillary lymph node dissection(ALND) with ARM technique was conducted between March 2019 and November 2020 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital. Of the 478 patients, methylene blue was applied in 147 patients, indocyanine green in 119, and indocyanine green plus methylene blue in 212 patients. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Chi-squire test or Fisher test, and binary logistic regression were carried out to identify the factors associated with identifying ARM lymph nodes. Results: The recognition rates of ARM lymph nodes were 73.5%, 79.0%, and 83.0%(P=0.091), and the recognition rate of ARM lymphatic vessels was 62.6%, 92.4%, 89.6%(P<0.001), respectively. The coincidence rate of ARM lymph node and SLN was 8.1%(12/148), and the metastasis rate was 16.1%(61/378). Supplemental injection of 1 ml of methylene blue or indocyanine green can improve the identification of ARM lymph nodes. The larger BMI and the performance of neoadjuvant therapy were associated with the lower recognition rate of ARM lymph nodes. Neoadjuvant therapy was an independent factor for the identification rate of ARM lymph nodes. Conclusions: Indocyanine green combined with methylene blue can improve the recognition rate of ARM lymph nodes. Obese patients have a lower recognition rate of ARM lymph nodes, and the supplemental injection tracer can be injected to improve the recognition rate. In breast cancer patients whose ARM lymph nodes are not successfully identified during operation, it may be that the ARM lymph nodes are not located in the axilla.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and reliable assessment of direct economic losses of flood disasters is important for emergency dispatch and risk management in small- and medium-sized cities. In this study, a single flood disaster in Lishui city in 2014 was taken as an example to study and verify a method for rapid and detailed assessment of direct economic loss. First, based on a field investigation, the inundation data simulated by the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model and geographic information system (GIS) analysis method were verified. Next, the urban land use map and high-resolution land use classifications based on remote sensing data were fused and combined with expert questionnaire surveys, thereby providing the 47 types and values of land use. Then, based on the previous depth-damage function in the past study, the vulnerability curves of 47 types of land use in Liandu district were fitted by the lognormal cumulative distribution function and then calibrated using disaster loss report data. Finally, the distributions of the loss ratio and loss value were estimated by spatial analysis. It is found that the land use data have detailed types and value attributes as well as high resolution. Secondly, the vulnerability curves after function fitting and calibration effectively reflect the change characteristics of land use loss ratio in this area. Finally, except for the three types of land for agriculture, recreational and sports facilities, and green parking spaces, the optimized simulated total loss is CNY322.6 million, which is 0.16% higher than the statistics report data. The estimated loss ratio and loss value can reliably reflect the distribution pattern of disaster losses in detail, which can be applied by government and private sectors to implement effective disaster reduction and relief measures.

AB  - Leaf chlorophyll, as a key factor for carbon circulation in the ecosystem, is significant for the photosynthetic productivity estimation and crop growth monitoring in agricultural management. Hyperspectral remote sensing (RS) provides feasible solutions for obtaining crop leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) by the advantages of its repeated and high throughput observations. However, the data redundancy and the poor robustness of the inversion models are still major obstacles that prevent the widespread application of hyperspectral RS for crop LCC evaluation. For winter wheat LCC inversion from hyperspectral observations, this study described a novel hybrid method, which is based on the combination of amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2D correlation spectrum (2DCOS) and transfer learning. The innovative feature selection method, amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS, which originated from 2DCOS, additionally considered the relationships between external perturbations and hyperspectral amplitude and shape characteristics to enhance the dynamic spectrum response. To extract the representative LCC featured wavelengths, the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS was conducted on the leaf optical PROperties SPECTra (PROSPECT) + Scattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) (PROSAIL) simulated dataset, which covered most possible winter wheat canopy spectra. Nine wavelengths (i.e., 455, 545, 571, 615, 641, 662, 706, 728, and 756 nm) were then extracted as the sensitive wavelengths of LCC with the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS. These wavelengths had specificity to LCC and showed good correlation with LCC from the aspect of photosynthesis mechanism, molecular structure, and optical properties. The transfer learning techniques based on the deep neural network was then introduced to transfer the knowledge learned from the PROSAIL simulated dataset to the inversion tasks of field measured LCC. Parts of the labeled samples in field observations were used to finetune the model pre-trained by the simulated dataset to improve the inversion accuracy of the winter wheat LCC in different field scenes, aiming to reduce the need for the field measured and labeled sample size. To further ascertain the universality, transferability and predictive ability of the proposed hybrid method, field samples collected from different locations at different phenological phases, including the jointing and heading stages in 2013, 2014, and 2018, were utilized as target tasks to validate the proposed hybrid method. Moreover, the LCC of winter wheat estimated with the proposed method was evaluated with the ground-based platform and the UAV-based platform to verify the model versatility for different monitoring platforms. Various validations demonstrated that the hybrid inversion method combining the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS and the fine-tuned transfer learning model could effectively estimate winter wheat LCC with good accuracy and robustness, and can be extended to the detection and inversion of other key variables of crops.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The idea of a smart city seeks to improve the quality of life, which environmental sustainability is one of its main challenges, and low air quality is an important obstacle to achieving the sustainability. Accordingly, we investigated the relationships between Urmia Lake drying-up and PM10 concentration in Tabriz by 3D visualization of space-time cube in ArcGIS pro 2.7. So, Satellite images of the lake and PM10 data were collected. Next, a spacetime cube was created for each season of the lake and PM10 during 2004 to 2019. Then Time series analysis, Emerging hot spot analysis and 3D visualization of these cubes were performed. The results showed that there is a clear relationship between drying-up of the lake and increasing of PM10 in Tabriz and we recognized that the drying-up has a significant impact on increasing of PM10 concentration in Tabriz.

TI  - Gold Prospectivity Mapping in the Sonakhan Greenstone Belt, Central India: A Knowledge-Driven Guide for Target Delineation in a Region of Low Exploration Maturity
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sonakhan greenstone belt in Central India is under-explored with respect to gold in spite of its similarity to auriferous greenstone belts in general, which prompted a prospectivity analysis. The workflow involved adoption of a conceptual mineral systems model, recognizing indicative spatial proxies, processing exploration datasets, generating evidence maps and integrating into GIS-based mineral prospectivity mapping. Available geological information such as key lithologic units and their contacts was combined with geochemical anomalies of selected pathfinder elements, geophysical data (aeromagnetic anomaly and K/Th ratio map) and satellite digital image data (ASTER and Landsat 7 ETM +), leading to generation of 17 evidential layers. The lack of a significant number of known mineral occurrences in the study area precludes the use of data-driven prospectivity modeling techniques. Therefore, knowledge-driven approaches such as binary and multiclass index overlay, fuzzy logic and fuzzy AHP (analytic hierarchy process) were adopted to integrate the evidential layers resulting in four prospectivity maps. The variation of cumulative prospectivity with respect to cumulative area in each model was used to determine threshold to produce binary prospectivity maps separating high and low prospectivity zones. An approach based on the unique conditions of the binary prospectivity maps was used to illustrate the combined results of different models. In order to quantify the intuitive uncertainty in exploration targeting that arose due to different model outputs, a modulated predictive model was generated taking the mean prospectivity values at each pixel. The pixels having mean values above 95th percentile were grouped and the area delineated as potential exploration targets for gold that comprises merely 5% of the study area. The estimated uncertainty and confidence values for each pixel were used in the risk analysis that returned 1.95% and 3.05% of the study area as low- and high-risk exploration targets, respectively.

TI  - Surgical de-escalation for head and neck cancer surgery
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Head and neck cancer surgery often has functional and aesthetic consequences. De-escalation surgery is a major concern for surgeons with a constant desire to develop surgical techniques with less invasive approaches and to preserve anatomical structures as much as possible. This was made possible by the appearance of minimally transoral and endonasal surgery as well as by the limitation of the surgical procedure by neoadjuvant treatments or by the limitation of surgical excision without compromising the oncological outcome and patient survival. This evolution continues with the arrival of new technologies such as virtual reality or artificial intelligence.

TI  - Testing a Generalizable Machine Learning Workflow for Aquatic Invasive Species on Rainbow Trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) in Northwest Montana
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasions are accelerating worldwide, causing major ecological and economic impacts in aquatic ecosystems. The urgent decision-making needs of invasive species managers can be better met by the integration of biodiversity big data with large-domain models and data-driven products. Remotely sensed data products can be combined with existing invasive species occurrence data via machine learning models to provide the proactive spatial risk analysis necessary for implementing coordinated and agile management paradigms across large scales. We present a workflow that generates rapid spatial risk assessments on aquatic invasive species using occurrence data, spatially explicit environmental data, and an ensemble approach to species distribution modeling using five machine learning algorithms. For proof of concept and validation, we tested this workflow using extensive spatial and temporal hybridization and occurrence data from a well-studied, ongoing, and climate-driven species invasion in the upper Flathead River system in northwestern Montana, USA. Rainbow Trout (RBT; Oncorhynchus mykiss), an introduced species in the Flathead River basin, compete and readily hybridize with native Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT; O. clarkii lewisii), and the spread of RBT individuals and their alleles has been tracked for decades. We used remotely sensed and other geospatial data as key environmental predictors for projecting resultant habitat suitability to geographic space. The ensemble modeling technique yielded high accuracy predictions relative to 30-fold cross-validated datasets (87% 30-fold cross-validated accuracy score). Both top predictors and model performance relative to these predictors matched current understanding of the drivers of RBT invasion and habitat suitability, indicating that temperature is a major factor influencing the spread of invasive RBT and hybridization with native WCT. The congruence between more time-consuming modeling approaches and our rapid machine-learning approach suggest that this workflow could be applied more broadly to provide data-driven management information for early detection of potential invaders.

TI  - Assessment of karst rocky desertification from the local to regional scale based on unmanned aerial vehicle images: A case-study of Shilin County, Yunnan Province, China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst rocky desertification is a major ecologic and geologic problem in Southwest China that has restricted the sustainable development of society and the economy. Many methods have been used to evaluate rocky desertification based on satellite remote sensing, but the results of these methods are affected by the heterogeneous surroundings of the karst region and the low resolution of sensors. In this study, a new method that combines satellite images and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images was used to quantitatively extract information and evaluate rocky desertification. First, we extracted the bare rock ratio from the local high-resolution UAV images, and then the regression models were established between the bare rock ratio of UAV images and the band reflectivity and eight rock indices of satellite images to invert the bare rock ratio at the county scale. The results showed that the overall accuracy and F1 of the classification of UAV images was 97% and 90%, respectively. The linear regression model between the reflectivity of the pixels in band 2 of the LANDSAT image and the bare rock ratio extracted from the UAV images was the best (R-2 = 0.86). In addition, our method in which rocky desertification was assessed by the inversion model based on UAV images and LANDSAT images was superior to the traditional approach based on vegetation coverage. These results suggested that we can extract information on rocky desertification based on high-resolution UAV images and assess rocky desertification by the inversion model from the local to regional scale.

TI  - Comparing <i>in situ</i> spring phenology and satellite-derived start of season at rural and urban sites in Ireland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of spring phenology marks the start of the growing season and the beginning of the carbon-uptake period. In order to accurately calculate carbon budgets across different vegetation types, reliable start-of-season data over relatively large areas is necessary. However, in-situ phenological observation networks are generally restricted in their geographical extent and limited to a small number of species, typically dominant trees. Satellite remote sensing can provide spatially extensive phenological information but requires validation with in-situ observations. Here, we examined trends (1968-2016) in the timing of leaf-unfolding (LU) as well as growing-season-length (GSL), derived from in-situ observations, of a suite of deciduous trees, at three rural sites and one urban site in Ireland, all of which are within the International Phenological Gardens network. We compared in-situ trends with satellite derived phenometrics, including start of greening increase and GSL, based on two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) from a combined AVHRR and MODIS time-series over the time period 1982-2016. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of satellite remote sensing in capturing LU and GSL as determined by in-situ observations from sites dominated by varying land cover types. The timing of LU (DOY 111) at the urban site was significantly (p < 0.000) later than all rural sites, apart from one (1982-2016). The significantly (p < 0.000) longer (2-5 weeks) GSL (217 days), at the urban site, was thus driven by delayed leaf fall (LF). Satellite derived Start of Season (SOS) was consistently earlier than LU across all sites (RMSE 25-52d; MBE -5 to -50 d) whereas EVI2-derived GSL was consistently longer than in situ data (RMSE 65-102d; MBE 45 to 96 d). Overall, the discrepancies reported here between the timing of in-situ spring phenology and satellite-derived phenometrics at these sites were possibly due to a combination of factors including differences in scale between the two methods, the small number of cloned trees being monitored, which does not appear to represent the broader landscape vegetation, the heterogeneity of the landscape and technical differences between the satellite sensors used to construct the EVI2 time-series. Addressing these issues is challenging but engaging citizen scientists to monitor local vegetation would increase the spatial coverage of the in-situ observation network while also incorporating a broader range of species some of which would undoubtedly represent native vegetation.

TI  - Healthy ecosystems for human and animal health: Science diplomacy for responsible development in the Arctic The Nordic Centre of Excellence, Clinf.org (Climate-change effects on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and the impacts on Northern societies)
T2  - POLAR RECORD
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate warming is occurring most rapidly in the Arctic, which is both a sentinel and a driver of further global change. Ecosystems and human societies are already affected by warming. Permafrost thaws and species are on the move, bringing pathogens and vectors to virgin areas. During a five-year project, the CLINF - a Nordic Center of Excellence, funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers, has worked with the One Health concept, integrating environmental data with human and animal disease data in predictive models and creating maps of dynamic processes affecting the spread of infectious diseases. It is shown that tularemia outbreaks can be predicted even at a regional level with a manageable level of uncertainty. To decrease uncertainty, rapid development of new and harmonised technologies and databases is needed from currently highly heterogeneous data sources. A major source of uncertainty for the future of contaminants and infectious diseases in the Arctic, however, is associated with which paths the majority of the globe chooses to follow in the future. Diplomacy is one of the most powerful tools Arctic nations have to influence these choices of other nations, supported by Arctic science and One Health approaches that recognise the interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment at the local, regional, national and global levels as essential for achieving a sustainable development for both the Arctic and the globe.

TI  - Assessing Interactions Between Crop Biophysical Parameters and X-Band Backscattering Using Empirical Data and Model Sensitivity Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active microwave remote sensing data at different frequencies can provide crucial information on crop morphology and conditions, thus effectively supporting agronomic management at different scales. Despite the ever-increasing availability of spaceborne platforms and the extensive research developed throughout more than two decades, some knowledge gaps still await to be filled toward operational use, dealing with SAR backscatter response to crop-specific features and seasonal dynamics, including the effects of agronomic practices. In this work, we used variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) as a quantitative framework for investigating the sensitivity of X-band backscattering to agronomic and morphological features typical of two different crops maize and rice. To this end, we jointly exploited empirical data on crop status and growth, high-resolution TerraSAR-X (TSX) data, and microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. Phenology-informed simulations allowed us to quantify the contributions of different scattering mechanisms for the two crops under varying observation setups, to assess the sensitivity of X-band backscattering to morphostructural crop biophysical parameters (BPs) (and their interactions), and to evaluate the effects of crop biomass on backscatter across growth stages. In particular, multidimensional GSA outputs accounting for model input correlations through Shapley effects provided a comprehensive suite of information on the relative proportion of total backscatter variance explained by a range of parameters and a quantitative description of the different behavior in vertical and horizontal polarization (changing throughout plant growth) in paddy rice, and the mixed contribution of canopy density and leaf angle distribution (depending on the incident angle) in maize.

TI  - Reconciling the inconsistency of annual temperature cycles modelled from Landsat and MODIS LSTs through a percentile approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important variable to understand surface energy fluxes, land-atmosphere interactions, and urban thermal environments. Time series analysis of LSTs through semi-physical models such as the annual temperature cycle (ATC) model has become critical for these understandings. However, studies are lacking in examining and reconciling the inconsistency of time series LST modelling results across spatial scales, weakening the reliability of these semi-physical models to characterize landscape thermal patterns. In this study, a percentile approach was used to reveal and reconcile discrepancies of ATC parameters estimated from Landsat (100 m) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 1000 m) LSTs. Results showed substantial differences across spatial scales for each of the ATC parameters, i.e. mean annual surface temperature (MAST), yearly amplitude of surface temperature (YAST), and revised phase shift (RPS), within the same land cover (e.g. 4.0 K difference between MAST estimated from Landsat LSTs and that from MODIS LSTs for grassland). The spatial distribution of ATC parameters estimated from MODIS LSTs across land cover types was quite different from that from Landsat LSTs. The percentile aggregation analysis suggested that the difference between MAST/YAST (and RPS) derived from MODIS LSTs and Landsat-aggregated values at the 25th (and 40th) percentile within a MODIS block was close to zero. Further regression analysis showed that differences in ATC parameters, particularly MAST and YAST, derived from different datasets could be reconciled. Our study offers new insights into understanding inconsistencies in and reconciliations of ATC parameters modelled at different spatial scales for quantifying landscape thermal patterns spatially and temporally.

TI  - Host Associations of <i>Culex pipiens</i>: A Two-Year Analysis of Bloodmeal Sources and Implications for Arboviral Transmission in Southeastern Virginia
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding vector-host interactions is crucial for evaluating the role of mosquito species in enzootic cycling and epidemic/epizootic transmission of arboviruses, as well as assessing vertebrate host contributions to maintenance and amplification in different virus foci. To investigate blood-feeding pattern of Culex pipiens, engorged mosquitoes were collected on a weekly basis at 50 sites throughout Suffolk, Virginia, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps, BG-Sentinel traps, and modified Reiter gravid traps. Vertebrate hosts of mosquitoes were identified by amplifying and sequencing portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Of 281 Cx. pipiens bloodmeals successfully identified to species, 255 (90.7%) contained solely avian blood, 13 (4.6%) mammalian, 1 (0.4%) reptilian, and 12 (4.3%) both avian and mammalian blood. Nineteen avian species were identified as hosts for Cx. pipiens with American robin (n = 141, 55.3% of avian hosts) and northern cardinal (n = 57, 22.4%) as the most common hosts. More American robin feedings took place in areas of higher development. Three mammalian species were also identified as hosts for Cx. pipiens with Virginia opossum and domestic cat as the most common hosts in this class (each n = 6, 46.2% of mammalian hosts). There was no significant seasonal difference in the proportion of bloodmeals obtained from avian hosts, but there was a decrease in the proportion of bloodmeals from mammalian hosts from spring to fall. One engorged specimen of Cx. pipiens with Virginia opossum-derived bloodmeal tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), and another with black-and-white warbler-derived bloodmeal tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis virus. Our findings, in conjunction with the results of vector competence studies and virus isolation from field-collected mosquitoes, lend additional support that Cx. pipiens serves as the principal enzootic vector and potential epizootic/epidemic vector of WNV in southeastern Virginia.

TI  - Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarinoma of the lower uterine segment diagnosed 6 weeks after a term delivery: A case report and literature review
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological malignancy in Australian women. Less than 5% of cases occur in women under 40 years of age and it is rarely associated with pregnancy. Most cases associated with pregnancy are diagnosed after first trimester loss. Only 14 cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed post-partum are reported in the literature. These cases were diagnosed up to 15 months post-partum. The histopathological classification was low grade in 12 patients and high grade in two patients.Case: We describe a 37 year old woman, who presented after her second vaginal delivery (at 37 weeks of gestation) with suspected retained products of conception (RPOC). She had a dilation and curettage leading to the diagnosis of endometrial cancer six weeks post-partum. She underwent a total lapamscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and bilateral sentinel node biopsy. Histopathology confirmed a stage 1B grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma located in the lower uterine segment with widespread lymph-vascular invasion and no other evidence of malignancy. She is planned to complete six cycles of adjuvant carboplatin/ paclitaxel chemotherapy, followed by pelvic external beam radiotherapy.Discussion: We report the second case of a high-grade endometrial cancer diagnosed post-partum. The bulk of this tumour was in the lower segment of the uterus, which together with the fundal placenta, likely permitted the pregnancy progressing to term. Endometrial cancer should be considered a rare cause of abnormal post-partum bleeding. Curettage and histopathology examination is recommended in cases that do not resolve with conservative measures to exclude this rare complication.

AB  - A new semi-analytical algorithm that retrieves the total concentration of suspended matter (TSM) was derived from the China Eastern Coastal Zone using multiple ocean colour instruments including the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI II). The algorithm in one model derives TSM concentration (C-TSM) from satellite inherent optical properties products for clear and moderately turbid water. For turbid waters, a second model with a four-band approach was used. The two model algorithms were combined into one algorithm using a linking weighted function to generate a smooth C-TSM for clear and turbid water and for water with intermediate transparency. Compared to eight existing algorithms, our new algorithm performed better with a wide dynamic range for the C-TSM retrievals. The mean absolute percent difference was 28.22% for the CECZ data and the C-TSM varied from 0.5 mg l(-1) to 2435.4 mg l(-1). New algorithm decreased the MAPD by >11% for the C-TSM retrievals compared to the eight existing algorithms. Furthermore, when new algorithm was tested with a synthetic data set that had been contaminated with residual error, it exhibited more residual error tolerance than the other algorithms when retrieving C-TSM, which agreed well with the results provided by a multi-mission consistency analysis. These results indicate that new algorithm could provide accurate and consistent multi-mission C-TSM from turbid coastal water with a widely varying range of C-TSM.

TI  - Conization and lymph node evaluation in low-risk cervical cancer. Is it time to avoid radical surgery? Retrospective series and literature review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the oncologic and obstetric outcomes of patients with low-risk cervical cancer who underwent conization and lymphatic evaluation to preserve fertility. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively from September 2013 to February 2021. Eligibility criteria included Women with cervical cancer (aged <45 years) who underwent fertility preservation treatment, [stage IA1 with positive lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), stage IA2, or stage IB1 (<2 cm) with less <10 mm cervical stromal invasion, according to the International Federaltion of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 staging system] aged <45 years who wished to preserve their fertility were included in this study. All patients were treated with cervical conization(s) and laparoscopic lymph node evaluation [pelvic lymphadenectomy and/or sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping]. Oncologic and obstet-ric outcomes were evaluated. Results: Overall, 31 patients met the inclusion criteria; 15 (48.3%) women were nulliparous. There were 8 IA1LVSI+ (25.8%), 11 IA2 (35.4%) and 12 IB1 (31.7%) tumours, according to 2018 FIGO stage classification. Most patients had squamous cell carcinoma (77.4%). Lymphovascular space involvement was found in thirteen patients (41.9%). Reconization was performed in 17 (54.8%) patients, of which 6(35.2%) were done due to compromised margins, 4(23.5%) for margins under than 3 mm, 3(17.6%) for unreported or coagulated margins and 4(23.5%) because previous conization was done in another institution and we could not obtain the paraffin blocks for pathology review. Twenty patients had MRI and eleven CT scan. Nine (30%) patients had a complete bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, 9 (26.6%) had SLN mapping with pelvic lymphadenectomy, and 13 (43.3%) had SLN mapping alone after bilateral SLN identification at surgery. After a median follow-up of 41.4 months (range 2-90 months), no recurrences have been detected. In terms of obstetrial outcome, 11 patients attempted pregnancy and 9 became pregnant. First-trimester miscarriage occurred in one patient. Five patients delivered at term by caesarean section, one of them requiring hysterectomy at the time of delivery. Pathology did not show residual disease. Two patients had a vaginal delivery at 38 weeks. One pregnancy is still ongoing. Conclusion: Cervical conization with lymph node assessment by SLN mapping/lymphadenectomy is an oncologic safe procedure in patients with low-risk cervical cancer. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Time-series clustering of remote sensing retrievals for defining management zones in a vineyard
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Management zones (MZs) are efficient for applying site-specific management in agricultural fields. This study proposes an approach for generating MZs using time-series clustering (TSC) to also enable time-specific management. TSC was applied to daily remote sensing retrievals in a California vineyard during four growing seasons (2015-2018) using three datasets: evapotranspiration (ET), leaf area index (LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Distinct MZs were delineated based on similarities in pixel-level temporal dynamics for each dataset, using dissimilarity index to determine the optimal number of clusters and compare TSC results. The differences between the cluster centers were calculated, along with the ratio between the centers' differences and the range of each dataset, denoting the degree of difference between MZs centers. Similarity between MZs from each factor was quantified using Cramer's V and Frechet distances. Finally, an aggregated (multi-factor) MZ map was generated using multivariate clustering. The resulting MZs were compared to a 2016 yield map to determine the significance of differences between means and distribution among MZs. The findings show that LAI TSC achieved the best cluster separation. The NDVI and LAI MZs maps were nearly identical (Cramer's V of 0.97), while ET showed weaker similarities to NDVI and LAI (0.61 and 0.62, respectively). Similar findings were observed for the Frechet distances. The yield values were found to be significantly different among MZs for all TSC maps. TSC may be further utilized for defining within-field spatial variability and temporal dynamics for precision irrigation practices that account for spatial and temporal variability.

TI  - Error removal by energy scaling from hyperspectral images for performance improvement of spectral classifiers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the remote sensing community, HyperSpectral (HS) images (HSI) are becoming increasingly popular as the advancement of technology and the consequent reduction of cost make them financially more accessible. The reason for their success is the higher capability they can offer, with respect to multispectral data, to discriminate classes that are spectrally similar. A series of pre-processing steps such as geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections are carried out on raw data captured by HS sensors. The processed data is then passed to the data analyst, whose work generally relies on the assumption that the received HS data is 'clean,' as all possible corrections have already been implemented; however, corrections are hardly perfect and residual disturbances can still bias the quality of results. At this stage, however, all corrections based on ancillary information have already been made and the possibilities for 'exogenous' correction of data are exhausted. More could be possibly done by sourcing additional information from the data itself. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective additional step for error suppression through energy scaling, termed 'Error Removal by Energy Scaling' (ERES). In classification problems, the absolute value of wavelength lambda is often overlooked, except for, e.g. removal of strong absorption bands; yet the lambda value can actually further support the classification process if their physical meaning is tapped. The proposed ERES method is indeed a non-linear scaling method, derived from physical phenomena linked with radiation extinction properties. In ERES, each band is associated with an energy level, that is inversely related to its own wavelength. The associated nonlinear energy information in HSI, neglected in most classification strategies, prevents optimal separation of class-specific spectral signatures, that are generated by the physics of wave-matter interaction. This is especially true for linear classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). Removing this physics-linked information makes data more suitable to be classified with physics-unaware classification strategies, typically used in down stream remotely sensed data processing. The relevance of the issue, and the benefits of ERES, are discussed and validated in this work over three different datasets, using accuracy improvements on the popular Spectral Angle Mapper and SVM classifiers as a means to gauge the effectiveness of the correction strategy. Results clearly reveal the positive impact of applying ERES to the data before proceeding to classification.

TI  - Mapping the paramo land-cover in the Northern Andes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andean paramo is a biodiverse and vulnerable tropical high-mountain region, whose spatio-ecological patterns remain understudied. The lack of general characterization of its overall extent, land-cover classes, and treeline spatial features hinders our capacity to understand its responses to human impacts and predict future land-system changes. To address this knowledge gap, we classified the land-cover of the paramo in the Northern Andes. Moreover, we estimated (1) the paramo's total extent and its distribution among the Andean countries, (2) the relative extent of 12 of its main land-cover classes, categorized into natural vegetation, natural abiotic and anthropogenic groups, and (3) the preliminary position and anthropogenic influence of its bordering treeline. Relying on Landsat 8 imagery, we performed hybrid manual-automated classifications using the Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest algorithms. The two resulting final classifications were manually checked for errors compared to Google Earth and VegParamo data, and used to produce the expert classification. Finally, we delimited the treeline based on regional forest connectivity, and applied it to the expert classification to evaluate paramo elevations, surface areas and land-cover classes above the Andean treeline. The paramo extent was estimated at 24,301 km(2), distributed between Ecuador (47%), Colombia (43%), Venezuela (8%) and Peru (2%). Natural vegetation, especially shrublands, rosette plant communities and grasslands were dominant (altogether, 65%), whereas classes reflecting intense land-use covered 12% overall. The average treeline reached 3546 m and was bordered uphill at 16% with anthropogenic land-cover classes. The paramo's extent is smaller than previously suggested. It remains a (semi-) natural region, yet the expansion of crops and pastures towards high elevations is a critical concern for long-term sustainability. Future research can build on our findings to predict land-system changes and assess priority areas for conservation. We recommend for future research to focus on remnant forest patches and treeline connectivity in priority.

TI  - Leaf area index remote sensing based on Deep Belief Network supported by simulation data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable in the exchange of substance and energy between the surface and the atmosphere. Remote sensing inversion is the most effective method used to obtain the LAI in a large area. However, owing to the complexity of the spatial structure of vegetation, it is difficult to obtain LAI measurements with high stability and precision. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of information mining ability provided by remote sensing images. To fully utilize the information provided by these images, deep learning technology, with strong self-learning ability and information mining ability, was proposed in this study to retrieve the LAI. The accuracy and stability of deep learning technology largely depends on the quality, quantity, and representativeness of the samples. Given the present difficulties in producing enough high-quality samples from land surface measurements, this paper proposes the use of a radiative transfer model to simulate samples to realize a remote sensing inversion of the LAI. The PROSAIL model is used to simulate the training samples for LAI inversion. A Deep Belief Network (DBN) was used for LAI inversion from MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data with seven spectral bands, and the estimated LAI was compared with the current MODIS LAI product (MOD15A2H), on the basis of validation by ground-measured LAI. The inversion results (Root Mean Square Error RMSE and Pearson's correlation coefficient r) obtained by the DBN algorithm (RMSE = 0.8988, r = 0.7188) of this study and GLASS (Global LAnd Surface Satellite) algorithm (RMSE = 0.7111, r = 0.7995) showed a similar performance, and they are superior to the MODIS LAI product (RMSE = 1.0595, r = 0.6613).

TI  - Factors predicting one or two sentinel lymph nodes to be accepted for sentinel lymph node biopsy alone after neoadjuvant therapy in initially node-positive breast cancer patients
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Current guidelines recommend harvesting >= 3 sentinel nodes if sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone is considered after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for initially node-positive (cN+) breast cancer. We attempted to investigate factors predicting one or two sentinel lymph nodes harvested to be accepted for SLNB alone after NAT in initially cN + patients.Methods: Overall, 157 patients who received NAT (clinically T1-3/N1-2/M0) and underwent SLNB were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Significant factors were identified using a multiple logistic regression model.Results: The overall SLN identification rate was 83.4%. Failed SLN identification was associated with a 2-day protocol using a single tracer (odds ratio: 0.331 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.132-0.830], p = 0.018), age >52 years (0.345 [0.131-0.913], p = 0.032), and lobular histology (0.156 [0.026-0.944], p = 0.043). The overall false-negative SLNB rate was 14.7%. Its increased risk was associated with radioactivity count >530 for any SLN during SLNB (96.4 [4.00-2320], p = 0.005), age >= 57 years (34.2 [1.92-610], p = 0.016), and taxane use (105 [1.02-10700], p = 0.049); its decreased risk was associated with more harvested SLNs (0.191 [0.054-0.669], p = 0.01) and dual tracers (0.101 [0.012-0.843], p = 0.034). A predictive model using these factors achieved an area under the curve of 0.935 (95% CI: 0.878-0.991).Conclusion: When taxane was administered during NAT, the false-negative rate was predicted at <5% for patients aged <57 years, if 1-2 SLNs were harvested using dual tracers, and when the count of every SLN was lower than 530 after NAT in cN + breast cancer.

TI  - Mapping coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Delta, China during 2008-2019: impacts of valid observations, harmonic regression, and critical months
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora has become one of the top exotic invasive plants in coastal China. Accurate and timely mapping of coastal wetlands is critical to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of S. alterniflora invasion and native species degradation. Due to the humid weather and frequent cloud cover in coastal wetlands, pixel-based classifications based on time-series satellite observations have been increasingly utilized to mitigate this problem. However, the spatial and temporal variations in valid observations might affect pixel-based classification accuracies, while this issue has been paid little attention in previous research. In this paper, we conducted annual mapping of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) wetland from 2008 to 2019 based on time-series Landsat 5/7/8 images using harmonic regression analysis and random forest classification on Google Earth Engine. We further analysed how valid observations and temporal distribution of observations affected the classification accuracy. Our results showed that the overall classification accuracies ranged from 87.25% in 2012 to 92.36% in 2018. The mapping results showed that S. alterniflora expanded from 39.91 ha to 4672.38 ha from 2008 to 2019, encroaching seagrass beds with 902.32 ha and encroaching S.salsa and bare flat with 3730.15 ha. This is the first time that maps of coastal wetlands of YRD are produced at an annual time step. Our analysis showed that the number of valid observations affected classification accuracies both temporally and spatially. Years with higher density of observations witnessed higher overall accuracies compared to the years with fewer observations. Pixels with more observations had a higher chance to be correctly classified compared to the pixels with fewer observations. Harmonic regression features helped improve classification accuracies (increase in overall accuracies from 0.15% to 3.32%), especially for vegetation types (increase in F-score from 0.19% to 3.86%). Greater number of valid observations enhances the importance of harmonic regression features in classification. The critical months identified were March, July, and October, and the combinations of these months achieved better accuracies (91.24%) than using all other observations (89.68%) in 2018, suggesting that temporal distributions of observations could be more important than the number of observations for harmonic-based classification of coastal wetlands such as YRD.

TI  - A framework for estimating actual evapotranspiration at weather stations without flux observations by combining data from MODIS and flux towers through a machine learning approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The scarcity of site-scale actual evapotranspiration (ET) measurements poses a challenge for modelling and verifying regional ET. Taking the grassland ecosystem in arid and semi-arid regions of Northern China (ASNC) as an example, we proposed a framework for estimating ET at weather stations without flux observations through a machine learning approach by combining data from MODIS and fifteen flux towers distributed in alpine grassland (AG) and temperate grassland (TG) across ASNC. First, we analyzed the temporal characteristics of grassland ET at site scale. Second, we applied the machine learning approach Random Forest (RF) to develop a robust model for simulating site-scale grassland ET, and used random and spatial cross-validations (CVs) and three metrics to evaluate the RF models performance. Two strategies (using pooled data from all flux towers for a general model, and dividing data by grassland type to develop models specific to AG and TG) and four temporal resolutions (daily, 8-day, monthly and seasonal) were used to develop the RF models. Third, we investigated how the importance of predictor variables for estimating grassland ET changed in different CVs, strategies and temporal resolutions. The ET of AG and TG showed similar dynamic patterns but differed in magnitude. The RF models showed good performance in both strategies and all four temporal resolutions (R-2 > 0.64, MAE < 0.53 mm d(-1), RMSE < 0.72 mm d(-1)). However, seasonal ET simulations performed better than that of daily, 8-day and monthly using pooled data from all flux towers, especially in spatial CV. Meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation and radiation), vegetation (NDVI, LAI and FPAR) and soil (soil water content and soil temperature) were strong predictors of variation in grassland ET. Changes in the importance ranking and value of predictor variables partly explained the variations of model performance. The robust model performance in spatial CV proved that the framework developed in this study was reliable when applied to weather stations without flux observations, thereby overcoming the scarcity of site-scale actual ET measurements.

TI  - Assimilating Fengyun-4A observations to improve WRF-Chem PM<sub>2.5</sub> predictions in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) is a new generation geostationary satellite that provides high temporal resolution atmo-spheric observations of China and the adjacent regions. This study proposed to assimilate FY-4A observations via a combined utilization of a 3D variational method and a random forest approach. The ground-level PM2.5 concentrations were estimated as an intermediate variable and subsequently assimilated based on the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system. Four parallel experiments were conducted to verify the proposed method, including a control experiment and three data assimilation experiments that assimilated satellite observations and ground observations alone and simultaneously. Results showed that the proposed approach improved PM2.5 predictions for most sites, especially in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Yangtze River Delta re-gions. Assimilating PM2.5 estimations from satellite showed an advantage over the assimilation of ground PM2.5 observations in places where local or upstream regional PM2.5 monitoring sites are sparse. Simultaneous assimilation of the PM2.5 from satellite and ground observations further improved the PM2.5 predictions accu-racy in most places.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates the influence of anthropogenic emission reductions on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) concentration changes in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic period using in-situ surface and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite column measurements and GEOS-Chem model simulations. We show that reductions in anthropogenic emissions in eight German metropolitan areas reduced mean in-situ (& column) NO2 concentrations by 23 % (& 16 %) between March 21 and June 30, 2020 after accounting for meteorology, whereas the corresponding mean in-situ O3 concentration increased by 4 % between March 21 and May 31, 2020, and decreased by 3% in June 2020, compared to 2019. In the winter and spring, the degree of NOX saturation of ozone production is stronger than in the summer. This implies that future reductions in NOX emissions in these metropolitan areas are likely to increase ozone pollution during winter and spring if appropriate mitigation measures are not implemented. TROPOMI NO2 concentrations decreased nationwide during the stricter lockdown period after accounting for meteorology with the exception of North-West Germany which can be attributed to enhanced NOX emissions from agricultural soils.

AB  - From June 29 to July 1, 2015, a phreatic eruption occurred in Owakudani, the largest fumarole area in Hakone volcano, Japan. In this study, an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) data was performed to measure deformation after the eruption. The results show that the central cones of the volcano have subsided since the eruption and its deflation source is located beneath the previously estimated bell-shaped conductor, which is considered as a sealing layer confining a pressurized hydrothermal reservoir. Therefore, the InSAR results demonstrate the deflation of the hydrothermal system beneath the volcano. One possible cause of this deflation is compaction due to a decrease in pore pressure caused by rupture and fluid migration during and after the eruption.

TI  - Facing epistemic and complex uncertainty in serious illness: The role of mindfulness and shared mind
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Epistemic uncertainty refers to situations in which available evidence is insufficient or un-reliable, often accompanied by complexity due to novel contexts, multifactorial causation, and emerging options (the "unknowable unknown"). It stands in contrast to aleatory uncertainty where probabilities are known, and potential benefits and harms can be calculated and presented graphically (the "knowable unknown"). Discussion: Epistemic uncertainty is common, and encompasses uncertainty about the nature of the illness, whom to entrust with one's care, and one's ability to adapt and cope. Communication about the "un-knowable unknown" occurs infrequently and ineffectively, and there is little research on improving com-munication in the face of epistemic and complex uncertainty. Terror Management Theory (TMT) predicts that in encountering serious illness, people engage in "worldview defense" - suppressing death-related thoughts, affiliating with like-minded others, and developing cognitive rigidity and intolerance of in-formation that challenges their worldview. Mindfulness is associated with diminished defensive worldview reactions and cognitive rigidity, and greater tolerance of ambiguity. Shared mind encompasses shared understanding and affective attunement. Conclusion: For clinicians and seriously ill patients facing epistemic uncertainty, psychologically-informed interventions that promote mindfulness and shared mind offer promise in promoting open discussions regarding prognostic uncertainty, advance care planning, and treatment decision-making.

TI  - Assessing the spatial variation of cropping intensity using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data by rule-based classification
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was conducted to analyze cropping intensity of four blocks (Mogra-Chinsurah, Polba-Dadpur, Singur and Haripal) of the Gangetic alluvial zone of India using multi-dated Sentinel-2 data in 2018-19 cropping year. It was observed that during peak growing stage all crops ascribed higher Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI values (0.4 to 0.73) and NDVI became as low as 0.06 when the fields were vacant. Sentinel-2 data acquired in the peak crop growing period during each cropping season were carefully selected, and NDVI was computed over the whole study area. Rule-based classification was applied for cropping sequence and cropping intensity classification based on the occurrence and non-occurrence of crops using NDVI threshold (0.4). Sentinel-2 images acquired on 22/10/2018, 6/12/2018, 30/1/2019 and 30/4/2019 were used for masking of trees and non-agricultural area. October 22, January 30 and April 30 imageries demonstrated peak crop growing period during kharif, rabi and pre-kharif seasons whereas December 6 image represented occurrence of no or little crop in the study area. Crop acreage was the highest in Polba-Dadpur block during all the three seasons. The crop-fallow-crop sequence occupied the highest areas (43%) followed by crop-crop-crop sequence (39%). 50% and 39% of the total cultivated land was under 200% and 300% cropping intensities. Overall, accuracies of cropping system and cropping intensity classification were 88.54% and 87.85%, respectively. Sentinel-2 data can be successfully used for cropping system analysis which helps in crop planning and management.

TI  - The Field Geomorphologist in a Time of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing number of papers incorporate machine learning (ML) approaches to analyze spatially and temporally rich data sets in geomorphology. These data-driven approaches have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of complex systems across a range of scales and support the development of new theories of landform and landscape development that can eventually be incorporated into predictive models. Coupled with the growing availability of remotely sensed data, geomorphology could move further toward a desk-based science and erosion of the field tradition. Using examples from coastal geomorphology, this review of ML applications argues that the development of models that are scalable and can be translated between sites is dependent on experience in the field. Although ML models are shown to be effective as a surrogate to process-based numerical models, they are only as good as our conceptual understanding of landform and landscape form and evolution. This means that ML is simply a new and powerful tool in the proverbial belt of the geomorphologist and should not come at the expense of the field tradition that informs us of whether ML results are accurate, transferable, and scalable.

TI  - Atheism is Nothing but an Expression of Buddha-Nature
T2  - SOPHIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The theism-atheism debate is foreign to many Mahayana Buddhist thinkers such as the Japanese Zen Master Dogen (1200-1253). Nevertheless, his philosophy of 'expression' (dotoku) is able to shine a new light on the various incarnations of this debate throughout history. This paper will explore a/theism from Dogen's philosophical standpoint. Dogen introduces the notion of 'expression' to describe the concomitant vertical and horizontal relationships of the religious project, namely the relationship between the individual and the divine as well as the relationship among a multiplicity of individuals, each of which Dogen conceives of as an expression of the divine and/or the oneness of the cosmos. Dogen's philosophy presupposes the 'way of emptiness' (sunyatavada) and Chengguan's (738-839) 'four dharma worlds' (sifajie). To Dogen, the former indicates the conventional nature of predication and signification, while the latter denotes the existential interwovenness of numerous individuals and the divine oneness of the cosmos. Such a philosophy implies that all truth claims and philosophical positions are mere intellectual and discursive constructions that are formulated against a perceived other. Therefore, Dogen observes laconically that 'when one side is expressed, the other is obscured' or, as Dogen says elsewhere, 'when expression is expressed, non-expression is not expressed.' Dogen's philosophical framework provides some interesting insights about one or more discourses on atheism: Again, the basic assumption is that all philosophical paradigms, systems, and positions are devoid of an absolute truth value, framed in a specific cultural and historical context which they express, and formulated vis-a-vis a perceived other. In this paper, I will look at Friedrich Nietzsche's (1844-1900) atheism from the perspective of Dogen's philosophical standpoint. Concretely, I will present Nietzsche's position on his own terms, translate his philosophy into Dogen's terminology, interpret his philosophy from the standpoint of Dogen's philosophical approach, and assess the utility of such an exercise. I believe that such a project enables us to read theism through the eyes of atheism, atheism through the eyes of theism, both through the eyes of Dogen, and Dogen through the eyes of the a/theism debate. In this last section, I will introduce the language of Nishida Kitaro (1870-1945) who attempted a similar project in his The Logic of Basho and the Religious Worldview. The goal of this project is to determine what atheism denies, what atheism contributes, and why a multi-faceted and multi-cultural engagement of atheism is important today.

TI  - Identifying urban land use social functional units: a case study using OSM data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land use is always the central focus of urban planners and policymakers when pursuing urban sustainable development. Currently, many studies have explored urban land use using satellite data, but few of them can identify the social function of land use through these data. In this research, OpenStreetMap (OSM) data are used to extract urban land use social functional units. Firstly, the OSM data are transferred to actual land use types based on the established mapping rules between OSM data and the urban land use classification standards. Then, the improved DBSCAN algorithm is applied with OSM data of the study area after estimating the parameters of the neighborhood radius (Eps) and the minimum polygons (MinPolys) based on the polygon density. With the two estimated parameters, the improved DBSCAN algorithm is used to cluster residential, commercial and public service land use social functional polygons of the OSM data. Following that, the clusters of the three land use types are processed into land use social functional units. The results show that OSM data perform well in determining these three land use social functional clusters using the improved DBSCAN algorithm, and the social functional units display obvious spatial features.

TI  - Orthorectification of WorldView-3 Satellite Image Using Airborne Laser Scanning Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images have been widely used to produce land use and land cover maps and to generate other thematic layers through image processing. However, images acquired by sensors onboard various satellite platforms are affected by a systematic sensor and platform-induced geometry errors, which introduce terrain distortions, especially when the sensor does not point directly at the nadir location of the sensor. To this extent, an automated processing chain of WorldView-3 image orthorectification is presented using rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) model and laser scanning data. The research is aimed at analyzing the effects of varying resolution of the digital surface model (DSM) derived from high-resolution laser scanning data, with a novel orthorectification model. The proposed method is validated on actual data in an urban environment with complex structures. This research suggests that a DSM of 0.31m spatial resolution is optimum to achieve practical results (root-mean-square error=0.69m) and decreasing the spatial resolution to 20m leads to poor results (root-mean-square error=7.17). Moreover, orthorectifying WorldView-3 images with freely available digital elevation models from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (30m) can result in an RMSE of 7.94m without correcting the distortions in the building. This research can improve the understanding of appropriate image processing and improve the classification for feature extraction in urban areas.

TI  - Implication of Remote Sensing Data under GIS Environment for Appraisal of Irrigation System Performance
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor irrigation management is a common issue of irrigated agriculture. Assessment of irrigation system performance is essential to improve the irrigation system, which requires real-time data. Satellite data has been found the best alternate. This manuscript presents a methodology to assess irrigation system performance using combination of satellite and ground data. The developed methodology was applied on a canal system of Punjab Pakistan. High resolution satellite images were processed to images of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), evaporative fraction (EF) and evapotranspiration (ET). These images in combination with ground data provided information on pixel to pixel vegetated area, water availability/ requirement consequently the irrigation system performance indicators. The results revealed that potential water requirement of the area was 401.66 million cubic meters (MCM) and available canal water supply was 247.14 MCM, thus indicating shortage of 38%. Adequacy of the system was found to be 74% while its reliability varied from 35-73%. Average coefficient of variance (Cv) was found 0.43 showing poor reliability of the system. Performance in equity terms revealed that head areas of irrigation channels were receiving more water supplies than the tail areas. Strong correlation was found between crop yields and water supplies i.e., crop yield was strongly dependent on water supplied (R-2 = 0.80).

TI  - Assimilating satellite-based soil moisture observations in a land surface model: The effect of spatial resolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on developing a data assimilation system that combines the modeled surface moisture estimates and satellite observations. Specifically, model states simulated by the Noah-MP land surface model are updated using an Ensemble Kalman Filter with products from the NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite mission. The land surface model is run on two different regular grids, one at 12.5 km and the other at 500 m to produce surface and root zone soil moisture estimates across Oklahoma during April-July 2015. In the first case, the model was forced with the NLDAS-2 (North America Land Data Assimilation System) dataset and in the second with a downscaled version of the same dataset. Ground observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet network are compared to surface and root zone soil moisture output simulated by three different Noah-MP model runs i) an open loop simulation (in which no satellite data are assimilated); ii) assimilation of the 36 km SMAP radiometer-only product, and iii) assimilation of the 9 km SMAP radiometer-radar combined product. Results show that SMAP soil moisture retrievals improve the model performance (i.e., with respect to the open loop run) and that forcing the land surface model with higher resolution atmospheric forcings yields higher correlations and smaller errors in soil moisture simulations with respect to the original NLDAS-2 dataset. Although root zone soil moisture is not directly assimilated (since satellite observations are limited to the top 5 cm of the soil column), the assimilation of SMAP products at the surface is transferred to lower layers by the modeled physical processes and is shown to improve root zone soil moisture estimates as well.

TI  - Alternatives to Liquid Water Beneath the South Polar Ice Cap of Mars
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Radar sounding of Mars' south polar ice cap has revealed portions of its base with stronger radar returns than its surface. These have been used to estimate high real permittivity values consistent with liquid water. However, the thermal, chemical, and geological conditions required to sustain such water bodies are challenging to achieve in the contemporary Martian environment. Three recent papers address this conflict. Khuller and Plaut (2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL093631) find similar radar signatures across the ice cap, expanding the range conditions associated with water candidates. Bierson et al. (2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL093880) show that, for non-zero conductivity, a wider range of materials could produce the observed echoes. Similarly, Smith et al., (2021, https://doi. org/10.1029/2021GL093618) use modeling, laboratory tests, and remote sensing data to propose smectite deposits as their specific source. While not incompatible with bodies of liquid brines, these papers provide potential alternative sources for the bright radar observations.Plain Language Summary Bright radar reflections from beneath the ice cap on the south pole of Mars provided tantalizing evidence for liquid water bodies beneath the ice. However, three recent papers present new challenges for this interpretation. The first shows that similar bright reflections are widespread across much of the ice cap. The environment on Mars already makes it difficult for water to remain stable and these echoes mean that it would have to do so across an even wider range of challenging temperatures and pressures. The two other papers show that other materials, like salty ice and clay, could also produce the bright reflections. Although these new papers do not rule out the possibility of very salty bodies of liquid water beneath the ice cap, they do raise the possibility of alternative sources for the bright reflections.

TI  - Evaluating the added value of multi-variable calibration of SWAT with remotely sensed evapotranspiration data for improving hydrological modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological processes in a watershed consist of multiple sub-processes (such as plant growth, evapotranspiration, water yield, and soil-water balance) that have complex interactions. The common practice of calibrating hydrological models against only a single variable (e.g., streamflow) can lead to parameter uncertainty (also known as equifinality), resulting in significant uncertainties in the representation and simulation of sub-processes. As multi-variable calibration can be a potential solution to this issue, we tested the integration of spatially and temporally gridded remotely sensed evapotranspiration (RS-ET) data with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model. This approach was intended to reduce equifinality by enhancing related hydrological sub-processes in both space and time rather than improving the evaluation metrics at the streamflow outlet. We further introduced the principle of repeated measure design in the calibration process, where the SWAT was calibrated under two different schemes: Scheme1 (using only streamflow data) and Scheme2 (using both RS-ET and streamflow data). The model's performance was evaluated using the concept of stability at multiple spatial scales (basin outlet, sub-basins, and hydrological response units) and aspects (different model outputs and most sensitive calibrated parameters). The significance of the difference between the stabilities produced by the two schemes was estimated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Testing this approach in Meichuan Basin (China) showed that Scheme2 substantially reduced equifinality for calibrated parameters and model outputs compared to Scheme1. In addition, the model solutions and outputs for Scheme2 were significantly different from Scheme1. Our results demonstrate the added value of using increasingly available open-access RS-ET data for improving hydrological model calibration.

TI  - Multi-Source Data Based Investigation of Aerosol-Cloud Interaction Over the North China Plain and North of the Yangtze Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although great progress has been made in the study of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs), representation of ACI is still the largest uncertainty in current weather and climate models. In this study, the ACI over the North China Plain and north of the Yangtze Plain is investigated using multi-source data including satellite, ground-based, reanalysis, and fusion data. The effects of aerosol characteristics (PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5/PM10 ratio), atmospheric conditions including liquid water path (LWP) and lower tropospheric stability (LTS), and drizzle on ACI are analyzed. Results suggest that both aerosol characteristics and atmospheric conditions can affect cloud effective radius (re), but drizzle in clouds plays a decisive role on ACI. In the case of fixed LTS and LWP, the average cloud droplet re increases first and then fluctuates for all clouds examined with the increase of PM2.5 concentration. The PM2.5 concentration corresponding to the turning point of re increases with the increasing LWP due to the increased chance of collision and coalescence. In contrast, the average cloud droplet re and PM2.5 concentration show a negative correlation for clouds without drizzle, which is mainly caused by competition of water vapor. The quantitative ACI results show that the values of the aerosol first indirect effect are negative for most cases when considering all clouds examined, but positive when only considering clouds without drizzle.

TI  - Analysis of the mast cell expressed carboxypeptidase A3 and its structural and evolutionary relationship to other vertebrate carboxypeptidases
T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metallo-carboxypeptidases are exopeptidases with diverse expression and function, found in all kingdoms of life from bacteria to mammals. One of them, the carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3), has become an important component of the mammalian immune system by its expression in mast cells. Mast cells (MCs) are highly specialized sentinel cells, which store large amounts of bioactive mediators, including CPA3, in very abundant cytoplasmic granules. Clinical studies have found an increased CPA3 expression in asthma but the physiological role as well as the evolutionary origin of CPA3 remains largely unexplored. CPA3 belongs to the M14A subfamily of metallocarboxypeptidases, which among others also includes the digestive enzymes CPA1, CPA2, CPB1 and CPO. To study the appearance of CPA3 during vertebrate evolution, we here performed bioinformatic analyses of homologous genes and gene loci from a broad panel of metazoan animals from invertebrates to mammals. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that CPA3 appeared at the base of tetrapod evolution in a branch closer to CPB1 than to other CPAs. Indeed, CPA3 and CPB1 are also located in the same locus, on chromosome 3 in humans. The presence of CPA3 only in tetrapods and not in fishes, suggested that CPA3 could have appeared by a gene duplication from CPB1 during early tetrapod evolution. However, the apparent loss of CPA3 in several tetrapod lineages, e.g. in birds and monotremes, indicates a complex evolution of the CPA3 gene. Interestingly, in the lack of CPA3 in fishes, zebrafish MCs express instead CPA5 for which the most closely related human carboxypeptidase is CPA1, which has a similar cleavage specificity as CPA3. Collectively, these findings clarify and add to our understanding of the evolution of hematopoietic proteases expressed by mast cells.

TI  - Drivers and extent of surface water occurrence in the Selenga River Delta, Russia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Selenga River Delta (SRD), Russia.Study focus: How is water occurrence changing in the SRD, and what are the hydroclimatic drivers behind these changes? The presence of water on the surface in river deltas is governed by land use, geomorphology, and the flux of water to and from the Delta. We trained an accurate image classification of the Landsat satellite imagery during the last 33 years to quantify surface water occurrence and its changes in the SRD. After comparing our estimations with global-scale data sets, we determined the hydrological drivers of these changes.New hydrological insights for the region: We find mild decreases in water occurrence in 51% of the SRD's surface area from 1987-2002 to 2003-2020. Water occurrence in the most affected areas decreased by 20% and in the most water-gaining areas increased by 10%. We find a significant relationship between water occurrence and runoff (R-2 = 0.56) that does not exist between water occurrence and suspended sediment concentration (SSC), Lake Baikal's water level, and potential evapotranspiration. The time series of water occurrence follows the peaks in the runoff but not its long-term trend. However, the extremes in SSC do not influence surface water occurrence (R-2 < 0.1), although their long-term trends are similar. Contrary to expected, we find that the Delta has a relatively stable long-term water availability for the time being.

TI  - Variations in urban land surface temperature intensity over four cities in different ecological zones
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at assessing variations and changes in the intensity of urban land surface temperature (LST) over four major cities in different ecological zone. The study intends to examine the contributions of different land cover types and variation in ecological locations on the intensity of urban LST. Remote Sensing and GIS techniques were used to measure the extent of the LST intensity over different cities and implications of land use/land cover (LULC) changes, using the Landsat TM/ ETM from 1984 to 2012, and Landsat OLI/TIRS from 2015 to 2019. The contributions of different landscape types to urban LST intensity were examined, using contribution index (CI) and Landscape index (LI) methods while the relationship between urban LST, and changes in LULC was examined using zonal statistics. The results revealed that the spatial and temporal changes in the LULC have greatly influenced the LST in the cities, though this varies from identified LULC. Changes in estimated LST vary from 0.12 to 1 degrees C yearly, while the changes are much intensified in the core section of the cities. The contribution of each landscapes varies, - 0.25 < CI > - 1.17 for sink landscape and 0.24 < CI > 1.05 for source landscape. The results further reveal that as LI >= 1, the contribution of source landscape to intensity of LST is lesser than that of sink landscape, but LI <= 1 shows that source landscapes contribute more to intensity of LST than sink landscapes. This might be as a result of changes in the vegetation cover between 1984 and 2019 as revealed in LULC change. Loss in the vegetal cover is anthropogenically induced leading to an increase in built-up and impervious surfaces resulted in mean monthly and yearly temperature changes. It is observed that the core and densities areas of cities witnessed higher LST compared with the rural area. The study concludes that different types of land cover within an urban area can affect the spatial pattern of urban LST, though this varies from one ecological zone to another and distribution of LST intensity in the urban area depends on its changes LULC. Thus, as cities' population is expected to keep expanding there is a need to establish more viable linkages between the ever-growing population and land use patterns. The major findings from this study are useful in informing policymakers of the need to promote more sustainable urban development in the cities.

TI  - SAVI SCOUT® localization of metastatic axillary lymph node prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for targeted axillary dissection: a pilot study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In clinically node-positive breast cancer, axillary staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is optimized with targeted axillary dissection (TAD), which includes removal of the biopsy-proven metastatic lymph node (LN) in addition to sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). Localization of the clipped node is currently performed post-NAC; however, technical limitations can make detection and localization of the treated LN challenging. We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of localizing the metastatic LN with a SAVI SCOUT (R) reflector (SAVI) prior to NAC for targeted removal at surgery. Methods Twenty-five patients with stage 2/3 breast cancer underwent ultrasound-guided localization of the biopsy-proven LN with SAVI prior to NAC. After NAC, patients with clinical response underwent TAD. Primary outcome measures were rate of successful localization, days between insertion of SAVI and axillary surgery, frequency of retrieval of clipped node, and frequency of SAVI-LN as SLN. Results After NAC, 23/25 (92%) had clinical axillary down-staging and underwent TAD. Two patients with persistent palpable axillary disease underwent ALND for initial staging. Axillary surgery was performed at an average of 141 days post-SAVI insertion and the SAVI was successfully retrieved in all cases. Among 23 patients undergoing TAD, the SAVI was retrieved within a LN in all patients, whereas clip migration was observed in two patients. The median SLN removed was 4, and SAVI-LN was SLN in 22/23 patients. Axillary pCR rate was 44%. Conclusion Localizing a metastatic LN with SAVI reflector prior to NAC for targeted removal at surgery is feasible and may provide technical and logistical advantages over axillary localization post-NAC.

TI  - Vulnerability of European ecosystems to two compound dry and hot summers in 2018 and 2019
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2018 and 2019, central Europe was affected by two consecutive extreme dry and hot summers (DH18 and DH19). The DH18 event had severe impacts on ecosystems and likely affected vegetation activity in the subsequent year, for example through depletion of carbon reserves or damage from drought. Such legacies from drought and heat stress can further increase vegetation susceptibility to additional hazards. Temporally compound extremes such as DH18 and DH19 can, therefore, result in an amplification of impacts due to preconditioning effects of past disturbance legacies.Here, we evaluate how these two consecutive extreme summers impacted ecosystems in central Europe and how the vegetation responses to the first compound event (DH18) modulated the impacts of the second (DH19). To quantify changes in vegetation vulnerability to each compound event, we first train a set of statistical models for the period 2001-2017, which are then used to predict the impacts of DH18 and DH19 on enhanced vegetation index (EVI) anomalies from MODIS. These estimates correspond to expected EVI anomalies in DH18 and DH19 based on past sensitivity to climate. Large departures from the predicted values can indicate changes in vulnerability to dry and hot conditions and be used to identify modulating effects by vegetation activity and composition or other environmental factors on observed impacts.We find two regions in which the impacts of the two compound dry and hot (DH) events were significantly stronger than those expected based on previous climate-vegetation relationships. One region, largely dominated by grasslands and crops, showed much stronger impacts than expected in both DH events due to an amplification of their sensitivity to heat and drought, possibly linked to changing background CO2 and temperature conditions. A second region, dominated by forests and grasslands, showed browning from DH18 to DH19, even though dry and hot conditions were partly alleviated in 2019. This browning trajectory was mainly explained by the preconditioning role of DH18 on the impacts of DH19 due to interannual legacy effects and possibly by increased susceptibility to biotic disturbances, which are also promoted by warm conditions.Dry and hot summers are expected to become more frequent in the coming decades, posing a major threat to the stability of European forests. We show that state-of-the-art process-based models could not represent the decline in response to DH19 because they missed the interannual legacy effects from DH18 impacts. These gaps may result in an overestimation of the resilience and stability of temperate ecosystems in future model projections.

TI  - Single-site robotic-assisted hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node mapping for low-risk endometrial cancer: surgical technique and preliminary outcomes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The staging of endometrial cancer has changed from clinical to surgical over the years. Lymph node disease is recognised as an important prognostic factor as well as an aid to tailoring adjuvant therapy. The development of sentinel lymph node mapping algorithms shows promise in diagnostic accuracy and reducing the morbidity associated with comprehensive lymphadenectomy. In select patients, it is feasible to perform sentinel lymph node mapping using minimally invasive surgical techniques. We present a series of single-site robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node mapping for low-risk endometrial cancer focusing on the surgical technique required and perioperative outcomes.

TI  - GIS and remote sensing-based spatiotemporal analysis of cumulative flood risk over Bangladesh's national highways
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The national highways (NHs) play a significant role in the economy of Bangladesh. However, natural disasters, especially floods, interrupt the traffic flow almost annually affecting the sustainable growth of the economy. Therefore, understanding the extent and patterns of historical flood risk over the NHs is important to identify the most affected areas. The study combined remote sensing and GIS to map the flooding risks over the NHs. To conduct the analysis this study selected flood events with over 100 deaths from the past 20 years. The results identified not only the NH location but the affected lengths as well. With further analysis, it was obvious that a single impact of the flood may appear insignificant, but the cumulative risk is severe. The study area received a cumulative risk of 1400 km and the average flood affected approximately 200 km of the area. Five NHs (i.e. N1, N5, N6, N7, and N8) received a cumulative risk of over 200 km from seven floods. The 2007 July to October flood affected 15% of the study area and reached the highest risk in this study. A similar pattern of risk was also noticed over five NHs (i.e. N3, N4, N6, N7, and N8) multiple times. Further investigation of similarly affected road locations created an opportunity to address repeated impacts. The results of this study can contribute to the establishment of a reliable historical database that identifies the most flood-affected roads with specific lengths and locations for further decision-making regarding relevant flood mitigation policy formulation.

TI  - Desertification of Iran in the early twenty-first century: assessment using climate and vegetation indices
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of specific climatic and biogeographical parameters is an effective means of evaluating the large-scale desertification status of drylands affected by negative human impacts. Here, we identify and analyze desertification trends in Iran for the period 2001-2015 via a combination of three indices for vegetation (NPP-net primary production, NDVI-normalized difference vegetation index, LAI-leaf area index) and two climate indices (LST-land surface temperature, P-precipitation). We combine these indices to identify and map areas of Iran that are susceptible to land degradation. We then apply a simple linear regression method, the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test, and the Theil-Sen estimator to identify long-term temporal and spatial trends within the data. Based on desertification map, we find that 68% of Iran shows a high to very high susceptibility to desertification, representing an area of 1.1 million km(2) (excluding 0.42 million km(2) classified as unvegetated). Our results highlight the importance of scale in assessments of desertification, and the value of high-resolution data, in particular. Annually, no significant change is evident within any of the five indices, but significant changes (some positive, some negative) become apparent on a seasonal basis. Some observations follow expectations; for instance, NDVI is strongly associated with cooler, wet spring and summer seasons, and milder winters. Others require more explanation; for instance, vegetation appears decoupled from climatic forcing during autumn. Spatially, too, there is much local and regional variation, which is lost when the data are considered only at the largest nationwide scale. We identify a northwest-southeast belt spanning central Iran, which has experienced significant vegetation decline (2001-2015). We tentatively link this belt of land degradation with intensified agriculture in the hinterlands of Iran's major cities. The spatial and temporal trends identified with the three vegetation and two climate indices afford a cost-effective framework for the prediction and management of future environmental trends in developing regions at risk of desertification.

TI  - Systematic review of synchronous contralateral axillary metastases in breast cancer: really M1 disease?
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective The objective of the study is to assess and quantify the effect of the appearance of synchronous contralateral axillary on breast cancer survival. Summary background data Breast cancer with contralateral axillary metastases (CAM) is classified as a metastatic disease. There are few cases reported and a lack of evidence of the significance of CAM when synchronous appearance with a primary tumor and no other site of disease. Methods A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines to evaluate the prognosis of patients with synchronous CAM without other metastatic diseases comparing with metastatic disease is conducted through a search in PubMed, Embase, Clinical Key, and Cochrane Library databases. We present one case. The median age, follow-up, clinico-pathological characteristics, status of lymph nodes, treatments, and outcomes are analyzed. Results A total of 23 articles (10 case reports and 13 case series) with a total 68 patients, including our case. Median age was 48 years old. Median follow-up was 27 months. Overall survival of the series was 71.4%. Twenty-one of 49 patients reported (36.2%) were alive without disease, fourteen (28.6%) were alive with disease while the rest fourteen (28.6%) died. Inflammatory presentation and ipsilateral axilla status were related to overall survival. Conclusions Synchronous CAM in breast cancer show better outcomes in terms of overall survival than other metastatic diseases. The absence of comparative studies may not allow definitive conclusions, meanwhile, together with other authors we suggest treatment with curative intention. More studies may lead to consider a modification of TNM system.

TI  - Google Earth Engine based spatio-temporal analysis of air pollutants before and during the first wave COVID-19 outbreak over Turkey via remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is one of the vital problems for the sustainability of cities and public health. The lockdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has become a natural laboratory, enabling to investigate the impact of human/industrial activities on the air pollution. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal density of TROPOMIbased nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) products, and MODIS-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from January 2019 to September 2020 (also covering the first wave of the COVID-19) over Turkey using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results showed a significant decrease in NO2 and AOD, while SO2 unchanged and had slightly higher concentrations in some regions during the lockdown compared to 2019. The relationship between air pollutants and meteorological parameters during the lockdown showed that air temperature and pressure were highly correlated with air pollutants, unlike precipitation and wind speed. Moreover, Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, indicator of economic/industrial activities, also provided poor correlation with air pollutants. TROPOMI-based NO2 and SO2 were compared with station-based pollutants for three sites (suburban, urban, and urban-traffic classes) in Istanbul, revealing 0.83, 0.70 and 0.65 correlation coefficients for NO2, respectively, while SO2 showed no significant correlation. Besides, AOD data were validated using two AERONET sites providing 0.86 and 0.82 correlation coefficients. Overall, the satellite-based data provided significant outcomes for the spatio-temporal evaluation of air quality, especially during the first wave of the COVID-19 lockdown.

TI  - The NIEER AVHRR snow cover extent product over China - a long-term daily snow record for regional climate research
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-term Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) snow cover extent (SCE) product from 1981 until 2019 over China has been generated by the snow research team in the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources (NIEER), Chinese Academy of Sciences. The NIEER AVHRR SCE product has a spatial resolution of 5 km and a daily temporal resolution, and it is a completely gap-free product, which is produced through a series of processes such as the quality control, cloud detection, snow discrimination, and gap-filling (GF). A comprehensive validation with reference to ground snow-depth measurements during snow seasons in China revealed the overall accuracy is 87.4 %, the producer's accuracy was 81.0 %, the user's accuracy was 81.3 %, and the Cohen's kappa (CK) value was 0.717. Another validation with reference to higher-resolution snow maps derived from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images demonstrates an overall accuracy of 87.3 %, a producer's accuracy of 86.7 %, a user's accuracy of 95.7 %, and a Cohen's kappa value of 0.695. These accuracies were significantly higher than those of currently existing AVHRR products. For example, compared with the well-known JASMES AVHRR product, the overall accuracy increased approximately 15 %, the omission error dropped from 60.8% to 19.7 %, the commission error dropped from 31.9% to 21.3 %, and the CK value increased by more than 114 %. The new AVHRR product is already available at https://doi.org/10.11888/Snow.tpdc.271381 (Hao et al., 2021).

TI  - The lymphatic system and sentinel lymph nodes: conduit for cancer metastasis
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Review
AB  - The lymphatic system is a complicated system consisting of the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes draining the extracellular fluid containing cellular debris, excess water and toxins to the circulatory system. The lymph nodes serve as a filter, thus, when the lymph fluid returns to the heart, it is completely sterile. In addition, the lymphatic system includes the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, such as tonsils, adenoids, Peyers patches in the small bowel and even the appendix. Taking advantage of the drainage system of the lymphatics, cancer cells enter the lymphatic vessels and then the lymph nodes. In general, the lymph nodes may serve as a gateway in the majority of cases in early cancer. Occasionally, the cancer cells may enter the blood vessels. This review article emphasizes the structural integrity of the lymphatic system through which cancer cells may spread. Using melanoma and breast cancer sentinel lymph node model systems, the spread of early cancer through the lymphatic system is progressive in a majority of cases. The lymphatic systems of the internal organs are much more complicated and difficult to study. Knowledge from melanoma and breast cancer spread to the sentinel lymph node may establish the basic principles of cancer metastasis. The goal of this review article is to emphasize the complexity of the lymphatic system. To date, the molecular mechanisms of cancer spread from the cancer microenvironment to the sentinel lymph node and distant sites are still poorly understood and their elucidation should take major priority in cancer metastasis research.

TI  - The difference and linkage between aerosol direct and indirect effects on precipitation over Southeast Asia during summer 2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid economic development and urbanization has enhanced the anthropogenic emissions over Southeast Asia, which drew great attention on the aerosol influence on its precipitation. Four simulations are conducted on summer 2015 using WRF-Chem to explore the aerosol direct effect (ADE) and aerosol indirect effect (AIE) on precipitation over Southeast Asia. The research is aiming to compare and discuss the land-sea difference between two effects and their mechanisms of influences. Based on the comparison analysis, it is showed that 1. Including the chemistry processes in the model improves the simulation to a limited extent; 2. ADE and AIE influence precipitation in an inverse way. ADE induces larger changes in precipitation than AIE and shows great land-sea difference; 3. ADE cools and enhances downward motion over the land surface and increases water vapor via aerosol absorption, which leads to suppressed precipitation and smaller rain radius; 4. AIE enhances the conversion of cloud water into rainwater and heats the land surface via cloud reduction, which leads to an enhancement in upward motion and precipitation.

TI  - Integration of optical, SAR and DEM data for automated detection of debris-covered glaciers over the western Nyainqentanglha using a random forest classifier
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of optical images to detect clean-ice glaciers has been well-demonstrated. Debris-covered glaciers, are different from clean-ice glaciers and are important for research of glacier mass balance. However, the main challenges to detect debris-covered glaciers in alpine regions faced by many researchers are the spectral similarity between debris-covered glaciers and the rocks and soils on both sides, as well as shadows cast from mountains, clouds and seasonal snow in satellite images. This study aimed to develop an automatic algorithm (using a Random Forest classifier model) implemented in the western Nyainqentanglha to map debris-covered glaciers based on multi-source datasets such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data, Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument data, Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor and Digital Elevation Models. All data was split into training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). The main strength of this study is that our method overcomes most of the above-mentioned challenges and the great accuracy (Kappa coefficient: 0.96, overall accuracy: 97.21%) of the Random Forest classifier model represents a comprehensive success in identifying debris-covered glaciers, illustrating that if this method can be executed efficiently, it will bring benefits for glacier inventory management. Additionally, an analysis of the spatial characteristic of the mountain glaciers showed that the glacier area, elevation and slope of the Nyainqentanglha Mountains were closely related. Moreover, most glacier movement occurred in glaciers with an area of less than 1 km2 and greater than 10 km2, which had mean velocities of 0.141 m/day and 0.168 m/day, respectively, and glacier movement explained the uncertainty of glacier facies mapping.

TI  - Hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies based on deep learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Savanna, also known as Cerrado, is considered a global hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The detailed mapping of vegetation types, called physiognomies, is still a challenge due to their high spectral similarity and spatial variability. There are three major ecosystem groups (forest, savanna, and grassland), which can be hierarchically subdivided into 25 detailed physiognomies, according to a well-known classification system. We used an adapted U-net architecture to process a WorldView-2 image with 2-m spatial resolution to hierarchically classify the physiognomies of a Cerrado protected area based on deep learning techniques. Several spectral channels were tested as input datasets to classify the three major ecosystem groups (first level of classification). The dataset composed of RGB bands plus 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) achieved the best performance and was used to perform the hierarchical classification. In the first level of classification, the overall accuracy was 92.8%. On the other hand, for the savanna and grassland detailed physiognomies (second level of classification), 86.1% and 85.0% were reached, respectively. As the first work that intended to classify Cerrado physiognomies in this level of detail using deep learning, our accuracy rates outperformed others that applied traditional machine learning algorithms for this task.

TI  - Role of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer: a review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph node involvement is still an important predictor of recurrence and survival in breast cancer. Axillary staging was classically done by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), but the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has led to a progressive and continuing de-escalation in its use. Therefore, SLNB can now be considered the standard procedure for axillary staging in clinically No patients. Different studies have also begun to report that a positive sentinel node does not always require ALND, reducing the morbidity derived from this technique. Fears that this sentinel node approach might not be accurate for neoadjuyant chemotherapy have been allayed by several studies showing that post-neoadjuyant SLNB in clinical No patients reduces the rate of ALN D. This approach benefits from axillary pathological complete response with an acceptable false-negative rate. By contrast, however, cN1 disease still requires that we optimise the technique to reduce the rate of false negatives. Currently, SLNB is the best method for axillary staging in breast cancer, allowing patients to be treated according to risk of recurrence, and with good evidence that morbidity is lower than with other more radical techniques.

TI  - Quantifying the lagged effects of climate factors on vegetation growth in 32 major cities of China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change affects vegetation growth around the world. It has been recognized that the effect of climate change on vegetation growth exhibits hysteresis. However, the duration and intensity of time-lag effect of climate factors on vegetation growth is still difficult to quantify. We analyzed the impacts of climate on vegetation growth in 32 major cities of China from 2010 to 2016. Vegetation growth conditions were characterized using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) datasets from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). The climate data were extracted from the Daily Value Data Set of China Surface Climate Data (V3.0), including precipitation (PRE; mm), air temperature (TEM; oC), sunshine duration (SSD; h), humidity (RHU; %), and evapotranspiration (EVP; mm). We used the vector autoregressive model (VAR) to analyze the lagged effects of climate factors on EVI, predict vegetation responses to future global changes, and validate its accuracy. Results showed that RHU had the longest (6.13 +/- 1.96 months) and strongest (median 0.34 EVI per unit RHU in the first lag period) time-lag effect on EVI, while EVP had the shortest (3.45 +/- 1.09 months) and weakest (median-0.02 EVI per unit EVP in the first lag period) time-lag effect on EVI. The time-lag effects of PRE and SSD on EVI were stronger in the south than in the north. Meanwhile, the EVI predicted by the VAR model was highly consistent with the observed EVI (root mean squared error, RMSE < 0.08), and the prediction accuracy generally improved by 23.43% compared with the EVI predicted by the multiple linear regression model (MLR). Our study highlights the necessity of considering time-lag effects when exploring vegetation-climate interaction. The methods developed in this study can be used to reveal the lagged effects of climatic factors on vegetation growth and improve prediction of EVI dynamics under climate change.

TI  - Responding to Worldview Threats in the Classroom: An Exploratory Study of Preservice Teachers
T2  - JOURNAL OF TEACHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used two training sessions and two focus groups with 17 preservice teachers (aged 20-36) completing their first teaching practicum placement during their Bachelor of Education program at an urban research university in western Canada. The aim was to implement ideas from terror management theory (TMT) during their teaching practicum. Participants explored how to facilitate contentious issues so as to prevent defensive reactions when worldviews clash in the classroom. A dramaturgical analysis identified participant objectives, conflicts, tactics, attitudes, emotions, and subtexts as they explored how to anticipate and avoid worldview and self-esteem threat, navigate tense pedagogical spaces, build capacity for expressing uncomfortable emotions, and diffuse threat with humor. Because difficult emotions are central to teaching potentially polarizing content, participating preservice teachers explored when compensatory reactions might emerge and, as a result, developed their own emotional awareness-TMT became both an experience and a teachable theory.

TI  - Triaxis Static Force Sensing for Langevin-Type Ultrasonic Tools Using Lead-Zirconate-Titanate Ceramic Rings
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel triaxis static force sensor that uses lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic rings is proposed. The actuator ring is driven at the resonance frequency of the thickness vibration mode to generate ultrasonic waves in the detector rings. The electric potential between the top and bottom surfaces of the detector ring due to the direct piezoelectric effect is measured. The sensing mechanism is based on the variation of the compliance coefficient with the applied force. The bolt-clamped Langevin transducer is the most widely used ultrasonic actuator in ultrasonic machining. The proposed design composed of two PZT ceramic rings imparts triaxis static force sensing capability to the Langevin transducer without the use of external components. The statics model, relationship between stress and the compliance coefficient, and decoupling matrix were derived to estimate the forces on the tool tip based on the voltages at the electrodes on the detector ring. The mean differences between the calculated and experimental results in terms of F-x, F-y, and F-z were 1.92%, 2.54%, and 4.26%, respectively, the full range of +/- 150 N. The experiments were conducted using different weights and a multiaxis force reference sensor.

TI  - Prognostic factors and population-based analysis of melanoma with sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous malignant melanoma is a rare but fatal disease in East Asia. Despite its increasing incidence, a general lack of awareness about the disease was noted. This study aims to provide population-based prognostic analysis of melanoma with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in Taiwan. We conducted this retrospective cohort study using the data from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database during 1997-2013. The study cohort contains 3284 patients. The 5-year survival rates of patients undergoing SLNB and not undergoing SLNB were 45.5% and 33.6%. In multivariate analysis, age >= 80 years [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 2.15] and male (aHR = 1.19) were associated with a poorer prognosis, while high social economic status (SES) (aHR = 0.69) and undergoing SLNB (aHR = 0.84) were good prognostic factors. Old age and low SES were associated with lower percentages of patients undergoing SLNB (P < 0.001). E-value analysis suggested robustness to unmeasured confounding. In conclusion, undergoing SLNB was associated with a better prognosis. The poor prognosis of old age and low SES may be due to decreased percentages of patients undergoing SLNB. Therefore, we recommend that SLNB should be performed on patients, especially in old age or low SES, who are candidates for SLNB according to current guidelines to achieve maximal survival.

TI  - Geospatial quantitative analysis of the Aral Sea Shoreline changes using RS and GIS techniques
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The variations in the lake area, water level, and water volume change of the Aral Sea from 1987 to 2018 were analyzed in this study, which is based on the multi-temporal Landsat images and remote sensing water body index (Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI). Lake shorelines were automatically digitized and visualized using Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) by Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The surface area, water level, and water volume change of the North Aral Sea were not changed significantly in 1987-2018. The maximum lake area appeared in March 2015 with 3550.15 km(2), the minimum lake area appeared in October 2001with 2830.56 km(2). However, since 2010 the South Aral Sea split into the East Aral Sea and the West Aral Sea, the area change has shrunk dramatically. The area of the East Aral Sea decreased by 17852.65 km(2) (89.99 %) from March 2011 to September 2018. The area of the West Aral Sea decreased by 2203.62 km(2) (35.96 %) from August 2014 to March 2017. The distance of lake shoreline changes and rates of net movement along transects were determined by DSAS. The two largest positive values of NSM were 18715.93 and 12268.67 m, which showed lake shoreline retreat, occurred in the periods of 2010-2018 in the East Aral Sea and 1987-1999 in the South Aral Sea, respectively. The two periods in which the largest negative value of NSM appeared was (1987-1993) and (2001-2010) in the North Aral Sea, and the lake shoreline expanding distance was 145.43 and 545.84 m, respectively.

TI  - The potential roles of pharmacy medication sales data to augment the syndromic surveillance system in response to COVID-19 and preparedness for other future infectious disease outbreaks in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Indonesia faces a continuous threat from communicable disease outbreaks. The current COVID-19 outbreak, the previous one of SARS, and many other infectious outbreaks encountered in the country warn of the need to develop comprehensive early warning systems to enable timely health responses in the long run. In this article, we argue that over the counter medication sales data at community pharmacies in Indonesia can potentially augment and increase the detection power of the current syndromic surveillance system, particularly in dealing with COVID-19 and other future infectious disease outbreaks in the country. Main Body This article discusses the experience of other countries in employing pharmacy medication sales data to serve as potential syndromic surveillance platform and contribute to pandemic responses. We argue why it is worth considering utilising medication sales data from pharmacies in Indonesia to support the current surveillance system which enables the provision of early warnings of disease outbreaks. We then discuss the potential challenges of operationalising these data and suggest a way forward for the development and implementation of the syndromic surveillance system at community pharmacy settings in Indonesia. Conclusion While there are several challenges in developing a workable system in Indonesia that need to be addressed, introducing a syndromic surveillance system using pharmacy-setting medication sales data is worth investigating in the country.

TI  - Evaluating cloud radiative effect from CMIP6 and two satellite datasets over the Tibetan Plateau based on CERES observation
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on 12 years (March 2000-February 2012) of monthly data from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System energy balanced and filled (CERES-EBAF), this study systematically evaluates the applicability of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and second Along-Track Scanning Radiometer and advanced ATSR (AATSR) flux products at the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA), and the ability of atmosphere-only simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase6 (CMIP6/AMIP) model in reproducing the observed spatial-temporal patterns of TOA cloud radiative effect (CRE) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Results show that TOA radiative fluxes from AVHRR and AATSR can be used to analyze their spatial/temporal characteristics over TP region, especially for AVHRR, but none of them can capture the observed CRE trend since 2000. In particular, when using AATSR TOA radiative flux in clear-sky of TP, the large bias of SW flux (regional mean about 30.48 Wm(-2)) compared with CERES-EBAF must be taken seriously. The multimodel ensemble mean (MEM) can sufficiently reproduce the temporal changes of CREs, particularly the shortwave CRE. Regarding the geographical pattern of CREs of MEM, the annual mean deviations of longwave CRE are very small, while obvious underestimations can be found in the southeastern TP for shortwave CRE. Additionally, the spatial distribution of CREs is difficult to reproduce for many individual models due to albedo and temperature biases of surface. Our results also demonstrated that MEM still has evident difficulties to capture realistic CRE trends in TP due to poor simulations in surface and cloud properties (particularly cloud fraction).

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antibody response and breakthrough infection in dialysis.
T2  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
M3  - Preprint
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients receiving dialysis are a sentinel population for groups at high risk for death and disability from COVID-19. Understanding correlates of protection post-vaccination can inform immunization and mitigation strategies.METHODS: Monthly since January 2021, we tested plasma from 4791 patients receiving dialysis for antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using a high-throughput assay. We qualitatively assessed the proportion without a detectable RBD response and among those with a response, semiquantitative median IgG index values. Using a nested case-control design, we matched each breakthrough case to five controls by age, sex, and vaccination-month to determine whether peak and pre-breakthrough RBD IgG index values were associated with risk for infection post-vaccination.RESULTS: Among 2563 vaccinated patients, the proportion without a detectable RBD response increased from 6.6% [95% CI 5.5-8.1] in 14-30 days post-vaccination to 20.2% [95% CI 17.1-23.8], and median index values declined from 92.7 (95% CI 77.8-107.5) to 3.7 (95% CI 3.1-4.3) after 5 months. Persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection prior-to-vaccination had higher peak index values than persons without prior infection, but values equalized by 5 months (p=0.230). Breakthrough infections occurred in 56 patients, with samples collected a median of 21 days pre-breakthrough. Peak and pre-breakthrough RBD values <23 (equivalent to <506 WHO BAU/mL) were associated with higher odds for breakthrough infection (OR: 3.7 [95% CI 2.0-6.8] and 9.8 [95% CI 2.9-32.8], respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination wanes rapidly, and in persons receiving dialysis, the persisting antibody response is associated with risk for breakthrough infection.

TI  - Neogene drainage reversal and Colorado Plateau uplift in the Salt River area, Arizona, USA
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - U-Pb detrital zircon and 40Ar-39Ar detrital sanidine dating of paleoriver deposits refines the timing of the mid Cenozoic drainage reversal from NE- to SW-flowing rivers across the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. NE flowing paleorivers of the Mogollon Rim Formation were of multiple ages: <= 59.38 Ma for the Flying V outcrop and <= 37-33 Ma for other outcrops. These NE-flowing paleorivers were defeated by construction of the 38-23 Ma Mogollon-Datil volcanic field and extensional collapse of the Mogollon Highlands. The 37.6-21.8 Ma Whitetail Conglomerate of the Salt River paleocanyon records the transition from NE-flowing rivers to internal drainage that persisted from 30 to 14.67 Ma during continued extensional collapse. The SW-flowing proto-Salt River was established by about 12 Ma and flowed into Tonto Basin -7 Ma. The Salt River extended its length to near Phoenix via basin spillover from the Tonto and Verde basins about 2.8 Ma and became established in its present path only in the past -500 ka. Between 3.0 and 0.52 Ma, incision rates of the Salt River's headwaters have been steady at 95 m/Ma as calculated using the age and height of four far-traveled basalt runouts from the Springerville volcanic field. These incision rates contrast with 10 m/Ma rates for downstream areas near the Sentinel-Arlington volcanic field on the Gila River over the past 2.37 Ma. This 85 m/Ma of differential incision was a geomorphic response of headwater drainages to changes in base level (base level fall plus headwater uplift) that, at least in part, was a consequence of top-down integration of the Salt and Verde river systems via spillover. Neogene headwater uplift is proposed to have set the stage for and perhaps driven this downward integration by increasing river gradients, and progressive uplift in the past 3 Ma may help explain post-integration steady headwater incision. Surface uplift components include construction of the Springerville and San Francisco volcanic fields and related mantle-driven epeirogenic uplift of the southern rim of the Colorado Plateau. Long-term differential incision rates for the Salt River (85 m/Ma) are less than for the Colorado River system (140 m/Ma across Grand Canyon) suggesting west-up neotectonic tilting of the Colorado Plateau.

TI  - COVID-19 slowdown induced improvement in air quality in India: rapid assessment using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 lock/slow down affected humanity and livelihood, while it showed some positive effects on the environment with improvement in air quality indicators. Though many studies published after COVID-19 first phase lockdown observed reduction in pollutants over India, no studies yet compared the air quality indicators over the two lock/slow down windows during 2020-2021. This study reports results of rapid assessment of seven air quality indicators such as Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Formaldehyde (HCHO), Methane (CH4), Carbon monoxide (CO), Aerosol (Ultraviolet Aerosol Index, UVAI), and Ozone (O-3) for the past three years on monthly time scale using TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) data on GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform over India, with focus on the Gangetic plain, an air pollution hotspot. Significant reduction in NO2, SO2, HCHO and Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) was observed during March-May 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, while the levels of NO2, SO2, HCHO and CO increased significantly in 2021 compared to March-May 2020. This suggests that COVID-19 lock/slow down in 2020 played a significant role in improving air quality indicators, while the relaxation in 2021 has led to detoriation, compared to 2020. The pyrogenic (forest fire and slash and burn agriculture) and agricultural (wet crop) sources were identified to contaminate the expression of slow/lock down effects on air quality indicators such as HCHO, CO and CH4 over India.

TI  - Decision tree-based classification in coastal area integrating polarimetric SAR and optical data
T2  - DATA TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose As one of the world's most productive ecosystems, ecological land plays an important role in regional and global environments. Utilizing advanced optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for land cover/land use research becomes increasingly popular. This research aims to investigate the complementarity of fully polarimetric SAR and optical imaging for ecological land classification in the eastern coastal area of China. Design/methodology/approach Four polarimetric decomposition methods, namely, H/Alpha, Yamaguchi3, VanZyl3 and Krogager, were applied to Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) SAR image for scattering parameter extraction. These parameters were merged with ALOS optical parameters for subsequent classification using the object-based quick, unbiased, efficient statistical tree decision tree method. Findings The experimental results indicate that an improved classification performance was obtained in the decision level when merging the two data sources. In fact, unlike classification using only optical images, the proposed approach allowed to distinguish ecological land with similar spectrum but different scattering. Moreover, unlike classification using only polarimetric information, the integration of polarimetric and optical data allows to accurately distinguish reed from artemisia and sand from salt field and therefore achieve a detailed classification of the coastal area characteristics. Originality/value This research proposed an integrated classification method for coastal ecological land with polarimetric SAR and optical data. The object-based and decision-level fusion enables effective ecological land classification in coastal area was verified.

TI  - Effect of climate and ecological restoration on vegetation changes in the "Three-River Headwaters" region based on remote sensing technology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperature and precipitation are factors effecting vegetation growth. Vegetation coverage change is one of the important factors influencing global and regional climate change. Dynamic monitoring of vegetation change can reflect the trend of climate change to a certain extent. Three-River Headwaters are located in the hinterland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It has the characteristics of "high, cold, and dry" (higher altitude, cold and dry weather) and its ecosystem is fragile. In recent years, with the global climate change, a series of eco-environmental problems such as river flow cutoff, permafrost degradation, and vegetation destruction has occurred in the headwaters area, which are closely related to climate and vegetation changes. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of ecological environment degradation in the region, various ecological restoration policies have implemented. Several uncertainties in the relationship between vegetation and climate change in the Three-River Headwaters region. This study aims to find out the uncertainties. In this study, the spatial distribution of vegetation coverage was calculated by using NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) from the first-level product of MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) remote sensing data. Combining policy factors, the relationship between rainfall, surface temperature, and vegetation growth status were analyzed. The results show that during the study period (1948-2019), the temperature rose significantly and the rainfall increased especially after the implementation of ecological restoration policy (after 2000). Vegetation coverage increased year-by-year (2000-2015). The rainfall effect on surface temperature and vegetation growth, when the summer rainfall increased, the temperature decreased, leads to vegetation coverage decreased (for example, 2001, 2003, 2008 and 2011); the dependence of vegetation on rainfall has obvious lag in Three-River Headwaters in summer. In the years with suitable rainfall and higher temperature in summer, the vegetation grows better and the vegetation coverage increases. This is mainly because the Three-River Headwaters is located in the alpine zone, and vegetation growth is more dependent on temperature. The implementation of ecological restoration policy promotes vegetation coverage. Studying the impact of climate and policy factors on vegetation cover is of great scientific significance and practical value for understanding the ecological restoration mechanism in high cold and arid regions.

TI  - Estimation of crop evapotranspiration from MODIS data by combining random forest and trapezoidal models
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important parameter for crop growth monitoring and land surface modeling. This paper proposed a new workflow, namely ESVEP-RF, to calculate ET during the crop growing season using MODIS data by combining the advantages of the trapezoidal model and Random Forest (RF) algorithm. In ESVEP-RF, the endmember-based soil and vegetation energy partitioning (ESVEP) model was first used to calculate a series of parameters from MODIS and meteorological inputs, and then all parameters derived from remote sensing data, meteorological data and ESVEP models were used as inputs to the RF algorithm for latent heat flux (LE) calculation. In-situ data of 12 years (2003-2012, 2018 and 2019) from five flux towers located in Nebraska (NE) and Michigan (MI) were used to test the performance of ESVEP-RF, and results showed that ESVEP-RF had great potential to accurately calculate ET when the number of training samples was sufficient and representative. In 2010 and 2011, R-2 of LE were around 0.8 and RMSE were around 70 W/m(2), which outperformed original ESVEP model results. This indicated that the RF algorithm could better describe the non-linear correlation between in LST/FVC space endmembers and LE. Among all parameters, LAI, PLEv and R-vw had high contribution with percentage importance of 18.49%, 15.71% and 13.57%, respectively. Furthermore, all samples between 2003 and 2012 collected from the three NE sites were used to train RF models and then calculate LE for both NE and MI sites in 2018 and 2019. In NE sites, RMSE was around 65 W/m(2) and R-2 was around 0.8. In MI sites, it was noted that no samples from these sites were included in the training data set, and RMSE was around 70 W/m(2) and R-2 was higher than 0.7. These results showed the potential of ESVEP-RF for providing up-to-date ET information.

TI  - WetNet: A Spatial-Temporal Ensemble Deep Learning Model for Wetland Classification Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While deep learning models have been extensively applied to land-use land-cover (LULC) problems, it is still a relatively new and emerging topic for separating and classifying wetland types. On the other hand, ensemble learning has demonstrated promising results in improving and boosting classification accuracy. Accordingly, this study aims to develop a classification system for mapping complex wetland areas by incorporating deep ensemble learning and satellite datasets. To this end, time series of Sentinel-1 dual-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset, alongside Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (MSI), are used as input data to the model. In order to increase the diversity of the extracted features, the proposed model, herein called WetNet, consists of three different submodels, comprising several recurrent and convolutional layers. Furthermore, multiple ensembling sections are added to different stages of the model to increase the transferability of the model (to other areas) and the reliability of the final results. WetNet is evaluated in a complex wetland area located in Newfoundland, Canada. Experimental results indicate that WetNet outperforms the state-of-the-art deep models (e.g., InceptionResnetV2, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121) in terms of both the classification accuracy and processing time. This makes WetNet an efficient model for large-scale wetland mapping application. The python code of the proposed WetNet model is available at the following link for the sake of reproducibility: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pvMOd3_tFYaMYGyHNfxqDxOiwF78lKgN?usp=sharing

TI  - Impact of baseline SARS-CoV-2 antibody status on syndromic surveillance and the risk of subsequent COVID-19-a prospective multicenter cohort study
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In a prospective healthcare worker (HCW) cohort, we assessed the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to baseline serostatus. Methods Baseline serologies were performed among HCW from 23 Swiss healthcare institutions between June and September 2020, before the second COVID-19 wave. Participants answered weekly electronic questionnaires covering information about nasopharyngeal swabs (PCR/rapid antigen tests) and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Screening of symptomatic staff by nasopharyngeal swabs was routinely performed in participating facilities. We compared numbers of positive nasopharyngeal tests and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms between HCW with and without anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. Results A total of 4812 HCW participated, wherein 144 (3%) were seropositive at baseline. We analyzed 107,807 questionnaires with a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Median number of answered questionnaires was similar (24 vs. 23 per person, P = 0.83) between those with and without positive baseline serology. Among 2712 HCW with >= 1 SARS-CoV-2 test during follow-up, 3/67 (4.5%) seropositive individuals reported a positive result (one of whom asymptomatic), compared to 547/2645 (20.7%) seronegative participants, 12 of whom asymptomatic (risk ratio [RR] 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.66). Seropositive HCWs less frequently reported impaired olfaction/taste (6/144, 4.2% vs. 588/4674, 12.6%, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.73), chills (19/144, 13.2% vs. 1040/4674, 22.3%, RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.90), and limb/muscle pain (28/144, 19.4% vs. 1335/4674, 28.6%, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.49-0.95). Impaired olfaction/taste and limb/muscle pain also discriminated best between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Conclusions Having SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies provides almost 80% protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection for a period of at least 8 months.

TI  - A microfluidic platform for highly parallel bite by bite profiling of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito bites transmit a number of pathogens via salivary droplets deposited during blood-feeding, resulting in potentially fatal diseases. Little is known about the genomic content of these nanodroplets, including the transmission dynamics of live pathogens. Here we introduce Vectorchip, a low-cost, scalable microfluidic platform enabling high-throughput molecular interrogation of individual mosquito bites. We introduce an ultra-thin PDMS membrane which acts as a biting interface to arrays of micro-wells. Freely-behaving mosquitoes deposit saliva droplets by biting into these micro-wells. By modulating membrane thickness, we observe species-dependent differences in mosquito biting capacity, utilizable for selective sample collection. We demonstrate RT-PCR and focus-forming assays on-chip to detect mosquito DNA, Zika virus RNA, as well as quantify infectious Mayaro virus particles transmitted from single mosquito bites. The Vectorchip presents a promising approach for single-bite-resolution laboratory and field characterization of vector-pathogen communities, and could serve as a powerful early warning sentinel for mosquito-borne diseases.High-throughput molecular surveillance of mosquitoes carrying dangerous pathogens is currently challenging. Here the authors present Vectorchip, a low-cost microfluidic platform enabling multiplexed detection of mosquito DNA, viral RNA and infectious viral particles at single bite resolution.

TI  - The Gulf of St. Lawrence Biogeochemical Model: A Modelling Tool for Fisheries and Ocean Management
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this paper is to give a detailed description of the coupled physical-biogeochemical model of the Gulf of St. Lawrence that includes dissolved oxygen and carbonate system components, as well as a detailed analysis of the riverine contribution for different nitrogen and carbonate system components. A particular attention was paid to the representation of the microbial loop in order to maintain the appropriate level of the different biogeochemical components within the system over long term simulations. The skill of the model is demonstrated using in situ data, satellite data and estimated fluxes from different studies based on observational data. The model reproduces the main features of the system such as the phytoplankton bloom, hypoxic areas, pH and calcium carbonate saturation states. The model also reproduces well the estimated transport of nitrate from one region to the other. We revisited previous estimates of the riverine nutrient contribution to surface nitrate in the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary using the model. We also explain the mechanisms that lead to high ammonium concentrations, low dissolved oxygen, and undersaturated calcium carbonate conditions on the Magdalen Shallows.

T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Antarctica plays an important role in research on global change, and its unique geography, ocean, climate, and environment provide an ideal place for humankind to understand Earth's evolution. Remote sensing provides an effective means to monitor and observe large-scale processes on the continent. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in particular provides the capability for all-weather Earth observation. The Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B SAR satellites have ideal ground coverage and imaging frequency for observing Antarctica. This study developed a dataset of 69,586 Sentinel-1 EW mode satellite images of the Antarctic ice sheet from October 2014 to December 2020. The dataset was processed with the European Space Agency Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and a Python batch scheduling tool on the Big Earth Data Cloud Service Platform of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Big Earth Data Science Engineering Program (CASEarth). Several data processing operations were implemented to process the raw dataset, including radiometric calibration, invalid edge removal, geocoding, data re-projection to an Antarctic projection, data compression to TIFF format, and construction of image pyramids. The dataset is available at http://www.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.j00076.00085.

TI  - Data Assimilation of Growing Stock Volume Using a Sequence of Remote Sensing Data from Different Sensors
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) has implied a disruptive transformation of how data are gathered for forest management planning in Nordic countries. We show in this study that the accuracy of ALS predictions of growing stock volume can be maintained and even improved over time if they are forecasted and assimilated with more frequent but less accurate remote sensing data sources like satellite images, digital photogrammetry, and InSAR. We obtained these results by introducing important methodological adaptations to data assimilation compared to previous forestry studies in Sweden. On a test site in the southwest of Sweden (58 degrees 27 ' N, 13 degrees 39 ' E), we evaluated the performance of the extended Kalman filter and a proposed modified filter that accounts for error correlations. We also applied classical calibration to the remote sensing predictions. We evaluated the developed methods using a dataset with nine different acquisitions of remotely sensed data from a mix of sensors over four years, starting and ending with ALS-based predictions of growing stock volume. The results showed that the modified filter and the calibrated predictions performed better than the standard extended Kalman filter and that at the endpoint the prediction based on data assimilation implied an improved accuracy (25.0% RMSE), compared to a new ALS-based prediction (27.5% RMSE).

TI  - Generation and analysis of stage-fall-discharge laws from coupled hydrological-hydraulic river network model integrating sparse multi-satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current and forthcoming altimetry satellites provide increasing hydraulic visibility of river surface variabilities. However, due to unobservable river bathymetry and friction, as well as the sampling and quality of remote sensing data, discharge estimation remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a new rigorous methodology to estimate stage-fall-discharge laws at any point of a hydrographic network including backwater affected reaches. This methodology is adapted to operational estimation of discharge from multi-mission satellite altimetry data. The cornerstone of the method is to take advantage of meaningful hydraulic signatures, including water surface slopes, simulated by a river network model optimally combined with multi-satellite noisy observations. This optimal combination of heterogeneous multi-source data with a river network model is achieved through variational data assimilation performed using the DassFlow-HiVDI hydraulic model inflowed by MGB regional hydrological model. It is newly applied to the large and complex Negro-Branco River network in the Amazon basin. An effective model is obtained by variational calibration using Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A and -3B altimetry observations between February 2016 and May 2019. A fairly good fit bellow 1 m for 80% of the altimetric observations is obtained. Using this hydrodynamic model as a fine spatio-temporal extrapolator of hydraulic quantities, and in particular of multi-scale water surface slope signatures, the parameters of a general SFD law, as well as the uncertainties estimations, can be constrained at any location within the river network domain using a Bayesian optimization method. This methodology is tested over 4 virtual stations representing various hydraulic complexities. Accurate discharge estimates and meaningful SFD parameters are obtained compared to those of the reference low Froude model at these locations. Analyses are also performed on a reference case with fine-scale bathymetry data of the Garonne River, France. The strength of the method lies in its applicability to noisy multi-satellite data while ensuring physical consistency. It should be applicable in real time to any river basin, using nadir altimetry only or combined to the forthcoming SWOT satellite data. Moreover, the method allows to take full advantage, via the hydrodynamic model, of variable water masks observations and physical segmentations of river networks. The method is implemented in the open source hydrodynamic data assimilation platform DassFlow.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite retrievals of liquid clouds from the GOES-13 imager and MODIS over the midlatitude North Atlantic during the NAAMES campaign
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrievals of cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)) and optical depth (tau) from the Thirteenth Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-13) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua and Terra, based on the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project algorithms, are evaluated with airborne data collected over the midlatitude boundary layer during the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES). The airborne dataset comprises in situ r(e) from the Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP) and remotely sensed re and tau from the airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). GOES-13 and MODIS (Aqua and Terra) r(e) values are systematically greater than those from the CDP and RSP by at least 4.8 (GOES-13) and 1.7 mu m (MODIS) despite relatively high linear correlation coefficients (r=0.52-0.68). In contrast, the satellite tau underestimates its RSP counterpart by -3.0, with r=0.76-0.77. Overall, MODIS yields better agreement with airborne data than GOES-13, with biases consistent with those reported for subtropical stratocumulus clouds. While the negative bias in satellite tau is mostly due to the retrievals having been collected in highly heterogeneous cloud scenes, the causes for the positive bias in satellite re, especially for GOES-13, are more complex. Although the high viewing zenith angle (similar to 65 degrees) and coarser pixel resolution for GOES-13 could explain a re bias of at least 0.7 mu m, the higher GOES-13 r(e) bias relative to that from MODIS is likely rooted in other factors. In this regard, a near-monotonic increase was also observed in GOES-13 re up to 1.0 mu m with the satellite scattering angle (Theta) over the angular range 116-165 degrees; that is, re increases toward the backscattering direction. Understanding the variations of re with Theta will require the combined use of theoretical computations along with intercomparisons of satellite retrievals derived from sensors with dissimilar viewing geometry.

TI  - Multi-Scale Spectral Separability of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Species in a Freshwater Ecosystem
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing has been suggested as a preferred method for monitoring submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), a critical component of freshwater ecosystems that is facing increasing pressures due to climate change and human disturbance. However, due to the limited prior application of remote sensing to mapping freshwater vegetation, major foundational knowledge gaps remain, specifically in terms of the specificity of the targets and the scales at which they can be monitored. The spectral separability of SAV from the St. Lawrence River, Ontario, Canada, was therefore examined at the leaf level (i.e., spectroradiometer) as well as at coarser spectral resolutions simulating airborne and satellite sensors commonly used in the SAV mapping literature. On a Leave-one-out Nearest Neighbor criterion (LNN) scale of values from 0 (inseparable) to 1 (entirely separable), an LNN criterion value between 0.82 (separating amongst all species) and 1 (separating between vegetation and non-vegetation) was achieved for samples collected in the peak-growing season from the leaf level spectroradiometer data. In contrast, samples from the late-growing season and those resampled to coarser spectral resolutions were less separable (e.g., inter-specific LNN reduction of 0.25 in late-growing season samples as compared to the peak-growing season, and of 0.28 after resampling to the spectral response of Landsat TM5). The same SAV species were also mapped from actual airborne hyperspectral imagery using target detection analyses to illustrate how theoretical fine-scale separability translates to an in situ, moderate-spatial scale application. Novel radiometric correction, georeferencing, and water column compensation methods were applied to optimize the imagery analyzed. The SAV was generally well detected (overall recall of 88% and 94% detecting individual vegetation classes and vegetation/non-vegetation, respectively). In comparison, underwater photographs manually interpreted by a group of experts (i.e., a conventional SAV survey method) tended to be more effective than target detection at identifying individual classes, though responses varied substantially. These findings demonstrated that hyperspectral remote sensing is a viable alternative to conventional methods for identifying SAV at the leaf level and for monitoring at larger spatial scales of interest to ecosystem managers and aquatic researchers.

TI  - De-escalation of axillary irradiation for early breast cancer-Has the time come?
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy, initially in clinically node-negative and subsequently in patients presenting with involved axilla and downstaged by primary systemic therapy, allowed for significant decrease in morbidity compared to axillary lymph node dissection. Concurrently, regional nodal irradiation was demonstrated to improve outcomes in most node-positive patients. Additionally, over the last decades, introduction of more effective systemic therapies has resulted in improvements not only at distant sites, but also in locoregional control, creating space for de-escalation of locoregional treatments. We discuss the data on de-escalation in axillary surgery and irradiation, both in patients undergoing upfront surgery and primary systemic therapy, with special emphasis on the feasibility of omission of nodal irradiation in patients undergoing primary systemic therapy. In view of the accumulating evidence, omission of axillary irradiation may be considered in clinically node-positive patients converting after primary systemic therapy to pathologically negative nodes on sentinel lymph node biopsy (preferably also with in-breast pCR), presenting with lower initial nodal stage, older age and were treated with breast-conserving surgery followed by whole breast irradiation. Omission of regional nodal irradiation in patients with aggressive tumor phenotypes achieving a pCR is under investigation. In patients undergoing preoperative endocrine therapy the adoption of axillary management strategies utilized in case of upfront surgery seems more suitable than those used in post chemotherapy-based primary systemic therapy setting.

TI  - The flowering of Atlantic Forest <i>Pleroma</i> trees
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial distribution of a plant is a current challenge in ecology. Here, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and 33,798 Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to detect and map forest stands dominated by trees of the genus Pleroma by their magenta-to-deep-purple blossoms in the entire Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain, from June 2016 to July 2020. The Pleroma genus, known for its pioneer behaviour, was detected in an area representing 10.8% of the Atlantic Forest, associated negatively with temperature and positively with elevation, slope, tree cover and precipitation. The detection of another genus by the model, 18% of all the detections contained only pink blooming Handroanthus trees, highlighted that botanical identification from space must be taken with caution, particularly outside the known distribution range of the species. The Pleroma blossom seasonality occurred over a period of similar to 5-6 months centered on the March equinox and populations with distinct blossom timings were found. Our results indicate that in the Atlantic Forest, the remaining natural forest is less diverse than expected but is at least recovering from degradation. Our study suggests a method to produce ecological-domain scale maps of tree genera and species based on their blossoms that could be used for tree studies and biodiversity assessments.

TI  - Enterochromaffin Cells: Sentinels to Gut Microbiota in Hyperalgesia?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, increasing studies have been conducted on the mechanism of gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric diseases and non-neuropsychiatric diseases. The academic community has also recognized the existence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Chronic pain has always been an urgent difficulty for human beings, which often causes anxiety, depression, and other mental symptoms, seriously affecting people's quality of life. Hyperalgesia is one of the main adverse reactions of chronic pain. The mechanism of gut microbiota in hyperalgesia has been extensively studied, providing a new target for pain treatment. Enterochromaffin cells, as the chief sentinel for sensing gut microbiota and its metabolites, can play an important role in the interaction between the gut microbiota and hyperalgesia through paracrine or neural pathways. Therefore, this systematic review describes the role of gut microbiota in the pathological mechanism of hyperalgesia, learns about the role of enterochromaffin cell receptors and secretions in hyperalgesia, and provides a new strategy for pain treatment by targeting enterochromaffin cells through restoring disturbed gut microbiota or supplementing probiotics.

TI  - Visualization positioning-guided biopsy of suspicious breast microcalcifications: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: At present, most histological evaluations of microcalcifications without a mass are performed using X-ray guided hook wire localization or vacuum-assisted stereotactic biopsy (VASB), but there are still several limitations to these techniques. Therefore, we designed a visualization positioning technique based on three directions of mammography to accurately locate suspected microcalcifications to guide the biopsy.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with suspicious microcalcifications who underwent visualization positioning-guided biopsy (VPB) from June 1, 2016, to June 1, 2021. The visualization positioning technique was performed using an electronic ruler to measure the vertical distance from the microcalcification core to the vertical lines on mammography.Results: A total of 133 patients (median age 46 years; range, 22-87 years) who underwent VPB were included in our study. Among the 133 cases of microcalcifications based on pathological results, 104 were benign, 14 were high risk, and 15 were malignant. In 124 (93.2%) patients, microcalcification was confirmed during the first round of VPB specimen analysis. Only 6 (4.5%) and 3 (2.3%) patients underwent second and third extended resections, respectively, as the resected specimens did not contain microcalcifications. Four patients (3.0%) with malignant biopsy results underwent a subsequent operation. Two patients with DCIS underwent mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy because of diffuse calcification. One patient had no residual cancer, and the other was upgraded to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Two patients with IDC underwent breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy.Conclusions: VPB can be used to evaluate breast microcalcifications when a mass is not present, making it an effective diagnostic technique.

TI  - Syndromic Surveillance as a Tool for Case-Based Varicella Reporting in Georgia, 2016-2019
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Syndromic surveillance can be used to enhance notifiable disease case-based surveillance. We analyzed features of varicella reported in Georgia to evaluate case detection through syndromic surveillance and to compare varicella reported through syndromic surveillance with varicella reported from all other sources. Methods Syndromic surveillance was incorporated into case-based varicella surveillance by the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) in May 2016. A cross-sectional study design evaluated syndromic and nonsyndromic varicella reported to GDPH from May 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. Varicella was reported by nonsyndromic sources including health care providers, schools, and laboratories. We identified syndromic varicella cases from urgent care and emergency department visit data with discharge diagnoses containing the terms "varicella" or "chickenpox." Results Syndromic notifications accounted for 589 of 2665 (22.1%) suspected varicella reports investigated by GDPH. The positive predictive value was 33.1% for syndromic notifications and 31.3% for nonsyndromic notifications. Mean days from rash onset to GDPH notification was 3.2 days fewer (P < .001) among patients identified through syndromic notification than among patients identified through nonsyndromic notification. The odds of varicella identified by syndromic notification being outbreak-associated were 0.18 (95% CI, 0.09-0.36) times those of varicella identified through nonsyndromic notification. Practice Implications Syndromic notifications were an effective, timely means for varicella case detection. Syndromic patients were significantly less likely than nonsyndromic patients to be outbreak-associated, possibly because of early detection. Syndromic surveillance enhanced case-based reporting for varicella in Georgia and was a useful tool to improve notifiable disease surveillance.

TI  - Molecular blood group screening in Omani blood donors
T2  - VOX SANGUINIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Blood group genotyping has been used in different populations. This study aims at evaluating the genotypes of common blood group antigens in the Omani blood donors and to assess the concordance rate with obtained phenotypes. Material and Methods Blood samples from 180 Omani donors were evaluated. Samples were typed by serological methods for the five blood group systems MNS, RH (RHD/RHCE), KEL, FY and JK. Samples were genotyped using RBC-FluoGene vERYfy eXtend kit (inno-train (c)). Predicted phenotypic variants for 70 red blood cell antigens among the MNS, RH (RHD/RHCE), KEL, FY, JK, DO, LU, YT, DI, VEL, CO and KN blood group systems were assessed. Results Simultaneous phenotype and genotype results were available in 130 subjects. Concordance rate was >95% in all blood group systems with exception of Fy(b+) (87%). Homozygous GATA-1 mutation leading to erythroid silencing FY*02N.01 (resulting in the Fy(b-)(ES) phenotype) was detected in 81/112 (72%) of genotyped samples. In addition, discrepant Fy(b) phenotype/genotype result was obtained in 14/112 samples; 13 of which has a heterozygous GATA-1 mutation and one sample with a wild GATA genotype. D and partial e c.733C>G variants expressing the V+VS+ phenotype were found in 22/121 (18.2%) and 14/120 (11.7%) of the samples, respectively. Di(a-b+), Js(a-b+), Yt(a+b-) and Kn(a+b-) genotype frequencies were 99.4%, 95.8%, 91.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Conclusion In conclusion, we report a high frequency of FY*02N.01 allele due to homozygous c.-67T>C GATA-1 single-nucleotide variation. This is the first study reporting the detailed distribution of common and rare red cell genotypes in Omani blood donors.

TI  - Ecosystem services (ES) provided by ditches in a desert agricultural valley
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural ditches can be an efficient method for removing nutrients in wetlands and rivers. In this paper, we document that additionally, ditches offer other ecosystem services (ES) such as providing bird habitat and sediment retention. A typical ditch reach of 6 km with variable width between 3 and 80 m and water depth from 0.06 and 0.5 m, was selected as a monitoring site among 1492 km of a drain network in the agricultural Mexicali Valley located in the Colorado River Delta. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentration and discharge flow rate determinations were obtained monthly during a year, at three stations along the ditch, dividing the reach into two segments. Total nutrient removal efficiency of 39%, along the monitoring year was observed. Additionally, nutrient mass flow had a significant winter-spring seasonal increment associated with crop irrigation, up four times for total nitrogen, nearly 2.5 times for nitrogen-based nutrients, and five times for PO4. Monthly estimations of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel images were obtained to evaluate the response of riparian vegetation to high flow discharge seasonal fluctuations, from 0.072 to 1.219 m3 s-1, and nutrient mass flow changes. No correlation among them was found, as riparian species are tolerant to high water levels and nutrient concentration fluctuation. Downstream changes in water electrical conductivity from 6.06 to 8.45 mS cm-1 along the resulted in the shift from Typha domingensis to Phragmatis australis which has a higher salinity tolerance. An intensive bird census showed ditch vegetation provided suitable habitat and refuge to 29 different bird species, including five common birds of the flooded remnant areas of the Colorado River Delta, as well as migratory birds. By using slope criteria of drainage network, 47% of it has a high and moderated potential of sediment retention. These ES are fundamental in semiarid regions because of the intense land-use changes from riparian and desert ecosystems to irrigation lands, as well as water being diverted from natural streams to irrigation channels. This study highlights the importance of considering agricultural ditches as helpful, not only as a natural water treatment of agricultural pollutants, but also as providers of resident and migratory bird habitat and vegetation diversity and erosion regulation by sediment retention on desert agricultural valleys.

TI  - Presence of DNA from <i>Chlamydia</i>-like organisms in the nasal cavities of grey seal pups (<i>Halichoerus grypus</i>) and three different substrates present in a breeding colony
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Chlamydia-like organisms (CLO) have been found to be present in many environmental niches, including human sewage and agricultural run-off, as well as in a number of aquatic species worldwide. Therefore, monitoring their presence in sentinel wildlife species may be useful in assessing the wider health of marine food webs in response to habitat loss, pollution and disease. We used nasal swabs from live (n = 42) and dead (n = 50) pre-weaned grey seal pups and samples of differing natal substrates (n = 8) from an off-shore island devoid of livestock and permanent human habitation to determine if CLO DNA is present in these mammals and to identify possible sources. Results We recovered CLO DNA from 32/92 (34.7%) nasal swabs from both live (n = 17) and dead (n = 15) seal pups that clustered most closely with currently recognised species belonging to three chlamydial families: Parachlamydiaceae (n = 22), Rhabdochlamydiaceae (n = 6), and Simkaniaceae (n = 3). All DNA positive sediment samples (n = 7) clustered with the Rhabdochlamydiaceae. No difference was found in rates of recovery of CLO DNA in live versus dead pups suggesting the organisms are commensal but their potential as opportunistic secondary pathogens could not be determined. Conclusion This is the first report of CLO DNA being found in marine mammals. This identification warrants further investigation in other seal populations around the coast of the UK and in other areas of the world to determine if this finding is unique or more common than shown by this data. Further investigation would also be warranted to determine if they are present as purely commensal organisms or whether they could also be opportunistic pathogens in seals, as well as to investigate possible sources of origin, including whether they originated as a result of anthropogenic impacts, including human waste and agricultural run-off.

T2  - American journal of clinical pathology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The TNM classification is the main tool for lymph node (LN) staging in gastric cancer (GC). However, alternative LN staging systems have been proposed, and the role of features other than the number of metastatic LNs is being investigated. Our aim is to discuss the main challenges of LN assessment in GC.METHODS: Comprehensive review of the literature on alternative LN staging systems, examined LNs, sentinel LN (SLN) biopsy, LN micrometastases (LNMIs), extracapsular extension (ECE), and tumor deposits (TDs) in GC.RESULTS: Many controversies exist regarding LN assessment in GC. The TNM classification shows excellent prognostic performance, but alternative prognostic methods such as the LN ratio or log odds of positive LNs have demonstrated to be better than the TNM system in terms of prognostic accuracy. The value of SLN biopsy and LNMIs in GC is still unclear, and several challenges concerning their clinical impact and pathologic analysis must be overcome before their introduction in clinical practice. Most authors have identified ECE and TDs as independent prognostic factors for survival in GC.CONCLUSIONS: Further studies should be performed to evaluate the impact of these features on the TNM classification and patient outcomes, as well as to standardize alternative LN staging systems.

TI  - Siglec-15 Is an Immune Suppressor and Potential Target for Immunotherapy in the Pre-Metastatic Lymph Node of Colorectal Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node metastasis indicates a poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of lymph node metastasis, we analyzed transcriptome characteristics of the pre-metastatic lymph node, a putative microenvironment favorable for the seeding and proliferation of cancer cells. Thus, we tried to compare and elucidate the transcriptional and immune characteristics of sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) with matched non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSNs) in colorectal cancer patients. In this study, a total of 38 pairs of SNs and NSNs were collected, in which 26 pairs of non-metastatic lymph nodes were subjected to RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis for the gene expression profiles. There were 16 differentially expressed genes between SNs and NSNs being identified, including 9 upregulated and 7 downregulated genes in SN. Gene Ontology (GO) classification analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in leukocyte differentiation, chemokine secretion, and immune system regulation. In the meantime, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that immune-related signaling pathways, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) signaling, were enriched in NSN, while cell proliferation-related signaling pathways were enriched in SN, including MYC signaling and G2M checkpoint signaling. We further identified SIGLEC15 as a top upregulated gene in SN. However, RNAscope assay showed that SIGLEC15 was not largely co-expressed with M2 macrophage marker CD163. We then selected eight pairs of lymph nodes for further cytological studies. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Siglec-15 was expressed on all myeloid cell subsets. The relative expression of SEGLEC15 (SN/NSN) was correlated with the microsatellite instability (MSI) status in colorectal cancer patients. Further studies found that small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-mediated silencing of SLGLEC15 can enhance the anti-tumor function of T cells, as indicated by cytokine release analysis. In conclusion, we presented here a first report on the gene expression profiling of the pre-metastatic lymph node in colorectal cancer. The findings in this study suggest that SIGLEC15 plays an important role in SN immunosuppression. SEGLEC15 silencing could be a therapeutic strategy for restoring T cell function in tumor SNs.

TI  - Hotter and drier climate made the Mediterranean Europe and Northern Africa region a shrubbier landscape
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A shift to higher temperatures has left the Mediterranean Europe and Northern Africa (MENA) region more vulnerable to drought and land degradation. We used MODIS LAI (leaf area index) and GPP (gross primary production) deficits, the differences between actual and historical-maximum values, to describe vegetation structural and functional changes and consequential landcover change in response to changing climate conditions during 2001-2019 in the area (20 degrees W-45 degrees E, 20 degrees N-45 degrees N). We found that 1) the vegetation responses varied significantly among eight landcover types with the decreasing importance: forests, savannas, a mosaic of cropland and natural vegetation (CNV), croplands, permanent wetlands, urban land, grasslands, and shrublands, each with distinctive yet overlapping signatures over the ranges of the climate conditions considered. 2) Forests, occupying the coolest and wettest niche, showed the strongest response to severe drought with a lag of 1-3 years and a legacy effect for 10 years. Shrubs, occupying the hottest and driest niche, were the most resilient under a hotter and drier climate. 3) The total areas of savannas and CNV increased by 394,994 and 404,592 km(2), respectively, while that of forests decreased by 33,091 km(2). Shrublands extended by 287,134 km(2) while grasslands and croplands retreated by 490,644 and 225,263 km(2). The area of wetlands increased by 49,192 km(2), and that of urban land increased by 39,570 km(2). A total of 57,649 km(2) of barren land became vegetated over the years. Along with higher temperature and more extended period of drought, MENA has evolved towards a shrubbier landscape.

TI  - Opinion Understanding and interpreting mosquito blood feeding studies: the case of Aedes albopictus
T2  - TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Blood feeding is a fundamental mosquito behavior with consequences for pathogen transmission and control. Feeding behavior can be studied through two lenses - patterns and preference. Feeding patterns are assessed via blood meal analyses, reflecting mosquito-host associations influenced by environmental and biological parameters. Bias can profoundly impact results, and we provide recommendations for mitigating these effects. We also outline design choices for host preference research, which can take many forms, and highlight their respective (dis)advantages for preference measurement. Finally, Aedes albopictus serves as a case study for how to apply these lessons to interpret data and understand feeding biology. We illustrate how assumptions and incomplete evidence can lead to inconsistent interpretations by reviewing Ae. albopictus feeding studies alongside prevalent narratives about perceived behavior.

TI  - A Seasonal Resilience Index to Evaluate the Impacts of Super Typhoons on Urban Vegetation in Hong Kong
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation plays a vital role in developing sustainable cities via essential urban ecoservices. Potential threats, however, from natural disturbances to urban vegetation and its resilience remain unclear at local scales. Taking the super typhoon Mangkhut in 2018 as an example, this study aimed to develop a resilience index to evaluate the impacts of super typhoons on urban vegetation in Hong Kong at the species level. The typhoon impacts and canopy recovery of four tree species were assessed by integrating field and remote sensing data. First, we discussed the specific influencing factors of the typhoon. Second, we constructed a normalized seasonal difference vegetation index (NSDVI) to identify and characterize the distribution of tree species. Then, a seasonal resilience index was developed at the species level to investigate the severity and recovery of the vegetation after the typhoon. The results demonstrated that strong wind was the leading cause of damage. NSDVI improved tree species identification by more than 10 percent compared with conventional methods. In terms of the resilience analysis, 87.25 percent of the trees were affected by the typhoon. Royal palm (Roystonea regia) performed well among the four species during the typhoon, suffering minor losses. A total of 47.95 percent of the trees recovered to their pretyphoon state two years after the typhoon. The recovery speed of Hainan ormosia (Ormosia pinnata) was the fastest. This research provides a scientific reference for the planning of urban vegetation species to increase their resilience and ability to provide ecoservices despite natural disturbances.

TI  - Seagrass Depth Distribution Mirrors Coastal Development in the Mexican Caribbean - An Automated Analysis of 800 Satellite Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The seagrass Thalassia testudinum is the dominant habitat-builder in coastal reef lagoons of the Caribbean, and provides vital ecosystem services including coastal protection and carbon storage. We used a remote sensing methodology to map T. testudinum canopies over 400 km of coastline of the eastern Yucatan Peninsula, comparing the depth distribution of canopy density, in terms of leaf area index (LAI), to a previously established ecological model of depth and LAI for this species in oligotrophic conditions. The full archive of Sentinel-2 imagery from 2016 to 2020 was applied in an automated model inversion method to simultaneously estimate depth and LAI, covering similar to 900 km(2) of lagoon with approximately 800 images. Data redundancy allowed for statistical tests of change detection. Achieved accuracy was sufficient for the objectives: LAI estimates compared to field data had mean absolute error of 0.59, systematic error of 0.04 and r(2) > 0.67 over a range of 0-5. Bathymetry compared to 46,000 ICESat-2 data points had a mean absolute error of 1 m, systematic error less than 0.5 m, and r(2) > 0.88 over a range of 0-15 m. The estimated total area of seagrass canopy was consistent with previously published estimates of similar to 580 km(2), but dense canopies (LAI > 3), which are the primary contributors to below-ground carbon storage, comprise only similar to 40 km(2). Within the year-to-year variation there was no change in overall seagrass abundance 2017-2020, but localised statistically significant (p < 0.01) patches of canopy extension and retraction occurred. 2018 and 2019 were affected by beaching of pelagic Sargassum and dispersion as organic matter into the lagoon. The multi-year analysis enabled excluding this influence and provided an estimate of its extent along the coast. Finally, the distribution of LAI with depth was consistent with the ecological model and showed a gradient from north to south which mirrored a well-established gradient in anthropogenic pressure due to touristic development. Denser canopies were more abundant in developed areas, the expected growth response to nutrient enrichment. This increase in canopy density may be a useful early bio-indicator of environmental eutrophication, detectable by remote sensing before habitat deterioration is observed.

TI  - Mapping temperate forest tree species using dense Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise information on tree species composition is critical for forest management and conservation, but mapping tree species with satellite data over large areas is still a challenge. Since 2017, Sentinel-2A/B provide multispectral time series with global coverage at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This is a new opportunity for mapping tree species over large areas that has not yet been fully explored. Because of the high spatial and temporal resolution, Sentinel-2 time series improve the characterization of vegetation phenology and canopy structure, parameters that are intrinsically linked to tree species. The objective of this study was to test the utility of a Sentinel-2 time-series based approach for mapping tree species in a temperate forest region in Central Europe. Using stand-wise forest inventory data for single species stands we assess how well main and minor tree species can be mapped, and if the addition of environmental variables and spatial texture metrics improves the classification accuracy. Our time series approach utilizes all available Sentinel-2 observations and an ensemble of radial basis convolution filters to build cloud-free 5-day time series for each spectral band. The time series are then used as input features to classify seventeen tree species. Our results show the potential of Sentinel-2 time-series based classification, but they also show the challenges associated with mapping a diverse portfolio of tree species. Accuracy of the nine main species, with an area proportion greater than 0.5%, ranged between 98.9% and 66.8%, which is promising for a large area. Adding detailed environmental data and texture metrics to the spectral model only marginally increased the accuracy of a few minor tree species. Overall, the eight minor tree species with area proportions less than 0.5% were most strongly affected by classification errors. Although the absolute mapped area of minor species correlated well with the estimated reference area, the small class areas of minor species lead to high classification errors in relative terms. Mapping minor tree species is challenging for statistical reasons (i.e., class imbalance, small sample size and class variance). Using all available Sentinel-2 data allows building dense time series at high spatial resolution that are mandatory for improved tree species mapping. We were able to show that the spectral time series is the prime explanatory information, even when complementing our analyses with texture information and various environmental data. The results suggest that with the applied data harmonization approach precise regional tree species mapping is feasible.

TI  - Estimating 2013-2019 NO<sub>2</sub> exposure with high spatiotemporal resolution in China using an ensemble model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has become a major issue in China, especially for traffic-related pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Current studies in China at the national scale were less focused on NO2 exposure and consequent health effects than fine particulate exposure, mainly due to a lack of high-quality exposure models for accurate NO2 predictions over a long period. We developed an advanced modeling framework that incorporated multisource, high-quality predictor data (e.g., satellite observations [Ozone Monitoring Instrument NO2, TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument NO2, and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction aerosol optical depth], chemical transport model simulations, high-resolution geographical variables) and three independent machine learning algorithms into an ensemble model. The model contains three stages: (1) filling missing satellite data; (2) building an ensemble model and predicting daily NO2 concentrations from 2013 to 2019 across China at 1x1 km(2) resolution; (3) downscaling the predictions to finer resolution (100 m) at the urban scale. Our model achieves a high performance in terms of cross-validation to assess the agreement of the overall (R-2 = 0.72) and the spatial (R-2 = 0.85) variations of the NO2 predictions over the observations. The model performance remains moderately good when the predictions are extrapolated to the previous years without any monitoring data (CV R-2 > 0.68) or regions far away from monitors (CV R-2 > 0.63). We identified a clear decreasing trend of NO2 exposure from 2013 to 2019 across the country with the largest reduction in suburban and rural areas. Our downscaled model further improved the prediction ability by 4%-14% in some megacities and captured substantial NO2 variations within 1-km grids in the urban areas, especially near major roads. Our model provides flexibility at both temporal and spatial scales and can be applied to exposure assessment and epidemiological studies with various study domains (e.g., national or citywide) and settings (e.g., long-term and short-term).

TI  - Delhi Model with Chemistry and aerosol framework (DM-Chem) for high-resolution fog forecasting
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce here the Delhi Model with Chemistry and aerosol framework (DM-Chem), a high-resolution (330 m) visibility and fog forecasting model with the UK Chemistry and Aerosol scheme. DM-Chem is developed at the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) in collaboration with UK Met Office and Carnegie Mellon University. We present a revised visibility scheme here which uses prognostic aerosols (mass and number concentration) from the two-moment prognostic Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) -mode aerosol scheme. This scheme represents aerosol microphysical processes and the internal mixing of chemical components within five log-normal size modes. The cloud microphysics parameterization also makes use of the GLOMAP scheme to predict cloud droplet number concentration (Nd). Therefore we are able to evaluate the performance of the scheme indirectly by comparing the predicted Nd with that derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals over the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Aerosol emissions for the inner (330 m) nest are prescribed with a high-resolution inventory for Delhi, from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting project (SAFAR). Winter-time stubble burning is represented using the MODIS-based Fire Energetics and Emissions Research inventory, updated daily. In this article we consider case studies spanning both foggy and haze days of winter 2019-2020. The model compares well with the observed visibility and its spatial and diurnal patterns. The SAFAR emissions help improve the near-surface model fields. For the "haze" case, the single scattering albedo (SSA) is high along the regions of high AOD, and the surface radiative cooling is enhanced. During the "foggy" case, the SSA is not clearly related to AOD, but aerosol absorption does lead to a minor surface warming via the semi-direct effect at the time of onset of fog. The DM-Chem entered operational mode at NCMRWF from winter 2020 and provides high-resolution visibility forecast for Delhi and the adjoining region.

TI  - A new threshold free dust storm detection index based on MODIS reflectance and thermal bands
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind and soil confrontation under specific atmospheric conditions leads to the horrendous phenomenon of dust storms, particularly in arid lands. The negative impact of storms on the health and life of living beings is evident, resulting in many losses in the economic, social, and environmental sectors. Dust storm detection is the most important topic in dust studies, where many algorithms and indices have already been proposed using satellite imageries and remote sensing techniques. Despite the advantage of dust detection, these algorithms present drawbacks. This includes the need to determine different thresholds for different regional events or simply better respond to oceanic dust storms. The objective of this study is to develop a new Dust Storm Detection Index, called DSDI, without the need to determine different thresholds for each event. To establish the new index, it was necessary to distinguish the properties of dust, clouds, and land surfaces in the images of the MODIS sensors. These properties have been characterized by analyzing their spectral and thermal profiles at different wavelengths during dust storms from 2004 to 2009 in Yazd province, Central Iran, which is constantly coping with severe storms. Spectral and thermal ranges of 0.46, 0.56, 3.9, 1.4, 11, 12, and 13.6 mu m were the most suitable discriminating bands of dust from the cloud and land surfaces. The brightness temperature difference of the thermal bands and the spectral ratio of reflectance bands, i.e. DSDI, has developed an appropriate relationship for separating land surfaces and clouds of dust particles. There was a significant correlation between DSDI and horizontal visibility (P-value= 0.05 & 0.01). It confirmed the success of this algorithm to detect storms in the study area, as an arid land.

TI  - What Is High-risk Breast Cancer With Pathologically Negative Lymph Nodes for Regional Recurrence?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to identify high-risk factors for regional recurrence in patients with breast cancer with pathologically negative lymph nodes.Methods and Materials: We retrospectively analyzed 3800 patients with stage pT1-pT3 breast cancer and pathologically negative lymph nodes between 2004 and 2012. All patients underwent upfront surgery with curative intent. Adjuvant systemic treatments were administered to most patients (96.7%) based on contemporary guidelines.Results: After a median follow-up of 83 months (range, 7-175 months), the estimated 10-year cumulative incidence rate of regional recurrence was 2.0%. Multivariate competing risk analysis revealed that high histologic grade, positive lymphovascular invasion, and stage pT2-3 were significant risk factors for any regional recurrence. Patients with >= 2 risk factors showed a significantly higher 10-year cumulative incidence rate of any regional recurrence than those with 1 or no risk factors (5.5% vs 1.2%; P < .001). When the number of retrieved lymph nodes was less than 10, the difference in the incidence rate of regional recurrence between patients with >= 2 risk factors and those with 1 or no risk factors was greater (6.6% vs 1.3%, respectively; P < .001). The 10-year disease-free survival was worse in patients with >= 2 risk factors than in those with 1 or no risk factors (84.7% vs 90.0%, respectively; P < .001). Patients with >= 2 risk factors also showed worse 10-year overall survival than did those with 1 or no risk factors (91.3% vs 97.0%, respectively; P < .001).Conclusions: Overall, the cumulative incidence rate of any regional recurrence was low at 10 years. However, patients with >= 2 risk factors showed an increased risk of any regional recurrence and worse disease-free survival, particularly when the number of retrieved lymph nodes was less than 10.

TI  - Examining Amoghavajra's flat-earth cosmology: religious vs. scientific worldviews in Buddhist astrology
T2  - STUDIES IN CHINESE RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the cosmology of the monk Amoghavajra (Bukong (sic) ; 705-774), as outlined in his astrological manual, the Xiuyao jing (sic) (Sutra of Lunar Stations and Planets), as well as its historical background and context, in relation to classical Buddhist models of Mt. Meru and the Four Continents in the Agamas and Abhidharma. These models all use a flat-earth model, in contrast to the spherical-earth model utilized within classical Indian astronomy. This study shows that although the spherical model was known in Chinese from at least the early eighth century via the Jiuzhi li (sic) (*Navagraha-kara.a), a translation of an Indian astronomical treatise, Amoghavajra consciously adopted the flat-earth model in his cosmology, yet at the same time he was willing to introduce new astronomical elements, such as the planets and the zodiac signs. It is argued that Amoghavajra's cosmology constitutes an intriguing example in Buddhist history of a religious worldview taking precedence over a scientific one, yet at the same time it is demonstrated that Chinese Buddhist literature was not averse to incorporating some scientific astronomical elements before, during and after Amoghavajra's time.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node identification in early stage ovarian cancer: is it still possible after prior tumor resection?
T2  - JOURNAL OF OVARIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in ovarian cancer is feasible when tracers are injected before the pathological ovary is resected. This study aims to investigate whether the SLN identification is also feasible in patients whose ovarian tumor has already been resected with injection of the tracer into the ovarian ligaments stumps, i.e. in the event that a frozen section confirms malignancy. Methods Patients who underwent laparotomy with frozen section confirming an ovarian malignancy, and those who underwent a second staging laparotomy after prior resection of a malignant ovarian mass, were included. Blue dye and a radioactive isotope were injected in the stumps of the ligamentum ovarium proprium and the ligamentum infundibulo-pelvicum. After an interval of at least 15-min, the sentinel node(s) were identified using either the gamma-probe and / or blue dye. Results A total of 11 patients were included in the study, the sentinel node (SLN) procedure was completed in all 11 patients. At least one SLN was identified in 3 patients, resulting in a rather low detection rate of 27,3%. Conclusion In this study we showed that SLN procedure after (previous) resection of the tumor seems inferior to detect sentinel nodes when compared to injection of the tracer in the ovarian ligaments before tumor resection.

AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-based sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been promoted to detect early metastasis of oral/oropharyngeal carcinoma, but its diagnostic value still remains unclear. In this letter, we identified 6 studies on ICG fluorescence based SLN in the detection of lymph node metastasis in oral/oropharyngeal carcinoma. For detection of metastatic lymph node, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the studies were 0.86 and 0.91, respectively. SROC curve was determined according to the combined sensitivity and specificity, and the overall area under the curve AUC was 0.93. On the whole, ICG fluorescence-based SLN biopsy showed promising effect for earlier detection and staging.

TI  - Effect of Lockdown on Pollutant Levels in the Delhi Megacity: Role of Local Emission Sources and Chemical Lifetimes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changed emission regimes all over the world. India also imposed complete lockdown on all modes of travel and industrial activities for about 2 months from 25-March-2020 and later unlocked these activities in a phased manner. Here, we study signatures of emissions changes on levels of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols contributing to air pollution over multiple sites in India's capital Delhi covering various lockdown and unlock phases using satellite data and in-situ observations. The resulting changes in the levels of these species were compared with respect to their average of 2015-2019 to attribute for year to year and seasonal changes. A clear impact of lockdown was observed for AOD, PM, NO2, CO, and SO2 as a result of emission changes, while changed precursor levels led to a change in O-3 chemical regimes impacting its concentrations. A detailed analysis of FLEXPART trajectories revealed increased PM levels over Delhi in north-westerly air masses sourced to Punjab region all the way up to Pakistan. Changes in aerosols and NO2 were not only restricted to the surface but transcended the total tropospheric column. The maximum decrease in PM, NO2, CO, and SO2 was observed during the month of total lockdown in April. The lockdown impact varied with species e.g., PM10 and PM2.5 as well as locations even within the periphery of Delhi. While surface level aerosols and NO2 showed significant and almost similar changes, AOD showed much lower decrease than tropospheric column NO2.

TI  - A sentinel population: The public health benefits of monitoring enhanced body builders
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - There is heightened recognition of the public health implications of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) for the use of image and performance enhancement; with increasing evidence of their long-term negative health impacts, the hazards associated with their administration (often via injection), and the variability and unpredictability of their contents. In order to optimise the effects of these drugs, together with strict dietary and training regimes, AAS users typically supplement their use with an expansive and continually evolving range of ancillary drugs. The discovery and subsequent adoption of these drugs by the broader AAS user population is largely dependent upon a minority of social influencers within the bodybuilding community. Pioneering enhanced bodybuilders who self-experiment with a diverse range of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs) and ancillary drugs have been the forerunners in the development of an underground user-led literature, online discussion forums, and were early adopters of internet-facilitated drug markets. Yet the impact of their self-experimentations extends well beyond the enhanced bodybuilding community, particularly in their use of ancillary drugs. Most significantly has been their role in the diffusion of various enhancement and psychoactive drugs to the wider population. Using the theoretical framework of the 'diffusion of innovation' we consider the role that pioneering enhanced bodybuilders have played in the diffusion of various enhancement and psychoactive drugs to the wider population through a focus on three substances: dinitrophenol (DNP), melanotan II and gammahydroxybtyrate (GHB). With an increasing range of drugs used by bodybuilders, coupled with an expansion in the use of online forums and online platforms to purchase pharmacological and new psychoactive drugs, we anticipate this trend of diffusion amongst the wider population will continue to flourish. Therefore, we highlight the need for policy makers to monitor emergent trends, not only in the general AAS population but particularly amongst enhanced bodybuilders.

TI  - The Necessity of an Emic Paradigm in Psychology
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides an overview of developments in the field of Black/Africana/Pan African psychology over the past 50 years. It has evolved toward production of psychological knowledge grounded in an emic cultural paradigm consistent with the understandings emerging from classical African civilization and across the Diaspora. The historical context for the development of a Black/Africana cultural paradigm is discussed, including an analysis of the failure of Eurowestern psychology to effectively address the mental health needs of people of African ancestry, particularly as exemplified in the experience of Non-immigrant Africans in the Americas (NIAAs). Readers are introduced to the rise of African-centered cultural frames of reference, values, and psychological models, practices, and strategies. The development of Optimal Psychology or Optimal Conceptual Theory (OCT) is highlighted. OCT is a comprehensive theory successfully implemented, utilized, and researched for more than 40 years. The production of psychological knowledge built upon a cultural paradigm rooted in the wisdom tradition of African deep thought traceable to the birthplace of all humankind is essential to a comprehensive understanding of humanity and will be described.

TI  - Comparison of upper extremity lymphedema after sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection: patient-reported outcomes in 3044 patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose A limited number of studies have examined the impact of type of axillary lymph node surgery on breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) from the patient's perspective. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in women diagnosed with BCRL using a condition specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), the LYMPH-Q upper extremity (UE) module. Methods Adult women diagnosed with BCRL were identified from the Danish National Health Data Authority database for the period 2008 to 2020 and were sent an online REDCap survey with the LYMPH-Q UE module. Information pertaining to axillary surgery was obtained from an online pathology repository. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine differences in the SLND and ALND groups on the LYMPH-Q UE scale scores. Results Three thousand and fourty four women with BCRL were included in the analysis. The mean follow-up duration was 8.6 +/- 5.15 years (range, 0-36 years). The majority of participants underwent ALND (n = 2805, 92.1%) and only 7.9% (n = 239) received SLND. The mean number of lymph nodes removed in the SLND group was 2.2 +/- 1.4. No statistically significant difference was found in the two groups on the LYMPH-Q UE scale scores. Conclusion There is no difference in women with upper extremity lymphedema after SLND or ALND on the LYMPH-Q UE module scales measuring arm symptoms, function, distress, and appearance.

TI  - Gravity for Lithosphere Architecture Determination and Analysis: the Central Eastern Mediterranean case study
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central-Eastern Mediterranean region is known to be a complex area due to the interaction of four tectonic plates, namely Arabia, Africa, Anatolia and Eurasia, and by the presence of an ancient oceanic crust in the Herodotus and Ionian Basins. The analysis of the available literature highlights that the distribution of the freely available geophysical data (i.e. seismic, gravity and magnetic observations) is quite disparate. In this framework, high-resolution global gravity field models, such as XGM2019e, mainly based (offshore) on satellite data, can be profitably used as a uniform dataset to study, in a coherent way, large regions. In the current work, we exploit the XGM2019e model, together with a set of a priori information, derived mainly from geophysical data retrieved from the literature, to study the structure of the crust in the Central-Eastern Mediterranean area. The study is organized in three different phases: in the first one, we enhanced the map of geological crustal provinces by means of an automatic Bayesian classification algorithm applied to the second radial derivatives of the gravitational potential. In the second phase, using as observation a grid of gravity anomalies, we applied a full three-dimensional inversion procedure (always based on a Bayesian paradigm) to estimate the mass density variations and the geometries of the main geological units in the whole study area. Finally, in the third phase, we performed a refined three-dimensional local inversion on the Cyprus area to improve the modelling of the shallowest layers. The main results of this study, carried out in the framework of the European Space Agency GIADA project, are freely available, upon request, at .

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Izmir, the third-largest city and economic center of Turkey, has been exposed to many natural disasters throughout its history. It is one of them in the 6.6 magnitude earthquake that last occurred on October 30, 2020. In this study, the PSInSAR technique was applied on 26 descending Sentinel-1 images between February 2020 and January 2021 to monitor the land change of the study area determined in Izmir. PSInSAR method was carried out with the SNAP-StaMPS integration, whose methodology is given below. The annual velocity values of the PS points produced in the study area in the direction of satellite view were found between - 68 and 32 mm/year. As a result of the study, it was observed that the most prominent surface change occurred in cigli and Karsiyaka districts. The points containing the speed information obtained from the PSInSAR result, PS points, and maps showing changes in the land were shared online to be used as auxiliary data in other studies.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper utilizes spatial econometric reenactments to examine the geographic effects of different types of environmentally friendly power on corban discharges. The example covers 31 nations in the Asia-Pacific district during the time frame 2000 to 2018. The spatial connection in the model was affirmed by symptomatic testing, and the spatial Durbin model was picked as the last model. Results show that Gross domestic product per capita, receptiveness to business sectors, unfamiliar direct venture, energy force, and urbanization critically affect CO2 emanations. In correlation, just wind and sunlight-based energy have added to a generous abatement in ozone harming substance emanations in nations over the long run. In contrast, hydropower, bioenergy, and geothermal energy discoveries have been irrelevant. A cross-sectional examination worldview delineated that nations with more elevated sunlight-based energy yield have higher CO2 outflows, while nations with lower levels have lower CO2 emanations. The presence of spatial impacts in the model gave off an impression of the negative consequences for homegrown CO2 outflows of Gross domestic product per capita and exchange transparency of adjoining nations. Furthermore, energy power and higher creation of sustainable power in adjoining nations will prompt lower homegrown CO2 outflows.

TI  - The influence of forest fires aerosol and air temperature on glacier albedo, western North America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, western North America glaciers experienced strong mass loss. Regional mass loss during the ablation season is influenced by air temperature, but the importance of other factors such as changes in surface albedo remains uncertain. We examine changes in surface albedo for 17 glaciated regions of western North America as documented in a 20-year record (2000 to 2019) of MODIS daily snow albedo (MOD10A1). Trend analysis reveals that albedo declined for 4% to 81% of the albedo grid cells, and the largest negative trends were situated south of 60 degrees N and in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. Sen's slope estimates indicate that 15 of 17 regions showed a decline of which the majority of the largest declines occurred within 100 m of glacier median elevation, suggesting that these declines are driven by a rise of the transient snowline. For most regions, albedo correlates strongly to temperature, and albedo trend in the Chugach region of Alaska, the South Coast, Southern Interior and Central and Southern Rockies of Canada show a significant relationship to aerosols optical depth. Temperature is approximately 2-6 times more predictive of the variation in albedo than AOD for the majority of regions, except the Southern Interior and Southern Rockies where albedo shows a greater dependence on AOD. Investigation of broadband albedo (MCD43A3) for snow grid cells above glacier median elevation in the Central and Southern Rockies shows that declines in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum are linked to the presence of forest fire generated aerosols. The results of this study indicate that glacier surface mass balance experiences a regional dependence on forest fire generated light absorbing particles.

TI  - An improved Forel-Ule index method for trophic state assessments of inland waters using Landsat 8 and sentinel archives
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Forel-Ule index (FUI) is one of the indicators used to assess the trophic state of inland waters, which can be objectively determined based on satellite-retrieved corrected hue angles (alpha). However, the functions for alpha correction have been proposed based on a dataset from Dutch and the North Sea, which might be inadequate for the precise FUI-derived trophic state. This study proposed a method for FUI retrieval through improved alpha correction. First, the daily surface spectral reflectance product (MOD09GA) was corrected through simple band subtraction. The results showed that the FUI retrieved from the corrected MOD09GA was more reliable than those without corrections. Second, we obtained new offset functions through the fit between the sensor (alpha) and the error with alpha derived from the corrected MOD09GA. The results showed that: (1) for three atmospheric correction methods, the C2RCC (case 2 regional coast color) processor and the iCOR (image correction for atmospheric effects) performed better than 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) in FUI calculations; and (2) with Pearson's r square (r(2)) of 0.72, and percentage error (PE) values of 5.80% for FUI derived from Landsat 8, r(2) of 0.52 and PE of 7.81% for results derived from Sentinel-2, r(2) of 0.60 and PE of 19.40% for results retrieved from Sentinel-3, the FUI determined by the new offset-corrected greatly improved the assessment of trophic states for five waterbodies in and around Wuhan, China. Hue angles retrieved by the corrected-MOD09GA are available as references and the results also imply that hue angle correction the functions can be achieved in any place, even if without an in-situ hyperspectral dataset. The waters of the Xiajiasi Reservoir and the Daoguanhe Reservoir were mostly in mesotrophic status; while East Lake, Tangxun Lake and Liangzi Lake were eutrophic.

TI  - Impact of Spectral Resolution on Quantifying Cyanobacteria in Lakes and Reservoirs: A Machine-Learning Assessment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Y Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms are an increasing threat to coastal and inland waters. These blooms can be detected using optical radiometers due to the presence of phycocyanin (PC) pigments. The spectral resolution of best-available multispectral sensors limits their ability to diagnostically detect PC in the presence of other photosynthetic pigments. To assess the role of spectral resolution in the determination of PC, a large (N = 905) database of colocated in situ radiometric spectra and PC are employed. We first examine the performance of selected widely used machine-learning (ML) models against that of benchmark algorithms for hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) spectra resampled to the spectral configuration of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of < 6 nm. Results show that the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network applied to HICO spectral configurations (median errors < 65%) outperforms other ML models. This model is subsequently applied to R-rs spectra resampled to the band configuration of existing satellite instruments and of the one proposed for the next Landsat sensor. These results confirm that employing MLP models to estimate PC from hyperspectral data delivers tangible improvements compared with retrievals from multispectral data and benchmark algorithms (with median errors between similar to 73% and 126%) and shows promise for developing a globally applicable cyanobacteria measurement approach.

TI  - Downscaled night air temperatures between 2030 and 2070: The case of cities with a complex- and heterogeneous-topography
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global and regional climate models tend to underestimate temperatures over urban areas. This limitation is exacerbated in complex-topography regions, where coarse spatial resolutions of climate models fail to detect large apparent change in cities' microclimates. In this study, a night air temperature downscaling approach was proposed in cities with heterogeneous- and complex-topography. It was developed based on six ground-based national weather station datasets along the 1-km remote-sensing-based MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data, between 2000 and 2020. An ordinary least square (OLS) statistical test was applied, including the 1-km MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), evapotranspiration (ET) and the digital elevation model (DEM) datasets as independent variables. Based on the generated regression relationship and a five-year pixel-based trend analysis, the 25-km NASA NEX-GDDP datasets were downscaled into 1-km spatial resolution night air temperatures between 2030 and 2072 and under two scenarios (i.e. RCP 4.5 and 8.5), averaged from 21 CMIP5 models. Validations were carried out showing good results with an RMSE of 0.49 degrees C, an AME of 0.42 degrees C and an R-squared value of 89.5%.Further assessment was made over the largest cities in Lebanon, namely Beirut, Tripoli, Zahle and Baalbeck. Main results showed that, on average, urban night air temperatures under the intermediate RCP 4.5 scenario are expected to increase by 0.12 degrees C or 0.61% in 2030, 0.36 degrees C or 1.82% in 2050 and 0.6 degrees C or 3.07% in 2070. Under the worst-case climate change RCP 8.5 scenario, the average increase would be an overwhelming 7.41 degrees C or 38.4% by 2070. City and policy makers are invited to implement the proposed straightforward and validated downscaling approach and to use the findings for a more responsive urban planning and design to the particular envimnemntal and geographic conditions; this isespecially required in cities and agglomorations dominated by complex- and heterogeneous-topographic characteristics.

TI  - Tracking the temporal dynamics of insect defoliation by high-resolution radar satellite data
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying tree defoliation by insects over large areas is a major challenge in forest management, but it is essential in ecosystem assessments of disturbance and resistance against herbivory. However, the trajectory from leaf-flush to insect defoliation to refoliation in broadleaf trees is highly variable. Its tracking requires high temporal- and spatial-resolution data, particularly in fragmented forests. In a unique replicated field experiment manipulating gypsy moth Lymantria dispar densities in mixed-oak forests, we examined the utility of publicly accessible satellite-borne radar (Sentinel-1) to track the fine-scale temporal trajectory of defoliation. The ratio of backscatter intensity between two polarizations from radar data of the growing season constituted a canopy development index (CDI) and a normalized CDI (NCDI), which were validated by optical (Sentinel-2) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data as well by intensive caterpillar sampling from canopy fogging. The CDI and NCDI strongly correlated with optical and TLS data (Spearman's rho = 0.79 and 0.84, respectively). The Delta NCDIDefoliation(A-C) significantly explained caterpillar abundance (R-2 = 0.52). The NCDI at critical timesteps and Delta NCDI related to defoliation and refoliation well discriminated between heavily and lightly defoliated forests. We demonstrate that the high spatial and temporal resolution and the cloud independence of Sentinel-1 radar potentially enable spatially unrestricted measurements of the highly dynamic canopy herbivory. This can help monitor insect pests, improve the prediction of outbreaks and facilitate the monitoring of forest disturbance, one of the high priority Essential Biodiversity Variables, in the near future.

TI  - Post-Classification Urban Heat Island Change Detection Based on Multi-Temporal Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing human desire for urbanization and, as a result, urban growth and development has caused the replacement of natural objects such as vegetation and mountains with building structures and roads. This exacerbates the phenomenon of urban heat islands (UHI), one of the main threats to the quality of human life. In this research, a post-classification change detection algorithm is proposed based on UHI classification maps are generated using multi-temporal Landsat images from a rapidly developing urban area, in Iran in 17-years' time interval. The main research objective is to investigate the effects of constructing new built-up areas on urban heat islands considering the land surface temperature, vegetation coverage, and surface object types. The production of UHI classification maps is based on the probabilistic reasoning rules for integrating the LST, Albedo, and NDVI as lines of evidence considering land use/land cover (LU/LC) object types. The analysis of the UHI change detection results in the rapidly developing urban area in this research indicates that the area percentage of built-up object class has increased by 12.1% in 17 years. This amount of construction led to a 23.7% increase in the high UHI class, which is equivalent to 2931 hectares. Moreover, the regions with medium and low UHI have decreased by - 16.09 and - 9.12%, respectively, which indicates an increase in the intensities of urban heat islands during this period.

TI  - Developing Maize Yield Predictive Models from Sentinel-2 MSI Derived Vegetation Indices: An Approach to an Early Warning System on Yield Fluctuation and Food Security
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual crop yield fluctuation due to natural and anthropogenic factors is a major concern of the Ethiopian Government. For an immediate response to drastically changing crop yields and resulting harvest failures and to enhance the country's food security in general, extensive area crop growth monitoring and early prediction of production are needed. In this study, we developed an early maize (Zea mays) yield forecasting model using Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument); the study was carried out in the Abaya district of the Oromia Regional State in Ethiopia. The model consists of the following components: (1) Sentinel-2 image-based cropland identification for different crop development stages, (2) extraction of time series Sentinel-2 vegetation indices for crop growth monitoring, and (3) a simple linear stepwise forward regression approach for yield prediction. We tested different spectral indices regarding their performance in describing the crop development and eventually predicting the expected yield. The result showed that (1) the linear Red-Edge Enhanced Vegetation Index (Red-Edge EVI), (2) the combination of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Green Vegetation Index (GVI), (3) the combination of the Red-Edge EVI and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and (4) the combination of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Red-Edge EVI and SAVI offer the best predictive model about 2 months before harvesting with the highest coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.73, 0.80, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively. The correlation for the GVI was generally lowest compared to established models, and no evidence of a peak correlation for NDVI was observed. Our approach showed a high accuracy of detecting maize fields, detecting crop phenology, and early predicting of grain yield for the study year 2018. Our simple model may generate early warning information, which may support in-time decision-making regarding food supply when critical yield fluctuations are to be expected.

TI  - Mapping Australia's dynamic coastline at mean sea level using three decades of Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, robust and consistent coastline mapping is critical for characterising and managing coastal change. Satellite earth observation provides an unparalleled source of freely available data for studying dynamic coastlines through time and across large spatial extents. However, previous satellite-derived shoreline mapping approaches have been challenged by two key limitations: the medium spatial resolution of freely available satellite data, and the confounding influence of tides that can obscure longer term patterns of coastal change. In this study we present Digital Earth Australia Coastlines, a new continental dataset documenting three decades of coastal change across Australia. We combine sub-pixel waterline extraction with a new pixel-based tidal modelling method to seamlessly map almost 2 million km of tide-datum shorelines along the entire Australian coast from 1988 to 2019. Our tidally-constrained median composite approach maps the dominant annual position of the shoreline at 0 m Above Mean Sea Level each year, suppressing the short-term influence of tides and sub-annual shoreline variability. Using this robust mid-term shoreline proxy, long-term coastal change rates spanning the last three decades were accurately quantified and mapped at the continental scale. We find that 22% of Australia's non-rocky coastline has retreated or grown significantly since 1988, with 16% changing at greater than 0.5 m per year. Although trends of retreat and growth were closely balanced across the Australian continent, our results highlight significant regional variability and extreme local hotspots of coastal change. Our findings provide new insights into patterns and trends of coastal change across Australia, and highlight advantages and limitations of tide modelling and composite-based methods for extracting consistent shoreline data and long-term coastal trends from earth observation data at continental scale. Digital Earth Australia Coastlines is made available to the public as free and open interactive tools and code to support future coastal research and management across Australia, and any coastal region globally with access to free and open medium resolution satellite data.

TI  - Detection of thermokarst lake drainage events in the northern Alaska permafrost region
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapidly warming Arctic climate is reducing the stability of near-surface permafrost, and the thawing of icerich permafrost causes landscape changes known as thermokarst processes. Growing evidence suggests an increasing trend in the frequency and magnitude of thermokarst lake drainage events, which would significantly alter topography and hydrology, affecting ecosystem stability and carbon cycling. Dynamic monitoring of thermokarst lakes through satellite imagery remains a challenging task, as current temporal trend analysis methods have difficulty in accurately detecting when thermokarst lake drainage events occur. In this study, to improve the detection of time series breakpoints, an advanced temporal segmentation and change detection algorithm developed for forest change detection was, for the first time, transposed to monitor thermokarst lake dynamics. Moreover, to filter out spurious signals caused by fluctuations in lake area, we developed a hybrid algorithm to validate the detected thermokarst lake drainage events at the pixel-level and lake object-level, respectively. The method developed in this study demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting thermokarst lake drainage events in Arctic permafrost ecosystems and the potential to monitor the evolution of thermokarst landscapes using Landsat archive. A time-series analysis of changes in the thermokarst lake region of northern Alaska since 2000 using all available Landsat continuous data was performed on the Google Earth Engine platform. In total, 90 drainage lakes larger than 5 ha in size were detected in our study area, nearly a third of which were almost completely drained. As thermokarst lakes drainage represent hotspots of permafrost degradation, we publicly share information on these drained lakes to help select more targeted sites for costly fieldwork and validation activities. This study provides a basis for understanding and quantifying thermokarst lake dynamics in the Arctic permafrost region, which will contribute to the goal of integrating thermokarst processes into earth system models.

TI  - Ubuntu Philosophy as a Humanistic-Existential Framework for the Fight Against the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ubuntu has been identified by several scholars as a philosophy that provides a framework to fight health disasters such as COVID-19. Ubuntu refers to the African worldview of seeing oneself through others. It refers to the pattern of interconnectedness between people in the form of a philosophy or worldview. Ubuntu explores concerns about cosmic and global context of life. This article stipulates that Ubuntu can provide ways to deal with challenges that emerge with the COVID-19 pandemic. Ubuntu fosters the integrated components of humanity as it appreciates the biological, psychosocial, spiritual, and environmental aspects of life. The article explores several themes such as self-awareness and societal responsibility, holism, spirituality, health promotion, food security, social justice and human rights, generosity, sharing, and teamwork. Others have advanced that Ubuntu is a philosophy to adopt in the fight against epidemics, and we seek to broaden the debate by exploring Ubuntu axiological and ontological humanistic-existential themes. Finally, the article calls for the adoption of Ubuntu philosophy in psychological and social work interventions in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Landscape Changes in the Semi-closed Raya Agricultural Graben Floor of Northern Ethiopia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few decades, the need for landscape monitoring and assessment of changes in spatial patterns over time has grown. Landscapes sustain changes of various aspects, such as their structure, in response to continuous modifications in land cover, land management regimes and policy decisions. This study investigates changes in the landscape structure along the Raya graben bottom in northern Ethiopia from 1986 to 2017. Landsat imageries were used to analyse land cover. The spatial structure of the landscape for 3 decades was evaluated using FRAGSTATS. The number of patches increased at the class and landscape levels. At the landscape level, the patches totalled 8,147 in 1986 and increased to 886,893 in 2017. Similarly, the patch density (PD) in 1986 was 3.4 and reached 372.7 in 2017. Therefore, high landscape fragmentation occurred within the study area. The value of the Shannon diversity index is close to 1.1, and the diversity of patch types within the landscape is regular. The Shannon Evenness Index value ranges from 0.6 to 0.7. Moreover, the diversity of patches has shown an increment across the study period. Each land cover reduces in size and proximity. Those changes were caused by population size, infrastructural development and commercial agriculture. Thus, proper land use planning must be practiced to reduce fragmentation and environmental impacts in landscapes that face increasing population pressure and continuous land cover changes.

TI  - Assessment of land use and land cover and forest fragmentation in traditional landscape in Manipur, Northeast India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change has serious impacts on the environment health. The knowledge and regular monitoring of LULC change has become a key facet for the sustainable management of natural resources. Forest fragmentation is considered one of the most pertinent conservation issues as it associates with the deterioration of ecosystem integrity. Using geospatial technology, we assessed the spatio-temporal changes in LULC, the net rate of deforestation, and forest fragmentation in the traditional landscape of Manipur, Northeast India, from 1999 to 2019. Multi-temporal satellite data Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager were used to classify different LULC classes. The Landscape fragmentation tool LFT v2.0 was used for the classification of different categories of forest fragmentation. During the study period, it was found that forest class dominated the study area, followed by cropland and shifting cultivation area. It was observed that area under dense forest has declined by 11.05% during 1999-2009 but slightly improved during 2009-2019 by 4.33%. The analysis of forest fragmentation found that a large area under the core forest has declined throughout the study period (1999-2019). The net rate of deforestation during 2009-2019 was 0.39% higher than the periods 1999-2009 (0.14%). Landscape indices at class level metrics were calculated using spatial analysis software called Fragstats. The results suggested an anthropogenic and natural activities are the major causes of LULC changes, deforestation, and forest fragmentation. The study provided the spatial database on LULC and forest fragmentation in the data-scare region of traditional landscape in Northeast India, which will help understand the impact of LULC and forest fragmentation on biodiversity-ecosystem processes and support the policymakers in ensuring sustainable land use planning.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - New solid-state chromogenic probes based on amorphous SiO2, HL-B, and Zeolite-Y, HL-ZY, have been prepared through immobilization of azo-azomethine molecular receptor, HL, in solid scaffolds. Remarkably, HL-B and HL-ZY show unique and rapid sensitivity towards CN- in the presence of H2PO4-, AcO-, HSO4-, NO3-, F-, Cl-, Br- and I- in water and could easily detect cyanide ion through naked eye detection even at 2x10(-4) molL(-1) and 5x10(-3) molL(-1), respectively. The prepared chromogenic probes were validated using standard spectroscopic methods as well as XRD, FE-SEM, and BET. Furthermore, thermal stability behavior and morphology of the probes were examined.

TI  - A combination method for multi-criteria decision making problem in turning process
T2  - MANUFACTURING REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for a turning process. An experimental process was performed according to the sequence of a matrix using the Taguchi method with nine experiments. The parameters including workpiece speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and nose radius were selected as the input variables. At each experiment, three cutting force components that were measured in the three directions X, Y, and Z, were F-x, F-y, and F-z, respectively. The value of Material Removal Rate (MRR) was also calculated at each experiment. The main purpose of this study is determination of an experiment in total performed experiments simultaneously ensuring the minimum F-x, F-y, and F-z and the maximum MRR. The Entropy method was applied to determine the weights for parameters F-x, F-x, F-x, and MRR. Eight MCDM methods were applied for multi-criteria decision making, this has not been performed in any studies. The implementation steps of each method were also presented in this paper. Seven ones of these eight methods determined the best experiment in total nine performed experiments. A new multi-criteria decision-making method as well as orientation for the further works were also proposed in this study.

TI  - The subunits of IL-12, originating from two distinct cells, can functionally synergize to protect against pathogen dissemination <i>in vivo</i>
T2  - CELL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cytokines are typically single gene products, except for the heterodimeric interleukin (IL)-12 family. The two subunits (IL-12p40 and IL-12p35) of the prototype IL-12 are known to be simultaneously co-expressed in activated myeloid cells, which secrete the fully active heterodimer to promote interferon (IFN)gamma production in innate and adaptive cells. We find that chimeric mice containing mixtures of cells that can only express either IL-12p40 or IL-12p35, but not both together, generate functional IL-12. This alternate two-cell pathway requires IL-12p40 from hematopoietic cells to extracellularly associate with IL-12p35 from radiation-resistant cells. The two-cell mechanism is sufficient to propel local T cell differentiation in sites distal to the initial infection and helps control systemic dissemination of a pathogen, although not parasite burden, at the site of infection. Broadly, this suggests that early secretion of IL-12p40 monomers by sentinel cells at the infection site may help prepare distal host tissues for potential pathogen arrival.

T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Green and blue spaces are important landscape elements in a city and there is strong literary evidence available regarding the ecological, social, cultural and recreational benefits of these spaces to people and urban sustainability. Comprehensive quantitative assessment of these spaces is gaining scientific recognition for their utility in sustainable urban planning and drafting greening policies. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal change in urban green and blue spaces in Chandannagar city, India through quantitative assessment for the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2020 using Landsat data of 30 m spatial resolution. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalised Difference Water Index was applied to extract information on urban green and blue spaces. The classified maps were validated through field observations and Google earth images. Spatio-temporal analysis was carried out at ward level to analyze the distribution of urban green spaces (UGS) at the micro level. The result indicated that there was a reduction in green and blue spaces in the central and eastern parts of the city while there was a good amount of UGS in the western part of the city. The findings of this study shed light on important policy implications for the UGS planning in the city.

TI  - Evidence of circulation of Orthobunyaviruses in diverse mosquito species in Kwale County, Kenya
T2  - VIROLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Arbovirus surveillance and recurrence of outbreaks in Kenya continues to reveal the re-emergence of viruses of public health importance. This calls for sustained efforts in early detection and characterization of these agents to avert future potential outbreaks. Methods A larval survey was carried out in three different sites in Kwale County, Vanga, Jego and Lunga Lunga. All containers in every accessible household and compound were sampled for immature mosquitoes. In addition, adult mosquitoes were also sampled using CO2-baited CDC light traps and BG-Sentinel traps in the three sites and also in Tsuini. The mosquitoes were knocked down using trimethylamine and stored in a liquid nitrogen shipper for transportation to the laboratory where they were identified to species, pooled and homogenized ready for testing. Results A total of 366 houses and 1730 containers were inspected. The House Index (HI), Container Index (CI) and Breateau Index (BI) for Vanga Island were (3%: 0.66: 3.66) respectively. In Jego, a rural site, the HI, CI and BI were (2.4%: 0.48: 2.4) respectively. In Lunga Lunga, a site in an urban area, the HI, CI and BI were (22.03%: 3.97: 29.7) respectively. The indices suggest that this region is at risk of arbovirus transmission given they were above the WHO threshold (CI > 1, HI > 1% and BI > 5). The most productive containers were the concrete tanks (44.4%), plastic tank (22.2%), claypot (13.3%), plastic drums (8.9%), plastic basins (4%), jerricans (1.2%) and buckets (0.3%). Over 20,200 adult mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps, and over 9,200 using BG- sentinel traps. These mosquitoes were screened for viruses by inoculating in Vero cells. Eleven Orthobunyavirus isolates were obtained from pools of Ae. pembaensis (4), Ae. tricholabis (1), Cx. quinquefasciatus (3), Culex spp. (1) and Cx. zombaensis (2). Five of the Orthobunyaviruses were sequenced and four of these were determined to be Bunyamwera viruses while one isolate was found to be Nyando virus. One isolate remained unidentified. Conclusions These results indicate circulation of Orthobunyaviruses known to cause diverse grades of febrile illness with rash in humans in this region and highlights the need for continued monitoring and surveillance to avert outbreaks.

TI  - Automated Coastal Ice Mapping with SAR Can Inform Winter Fish Ecology in the Laurentian Great Lakes
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many freshwater lakes in the temperate zone undergo annual freeze-thaw cycles. Climate change has disrupted these patterns and altered habitat for many species including ecologically, economically, and culturally valuable fish species. To understand the relationship between ice cover and aquatic species, suitable data can be derived from remote sensing. We developed a novel ice classification method with minimal user input using freely available Sentinel-1 data and an adjacent and time-coincident validation dataset. Using image object segmentation and a random forest classifier, ice conditions were classified correctly with >85% overall accuracy. Our ice mapping efforts coincided with a telemetry dataset of tagged Walleye (Sander vitreus) and Northern Pike (Esox lucius) in Hamilton Harbor in western Lake Ontario. Between years with low and high ice covers (2017 and 2019, respectively), we found Walleye appeared to reduce their area of movement when the harbor was covered in ice. Our ice mapping tool can provide a quick and consistent method for agencies to adopt for freshwater resource management as well as provide ice cover information in coastal areas that are important overwintering habitat for many fishes.

TI  - Diagnostic value of Platelet/lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) for predicting sentinel axillary lymph node positivity in early-stage breast cancer compared with ultrasonography
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction In breast cancer, the most important prognostic factor is axillary lymph node metastasis. However, there is no method which can diagnose axillary lymph node metastasis preoperatively with high sensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and sentinel lymph node metastasis in early-stage breast cancer. Methods In total, 202 cases which were operated under early-stage breast cancer diagnosis in Ankara City Hospital General Surgery Department were evaluated in retrospectively. We separated the patients into two categories according to their PLR. PLR groups were evaluated for relationship with sentinel lymph node metastasis. At the last part, sentinel lymph node positive sensitivity was evaluated in PLR and preoperative USG groups. Results Results showed that patients above PLR cut-off value had 0.43 times more risk of having a positive SLN in comparison with patients who had a PLR lower than cut-off (OR = 0.435, 95%CI:0.221-0.856, P < .016). When the PLR and USG were used in combination, sensitivity goes up to 75.5% and specificity 96%. Conclusion The rate of success in diagnosing metastatic SLN in early-stage breast cancer is higher in PLR when compared with USG and other imaging methods.

TI  - St Gallen 2019 guidelines understage the axilla in lobular breast cancer: a population-based study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The St Gallen 2019 guidelines for primary therapy of early breast cancer recommend omission of completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND), regardless of histological type, in patients with one or two sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases. Concurrently, adjuvant chemotherapy is endorsed for luminal A-like disease with four or more axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of patients with invasive lobular cancer (ILC) versus invasive ductal cancer of no special type (NST) with one or two SLN metastases for whom cALND would have led to a recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy.Methods: Patients with ILC and NST who had surgery between 2014 and 2017 were identified in the National Breast Cancer Register of Sweden. After exclusion of patients with incongruent or missing data, those who fulfilled the St Gallen 2019 criteria for cALND omission were included in the population-based study cohort.Results: Some 1886 patients in total were included in the study, 329 with ILC and 1507 with NST. Patients with ILC had a higher metastatic nodal burden and were more likely to have a luminal A-like subtype than those with NST. The prevalence of at least four ALN metastases was higher in ILC (31.0 per cent) than NST (14.9 per cent), corresponding to an adjusted odds ratio of 2.26 (95 per cent c.i. 1.59 to 3.21). Luminal A-like breast cancers with four or more ALN metastases were over-represented in ILC compared with NST, 52 of 281 (18.5 per cent) versus 43 of 1299 (3.3 per cent) (P < 0.001).Conclusion: Patients with ILC more often have luminal A-like breast cancer with at least four nodal metastases. Omission of cALND in patients with luminal A-like invasive lobular cancer and one or two SLN metastases warrants future attention as there is a risk of nodal understaging and undertreatment in one-fifth of patients.

TI  - Effects of climate change and land use intensification on regional biological soil crust cover and composition in southern Africa
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) form a regular and relevant feature in drylands, as they stabilize the soil, fix nutrients, and influence water cycling. However, biocrust forming organisms have been shown to be dramatically vulnerable to climate and land use change occurring in these regions.In this study, we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data of biocrust-dominated pixels (NDVIbiociust) obtained from hyperspectral and LANDSAT-7 data to analyse biocrust development over time and to forecast future NDVIbiocrust development under different climate change and livestock density scenarios in southern Africa. We validated these results by analysing the occurrence and composition of biocrusts along a mesoclimatic gradient within the study region.Our results show that NDVIbiocrust, which reached maximum values of 0.2 and 0.4 in drier and wetter years, respectively, mainly depended on water availability. A predicted decrease in rainfall events according to all future climate scenarios combined with increased temperatures suggested a pronounced decrease in NDVIbiocrust by the end of the 21st century caused by reduced biocrust coverage. Livestock trampling had similar effects and exacerbated the negative impacts of climate change on biocrust coverage and composition. Data assessed in the field concurred with these results, as reduced biocrust cover and a shift from well-developed to early stages of biocrust development were observed along a gradient of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures and livestock density.Our study demonstrates the suitability of multi-temporal series of historical satellite images combined with high-resolution mapping data and Earth system models to identify climate change patterns and their effects on biocrust and vegetation patterns at regional scales.

TI  - Radicalization to Violence: A View from Cultural Psychiatry
T2  - TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This article introduces a thematic issue of Transcultural Psychiatry with selected papers from the McGill Advanced Study Institute in Cultural Psychiatry on "Pluralism and Polarization: Cultural Contexts and Dynamics of Radicalization," which took place June 20-22, 2017. The ASI brought together an interdisciplinary group scholars to consider the role of social dynamics, cultural contexts and psychopathology in radicalization to violent extremism. Papers addressed four broad topics: (1) current meanings and uses of the term radicalization; (2) personal and social determinants of violent radicalization, including individual psychology, interpersonal dynamics, and wider social-historical, community and network processes; (3) social and cultural contexts and trajectories of radicalization including the impact of structural and historical forces associated with colonization and globalization as well as contemporary political, economic and security issues faced by youth and disaffected groups; and (4) approaches to community prevention and clinical intervention to reduce the risk of violent radicalization. In this introductory essay, we revisit these themes, define key terms, and outline some of the theoretical and empirical insights in the contributions to this issue. Efforts to prevent violent radicalization face challenges because social media and the Internet allow the rapid spread of polarizing images and ideas. The escalation of security measures and policies also serves to confirm the worldview of conspiracy theory adherents. In addition to addressing the structural inequities that fuel feelings of anger and resentment, we need to promote solidarity among diverse communities by building a pluralistic civil society that offers a meaningful alternative to the violent rhetorics of us and them.

TI  - Migrating rivers, consequent paleochannels: The unlikely partners and hotspots of flooding
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Furious floods have become an omnipresent reality with the dawn of climate change and its transition to adult-hood. Since climate change has now become an accepted reality, analysing the factors that favour or disfavour floods are an urgent requirement. Here we showcase the role of paleochannels, a product of migrating rivers, in a catastrophic flood in the south-western part of the Indian Peninsula. This study exposes whether these geo-morphic features facilitate or impede floods. For the purpose of extracting paleochannels and floodwater map-ping, we utilized multiple satellite datasets and took advantage of diversified feature selection algorithms. Paleochannels were demarcated viz., initial identification of a few paleochannels from literature and confirma-tion through high-resolution Google Earth (GE) images, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of Sentinel-2 images using Google Earth Engine (GEE), and a supervised classification of the principal bands 1, 2, and 3. False-positives were eliminated using Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA), which reduced the 964,254 poly-gons to 23,254. These polygons were visually affirmed using GE images that resulted in 115 paleochannels as the final collection. A few locations were verified through Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) using the Schlumberger method. The features were analysed with the floodwaters of the 2018 catastrophic flood, extracted from Syn-thetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which was delineated for different temporal limits including the day of peak flood of August 17, 2018. During the peak flood, the inundation of the study area extended to 534.86 km2 with all the paleochannels getting immersed in floodwater. After 44 days of peak flood, the post-flood analysis revealed that when the floodwater receded 50%, the paleochannels emptied 87.39%, with the midland paleochannels discharging more than those of lowlands. Thus, such geomorphic features can be flood hotspots, but can be considered for discharging floodwater to mitigate flood risk in case of unprecedented rain. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Versus Elective Node Dissection in Stage cT1-2N0 Oral Cavity Cancer
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) and elective neck dissection (END) in the surgical management of cT1-2N0 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). Methods English full-text articles were searched in PubMed and Embase on May 9, 2021. Articles had to compare SNB with END in cT1-T2N0 OCSCC patients; report hazard ratios (HRs), Kaplan-Meier curves, or P-values with total number of events for survival outcomes; be from a clinical trial, cohort, or case-control study. Two reviewers reviewed articles and a third settled disagreements. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool and revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials were used. The generic inverse variance method with a random-effect model was used for meta-analysis. Results Ten studies, five retrospective, three prospective, and two randomized controlled trials, were included (total number of patients [n] = 10,498, END n = 9102, SNB n = 1396). No significant differences were found in OS (HR = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-1.31) or DFS (HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.41-1.20). Heterogeneity was not detected in pooled OS analysis (P = .18; I-2 = 30%), but was in pooled DFS analysis (P = .003; I-2 = 66%). Conclusions No statistically significant differences in OS or DFS were observed between SNB and END in cT1-2N0 OCSCC, suggesting that SNB might be an alternative to END in the management of early-stage, clinically node-negative OCSCC.

TI  - Flash flood vulnerability assessment and zonation through an integrated approach in the Upper Ganga Basin of the Northwest Himalayan region in Uttarakhand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash Floods are one of the most destructive naturally occurring events, having a dreadful capability to cause havoc within a few hours. In India, Uttarakhand, a hill State of the Northwest Himalayan region, experiences flash floods every year, especially in the high elevation zones. In this study, morphometric parameters were derived from SRTM DEM data for 29 sub-watersheds of the Upper Ganga Basin (UGB) using Geographic Information System (GIS). The sub-watersheds were prioritized for flash flood vulnerability by employing Weighted Sum Approach (WSA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and an Integrated Approach (IA). A comparative assessment of the three approaches revealed that the results obtained by PCA and IA are relatively analogous in terms of the number of sub-watersheds classified under very high, high, and very low vulnerability zones. The IA methodology was validated through spatial analysis of previously occurred flash flood event locations of 2018 and 2019. For assessment of the vulnerable zones, remote sensing-based population distribution analysis and geospatial distribution analysis of 6360 towns and villages was carried out. Finally, the spatial analysis based on the final vulnerability map, population density map, and sub-watershed-wise geospatial distribution of towns and villages revealed that 5 densely populated sub-watersheds fall under very high and high vulnerability zones. The medium vulnerability zone also emerged as a critical zone. Therefore, IA has proved to be a replicable and reliable method to identify flash flood-prone vulnerable sub-watersheds. The study demonstrates an impactful use of remote sensing data and GIS for flash flood vulnerability zonation in mountainous catchments.

TI  - Potential conditions for fire occurrence in vegetation in the Peruvian Andes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire activity in the Peruvian Andes has increased significantly in recent decades, but climatic parameters associated with drought, which may indirectly contribute to the occurrence of severe forest fires, have not yet been investigated. Because fire prevention tools are scarce, strategies for deterring burning are necessary in order to reduce impacts in regions where forest fires usually result from human activity. This study explores the conditions conducive to forest fire in the Andes of Peru. Daily precipitation and temperature observed data from the PISCO gridded dataset for the 2002-2016 period were used. In addition, MODIS satellite images (MOD09A1 product) were collected to characterise Andean vegetation using spectral indices. Analysis of daily temperature and rainfall indicates that climatic parameters such as cumulative precipitation, dry-day frequency and hot-day frequency are statistically associated with conditions that could contribute to increased forest fire occurrence. Our findings suggest that a decrease in the water content of vegetation, estimated by the Global Vegetation Moisture Index during the dry period and wet period onset, can be used to identify potential conditions for forest fire occurrence. This study suggests that forest managers should consider implementing prevention strategies that include continuous monitoring of climate and vegetation parameters.

TI  - Nation-wide hierarchical and spatially-explicit framework to characterize seagrass meadows in New-Caledonia, and its potential application to the Indo-Pacific
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their ecological role and multiple contributions to human societies, the distribution of Indo-Pacific seagrasses remains poorly known in many places. Herein, we outline a hierarchical spatially-explicit assessment framework to derive nation-wide synoptic knowledge of the distribution of seagrass species and communities. We applied the framework to New Caledonia (southwest Pacific Ocean) and its 36,200 km(2) of reefs and lagoons. The framework is primarily field-based but can leverage various habitat maps derived from remote sensing. Field data collection can be stratified by map products and retrospectively contribute to developing new seagrass distribution maps. Airborne and satellite remote sensing alone do not allow for the spatial generalisation of the finest attributes (species distribution and types of seagrass beds), but staged stratified field sampling provides synoptic views of these attributes. Using three examples, we discuss how the hierarchical and spatial information generated from this framework's application can inform conservation and management objectives.

TI  - Study of the urban expansion of the city of Oran using LANDSAT satellite images and local data
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The city of Oran or more officially the Urban Agglomeration of Oran (UAO) is the second largest city of Algeria on the Mediterranean Sea that has experienced an extensive urban growth in the last three decades. Combining the spatial information extracted from LANDSAT satellites images and the data collected from the urban planning local institutions, the evolution of various main aspects of this urban expansion have been studied. This study has shown that from 1987 to 2015, the built space has increased by more than twice on the detriment of bare space and the vegetation space. 4% of vegetation space and 39.5% of bare space of their respective initial superficies were transformed. The housing unit density HUD has more than doubled to be 830 unit/km(2) and the average household size AHS has decreased from 6.4 to 4.2 persons per household. After 2000, there have been more constructions of tall towers for housing than before and, the construction of new individual homes on the state land stock was stopped, and more collective housing units constructed instead. The urban green space has not experienced the same development fate as built space and has not exceeded 140 ha.

TI  - Impact assessment of a large river on the sediments and fish from its continental shelf: using <i>Solea solea</i> as sentinel in the Ebro river mouth (NW Mediterranean, Spain)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have been carried out along mighty rivers with heavily industrialized watersheds to evaluate pollutants and their effects on freshwater organisms. However, their impact on marine organisms is virtually unknown. In order to cover this gap, Solea solea, one of the most important commercial fish species, together with sediments, were sampled during 2013-2015 offshore from the Ebro Delta river mouth. Fish health indicators (condition indices, histological tissue alterations, and parasite descriptors) were used to assess the potential effect of pollutants, an issue of particular interest in the area following the dredging activities taking place in the river upstream in 2013. No major histopathological alterations were detected, but perivascular inflammatory foci (PIF) were frequently observed, especially in 2014. The most prevalent and abundant parasites were acanthocephalans and digeneans within the digestive tract and copepods on the gills. Levels of trace metals from sediments and fish muscle were below the effects range median and reference levels accepted for human consumption, respectively. However, the lower levels of the hepatosomatic index, higher numbers of PIF, and variations in the abundance of parasites in 2014 and 2015 could suggest a pollutant exposure during these years. These results warn signs of toxicity, which could be associated with sediment leaks during the dredging activities.

TI  - An investigation of aspects of radiochemical purity of <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-labelled human serum albumin nanocolloid
T2  - EJNMMI RADIOPHARMACY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Nanocolloidal human serum albumin radiolabelled with Tc-99m provides a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy. NanoHSA (Nanotop), a commercially available kit, enables the simple preparation of this radiopharmaceutical via reconstitution with pertechnetate eluted from a generator. Thin-layer chromatography is widely used for determining radiochemical purity in clinical nuclear medicine. Quality control methods recommended by the manufacturer were sometimes reported to yield variable results. Therefore, we proposed and evaluated three alternative thin-layer chromatography methods for the quality control of [Tc-99m]Tc-NanoHSA from a commercially available kit. Results The radiochemical purity of [Tc-99m]Tc-NanoHSA determined with all methods was reproducible and met the requirements of the SPC and the European Pharmacopoeia (>= 95%). Our quality control using iTLC-SG chromatographic paper in methyl ethyl ketone mobile phase identified only free pertechnetate as impurity, resulting in > 99% RCP. The quality control using iTLC-SG in 85% methanol or iTLC-SA in 0.9% NaCl identified an additional small fraction of a hydrophilic impurity, resulting in 95-97% RCP. Glucose was identified as a potential Tc-99m-carrying hydrophilic species contributing to hydrophilic impurities. Conclusion Our quality control of [Tc-99m]Tc-NanoHSA with non-polar mobile phase tended to underestimate the amount of hydrophilic impurities, although without compromising the final quality of the radiopharmaceutical. Alternative TLC methods using aqueous mobile phases enabled a more accurate determination of hydrophilic impurities.

TI  - Pediatric hypertension screening and recognition in primary care clinics in Canada
T2  - PAEDIATRICS & CHILD HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Screening for hypertension in children is recommended by pediatric consensus guidelines. However, current practice is unknown. We evaluated rates of blood pressure assessment and hypertension recognition in primary care. Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network between 2011 and 2017. Children aged 3 to <18 years with at least one clinical encounter were included. Screening, follow-up, and hypertension recognition rates were evaluated. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistical regression were used to determine patient and provider characteristics associated with increased screening and recognition of pediatric hypertension. Results Among 378,002 children, blood pressure was documented in 33.3% of all encounters, increasing from 26.7% in 2011 to 36.2% in 2017; P=0.007. Blood pressure was documented in 76.0% of well child visits. Follow-up visits occurred within 6 months for 26.4% of children with elevated blood pressure, 57.1% of children with hypertension, and within 1 month for 7.2% of children with hypertension. Patient factors associated with increased blood pressure screening include being overweight (OR 2.15, CI 2.09 to 2.22), having diabetes (OR 1.69, CI 1.37 to 2.08), chronic kidney disease (OR 7.51, CI 6.54 to 8.62), increased social deprivation (OR 1.10, CI 1.09 to 1.11), and urban residence (OR 1.27, CI 1.15 to 1.4). Overall prevalence of hypertension was 1.9% (n=715) and of those, 5.6% (n=40) had recognized hypertension. Factors associated with increased recognition include male sex, overweight, and hyperlipidemia. Conclusions Rates of hypertension screening and recognition are low in primary care settings in Canada, suggesting pediatric hypertension should be a priority for implementation and dissemination of interventions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of global river extent and the natural driving factors revealed by decades of Landsat observations, GRACE gravimetry observations, and land surface model simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are among the most dynamic components in Earth's terrestrial water cycle and provide critical ecosystem services. Yet, the spatiotemporal variability of river surface extents remains largely unquantified at the global scale. Satellite remote sensing provides a promising alternative to in-situ observations, which can enable a more comprehensive survey and systematic analysis of global rivers at fine spatial resolutions. The study examines the spatiotemporal variability of river surface extent globally and its natural driving factors, by combining the use of Landsat-based Global Surface Water (GSW) and Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) databases. In addition to examining the long-term mean river surface extent in various climate zones, we perform statistical analyses to correlate monthly times series of fractional river extent with the terrestrial water storage (TWS) components obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model simulations. Results show that the spatiotemporal variability of water presence in rivers can be explained well via differentiating climate zones. The analysis also shows that 52.7% of the global maximum river extent is covered by water less than half of time. Changes of fractional river extent are found to be highly correlated with groundwater storage in low- and mid-latitudes, whereas snow melting dominates the river dynamics in high latitudes. By examining the extremes of fractional river extent, we found that the abrupt changes of fractional river extent are well linked to precipitation anomalies in the equatorial, arid, and warm temperate areas. This study offers an innovative perspective to study spatiotemporal dynamics of rivers by combining optical remote sensing (Landsat), gravimetry observations (GRACE), and land surface simulations; and it highlights the significant role of low-flow-generating processes (snow melting, infiltration, and recharge-discharge) in controlling river dynamics in certain regions, which warrants future investigation.

TI  - Assessing land use change and potential environmental quality in Chandernagore Municipal Corporation, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study has focused on portraying the spatio-temporal changes in land use pattern from 2011 to 2019 and has tried to assess the environmental quality index (EQI) based on the classified images of Chandernagore Municipal Corporation (CMC). To conduct the present research, satellite imageries of IRS Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV Mx (November 2011) and Sentinel-2A (November 2019) have been used. Supervised image classification approach with maximum likelihood classification has been adopted for the generation of land use maps. A total of 404 sample verification points has been taken to assess the accuracy of land use classification in both cases. The verification points have been selected by purposive random sampling method throughout the images. An initial statistical analysis and detailed principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to construct the EQI for the study region. This was followed by a spatial mapping and analysis to provide a better understanding of the status of the environmental quality to the planners and policy-makers. Results reveal the consistent increase in area under built-up (+ 14%) and brick kiln/industry (81%) and continuous decrease in orchard (- 10%), forest (- 10%) and open space (- 21%). The overall classification accuracy was found 90.10% (2011) and 93.32% (2019). The total Kappa coefficient is quite satisfactory for 2011 (0.86) and is almost perfect in 2019 (0.91). With more than 85% explanation within first three components in PCA (2011 and 2019, eigenvalue > 1), the EQI map is clearly portraying that the western part of CMC is still breathing in fresh air with better environmental quality but the recent phase of expansion and process of urban sprawl has evidently swallowed up the expensive land in eastern part of the city and gradually spreading towards the west.

TI  - Impacts of landscape change on net primary productivity by integrating remote sensing data and ecosystem model in a rapidly urbanizing region in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover patterns have been substantially changed under the intense global urbanization process. With the growing concern on the effects of land use/land cover change (LUCC) on the terrestrial carbon cycle, particularly net primary productivity (NPP), understanding the changing trends of LUCC and NPP and their correlation is essential for sustainable landscape planning. Using the integrated geographic information system, remote sensing, Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach model, and statistical methods, the spatial-temporal variations in landscape and NPP in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region from 2005 to 2015 were analyzed. The results showed that the built-up areas increased by 36.7% from 2005 to 2015, 80.5% of which were in lowland areas and 19.5% in relatively high elevation areas. The urban area all showed a tendency to be aggregated and complete in the entire region. The NPP of urban area was the lowest and was 31% lower than the highest value of forest land. Instead of the most urbanized city center, the peripheral area outside the metropolitan city center was facing the most intense NPP loss of 17.13 g C.m(-2).year(-1) in average. In addition to the climatic factors, the LUCC accounted for 70% of the total NPP change in urban area, while approximately 20% in forest and grassland, showing that human constructions undoubtedly affect the land productivity. Through a spatial clustering analysis, the 206 counties in the BTH region could be classified into five categories based on their temporal urbanization degree and their ecological functions. Planning specific development models for different types of areas can give consideration to both urban development and ecological protection in the urbanization process. Our study highlights the necessity of evaluating various impacts of LUCC on NPP in an integrated region of complex ecosystem composition, which contributes to the future localized landscape planning in the global urbanization process.

TI  - Analysis of the Mechanism of Breast Metastasis Based on Image Recognition and Ultrasound Diagnosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is one of the cancers with the highest incidence among women. In the late stage, cancer cells may metastasize to a distance, causing multiple organ diseases, threatening the lives of patients. The detection of lymph node metastasis based on pathological images is a key indicator for the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer, and correct staging decisions are the prerequisite and basis for targeted treatment. At present, the detection of lymph node metastasis mainly relies on manual screening by pathologists, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the diagnosis results are variable and subjective. The automatic staging method based on the panoramic image calculation of the sentinel lymph node of the breast proposed in this paper can provide a set of standardized, high-accuracy, and repeatable objective diagnosis results. However, it is very difficult to automatically detect and locate cancer metastasis areas in highly complex panoramic images of lymph nodes. This paper proposes a novel deep network training strategy based on the sliding window to train an automatic localization model of cancer metastasis area. The training strategy first trains the initial convolutional network in a small amount of data, extracts false-positive and false-negative image blocks, and uses manual screening combined with automatic network screening to reclassify the false-positive blocks to improve the class of negative categories. Using mammography, ultrasound, MRI, and 18F-FDG PET-CT examinations, the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of primary cancers in the breast of patients with axillary lymph node metastasis as the first diagnosis were obtained. The detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI for primary cancers in the breast are much higher than those of X-ray, ultrasound, and 18F-FDG PET-CT (all P values <0.001). Mammography, ultrasound, and PET-CT examinations showed no difference in the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of primary cancers in the breast of patients with axillary lymph node metastasis as the first diagnosis. Breast MRI should be used as a routine examination for patients with axillary lymph node metastasis as the first diagnosis. The primary breast cancer in the first diagnosed patients with axillary lymph node metastasis is often presented as localized asymmetric compactness or calcification on X-ray; it often appears as small focal mass lesions and ductal lesions without three-dimensional space-occupying effect on ultrasound.</p>

TI  - Copernicus data to boost raw material source management: Illustrations from the RawMatCop programme
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) data can become an essential tool in the transformation of a raw materials sector that aims to reconfigure its model of operation. The high demand for the mineral resources necessary for the transition to a carbon neutral and circular economy conflicts with the increasing difficulties of finding new deposits. As the sector heads towards embracing circularity and reducing the environmental impacts, a clear focus has been set on developing appropriate tools to boost the efficiency of mineral resource management, both technologically and economically. In this scenario, the Sentinel satellites of the European Copernicus program come into play. Despite being satellites considered medium resolution, they provide great temporal and spatial coverage in a continuous record, which makes them tools with great potential for the raw materials sector. However, the lack of applications in the raw materials sector suggests that these technological advances have remained underrated by sectoral actors. The RawMatCop program was designed to bridge this gap. This program, co-funded by the European Commission and EIT RawMaterials, aims to develop applications and promote the use of Copernicus data in the raw materials sector to contribute to a safe and sustainable supply of mineral resources. The presented applications can be grouped into three categories covering the whole mining cycle from exploration to exploitation and post-mining. Two of the presented case studies cover the study of primary sources including exploration of Iron Oxide Copper Gold mineralisations to identify high-potential mining areas and mapping of informal gold mining and its environmental impacts. Another project focused on secondary sources tackled data applications for grade mapping and sample optimisation in mining residues. And the forth project focused on monitoring ground stability related to mining activity. The results demonstrate the high cost-effectiveness of Sentinel 1 and 2 in extending ground-based measurements to larger areas, especially when these are hard-to-reach areas. Finally, the presented projects examine the industrial and social impacts of technological innovations, as well as contribute to the achievement of prominent European Union policy objectives and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Integration of One-Pair Spatiotemporal Fusion With Moment Decomposition for Better Stability
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion has got enough attention and many algorithms have been proposed, but its practical stability has not been emphasized yet. Observing that the strategies harnessed by different types of algorithms may lead to various tendencies, an integration strategy is introduced to make full use of the complementarity between different types of spatiotemporal fusion algorithms for better fusion stability. In our method, the images fused by two different types of methods are decomposed into components denoting strength, structure, and mean intensity, which are combined separately involving a characteristic analysis. The proposed method is compared with seven algorithms of four types by reconstructing Landsat-8, Landsat-7, and Landsat-5 images to validate the effectiveness of the spatial fusion strategy. The digital evaluation on radiometric, structural, and spectral loss illustrates that the proposed method can reach or approach the optimal performance steadily.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Sampling as an Alternative to Lymphadenectomy in Patients With Endometrial Cancer and Obesity
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY CANADA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Although its use in endometrial cancer staging is relatively new, sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling has been shown to be highly accurate and is associated with few complications. However, some studies report lower rates of detection with SLN sampling among patients with obesity. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the feasibility of SLN sampling in endometrial cancer for patients with obesity, and to determine whether omitting lymph node dissection (LND) in surgical staging using SLN sampling impacts oncologic outcomes.Methods: we conducted a retrospective study of patients with obesity (BMI >35 kg/m(2)), diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma between 2007 and 2017, that compared surgical and oncologic outcomes of 2 cohorts: patients who underwent LND and patients who underwent SLN without lymphadenectomy. The primary outcome was operative time. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative bleeding; lymph node assessment information; intraoperative and postoperative adverse events; and oncologic outcomes including progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and disease-specific survival (DSS). PFS was defined as the time from surgery to the recurrence or death from any cause. OS was defined as time from diagnosis to death or the last date the patient was known to be alive, and DSS was defined as the time from the surgery to death from the disease.Results: Out of 223 patients with a median BMI of 40.6 kg/m2, 140 underwent LND and 83 underwent SLN alone. The median operative time for patients in the SLN group was shorter than that of patients in the LND group (190.5 [range 108-393] vs. 238 [131-440] min; P < 0.001), and the SLN group had lower median estimated blood loss than the LND group (30 [range 0-300] vs. 40 [range 0-800] mL; P = 0.03). At the 24-month follow-up cut-off, 98% of patients were alive and 95.5% were disease free, with no significant differences in OS, DSS, and PFS between the 2 groups (P = 0.7, P = 0.8, and P = 0.4, respectively).Conclusions: In patients with obesity, omitting LND from surgical staging with SLN sampling was associated with shorter operative times and less bleeding and did not affect survival at 2 years.

TI  - Impact of gender diversity in boardroom on risk-return profile of Indian corporates
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The existing literature point that the presence of women directors in a firm reduces its risk. However, the relation between boardroom gender diversity and a firm's return is widely disputed leading to no concrete answer. Some studies mention that women directors have a positive impact on firm performance, whereas, on the other hand, some findings suggest that women directors reduce financial performance. This paper aims to study the relationship of firm risk and return with boardroom gender diversity and the net impact on firm performance in the Indian context. This study uses not only traditional measures of risk and return but also the third measure of risk-adjusted returns to postulate its findings. Design/methodology/approach Based upon the data of the top 100 of the Bombay Stock Exchange-500 firms for the period FY 2009-2010 to FY 2018-2019, this study applied fixed effect panel regression and random effects Tobit regression to examine the effect of board gender diversity on firm performance. Findings The study concludes that firms with women directors on board have lower risk and lower returns. It also results in a higher risk-adjusted return, creating a positive impact on a firm's performance. Originality/value The paper contributes to the existing literature on corporate governance by considering return, risk and risk-adjusted returns in single research to have a holistic measure of firm performance. It provides empirical evidence from one of the largest emerging economies, India where the female director and independent female director have been introduced recently.

TI  - Phenology-pigment based automated peanut mapping using sentinel-2 images
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable spatiotemporal crop data are vital for sustainable agricultural management. However, efficient algorithms that can be automatically applied to large regions are scarce, especially for cash crops, since it is hard to distinguish their uniqueness merely from temporal profiles of traditional vegetation indices. The efficiency of knowledge-based temporal features and red-edge pigment indices in characterizing crop growth has been reported in the literature, but the potential of combined applications in identifying crops has not been validated yet. This study fills this gap by developing a knowledge-based automated Peanut mapping Algorithm with a combined consideration of crop Phenology and Pigment content variations (PAPP). Peanut crop has earlier and longer flowering stages compared to other crops such as paddy rice and maize. Peanut fields are distinguished with less variations in anthocyanin and chlorophyll as well as higher carotenoid concentrations. Herein, three phenology and pigment-based indicators were proposed for peanut mapping by exploring the concentration and variations of the chlorophyll, anthocyanin and carotenoid indices, respectively. This PAPP algorithm was validated over large regions (around 250 thousand km(2) cropland) covering three provinces of Northeast China using Sentinel-2 time-series images. The results reported that there was 8,371 km(2) peanut area in Northeast China in 2018, concentrated in the western Jilin and Liaoning provinces. Validation from the 1,102 field survey sites revealed overall accuracies of 94%, with a kappa index of 0.87 and F-1 score of 0.91. The PAPP algorithm was not sensitive to thresholding, and a high classification accuracy could be obtained once the threshold of one indicator was roughly defined. The thresholds could be determined based on the proportions of staple crops (i.e. paddy rice and maize) using the historical agricultural statistical data since peanut fields either show the least or largest values in these three proposed indicators. The PAPP algorithm demonstrates the capabilities of automatic peanut mapping over large regions with no requirements of further training and modifications. This study makes contributions to a sustainable agricultural management society given the potential significant role of legume crops in co-delivering food security and adapting to climate change.

M3  - Review
AB  - Knowledge of axillary nodal status is highly important for correct staging and treatment planning in patients with breast cancer. Axillary US is a recognized highly specific and cost-effective tool for assessing nodal status and guiding appropriate treatment. Axillary US imaging with US-guided biopsy is routinely performed throughout the world. However, because of recent developments in the surgical management of the axilla in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group [ACOSOG] Z0011 trial) and in patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (ACOSOG Z1071, SENTinel NeoAdjuvant [SENTINA] and Sentinel Node biopsy aFter NeoAdjuvant Chemotherapy [SN FNAC] trials), some have questioned the utility of axillary US for nodal staging. Here, we review the evidence to date supporting the additional value of axillary US for patients with breast cancer. Nodal US in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer is useful for staging; in a significant proportion of patients, nodal US identifies additional axillary level II or level III nodal disease, which allows for appropriate treatment of disease. Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials may show that axillary surgery can be omitted in patients with negative findings on axillary US. In patients with lymph node-positive disease undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy, nodal US can guide the approach to axillary surgery. A more personalized patient approach, taking into the account tumor biology, among other factors, may help to mitigate the controversy surrounding the role of axillary US in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Axillary Ultrasound Evaluation in Breast Cancer Patients: A Multidisciplinary Viewpoint and Middle Ground
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past decade, there has been a trend toward de-escalation of axillary surgery. Certain patients may now forego axillary lymph node dissection even in the setting of a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and some patients may not even undergo a SLNB. However, there is wide variability in the imaging approach to assessing axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. Approaches range from performing axillary US in all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer to omitting axillary imaging evaluation in all patients. This article provides a multidisciplinary middle ground approach for axillary nodal evaluation. The clinical impact and rationale for appropriate axillary nodal imaging are discussed and an imaging algorithm is proposed.

TI  - Targeted optical fluorescence imaging: a meta-narrative review and future perspectives
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose The aim of this review is to give an overview of the current status of targeted optical fluorescence imaging in the field of oncology, cardiovascular, infectious and inflammatory diseases to further promote clinical translation. Methods A meta-narrative approach was taken to systematically describe the relevant literature. Consecutively, each field was assigned a developmental stage regarding the clinical implementation of optical fluorescence imaging. Results Optical fluorescence imaging is leaning towards clinical implementation in gastrointestinal and head and neck cancers, closely followed by pulmonary, neuro, breast and gynaecological oncology. In cardiovascular and infectious disease, optical imaging is in a less advanced/proof of concept stage. Conclusion Targeted optical fluorescence imaging is rapidly evolving and expanding into the clinic, especially in the field of oncology. However, the imaging modality still has to overcome some major challenges before it can be part of the standard of care in the clinic, such as the provision of pivotal trial data. Intensive multidisciplinary (pre-)clinical joined forces are essential to overcome the delivery of such compelling phase III registration trial data and subsequent regulatory approval and reimbursement hurdles to advance clinical implementation of targeted optical fluorescence imaging as part of standard practice.

TI  - Will borealization of Arctic tundra herbivore communities be driven by climate warming or vegetation change?
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Poleward shifts in species distributions are expected and frequently observed with a warming climate. In Arctic ecosystems, the strong warming trends are associated with increasing greenness and shrubification. Vertebrate herbivores have the potential to limit greening and shrub advance and expansion on the tundra, posing the question of whether changes in herbivore communities could partly mediate the impacts of climate warming on Arctic tundra. Therefore, future changes in the herbivore community in the Arctic tundra will depend on whether the community tracks the changing climates directly (i.e. occurs in response to temperature) or indirectly, in response to vegetation changes (which can be modified by trophic interactions). In this study, we used biogeographic and remotely sensed data to quantify spatial variation in vertebrate herbivore communities across the boreal forest and Arctic tundra biomes. We then tested whether present-day herbivore community structure is determined primarily by temperature or vegetation. We demonstrate that vertebrate herbivore communities are significantly more diverse in the boreal forest than in the Arctic tundra in terms of species richness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity. A clear shift in community structure was observed at the biome boundary, with stronger northward declines in diversity in the Arctic tundra. Interestingly, important functional traits characterizing the role of herbivores in limiting tundra vegetation change, such as body mass and woody plant feeding, did not show threshold changes across the biome boundary. Temperature was a more important determinant of herbivore community structure across these biomes than vegetation productivity or woody plant cover. Thus, our study does not support the premise that herbivore-driven limitation of Arctic tundra shrubification or greening would limit herbivore community change in the tundra. Instead, borealization of tundra herbivore communities is likely to result from the direct effect of climate warming.

TI  - Atmospheric ionization and cloud radiative forcing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric ionization produced by cosmic rays has been suspected to influence aerosols and clouds, but its actual importance has been questioned. If changes in atmospheric ionization have a substantial impact on clouds, one would expect to observe significant responses in Earth's energy budget. Here it is shown that the average of the five strongest week-long decreases in atmospheric ionization coincides with changes in the average net radiative balance of 1.7 W/m(2) (median value: 1.2 W/m(2)) using CERES satellite observations. Simultaneous satellite observations of clouds show that these variations are mainly caused by changes in the short-wave radiation of low liquid clouds along with small changes in the long-wave radiation, and are almost exclusively located over the pristine areas of the oceans. These observed radiation and cloud changes are consistent with a link in which atmospheric ionization modulates aerosol's formation and growth, which survive to cloud condensation nuclei and ultimately affect cloud formation and thereby temporarily the radiative balance of Earth.

TI  - Ground-based high-resolution remote sensing of sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) over Hefei, China: characterization, optical misalignment, influence, and variability
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a challenge to retrieve atmospheric sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) with high resolution solar spectra because it has only one single retrieval micro window and has interfered with many factors in the retrieval. Optical misalignment is one of the key factors that affect the accuracy of SF6 retrieval. In this study, we first present a long term time series of the SF6 total column over Hefei, China, between January 2017 and December 2020, retrieved by mid-infrared (MIR) solar spectra recorded by ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The sensitivities of the total column, root mean square of fitting residual (RMS), total error budgets, degrees of freedom for signal (DOFs), and vertical mixing ratio (VMR) profile with respect to different levels of optical misalignment for SF6 retrieval were assessed. The SF6 total column is sensitive to optical misalignment. In order to avoid inconsistencies in the total column due to optical misalignment, we use the true instrumental line shape (ILS) derived from regular low-pressure HBr cell measurements to retrieve the time series of SF6. The total column of SF6 over Hefei presents strong seasonal dependent features. The maximum monthly average value of (3.57 +/- 0.21) x 10(14) molecules*cm(-2) in summer is (7.60 +/- 3.50) x 10(13) molecules*cm(-2) (21.29 +/- 9.80)% higher than the minimum monthly average value of (2.81 +/- 0.14) x 10(14) molecules*cm(-2) in winter. The annual average SF6 total columns in 2017-2020 are (3.02 +/- 0.17), (3.50 +/- 0.18), (3.25 +/- 0.18), and (3.08 +/- 0.16) x 10(14) molecules*cm(-2), respectively, which are close to each other. It indicates that SF6 total column over Hefei is stable in the past four years. Our study can improve the current understanding for ground-based high-resolution remote sensing of SF6 and also contribute to generate new reliable remote sensing data in this sparsely monitored region for investigations of climate change, global warming, and air pollution.

TI  - Adsorption Reduction of Hexavalent Chromium and co-Catalytic Degradation of Organic Pollutants by Carbon Doped Hexagonal Boron Nitride Supported MoS<sub>2</sub>
T2  - CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problem of the low Cr (VI) removal capacity of molybdenum disulfide ( MoS.,) due to easy agglomeration, dopamine was used to modify hexagonal boron nitiide (BN) with excellent adsorption and chemical stability, and then the carbon doped hexagonal boron nitride supported MoS2 nanocomposite ( c-BN@AloS.,) was obtained by calcination and hydrothermal method, improving the dispersion of MoS, in the composite materials. The performance of c-BN@MoS., on the adsorption and reduction of Cr ( VI) and the synergistic catalytic degradation of organic pollutants were deeply investigated at room temperature. The experimental results indicated that the adsorption reduction removal rate of Cr ( VI) at 50 ing/t. by c-BN@AloS, was more than 95% within 40 min. The maximum capacity for Cr ( VI) removal could reach 401 mg/g under pH of 2.0 at 25 C., which was obviously higher than that of Cr (VI) by -MoS2(98 mg/g). This may he attributed to the fact that the introduction of c-BN increased the specific surface area and average pore diameter of MoS, promoting the formation of IT phase of MoS2, which is conducive to the adsorption of Cr( VI) and accelerating the electron transfer in the redox process. When c-BN@MoS, was introduced into the Fe'/PMS system, the degradation performance of sulfamethoxazole was significantly enhanced, and its reaction rate constant was 4 times as high as that of the -Fe/PMS system, which was mainly due to the fact that c-BN@AloS, significantly accelerated the transition from Fe' to Fe', resulting in more "OH production, thereby achieving the enhancement effect of pollutants degradation. This paper opens up a, new direction for the treatment of heavy metals and organic pollutants in wastewater by hexagonal boron nitride, and provides a useful reference for the efficient treatment of wastewater pollution.

M3  - Article
AB  - This communication reports the presence of lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) mineralization in the dolomite rocks found in the southern part of the Zawarmala which is a well-known carbonate hosted Pb-Zn deposit occurring in the Zawar region in the south of Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. Remote sensing data analysis indicated the southern extension of the Zawarmala dolomite till Dhelai village where the outcrop truncates by the E-W fault. The carbonate with malachite strains supported by field evidences and petrological, ore microscopic, XRF and evidence of the presence of the trace elements reveal the presence of base metals in this area. The extension of occurrence of these dolomites rocks may be explored further for investigation of base metal mineralization in this region.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Virtual reality (VR) is realistic, interactive and immersive 3D computer generated world that one can explore as if one is present in the scene. VR makes it possible to experience anything, anywhere and anytime. Head mount device (HMD) with headphones and hand controllers are used to provide fully immersive experience. There are three important I's in VR; interactivity, immersion and imagination. Virtual reality is stepping in each and every domain like engineering, science, military, education, medical, tourism and entertainment. We have explored its potential for usage in remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS). Usually, GIS users analyse remote sensing data such as high resolution images, digital elevation models and vector data in commercial and open sources 2D GIS software(s). Available GIS software(s) allow users to interact with remote sensing data as a third person only. We have developed in-house virtual reality solution to generate a 3D terrain using high resolution imagery and elevation models over Earth. User can move around or teleport to different locations inside the 3D scene and interact with real time objects available in the scene.

TI  - Promoting New Psychological Understandings by Use of an Indigenous American Psychological Paradigm
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous Americans are not well represented by mainstream psychology and its reductionistic tenets. As psychology developed, it could not help but to be implicitly biased by the surrounding hierarchical colonial culture-a culture in which Indigenous people and many others were conquered, oppressed, dehumanized, devalued, neglected, and excluded. An Indigenous worldview views humans as co-equal partners of an interdependent holistic system. Striving for healthy relationships with others is foundational to psychological health and well-being from an Indigenous perspective. Discrete entities (including self), independence, autonomy, and hierarchy are considered artificial mainstream conceptualizations that have negatively impacted the well-being of humans and the natural world. Indigenous American psychology appreciates the sacred nature of the whole and its entities, approaching professional psychology with the humility and respect that interacting with sacred entities warrants. Essential tenets of an Indigenous American Psychological Paradigm (IAPP) are discussed therein as an alternative to existing mainstream beliefs. An IAPP offers the ability to address intergenerational psychological problems holistically across time in ways that mainstream psychology has been unable. Psychology is ultimately strengthened by an ability to conceptualize psychology through the new lenses of alternative paradigms such as this one.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of the flood storage capacity of basin-scale lakes and reservoirs at high spatial and temporal resolutions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The flood storage of lakes and reservoirs plays an important role in flood regulation and control in floodplains. However, the flood storage capacity of lakes and reservoirs is ineffectively quantified at the basin scale due to the limited access to in-situ data and poor quality of optical satellite images in flooding seasons. To address this, taking a typical floodplain basin (the Poyang Lake basin) in the Yangtze as a study case, radar satellite data combined with measured bathymetry and digital elevation model data were utilized to reconstruct the time series of the water inundation area and water storage change of all lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km2 during the once-in-a-generation flood event that occurred in 2020 (termed as the 2020 flood event hereafter). Results show that the flood storage capacity of Poyang Lake can reach the maximum at 12.18 Gt, and that for other lakes and reservoirs within the basin is approximately 2.95 Gt. It indicates a total flood-storage capacity of 15.13 Gt for the basin-scale lakes and reservoirs, approximately accounting for 45.02% of the terrestrial water storage change of the basin. The storage capacity of Poyang Lake was approximately four times larger than the entirety of other lakes and reservoirs in the basin despite that its maximum water inundation area is in the proportion of 2.58 times other water bodies. This finding indicates that the Poyang Lake provided the dominant contribution to flood storage among all the lakes and reservoirs in the basin. This study introduced a remote sensing approach to quantify the flood storage capacity of basin-scale lakes and reservoirs at high spatial and temporal resolutions during the flood event, which could fill the insufficiently-quantified knowledge about dynamics of lakes and reservoirs in areas lacking full-covered in-situ data records. This study also helps to offer a quantitative basis to improve flood forecasting and control for the public authority, stakeholders, and decision -makers. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Warming of the Indian Ocean and its impact on temporal and spatial dynamics of primary production
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - The Indian Ocean, the third largest among the world's oceans, is experiencing unprecedented changes in sea surface temperature (SST). We present temporal and spatial dynamics of phytoplankton and their response to warming in the Indian Ocean (similar to 25 degrees N to 30 degrees S) during 1998-2019 using remote sensing data. Our study revealed that the area of the Indian Ocean Warm Pool (IOWP), defined as waters with SST values >28 degrees C, is significantly expanding in most regions, particularly in the most recent decade. The increase in IOWP area was greatest (similar to 74%) in the south-central basin. Furthermore, SST increased significantly in most areas of the Indian Ocean (10 out of 11 regions explored) over the 22-year study period with the highest increase of 0.7 degrees C observed in the south-central regions. Most other regions showed an average increase in temperature of 0.4-0.5 degrees C. At the same time, net primary production (NPP) showed large interannual variability in northern and central regions of the Indian Ocean, with slightly decreasing trends in a few northern regions. Overall, years of the first decade (1998-2008) showed more often cooler temperatures and higher productivity, except for a few years, whereas years of the last decade (2009-2019) showed more often warmer temperature and lower productivity, except in very recent years (2017-2019) when productivity was high. Mean Chl a concentrations increased in the last decade during the northeast monsoon period in the northwestern regions, suggesting increased NPP in December to March period as a future scenario in this highly productive area of the Indian Ocean. We also observed increasing SST in several major upwelling areas during the study period, whereas Chl a showed high interannual variability with no marked significant trends in most areas. Results from this study corroborate the importance of the southwest monsoon as a key driver of seasonal patterns in Chl a in major upwelling areas of the Indian Ocean.

T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation change discourse in tropical Africa is characterized by assumptions of generalised deforestation and degradation. Premised on the concept of the heterogeneity of the tropical African landscape, we make a multispatio-periodic analysis of land use and land cover change (LULCC), and examine its ramifications for woody resources of a forest-Savanna transition, that is characterized by assumed deforestation change discourse. Landsat data for 1985, 2000 and 2016, classified into seven (7) LULC categories were analyzed for change for 1985-2016, 1985-2000 and 2000-2016: for the whole study area, and six (6) smaller localities. In 1985-2016, all woody vegetation categories of the study area experienced reduction: ranging between 60.00% and 23.61%. Reduction in woodland was higher in 1985-2000. Dense woodland cover reduced in, practically, all localities in 1985-2000. The LULCC mechanism was a complex transfer among LULC types, resulting in different emergent LULC types. Hence, change process was not a simple linear deforestation and degradation. Dense woodland that existed at the end of each period was, predominately, regenerated from pre-existing fallow, rather than remnants of 'virgin, or pre-existing dense woodland. When pre-existing woody cover was higher, greater amount of woody vegetation regenerates by transformation in a shorter period, whereas limited woody regeneration of woody vegetation on pre-existing fallows dominateswhen there is limited pre-existing woodland, through a long processes of conversion and transformation. Therefore, maintaining higher woody vegetation cover will promote quicker and substantial regeneration of woody vegetation, and availability of woody resources for sustainable wood-based livelihoods, such as charcoal production.

TI  - Impact of mobility restrictions on active aging; cross-sectional associations and longitudinal changes parallel to COVID-19 restrictions
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Meaningful activities can be done in or around home, but opportunities for participation and active aging decrease when moving in smaller areas. Active aging refers to having an active approach to life in line with one's goals, ability and opportunities. In adults over 75 years with different baseline neighborhood mobility levels, we studied active aging scores two years prior to and amid COVID-19, when governments restricted mobility of residents to slow the COVID-19 outbreak.Methods: AGNES cohort data were collected in 2017-2018 and spring 2020. Individuals were queried about their will, ability, and opportunity, and extent of doing 17 activities, and subsequently, item, composite and sub-scores of active aging were computed. Neighborhood mobility was assessed as frequency of moving in or beyond own neighborhood (limited, regular, daily=reference). Associations were studied using Generalized Linear Models (cross-sectionally, n = 1007) and General Estimating Equations (prospectively, n = 774).Results: Participants with limited baseline neighborhood mobility had lower active aging scores than those with daily mobility, but the decline over time was similar. Some item scores on opportunity to act and extent of doing, e.g. for making one's day more interesting and advancing matters of faith or worldview, were better retained amid COVID-19 by those with limited mobility, attenuating group differences.Conclusions: Active aging scores were somewhat compromised in individuals with limited neighborhood mobility, but opportunities for and engagement in several activities seemed to be better retained amid COVID-19 than for those with daily mobility. Thus, active aging may be possible despite mobility restriction.

TI  - The change detection in coastal settlements using image processing techniques: a case study of Korfez
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas all over the world are usually exposed to intensive change and transformation processes resulting in a variety of natural, physical, and socio-economic problems. Korfez province, located along the Izmit Bay of Marmara Sea, Turkey, has been one of these coastal areas that has become a major point for industrial facilities and highly populated urbanized area since 1960s. Therefore, the analysis of the spatial changes in the land use patterns of the province has a critical role in the success of the physical planning processes and the protection of the coastal areas. In order to highlight this critical role, temporal change detection analysis for Korfez province covering a 6-year period and 5 land use classes was made using 2009 and 2015 SPOT imagery and thematic maps. Reclassified CORINE data, development plans, and land survey results were benefited for the supervised classification of the images. Four hundred eighty control points for each year were used to achieve a strong accuracy tested by Kappa coefficient. The spatio-temporal change detection results revealed a 22.5% and 2.3% decrease in agricultural lands and sea areas respectively, while there was an increase of 16.6% in forest-green areas, 6.4% in settlement areas, and 74.1% in lake areas. The results are believed to be significant input data to facilitate coastal and physical development planning over the area, and thus make sustainable land use decisions to protect the delicate landscape and coastal characteristics, while providing a sound risk management plan.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In satellite image analysis, classification of objects appearing in an image is a major step of information extraction. The information acquired from the satellite image can be used to provide the solution of various remote sensing problems such as agricultural challenges, natural hazards, and environmental monitoring etc. The most of the conventional classifiers used to classify satellite images do not provide realistic classification with high accuracy. Therefore, for achieving realistic and more accurate classification of the satellite images is still a challenging task. Machine intelligence is being harnessed to solve this task. In this paper, we present a novel machine intelligence pixel based approach for multispectral satellite image classification. We have proposed a machine intelligence deep learning neural network with five hidden layers and seven training features for satellite images classification. The model is tested on four types of data sets namely three classes, four classes, five classes and seven classes. Accuracy of 99.99%, 99.96%, 99.45% and 98.03% has been obtained on four test data sets respectively. In all cases, it is observed that the proposed method provides 8.52% higher accuracy than previously proposed classifiers.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing data in optimization of a national water resources model to improve the spatial pattern performance of evapotranspiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological models have traditionally been calibrated and evaluated against point-scale observations, such as streamflow, emphasizing the temporal, but not necessarily the spatial component of a model. The main goal of this study is to improve the spatial pattern performance of simulated actual evapotranspiration (AET), a key variable in the land-atmosphere interface, for the entire land-phase of Denmark. This is achieved by integrating fully distributed remote-sensing (RS) data and robust objective functions in the regionalization and optimization of the national water resources model of Denmark (DK-model). For this, monthly spatial patterns of MODIS16 ET at 1 km resolution are used as a reference RS ET estimate in the model calibration. We applied a gradient-based nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg (GML) algorithm for parameter estimation via inverse modeling. The proposed optimization framework includes three calibration strategies: Cal01 represents the traditional calibration approach against discharge and groundwater head observations only, Cal02 expands Cal01 by means of a spatial pattern-oriented objective function, namely the spatial efficiency (SPAEF) metric, targeting ET pattern performance, Cal03 adds to Cal02 an additional parameter regionalization scheme, where the original fixed land use class dependent distribution and seasonal development of leaf area index (LAI), crop coefficient (Kc) and mot depth (RD) are replaced with empirical schemes driven by distributed vegetation (NDVI) and soil texture (clay fraction) data. Our results reveal that a significant improvement in the simulated spatial patterns of AET is obtained when combining regionalization schemes and a spatial pattern oriented objective function in Cal03, which is highlighted by a Copula analysis also. At the same time, a very limited trade-off in the model performance of AET patterns, streamflow and groundwater-heads is observed. Finally, the regionalization scheme (Cal03) affected the simulated groundwater recharge according to changes of AET. The findings of this study contribute to further improve spatial representation and evaluation of hydrological models and highlight the need to carefully design regionalization schemes as well as objective functions in fully distributed models.

TI  - Modeling the radiation regime of a discontinuous canopy based on the stochastic radiative transport theory: Modification, evaluation and validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy radiative transfer (RT) modeling is critical for the quantitative retrieval of vegetation biophysical parameters and has been under intensive research over the decades. RT models of discontinuous canopies, such as three-dimensional (3D) RT models, posed challenges for the early one-dimensional (1D) hypothesis. Although 3D RT models have higher accuracy, theoretically, they suffer from two problems: detailed scene parameters and complex computational steps. To overcome these problems, the stochastic radiative transfer (SRT) theory, which is known to have the accuracy of 3D RT while being as simple as 1D RT, has been adapted from atmospheric research to the study of vegetation canopies. While the SRT model has been adopted into the operational production of vegetation parameters, its accuracy needs further improvement because of the insufficient consideration of hotspot effects. Additionally, the evaluation and validation of SRT process are still preliminary, which hinders its further development and application. To provide the community with missing information and a scientific basis for subsequent model improvement, we modified, evaluated, and validated the SRT model in this study. First, we proposed the new version of SRT model to better achieve the coupling of SRT process and hotspot effect by dividing the previous SRT into four subproblems. Then, we evaluated the performance of the modified SRT by comparing multiple intermediate variables in the SRT process with 3D computer simulations, and analyzed the model sensitivity to key input parameters as well as the spatial distribution and conservation of radiation energy. Our findings reconfirmed that the SRT theory can well describe the radiation regime of discontinuous canopies with balanced efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the newly proposed coupling scheme of hotspot effect further improves the model performance in the hotspot regions. Finally, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observations served as a reference to validate the modeled canopy reflectance, which shows a high concordance. These results provide a detailed theoretical basis for applications and further improvements of the SRT model.

TI  - Assessing the utility of remote sensing data to accurately estimate changes in groundwater storage
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely estimates of groundwater storage changes are critical to the sustainable management of aquifers worldwide, but are hindered by the lack of in-situ groundwater measurements in most regions. Hydrologic remote sensing measurements provide a potential pathway to quantify groundwater storage changes by closing the water balance, but the degree to which remote sensing data can accurately estimate groundwater storage changes is unclear. In this study, we quantified groundwater storage changes in California's Central Valley at two spatial scales for the period 2002 through 2020 using remote sensing data and an ensemble water balance method. To evaluate performance, we compared estimates of groundwater storage changes to three independent estimates: GRACE satellite data, groundwater wells and a groundwater flow model. Results suggest evapotranspiration has the highest uncertainty among water balance components, while precipitation has the lowest. We found that remote sensing-based groundwater storage estimates correlated well with independent estimates; annual trends during droughts fall within 15% of trends calculated using wells and groundwater models within the Central Valley. Remote sensing-based estimates also reliably estimated the long-term trend, seasonality, and rate of groundwater depletion during major drought events. Additionally, our study suggests that the proposed method estimate changes in groundwater at sub-annual latencies, which is not currently possible using other methods. The findings have implications for improving the understanding of aquifer dynamics and can inform regional water managers about the status of groundwater systems during droughts.

TI  - E000nsemble ecological niche modeling of West Nile virus probability in Florida
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological Niche Modeling is a process by which spatiotemporal, climatic, and environmental data are analyzed to predict the distribution of an organism. Using this process, an ensemble ecological niche model for West Nile virus habitat prediction in the state of Florida was developed. This model was created through the weighted averaging of three separate machine learning models-boosted regression tree, random forest, and maximum entropy-developed for this study using sentinel chicken surveillance and remote sensing data. Variable importance differed among the models. The highest variable permutation value included mean dewpoint temperature for the boosted regression tree model, mean temperature for the random forest model, and wetlands focal statistics for the maximum entropy mode. Model validation resulted in area under the receiver curve predictive values ranging from good [0.8728 (95% CI 0.8422-0.8986)] for the maximum entropy model to excellent [0.9996 (95% CI 0.9988-1.0000)] for random forest model, with the ensemble model predictive value also in the excellent range [0.9939 (95% CI 0.9800-0.9979]. This model should allow mosquito control districts to optimize West Nile virus surveillance, improving detection and allowing for a faster, targeted response to reduce West Nile virus transmission potential.

TI  - Monitoring river water level using multiple bounces of bridges in SAR images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring river water level is of great importance to understand hydrological and hydraulic processes and evaluate flood and landslide risk. This paper proposes a method for estimating river water levels under bridges using multi-temporal high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. Due to the side-looking characteristics of SAR data acquisitions, bridges crossing over rivers usually exhibit multiple bounce echoes in SAR images caused by the multipath scattering. The range difference of the multiple returns is proportional to the clearance between the water surface and the bridge. In this study, the water level oscillation of Yangtze River under Badong Yangzte River Bridge (China) was calculated by estimating the range pixel distances of the multiple bounces in ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images using cross correlation algorithm. Besides, a linear correlation between the range pixel distance of the multiple bounces and in situ water level measurements was found, with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.9985. This relationship allowed estimating the river water level in each SAR acquisition, with an average error equal to -0.39 m and root mean square error of 0.51 m, and the elevation of the bridge, with an error of about 0.5 m, which is smaller than the theoretical uncertainty of the method (1.24 m). The obtained results show the efficiency of the method in estimating river water levels. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global time series and temporal mosaics of glacier surface velocities derived from Sentinel-1 data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistent and continuous data on glacier surface velocity are important inputs to time series analyses, numerical ice dynamic modeling and glacier mass flux computations. Since 2014, repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite constellation as part of the Copernicus program of the EU (European Union) and ESA (European Space Agency). It enables global, near-real-time-like and fully automatic processing of glacier surface velocity fields at up to 6 d temporal resolution, independent of weather conditions, season and daylight. We present a new global data set of glacier surface velocities that comprises continuously updated scene-pair velocity fields, as well as monthly and annually averaged velocity mosaics at 200 m spatial resolution. The velocity information is derived from archived and new Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions by applying a well-established intensity offset tracking technique. The data set covers 12 major glacierized regions outside the polar ice sheets and is generated in an HPC (high-performance computing) environment at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. The velocity products are freely accessible via an interactive web portal that provides capabilities for download and simple online analyses: http://retreat.geographie.uni-erlangen.de (last access: 6 October 2021). In this paper, we give information on the data processing and how to access the data. For the example region of Svalbard, we demonstrate the potential of our products for velocity time series analyses at very high temporal resolution and assess the quality of our velocity products by comparing them to those generated from very high-resolution TerraSAR-X SAR and Landsat-8 optical (ITS_LIVE, GoLIVE) data. The subset of Sentinel-1 velocities for Svalbard analyzed in this paper is accessible via the GFZ Potsdam Data Services under the DOI (Friedl et al., 2021). We find that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 annual velocity mosaics are in an overall good agreement, but speckle tracking on Sentinel-1 6 d repeat acquisitions derives more reliable velocity measurements over featureless and slow-moving areas than the optical data. Additionally, uncertainties of 12 d repeat Sentinel-1 mid-glacier scene-pair velocities have less than half (< 0.08 m d(-1)) of the uncertainties derived for 16 d repeat Landsat-8 data (0.17-0.18 m d(-1)).

TI  - A Weighted Sample Framework to Incorporate External Calculators for Risk Modeling
T2  - STATISTICS IN BIOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Personalized risk prediction calculators abound in medicine, and they carry important information about the effect of prognostic factors on outcomes of interest. How to use that information in order to analyze local datasets is a pressing question, and several recent proposals have attempted to pool information from external calculators to local datasets using parameter sharing approaches. Here, we adopt a weighting approach using convex optimization in order to transfer information. Rather than directly modeling parameters, we instead pool information on a per-sample basis. In particular, we develop prediction-guided analyses, along with an attendant inferential strategy, for incorporating information from the external risk calculator. We also supplement this analytical approach with an exploratory technique using trees to describe what we term as 'calculator-guided observations.' In addition, the optimization problem itself can yield insights on the potential transferability of the external calculator to the local dataset. The methodology is illustrated by simulation studies as well as an application of risk calculators to the prediction of sentinel lymph node positivity in melanoma.

TI  - Landsat-based assessment of the quantitative and qualitative dynamics of the pasture areas in rural settlements in the Cerrado biome, Brazil
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pastures make up a large part of the agricultural land in Brazil and in the world. Specifically, this research aimed to understand how the pasture areas in the rural settlements in the State of Goi ' as (core region of the Cerrado biome) evolved, from their creation to present. For this purpose, quantitative and qualitative analyzes were carried out, based on the annual mapping of the Brazilian pasturelands (within the scope of the MapBiomas initiative), as well as on satellite images from the Landsat series, obtained and processed through the Google Earth Engine platform. The results showed that after the creation of the rural settlements there was an increase in pasture area by-11%, as well as a qualitative improvement, with a reduction in degraded pastures of about 10%. It was also observed that approximately 70% of the rural settlements managed to improve their pastures, particularly the oldest ones. Our results corroborated the potential of remote sensing images and techniques, which allowed us to analyze the evolution of pastures over time. However, additional field studies are necessary for a better understanding of the management practices adopted and their impacts on pasture conditions.

TI  - Sentinel node involvement with or without completion axillary lymph node dissection: treatment and pathologic results of randomized SERC trial
T2  - NPJ BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on results of clinical trials, completion ALND (cALND) is frequently not performed for patients with breast conservation therapy and one or two involved sentinel nodes (SN) by micro- or macro-metastases. However, there were limitations despite a conclusion of non-inferiority for cALND omission. No trial had included patients with SN macro-metastases and total mastectomy or with >2 SN macro-metastases. The aim of the study was too analyze treatment delivered and pathologic results of patients included in SERC trial. SERC trial is a multicenter randomized non-inferiority phase-3 trial comparing no cALND with cALND in cT0-1-2, cN0 patients with SN ITC (isolated tumor cells) or micro-metastases or macro-metastases, mastectomy or breast conservative surgery. We randomized 1855 patients, 929 to receive cALND and 926 SLNB alone. No significant differences in patient's and tumor characteristics, type of surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) were observed between the two arms. Rates of involved SN nodes by ITC, micro-metastases, and macro-metastases were 5.91%, 28.12%, and 65.97%, respectively, without significant difference between two arms for all criteria. In multivariate analysis, two factors were associated with higher positive non-SN rate: no AC versus AC administered after ALND (OR = 3.32, p < 0.0001) and >2 involved SN versus <= 2 (OR = 3.45, p = 0.0258). Crude rates of positive NSN were 17.62% (74/420) and 26.45% (73/276) for patient's eligible and non-eligible to ACOSOG-Z0011 trial. No significant differences in patient's and tumor characteristics and treatment delivered were observed between the two arms. Higher positive-NSN rate was observed for patients with AC performed after ALND (17.65% for SN micro-metastases, 35.22% for SN macro-metastases) in comparison with AC administered before ALND.

TI  - Evaluating the quality of remote sensing products for agricultural index insurance
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural index insurance contracts increasingly use remote sensing data to estimate losses and determine indemnity payouts. Index insurance contracts inevitably make errors, failing to detect losses that occur and issuing payments when no losses occur. The quality of these contracts and the indices on which they are based, need to be evaluated to assess their fitness as insurance, and to provide a guide to choosing the index that best protects the insured. In the remote sensing literature, indices are often evaluated with generic model evaluation statistics such as R-2 or Root Mean Square Error that do not directly consider the effect of errors on the quality of the insurance contract. Economic analysis suggests using measures that capture the impact of insurance on the expected economic well-being of the insured. To bridge the gap between the remote sensing and economic perspectives, we adopt a standard economic measure of expected well-being and transform it into a Relative Insurance Benefit (RIB) metric. RIB expresses the welfare benefits derived from an index insurance contract relative to a hypothetical contract that perfectly measures losses. RIB takes on its maximal value of one when the index contract offers the same economic benefits as the perfect contract. When it achieves none of the benefits of insurance it takes on a value of zero, and becomes negative if the contract leaves the insured worse off than having no insurance. Part of our contribution is to decompose this economic well-being measure into an asymmetric loss function. We also argue that the expected well-being measure we use has advantages over other economic measures for the normative purpose of insurance quality ascertainment. Finally, we illustrate the use of the RIB measure with a case study of potential livestock insurance contracts in Northern Kenya. We compared 24 indices that were made with 4 different statistical models and 3 remote sensing data sources. RIB for these indices ranged from 0.09 to 0.5, and R-2 ranged from 0.2 to 0.51. While RIB and R-2 were correlated, the model with the highest RIB did not have the highest R-2. Our findings suggest that, when designing and evaluating an index insurance program, it is useful to separately consider the quality of a remote sensing-based index with a metric like the RIB instead of a generic goodness-of-fit metric.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection by combining nonradioactive techniques with contrast agents: State of the art and prospects
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The status of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) has a substantial prognostic value because these nodes are the first place where cancer cells accumulate along their spreading route. Routine SLN biopsy ("gold standard") involves peritumoral injections of radiopharmaceuticals, such as technetium-99m, which has obvious disadvantages. This review examines the methods used as "gold standard" analogs to diagnose SLNs. Nonradioactive preoperative and intraoperative methods of SLN detection are analyzed. Promising photonic tools for SLNs detection are reviewed, including NIR-I/NIR-II fluorescence imaging, photoswitching dyes for SLN detection, in vivo photoacoustic detection, imaging and biopsy of SLNs. Also are discussed methods of SLN detection by magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonic imaging systems including as combined with photoacoustic imaging, and methods based on the magnetometer-aided detection of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The advantages and disadvantages of nonradioactive SLN-detection methods are shown. The review concludes with prospects for the use of conservative diagnostic methods in combination with photonic tools.

TI  - Field-Level Crop Classification Using an Optimal Dataset of Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR Data with Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification for acreage assessment using optical satellite data is challenging during Kharif (rainy) season in India due to persistent cloud cover. Microwave SAR data provides a promising alternative to it. In this present study, an optimum combination of multi-date Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR data (VV mode) and RADARSAT-2 (R-2) fine quad polarization SAR (HH, VV, VH, and HV) data was used for crop classification at the field level, using machine learning techniques. Four dates of S-1 data, between July and August, and three dates R-2 quad pol data between September and October were used during the Kharif season of 2019 for part of Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The study area's principal crops are rice and soybean, while minor crops are maize, pigeon pea, etc. A comprehensive approach combining principal component analysis, separability analysis, and layer-layer correlation was used to select the best seven dates/layers dataset for crop classification. Supervised machine learning classification algorithms of support vector machine (SVM), random forest, spectral angle mapper, and maximum likelihood classification were performed on the best set of S-1 and R-2 SAR selected dataset. Additionally, Wishart unsupervised classification was also performed on R-2 fully polarimetric data to classify the crops based on their scattering behavior. The results from five classification techniques were compared for their accuracy using ground truth data. It was observed that SVM, followed by Wishart, performed better than all other classification techniques regarding crop classification and area estimation accuracy. Overall, the study showed that an optimal combination of multi-date and multi-polarization SAR data from different satellites with a suitable classification technique is useful for crop area estimation at the field level, during Kharif season.

TI  - Beyond Vertical Point Accuracy: Assessing Inter-pixel Consistency in 30 m Global DEMs for the Arid Central Andes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative geomorphic research depends on accurate topographic data often collected via remote sensing. Lidar, and photogrammetric methods like structure-from-motion, provide the highest quality data for generating digital elevation models (DEMs). Unfortunately, these data are restricted to relatively small areas, and may be expensive or time-consuming to collect. Global and near-global DEMs with 1 arcsec (similar to 30 m) ground sampling from spaceborne radar and optical sensors offer an alternative gridded, continuous surface at the cost of resolution and accuracy. Accuracy is typically defined with respect to external datasets, often, but not always, in the form of point or profile measurements from sources like differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), spaceborne lidar (e.g., ICESat), and other geodetic measurements. Vertical point or profile accuracy metrics can miss the pixel-to-pixel variability (sometimes called DEM noise) that is unrelated to true topographic signal, but rather sensor-, orbital-, and/or processing-related artifacts. This is most concerning in selecting a DEM for geomorphic analysis, as this variability can affect derivatives of elevation (e.g., slope and curvature) and impact flow routing. We use (near) global DEMs at 1 arcsec resolution (SRTM, ASTER, ALOS, TanDEM-X, and the recently released Copernicus) and develop new internal accuracy metrics to assess inter-pixel variability without reference data. Our study area is in the arid, steep Central Andes, and is nearly vegetation-free, creating ideal conditions for remote sensing of the bare-earth surface. We use a novel hillshade-filtering approach to detrend long-wavelength topographic signals and accentuate short-wavelength variability. Fourier transformations of the spatial signal to the frequency domain allows us to quantify: 1) artifacts in the un-projected 1 arcsec DEMs at wavelengths greater than the Nyquist (twice the nominal resolution, so > 2 arcsec); and 2) the relative variance of adjacent pixels in DEMs resampled to 30-m resolution (UTM projected). We translate results into their impact on hillslope and channel slope calculations, and we highlight the quality of the five DEMs. We find that the Copernicus DEM, which is based on a carefully edited commercial version of the TanDEM-X, provides the highest quality landscape representation, and should become the preferred DEM for topographic analysis in areas without sufficient coverage of higher-quality local DEMs.</p>

M3  - Article
AB  - Lithological maps derived from traditional pixel-based image analysis are widely established in remote sensing. Recent development of new segmentation-based approaches such as object-based image analysis (OBIA) has led to significant improvements of accuracy in land cover classifications. However, additional enhancements have been reported by coupling OBIA with machine learning (ML) techniques. ML which automates computer algorithms and model building, enables learning, reasoning, and decision making through analysis and interpretation of data patterns and structures. This study is an attempt for evaluating and comparing the performances of four ML classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), normal Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and random forest (RF). This approach was tested with medium resolution imagery using an object-based classification procedure in a metamorphic complex, SW Iran. The multi-band input datasets were assembled form individual and multi-sensor layers from ASTER, Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2A. Results revealed that combined data sets obtain more reasonable classes for lithology, and combination of ASTER + simulated panchromatic of Sentinel-2A data shows the most efficient results. We also showed that, in general, RF and SVM algorithms were the most advantageous classifiers when using an object-based image analysis approach. When integrating the data sets aiming improvement of spatial resolution, the maximum accuracies of RF, SVM, k-NN and NB algorithms increased from 90% to 98%, 81% to 97%, 52 to 75%, and 40% to 64%, respectively. We also revealed that the integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2A data was promising and allowed for additional extraction of rock relief. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Modeling sub-boreal forest canopy bulk density in Minnesota, USA, using synthetic aperture radar and optical satellite sensor data
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background National estimates of canopy bulk density (CBD; kg m(-3)) for fire behavior modeling are generated and supported by the LANDFIRE program. However, locally derived estimates of CBD at finer scales are preferred over national estimates if they exist, as the absolute accuracy of the LANDFIRE CBD product is low and varies regionally. Active sensors (e.g., lidar or radar) are better suited for this task, as passive sensors are ill equipped to detect differences among key vertical fuel structures, such as coniferous surface fuels (<= 2 m high) and canopy fuels above this threshold-a key categorical fuel distinction in fire behavior modeling. However, previous efforts to map CBD using lidar sensor data in the Superior National Forest (SNF) of Minnesota, USA, yielded substandard results. Therefore, we use a combination of dormant-season synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite sensor data to (1) expand detectability of coniferous fuels among mixed forest canopies to improve the accuracy of CBD modeling and (2) better understand the influence of surface fuels in this regard. Response variables included FuelCalc output and indirect estimates of maximum burnable fuel based on canopy gap fraction (CGF) measured at ground level and 2 m above ground level. Results SAR variables were important predictors of CBD and total fuel density (TFD) in all independent model calibrations with ground data, in which we define TFD as the sum of CBD and primarily live coniferous surface fuel density (SFD) 0 to 2 m above ground. Exploratory estimates of TFD appeared biased to the presence of sapling-stage conifer fuel on measures of CGF at the ground level. Thus, modeling efforts to calibrate SFD with satellite sensor data failed. Both CGF-based and FuelCalc-based field estimates of CBD yielded close unity with satellite-calibrated estimates, although substantial differences in data distributions existed. Estimates of CBD from the widest CGF zenith angle range (0 to 38 degrees) correlated best with FuelCalc-based CBD estimates, while both resulted in maximum biomass values that exceeded those considered typical for the SNF. Model results from the narrowest zenith angle range (0 to 7 degrees) produced estimates of CBD that were more in line with values considered typical. LANDFIRE's estimates of CBD were weakly, but significantly (P = 0.05), correlated to both narrow- and wide-angle CGF-based estimates of CBD, but not with FuelCalc-based estimates. Conclusions The combined use of field estimates of CBD, based on indirect measures of CGF according to Keane et al. (Canadian Journal of Forest Research 35:724-739, 2005), with SAR and optical satellite sensor data demonstrates the potential of this method for mapping CBD in the Upper Midwest, USA. Results suggested that the presence of live, coniferous surface fuels neither confounds remote detection nor precludes mapping of CBD in this region using SAR satellite sensor data, as C- and L-band idiosyncrasies likely limit the visibility of these smaller understory fuels from space. Nevertheless, research using direct measures of burnable SFD for calibrations with SAR satellite sensor data should be conducted to more definitively answer this remote detection question, as we suspect substantial bias among measures of CGF from ground level when estimating SFD as the difference between TFD and CBD.

TI  - Estimations of forest water retention across China from an observation site-scale to a national-scale
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological models or remote sensing methods are often used to estimate water retention amounts and to analyze large spatial variations in water retention across large scales. However, the accuracies of hydrological models and remote sensing data are far lower than those of site-observational data. Here, we used 1045 observational sites of forest ecosystem across China and a random forest (RF) model for more accurate spatial prediction of canopy interception amount (CIA), litter maximum water-holding amount (LWHA), soil water storage amount (SSA), and forest water retention amount (WRA) of China. We found that the total forest WRA in China was 2325.87 x 108 m3, and the CIA, LWHA and SSA contributed 21.24%, 5.37% and 73.39%, respectively, to the WRA. The forest WRA in the basins of southern China including the Yangtze River Basin (YTRB), Songhua River Basin (SHRB), Southwest Rivers Basin (SWRB) and Pearl River Basin (PRB) accounted for 78.33% of the total forest WRA. The WRAs of subtropical needleleaf forest, temperate deciduous broadleaf forest, subtropical and tropical mountainous needleleaf forest, subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest, and cold and temperate mountainous needleleaf forest accounted for 50.61% of the total WRA in Chinese forests. The WRAs of cold and temperate forest types were relatively higher in the SHRB, Liao River Basin (LRB), Northwest Rivers Basin (NWRB), Hai River Basin (HRB) and Yellow River Basin (YRB) than in other basins, and the WRAs of subtropical and tropical forests types were relatively higher in the YTRB, Southeast Rivers Basin (SERB), SWRB, and PRB than in the other basins. This observation-based assessment can provide insight into spatial variations in different layers of the WRA including canopy, litter, and soil which can be used for forest resource management in China.

TI  - Plant phenomics & precision agriculture simulation of winter wheat growth by the assimilation of unmanned aerial vehicle imagery into the WOFOST model
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to optimize the simulation result of the WOFOST model and explore the possibility of assimilating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery into this model. Field images of wheat during its key growth stages are acquired with a UAV, and the corresponding leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and final yield are experimentally measured. LAI data is retrieved from the UAV imagery and assimilated into a localized WOFOST model using least squares optimization. Sensitive parameters, i.e., specific leaf area (SLATB0, SLATB0.5, SLATB2) and maximum CO2 assimilation rate (AMAXTB1, AMAXTB1.3) are adjusted to minimize the discrepancy between the LAI obtained from the model simulation and inversion of the UAV data. The results show that the assimilated model provides a better estimation of the growth and development of winter wheat in the study area. The R-2, RMSE, and NRMSE of winter wheat LAI simulated with the assimilated WOFOST model are 0.8812, 0.49, and 23.5% respectively. The R-2, RMSE, and NRMSE of the simulated yield are 0.9489, 327.06 kg.hm(-2) , and 6.5%. The accuracy in model simulation of winter wheat growth is improved, which demonstrates the feasibility of integrating UAV data into crop models.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of massive epistaxis and pseudoaneurysms in nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Epistaxis after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common clinical critical illness, which often leads to death of patients. This article focuses on the relationship between massive epistaxis and pseudoaneurysm after radiotherapy in patients with NPC and discusses clinically relevant treatment strategies. Methods A review was performed in 21 patients with massive epistaxis after radiotherapy for NPC from January 2011 to December 2019, and all of the patients were examined by computed tomography angiography (CTA). We also reviewed the English literature over the past 10 years to analyze the characteristics and related causes of pseudoaneurysms in terms of the clinical stage of NPC, course of radiotherapy, and affected artery. An analysis was performed on the methods of endovascular interventional treatment of such pseudoaneurysms. Results Among the 21 patients, 19 cases had bone destruction of the skull base; 13 cases were also found to have tumor recurrence; 15 cases were in stage III or IV of NPC; pseudoaneurysms were observed in 14 cases, of which nine cases had pseudoaneurysms in the internal carotid artery (ICA), and the rest had pseudoaneurysms in the external carotid artery (ECA). These data were consistent with the results of the literature review. Analysis with imaging revealed that the petrous ICA was the common predilection site. There were 11 out of 14 cases of pseudoaneurysms with sentinel hemorrhage in the initial phase. All 14 pseudoaneurysm patients underwent endovascular interventional therapy, but one died from hemorrhagic shock during the procedure. No rebleeding was observed among the other patients during 72 h after intravascular treatment. Nevertheless, regrettably two patients died on the 10th and 17th days after intervention. Conclusion Pseudoaneurysm, which was a serious complication after radiotherapy in patients with NPC, could cause massive epistaxis with high mortality. The formation of a pseudoaneurysm was closely associated with a high carcinoma stage, re-radiotherapy, and local bone destruction and infection. Most cases had sentinel epistaxis, which was considered the bleeding characteristic. The imaging material prompted that pseudoaneurysm had a predisposition to the petrous part of the ICA, while the preferred therapy was endovascular embolization treatment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Annual seasonal influenza activity in the northern hemisphere causes a high burden of disease during the winter months, peaking in the first weeks of the year. Aim: We describe the 2019/20 influenza season and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sentinel surveillance in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. Methods: We analysed weekly epidemiological and virological influenza data from sentinel primary care and hospital sources reported by countries, territories and areas (hereafter countries) in the European Region. Results: We observed co-circulation of influenza B/Victoria-lineage, A(H1) pdm09 and A(H3) viruses during the 2019/20 season, with different dominance patterns observed across the Region. A higher proportion of patients with influenza A virus infection than type B were observed. The influenza activity started in week 47/2019, and influenza positivity rate was a 50% for 2 weeks (05-06/2020) rather than 5-8 weeks in the previous five seasons. In many countries a rapid reduction in sentinel reports and the highest influenza activity was observed in weeks 09-13/2020. Reporting was reduced from week 14/2020 across the Region coincident with the onset of widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: Overall, influenza type A viruses dominated; however, there were varying patterns across the Region, with dominance of B/Victoria-lineage viruses in a few countries. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an earlier end of the influenza season and reduced influenza virus circulation probably owing to restricted healthcare access and public health measures.

TI  - Three decades of pastoralist settlement dynamics in the Ethiopian Omo Delta based on remote sensing data
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River deltas provide important livelihoods to local populations, but at the same time are under increasing anthropogenic pressure. The opening of the Gibe III dam on the Omo River in Ethiopia in 2016 attracted international attention due to the importance of the free-flowing River for pastoralist communities in the Omo Delta. Sustainable river basin management requires spatially explicit, long-term information about human settlements to mitigate negative impacts on people's livelihoods. Based on remote sensing time-series, and supplemented with ground-truthing, we mapped settlement-dynamics of the pastoralist Dasanech tribe. The inhabited area more than doubled from 1992 to 2009. From 2009 to 2019, settlements became more permanent and concentrated in the North of the Delta. Our results indicate that the Omo Delta has overall gained in importance as a livelihood area, but that the livelihoods of the traditionally nomadic people are shifting in the context of increasing investment in infrastructure. Management of future river flow at dams should consider the location and the trajectory of change in downstream settlements.

TI  - Nodal Recurrence in Patients With Node-Positive Breast Cancer Treated With Sentinel Node Biopsy Alone After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy-A Rare Event
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Prospective trials have demonstrated sentinel lymph node (SLN) false-negative rates of less than 10% when 3 or more SLNs are retrieved in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer rendered clinically node-negative with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, rates of nodal recurrence in such patients treated with SLN biopsy (SLNB) alone are unknown because axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in all patients, limiting adoption of this approach.OBJECTIVE To evaluate nodal recurrence rates in a consecutive cohort of patients with clinically node-positive (cN1) breast cancer receiving NAC, followed by a negative SLNB using a standardized technique, and no further axillary surgery.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From November 2013 to February 2019, a cohort of consecutively identified patients with cT1 to cT3 biopsy-proven N1 breast cancer rendered cN0 by NAC underwent SLNB with dual tracer mapping and omission of ALND if 3 or more SLNs were identified and all were pathologically negative. Metastatic nodes were not routinely clipped, and localization of clipped nodes was not performed. The study was performed in a single tertiary cancer center.INTERVENTION Omission of ALND in patients with cN1 breast cancer after NAC if 3 or more SLNs were pathologically negative.MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the rate of nodal recurrence among patients with cN1 breast cancer treated with SLNB alone after NAC.RESULTS Of 610 patients with cN1 breast cancer treated with NAC (median [IQR] age, 49 [40-58] years), 555 (91%) converted to cN0 and underwent SLNB; 234 (42%) had 3 or more negative SLNs and had SLNB alone. Median age was 49 years. Median tumor size was 3 cm; 144 (62%) were ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-positive, and 43 (18%) were triple negative. Most (212 [91%]) received doxorubicin-based NAC, 205 (88%) received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), and 164 (70%) also received nodal RT. At a median follow-up of 40 months, there was 1 axillary nodal recurrence synchronous with local recurrence in a patient who refused RT. Among patients who received RT (n = 205), there were no nodal recurrences.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cohort study found that in patients with cN1 disease rendered cN0 with NAC, with 3 or more negative SLNs with SLNB alone, nodal recurrence rates were low, without routine nodal clipping. These findings potentially support omitting ALND in such patients.This cohort study examines nodal recurrence rates in patients with clinically node-positive cancer treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Question What is the nodal recurrence rate in patients with clinically node-positive (cN1) breast cancer treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)? Findings In this cohort study of 610 patients with cN1 breast cancer, among 234 consecutive patients whose cancer was rendered cN0 with NAC treated with SLNB alone with 3 or more negative SLNs retrieved, rates of axillary failure at a median follow-up of 40 months were low (0.4%), without routine nodal clipping. Meaning These data support potential omission of axillary lymph node dissection in patients with cN1 breast cancer who achieve nodal pathologic complete response with NAC and are treated with SLNB alone.

TI  - Integrating empirical models and satellite radar can improve landslide detection for emergency response
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the spatial distribution of triggered landslides following an earthquake is invaluable to emergency responders. Manual mapping using optical satellite imagery, which is currently the most common method of generating this landslide information, is extremely time consuming and can be disrupted by cloud cover. Empirical models of landslide probability and landslide detection with satellite radar data are two alternative methods of generating information on triggered landslides that overcome these limitations. Here we assess the potential of a combined approach, in which we generate an empirical model of the landslides using data available immediately following the earthquake using the random forest technique and then progressively add landslide indicators derived from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellite radar data to this model in the order they were acquired following the earthquake. We use three large case study earthquakes and test two model types: first, a model that is trained on a small part of the study area and used to predict the remainder of the landslides and, second, a preliminary global model that is trained on the landslide data from two earthquakes and used to predict the third. We assess model performance using receiver operating characteristic analysis and r2, and we find that the addition of the radar data can considerably improve model performance and robustness within 2 weeks of the earthquake. In particular, we observed a large improvement in model performance when the first ALOS-2 image was added and recommend that these data or similar data from other L-band radar satellites be routinely incorporated in future empirical models.

TI  - Bats are an excellent sentinel model for the detection of genotoxic agents. Study in a Colombian Caribbean region
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife animals have been affected by human activities and the diminution of the areas needed to develop wildlife. In Colombia, artisanal and industrial mining focuses on gold extraction, which uses mercury and causes contamination in water sources. Bats may be susceptible to chemical contamination and primarily to bioaccumulated heavy metal contaminants in the food chain. The primary source of exposure is contaminated food and water ingest, followed by dermic exposition and inhalation. The objective was to evaluategenotoxic damage and mercury concentration in bats. Forty-five samples of blood and organs of bats captured in Ayapel and Majagual were collected. Erythrocytes were searched for micronuclei by peripheral blood smear. Mercury concentration in 45 liver and spleen samples was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (DMA80 TRICELL, Milestone Inc, Italy). Bats from four families were studied: Phyllostomidae (6 species), Molossidae (3 species), Vespertilionidae (1 species), and Emballonuridae (1 species). Mercury was found in all bat species from the different dietary guilds. Insectivores had the highest concentration of mercury in the liver (0,23 mu g/g) and spleen (0,25 mu g/g) and the highest number of micronuclei (260 micronuclei/10,000). The specimens captured in Majagual had the highest frequency of micronuclei (677 micronuclei/10,000), and those captured in Ayapel had the highest mercury concentration (0,833 mu g/g). This is the first study in Colombia to report that bats could act as sentinels to the environment's genotoxic chemical agents. Mercury and a high frequency of micronuclei were found in the tissues of captured bats. In addition to mercury contamination, there could also be other contaminants affecting Chiroptera.

TI  - Geotechnologies applied to the analysis of buildings involved in the production of poultry and swine to the integrated food safety system and environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Initiatives to promote food security in relation to reducing food waste are of relevant for sustainability on a global scale. Rural buildings involved in the production of poultry and swine, in an integrated system tend to comprise a variety of forms with complex characteristics. Studying the impacts of an integrated system on sustainability and food production becomes opportune. This study aims to analyze parameters in different buildings involved in the production of poultry and swine; considering economic, social and environmental factors with the use of remote sensing geotechnologies related to food safety. Methodologically, a K-means cluster analysis of the buildings was carried out to understand the impacts of raising poultry and pigs in relation to the distance from forests, roads, water bodies, distances from local and total buildings, based on the use of geotechnologies. Unpublished images from the Landsat TM-8 satellite were used, made available by the United States Geological Survey, in partnership with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration, modeled in QGIS. The results present eight production clusters, and a variation of distances between the studied buildings was identified, along with distances close to water resources. The importance of an integrated poultry and swine production system, which contributes to global food security, was highlighted.

TI  - Locoregional Management of the Axilla in Mastectomy Patients with One or Two Positive Sentinel Nodes: The Role of Intraoperative Pathology
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Tailoring axillary surgery to disease burden has occurred for patients treated with breast-conserving surgery, but limited data exist for patients treated with mastectomy; thus, most mastectomy patients who are clinically node=negative but found to be pathologically node-positive are treated with axillary dissection. From 2295 clinically node-negative mastectomy patients treated at our institution from 2008 to 2018, we studied 338 with one or two positive sentinel nodes. Patients with a positive sentinel node identified on intraoperative frozensection pathology had a higher nodal disease burden. Sixty-six of 108 patients (61%) whose nodal disease was identified only on permanent section pathology were treated with sentinel node surgery without axillary dissection with no 5-year regional nodal recurrences. This approach permits tailoring axillary surgery in most clinically node-negative mastectomy patients while avoiding a second operation.Introduction: Controversy exists regarding optimal management of the axilla in clinically node-negative (cN0) mastectomy patients with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes (+ SLNs). We evaluated the influence of frozen-section pathology on axillary management and recurrence. Patients and Methods: We studied cN0 breast cancer patients treated from 2008 to 2018 with mastectomy and SLN surgery with one or t wo +SLNs. Patients with one or two +SLNs identified on frozen-section intraoperatively (FS+SLN) were compared to those with one or two +SLNs not detected by frozen section (FS-SLN). Recurrence rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Of 2295 cN0 mastectomy patients, 338 patients had one or two +SLNs: 108 (32%) FS-SLN and 230 (68%) FS+SLN. In the FS+SLN cases, completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) was more frequent (97% vs. 39%; P <.001), and median SLN metastasis size (5 vs. 1.3 mm; P <.001) and likelihood of positive non-SLNs (31% vs. 14%; P =.02) were greater compared with FS-SLN cases. Across all 338 patients, 40% had SLN surgery alone, and 47% of cALND patients received post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). At a median follow-up of 61 months, no axillary recurrences were observed among FS-SLN patients. Among FS+SLN patients, 97% proceeded to cALND but 49% avoided PMRT; three regional nodal recurrences were observed (all in patients treated with cALND, of whom two received PMRT). Conclusion: Mastectomy patients with one or two FS+SLNs have a higher nodal disease burden than FS-SLN patients. The majority of FS+SLN patients underwent cALND, and 51% received PMRT with very low 5-year regional nodal recurrence rates. A substantial proportion of FS-SLN patients successfully avoided both cALND and PMRT. Frozen-section pathology analysis can guide de-escalation of axillary management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - New insights in glaciers characterization by differential diagnosis integrating GPR and remote sensing techniques: A case study for the Eastern Gran Zebru glacier (Central Alps)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In GPR profiles, ice is usually imaged as a mostly electromagnetic transparent facies. However, diffraction events, as well as internal layering, can be also observed. In some cases, the bedrock below glaciers is masked by dense diffractions usually interpreted as the effect of liquid water pockets inside the so-called warm ice. However, the actual physical meaning of such GPR facies is not always obvious, because it can be related also to mixed debris and ice deposits. We adopted a strategy well known in medical sciences and referred as "differential diagnosis" in order to infer which is the actual meaning of a high scattering facies imaged within the Eastern Gran Zebru glacier (Central Italian Alps) and, more generally, of all the internal glacier features. In fact, in many cases, there is no direct information to limit the subjectivity of geophysical interpretation; therefore, we provide all the discriminative hypotheses based on both independent and integrated criteria including GPR attribute analysis, imaging effects, reflection analysis, GPR frequency evaluations combined with geomorphological and remote sensing data obtained by two photogrammetric UAV and thermal infrared surveys. On the basis of the differential diagnosis, we concluded that the high scattering zone embedded within the studied glacier is most likely related to a mixture of ice and debris probably formed during a past shrinking phase. Beside this case study, this approach could be helpful in other GPR glaciological surveys, in which the target is related not only to the bedrock detection, but also to a detailed analysis of the internal facies of a glacier.

TI  - Quantifying the mitigation of temperature extremes by forests and wetlands in a temperate landscape
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of ongoing climate change and more frequent heat events, the regulating services of land cover in terms of moderating and mitigating local temperatures are increasingly important. While the reduced temperatures found in forests and wetlands are recognized, their wider contribution to regional landscape cooling remains largely uncharacterized and unquantified. Herein, we propose and test a new method that estimates the temperature response and inertia of landscapes in high temperatures, based on land cover share. In order to achieve this goal, we combined the MODIS daytime land surface temperature (henceforth LST) time series and CORINE land cover data. We classified the time series in two ways, i.e. by stepwise temperature range (-10/ -5 degrees C to +35/+40 degrees C) and by the occurrence of hot days (days with a mean LST >= 30 degrees C). As an explanatory variable, we developed and used a greenest pixel composite of the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. In our study area, covering parts of northeastern Germany and western Poland, the fragmented landscape has heterogeneous temperature patterns, including urban heat islands, warm agricultural areas, cool forests and cold wetlands. We found that at high temperature ranges only forests and wetlands remained comparably cool, with LSTs up to 20.8 degrees C lower than the maximum LST in the study area. The analysis of land cover shares and LSTs revealed the substantial cooling effect of forests and wetlands in line with increasing land cover share in higher temperature ranges, as well as on hot days. The relation between LST and the NDVI indicated vegetation cover as the cause. We propose the corresponding metrics to quantify landscapelevel temperature regulation. Equally, we advocate for management to identify these ecosystem services and their current and potential contributions, along with implications for sustaining and increasing, both tree cover and wetlands and thereby adapting landscapes to climate change.

TI  - Repeat Sentinel Lymph Node Surgery in Recurrent Breast Cancer: Peritumoral vs. Periareolar Injections
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - There are limited data on the optimal injection technique for repeat sentinel lymph node (rSLN) surgery. We conducted an institutional review of rSLN. A total of 141 patients were included; 103 (73%) underwent successful rSLN biopsy procedure with aberrant drainage in 32 (26%). Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is beneficial in patients with recurrent breast cancer. Periareolar and peritumoral injections had similar incidence of sentinel lymph node identification and aberrant drainage.Background: In the setting of recurrent cancer, there is no standard methodology regarding the technical aspects of repeat sentinel lymph node (rSLN) surgery. We analyzed our institutional experience with attempted rSLN surgery to determine the optimal injection technique. Materials and Methods: Single site, retrospective review of patients with prior lumpectomy for breast cancer who presented with recurrent or new ipsilateral breast cancer and underwent attempt at rSLN surgery from 2008 to 2017. Patients with prior mastectomy or no prior ipsilateral axillary operation were excluded. Results: A total of 141 patients were included; 103 (73%) underwent successful rSLN biopsy procedure. Lymphoscintigraphy showed aberrant drainage in 32 (26%). Periareolar (PA) injection resulted in failed mapping in 23/99 (23%) and aberrant drainage in 25/85 (29%). By comparison, peritumoral (PT) injection had a 14/38 (37%) incidence of failed mapping and 7/37 (19%) aberrant drainage (P =.11 and.23, respectively). Of the patients with successful sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy procedure via PA injection, 11/76 (14%) were positive for metastatic disease as compared with 2/24 (8%) in PT injection. Sixteen patients had lymph node metastases; 13 (81%) were SLNs, including 3 positive aberrant SLNs. Five-year regional recurrence rates were 11.4% (95% confidence interval, 0%-21.5%) and 0% for PA and PT injection techniques, respectively. Conclusion: PA and PT injections had a similar incidence of SLN identification and aberrant drainage. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is beneficial in patients with recurrent breast cancer given the higher incidence of aberrant drainage in this population. Patients who underwent PA injections had a higher incidence of regional recurrences but this difference was not statistically significant. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integration of multi-scale remote sensing data for reindeer lichen fractional cover mapping in Eastern Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.) are an essential food source for caribou especially during winter. They can also be a valuable indicator for ecosystem health and climate change. Inventory of lichen abundance at regional scales is required to assess availability within caribou ranges, and assess potential declines from natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Previous studies have mapped lichen cover and volume using remote sensing, but these efforts were often constrained by the limited availability of ground truth information needed for model calibration and validation. In this study, we leveraged unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys and WorldView (WV) satellite scenes in a nested upscaling approach in order to expand the number of training samples at the 30 m Landsat resolution. These were used to develop machine learning models to map fractional reindeer lichen cover in Eastern Canada. We found that the best correlation between UAV and WV derived lichen coverages exists at an optimal scale that is slightly larger than 30 m and varies with landscape type and observation geometry. Based on training data from UAV-calibrated lichen coverage from WV data, a neural network model with simple structure achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.09, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.07 and R-2 = 0.79 for mapping fractional lichen cover from Landsat without the use of ancillary data. We then applied our model and Landsat data to produce a lichen fractional cover map for the Red Wine Mountain caribou herd range in Labrador, NL and the Manicouagan caribou herd range in Que ' bec. Validation against domain-averaged lichen cover in eight UAV survey sites suggests an accuracy with RMSE = 0.04, MAE = 0.03 and R-2 = 0.62 for low lichen cover. Compared to aggregated lichen cover at 30 m from UAV surveys, map accuracy decreases to RMSE = 0.09, MAE = 0.06, and R-2 = 0.49, partially due to registration error between UAV and Landsat images. Our study demonstrates that upscaling of lichen cover from UAV data to Landsat via an intermediate image scale is an effective regional-scale mapping approach.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Based Gold Related Alteration Zones Detection: Case Study (Um Balad area), North Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Um Balad area has a good potential for further gold exploration because of the existence of extensive and intense alteration zones. The use of Remote Sensing data supported by Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) data analyses enabled the exploration of new gold occurrences in the alteration zones at the Um Balad area. False Color Composites (FCC), Color Ratio Composites (CRC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) techniques were integrated for delineating the contacts between the exposed rock units. The signature-based supervised classification techniques named Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID) techniques were integrated for mapping the alteration minerals present in the gold-related alteration zones. The automatic lineament extraction technique is used as well. Airborne radiometric data were applied through the use of gamma-ray spectrometry; Potassium (K %), Equivalent Thorium (eTh ppm), Equivalent Uranium (eU ppm), and Total Count, as well as the parameters of hydrothermal alteration; F-parameter (F), and Th-Normalization (Kd, Ud) approaches. Besides, the ratio maps; eU-(eTh/3.5), eTh/K, eU/K, and eU/eTh maps were utilized for delineating the potassic and phyllic hydrothermal alteration. The alterations are confined to the volcanic and plutonic rocks depending on the lineament and fracture density among such rocks, in which the upcoming hydrothermal solutions follow the rock lineament paths and leaving marks of alteration zones and mineral specifications in these rocks. These altered minerals are potentially associated with valuable minerals as sulfides and gold precipitations in the altered areas. The remote sensing derived results show a good correlation with Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry; in which analysis was accurate and helpful for mapping the lithological units, and detecting and mapping Gold related alteration zones. Consequently, these techniques are recommended for such studies in other areas.

TI  - Twenty years of experience with less radical fertility-sparing surgery in early-stage cervical cancer: Oncological outcomes
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The standard procedure in cervical cancer is radical hysterectomy (RH) and pelvic lymphade-nectomy (PLND). Because of the increasing age of women at childbirth, fertility becomes a major challenge. We present 20 years of experience with two-step less radical fertility-sparing surgery in women with IA1, LVSI positive, IA2 and IB1 (<2 cm, infiltration less than half of stromal invasions. Materials and method. Preoperative workout consisted of histopathological diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging along with ultrasonographic volumetry. We then performed laparoscopic sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) with frozen section (FS) followed by PLND and "selective parametrectomy" (removal of afferent lym-phatic channels from the paracervix) in case of a negative result. If verified by definitive histopathology, patients were treated by simple trachelectomy (IB1) or large cone (IA1/IA2) biopsy 1 week after primary surgery. Results. From 1999 to 2018, 91 women were enrolled in the study (median age 29.1 years, range 21-40). Of these 91 women, 51 (56.0%) were nulliparous. The detection rate of SLNs was 100% per patient and the specific side detection rate 96.7%. Positive lymph nodes were diagnosed in nine cases (9.8%). These women then underwent RH. Fertility was spared in 80 women but 4 recurred locally (5.0%). The mortality rate was 0.0%. The median follow-up was 149 months. Conclusion. Less radical fertility-sparing surgery with SLNM is safe in cervical cancers <2 cm at the largest di-ameter and infiltrating less than half of the cervical stroma. The recurrence rate is acceptable with no mortality. Morbidity with this procedure is low. Extended and accurate follow-up is necessary and human papillomavirus - high risk (HPV-HR tests seem to be useful in such follow-up assessment. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Satellite Aerosol Retrieval Using Scene Simulation and Deep Belief Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol satellite remote sensing retrieval is of great importance in the study of climatic and environmental effects. However, due to varied factors affecting the signals reaching satellite sensors, accurate aerosol retrieval remains challenging. Focusing on limitations in the availability of aerosol data from real scenes, we simulated real scenes to obtain sample data to achieve aerosol retrieval using a deep belief network (DBN). The 6S atmospheric radiative transfer model was used to simulate various possible parameters of earth-atmosphere, sun, and sensor in real scenes. A large amount of simulated data was generated and used as sample datasets of DBN training to obtain the aerosol inversion model. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to perform aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieval experiments. Global-scale aerosol retrieval experiments were conducted based on the following three representative regions: 1) Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China; 2) Midwestern and Southern United States; and 3) Central and Western Europe. The retrieval results were verified using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) datasets in comparison with MCD19A2 aerosol products. Five indicators, including mean absolute error (MAE) and within expected error (f $_{=EE}$ ), were used for the evaluation. The evaluation indicators of the proposed method, in which MAEs were 0.0626, 0.0366, and 0.0487, and f $_{=EE}$ 's were 86.28%, 85.21%, and 80.71%, performed better than MCD19A2 in three typical regions. The most significant advantage of the proposed method is that high-precision retrieval of spatially continuous AOT can be achieved using single-temporal satellite imagery data, which is not possible realizing in current aerosol retrieval methods.

TI  - Estimation of land-cover linkage to trends in hydrological variables of river basins in the Indian sub-continent using satellite observation and model outputs
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indian subcontinent suffers from a decline in the per capita of water resources in the course of recent decades due to exponential population growth. In India, the majority of the population is reliant on agribusiness which is in turn primarily dependent on water from monsoons. Regions that get lower precipitation than needed experience water deficits which impact agriculture. However, investigation of linkages between the trends in water balance components and land-cover distribution has not been performed. In our work, we focus on the water balance for the major river basins in India utilizing the following satellite and model-based datasets: Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Precipitation (P) from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Evapotranspiration (ET) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Total Runoff (surface overflow and baseflow) (R) from the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). We assessed the seasonal spatio-temporal changes in the water balance from 2002 to 2019 and observed that `Agriculture' and `Urban' are the two most disrupted land-cover types displaying a monotonic increasing/decreasing trend in the components of water balance. We also observed from the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) analysis that the inherent spatial variability between P-ET-R and TWSA do not correlate well. We also found that North-Eastern India and regions in Southern India along the west coast show large negative trends of P (-15 to -20 mm) and R (-10 to -15 mm) in the monsoon season, indicating that these regions suffer from drier monsoon seasons over the study period (2002-2019). From the land-cover linkages, it was found that 74% of monotonic trends observed in several of river basins were linked to 'Agricultural' land cover type and 19% were linked to `Urban' land cover type. These linkages suggest that agricultural lands are more vulnerable to changes in the components of the water balance.

TI  - Semi-automated tracking of iceberg B43 using Sentinel-1 SAR images via Google Earth Engine
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can be used to observe the drift of icebergs over the Southern Ocean with around 1-3 d of temporal resolution and 10-40 m of spatial resolution. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based platform allows processing of a large quantity of Sentinel-1 images, saving time and computational resources. In this study, we process Sentinel-1 data via GEE to detect and track the drift of iceberg B43 during its lifespan of 3 years (2017-2020) in the Southern Ocean. First, to detect all candidate icebergs in Sentinel-1 images, we employ an object-based image segmentation (simple non-iterative clustering - SNIC) and a traditional backscatter threshold method. Next, we automatically choose and trace the location of the target iceberg by comparing the centroid distance histograms (CDHs) of all detected icebergs in subsequent days with the CDH of the reference target iceberg. Using this approach, we successfully track iceberg B43 from the Amundsen Sea to the Ross Sea and examine its changes in area, speed, and direction. Three periods with sudden losses of area (i.e., split-offs) coincide with periods of low sea ice concentration, warm air temperature, and high waves. This implies that these variables may be related to mechanisms causing the split-off of the iceberg. Since the iceberg is generally surrounded by compacted sea ice, its drift correlates in part with sea ice motion and wind velocity. Given that the bulk of the iceberg is under water (similar to 30-60 m freeboard and similar to 150-400 m thickness), its motion is predominantly driven by the westward-flowing Antarctic Coastal Current, which dominates the circulation of the region. Considering the complexity of modeling icebergs, there is a demand for a large iceberg database to better understand the behavior of icebergs and their interactions with surrounding environments. The semi-automated iceberg tracking based on the storage capacity and computing power of GEE can be used for this purpose.

TI  - Bentonite clay minerals mapping using ASTER and field mineralogical data: A case study from the eastern Rif belt, Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and mineralogical data have been integrated to map the spatial distribution of bentonite clay minerals in the Zeghanghane area, located in the eastern Rif belt of Morocco. Numerous bentonite deposits of substantial economic potential are recognized in this region and their acceptability is still restricted. These clay minerals are directly derived from different weathering types of Neogene volcanic outcrops. For this purpose, different remote sensing processing techniques have been applied to the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer satellite data, including Relative absorption band-depth, Minimum noise fraction, Pixel purity index, and ND visualization. The obtained results allowed identifying three clay minerals, namely kaolinite/smectite, illite, and montmorillonite which typically characterize the bentonite clay minerals. They are mainly concentrated in the Neogene volcanic massifs such as Gourougou, Tidiennit and Amjar. Field work, petrographic and X-ray diffraction analyses permitted the verification and validation of the obtained results. A new bentonite alteration zones have been discovered and the majority of pre-existing ore deposits have been confirmed. The established bentonite map will serve as a guide for future mining exploration in the Zeghanghane area.

TI  - The divergence between potential and actual evapotranspiration: An insight from climate, water, and vegetation change
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, unprecedented extreme drought has appeared around the world. As the most direct signal of drought, evapotranspiration deserves a more systematic and comprehensive study. Further depicting their divergence of potential (ETp) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) will help to explore the limitation of evapotranspiration. In this paper, the multi-source remote sensing datasets from the Climate Research Unit (CRU), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on experiment (GRACE-FO), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002 to 2020 were employed to explore the influence of meteorological, hydrological and botanical factors on ETp, ETa and their divergence - reduction of evapotranspiration (E-r) which represents regional vegetation and water limitations. According to the Pearson correlation analysis and the Boruta Algorithm based on Random Forest, the temperature is the first decisive promoter of evapotranspiration in the most area while the sparse vegetation is the primary or second determinant limiting the evapotranspiration in 61.84% of the world. In addition, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) data from 2030 to 2090 and the support vector machine regression (SVMR) model were applied to predict the future global ETp, ETa and E-r on the pixel scale. Predicted results of the model considering the water change not only can highly improve the model performance (with higher R-2), but also can simulate the drought in Europe and the more intense ETa in Africa. Thus, Er proposed in this study provide a good reference for regional ETa except for ETp. The future evapotranspiration value derived by introducing the water storage changes into the machine learning model in this study is also valuable for climate change adaptation and drought warning.

TI  - Changes in stratospheric aerosol extinction coefficient after the 2018 Ambae eruption as seen by OMPS-LP and MAECHAM5-HAM
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stratospheric aerosols are an important component of the climate system. They not only change the radiative budget of the Earth but also play an essential role in ozone depletion. These impacts are particularly noticeable after volcanic eruptions when SO2 injected with the eruption reaches the stratosphere, oxidizes, and forms stratospheric aerosol. There have been several studies in which a volcanic eruption plume and the associated radiative forcing were analyzed using climate models and/or data from satellite measurements. However, few have compared vertically and temporally resolved volcanic plumes using both measured and modeled data. In this paper, we compared changes in the stratospheric aerosol loading after the 2018 Ambae eruption observed by satellite remote sensing measurements and simulated by a global aerosol model. We use vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficient at 869 nm retrieved at the Institute of Environmental Physics (IUP) in Bremen from OMPS-LP (Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite - Limb Profiler) observations. Here, we present the retrieval algorithm and a comparison of the obtained profiles with those from SAGE III/ISS (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on board the International Space Station). The observed differences are within 25 % for most latitude bins, which indicates a reasonable quality of the retrieved limb aerosol extinction product. The volcanic plume evolution is investigated using both monthly mean aerosol extinction coefficients and 10 d averaged data. The measurement results were compared with the model output from MAECHAM5-HAM (ECHAM for short). In order to simulate the eruption accurately, we use SO2 injection estimates from OMPS and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) for the first phase of eruption and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for the second phase. Generally, the agreement between the vertical and geographical distribution of the aerosol extinction coefficient from OMPS-LP and ECHAM is quite remarkable, in particular, for the second phase. We attribute the good consistency between the model and the measurements to the precise estimation of injected SO2 mass and height, as well as to the nudging to ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data. Additionally, we compared the radiative forcing (RF) caused by the increase in the aerosol loading in the stratosphere after the eruption. After accounting for the uncertainties from different RF calculation methods, the RFs from ECHAM and OMPS-LP agree quite well. We estimate the tropical (20 degrees N to 20 degrees S) RF from the second Ambae eruption to be about -0.13 W m(-2).

TI  - Development of a prediction model based on LASSO regression to evaluate the risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in Chinese breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to develop an intraoperative prediction model to evaluate the risk of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis in Chinese breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The clinicopathologic data of 714 patients with 1-2 positive SLNs were investigated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of NSLN metastasis. A new mathematical prediction model was developed based on LASSO and validated in an independent cohort of 131 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to quantify performance of the model. Patients with NSLN metastasis accounted for 37.3% (266/714) and 34.3% (45/131) of the training and validation cohorts, respectively. A LASSO regression-based prediction model was developed and included the 13 most powerful factors (age group, clinical tumour stage, histologic type, number of positive SLNs, number of negative SLNs, number of SLNs dissected, SLN metastasis ratio, ER status, PR status, HER2 status, Ki67 staining percentage, molecular subtype and P53 status). The AUCs of training and validation cohorts were 0.764 (95% CI 0.729-0.798) and 0.777 (95% CI 0.692-0.862), respectively. We presented a new prediction model with excellent clinical applicability and diagnostic performance for use by clinicians as an intraoperative clinical tool to predict risk of NSLN metastasis in Chinese breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLNs and make the final decisions regarding axillary lymph node dissection.

TI  - Multi-dimensional parametric coastal flood risk assessment at a regional scale using GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal floods are the most prominent natural disaster causing severe damages to the local communities regarding food security, economy and shelter. Risks can be defined by physiographical sensitivity and vulnerability associated with socio-economic, demographic and infrastructure aspects of the region. Population with poor socio-economic status and high dependence on natural resources for livelihood in coastal dwellings of rural India are extremely vulnerable to flood hazards. Policy formulation to reduce coastal flood risks necessitates quantifying hazard vulnerability at an administrative scale. In this context, we propose a method for evaluating the coastal flood risk of an island located in the habited part of Sundarbans, West Bengal. Extending up to 282 sq. km, Sagar Island has been a keystone in harbouring and supporting both local and migrant population since the 1880s. Land-use classification of the island indicates an increase of 1.7% to 3.6% in the built-up class, almost double in the past eight years (2012-2020). A considerable rise in area under the water bodies is also seen from 6.6 to 8.6%, signifying fair evidence of a coastal breach. Flood risk assessment of Sagar Island was carried out using high spatial resolution data from Indian remote sensing satellites and census data. This assessment was performed by modifying the established MCDA technique considering the data limitations and accounting accessibility to infrastructure as a novel variable to a multi-dimensional framework. The framework maps spatial vulnerability of the region using sub-factors such as socio-demographic, economic, infrastructure and accessibility. The exposure profile of the area is drawn with the help of topographic factors and classified land-use results. Literature evidence was used to develop classification rules for data standardization from very high to very low based on their flood sensitivity. Further, the factors and sub-factors were ranked using AHP by a panel of experts belonging to diverse fields such as disaster management, regional planning, environment, hydrology and social science. The weighted sum technique was used to quantify total vulnerability and exposure parameters, respectively. The total risk map generated is the product of the hazard and vulnerability map of the region. The findings reveal the dominance of economic and accessibility parameters in defining the vulnerability of the regional population towards coastal flood risks. Proximity to coastline and tidal creeks enhances disaster sensitivity due to frequent inundation, erosion, saltwater intrusion and complete submergence of land area. Water bodies engulfing the coastline emerge as a serious threat to sustenance given the present rate of submergence of about 6 m/year. The research highlights the pressing need for grassroots development through social and economic upliftment. It also advocates the undeniable need for proactive adaptation such as flood resilient housing and coastline protection by stabilizing sandbars and planting/nurturing/maintaining native species (mangroves).

TI  - Field surveys can improve predictions of habitat suitability for reintroductions: a swift fox case study
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Reintroductions are challenging, and success rates are low despite extensive planning and considerable investment of resources. Improving predictive models for reintroduction planning is critical for achieving successful outcomes. The IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations recommend that habitat suitability assessments account for abiotic and biotic factors specific to the species to be reintroduced and, where needed, include habitat quality variables. However, habitat assessments are often based on remotely-sensed or existing geographical data that do not always reliably represent habitat quality variables. We tested the contribution of ground-based habitat quality metrics to habitat suitability models using a case study of the swift fox Vulpes velox, a mesocarnivore species for which a reintroduction is planned. Field surveys for habitat quality included collection of data on the main threat to the swift fox (the coyote Canis latrans), and for swift fox prey species. Our findings demonstrated that the inclusion of habitat quality variables derived from field surveys yielded better fitted models and a 16% increase in estimates of suitable habitat. Models including field survey data and models based only on interpolated geographical and remotely-sensed data had little overlap (38%), demonstrating the significant impact that different models can have in determining appropriate locations for a reintroduction. We advocate that ground-based habitat metrics be included in habitat suitability assessments for reintroductions of mesocarnivores.

TI  - Indoor temperature variability in the Sahel: a pilot study in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Very little research has documented the exposure of populations in Africa to extreme heat. We measured indoor air temperature and humidity hourly for 13 months in seven houses of contrasted architecture and construction materials all in the northern neighbourhoods of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. These measurements are compared to air temperatures recorded at the synoptic weather station of Ouagadougou airport and to land surface temperature estimates from Landsat satellite images at seven dates with clear-sky conditions. The results reveal huge temperature differences (exceeding 10 degrees C) between houses, especially in the afternoon hours of the warmest season. Indoor temperature is also much more variable than land surface (outdoor) temperature in the same locations, as estimated by satellite imagery. Houses with greater thermal inertia smooth the afternoon temperature peak, reducing heat exposure. Heat stress bioindicators reveal that danger thresholds, while rarely reached in some houses, are frequently exceeded in others year round except for the core of the cold winter season (December and January). In spring, the hottest season, the danger threshold is almost permanently exceeded in these dwellings, exposing their inhabitants to significant heat stress. This pilot study shows the primary role of housing in modulating indoor temperature, raising questions of public health and habitability of Sahelian regions in a warming world. This issue will be of increasing importance with ongoing climate change, hence the need for further, more detailed instrumented campaigns in African settlements.

TI  - Beyond the boundaries: Do spatio-temporal trajectories of land-use change and cross boundary effects shape the diversity of woody species in Uruguayan native forests?
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental management often lacks a harmonization across scales and beyond boundaries of the land with changed use. As an example, extensive areas of Uruguayan grassland have been transformed into crop and timber plantations in the past decades, but little is known about the possible impacts of these changes on neighboring native forests. We explore how the diversity of native forests differs in relation to land-use change trajectories, from grassland to monocultures, in the surrounding landscapes. We recorded woody species in 32 different native forest plots in Uruguay. Using Landsat images, we created land-use maps in a buffer of 3 km around each plot for the years 1986/1987, 1996/1997, 2006/2007 and 2016/2017. We calculated trajectories of changes regarding the percentage of cover per land use, the landscape shape and aggregation index for native forests, grassland, timber plantations and crops. Trajectories were explored based on the slope of the generalized linear model correlated with woody species composition. Landscape covered by native forests, timber plantations and crops increased whereas grassland cover decreased. Large and interconnected native forests in a landscape dominated by grasslands harbor a high diversity of woody species. Disaggregation of grassland resulted in a decrease in richness and diversity of woody species. The history of surrounding landscape determines diversity of native forests. We observed cross boundary effects of neighboring land uses on native forests. These effects have to be considered in all measures of environmental management to reduce the trade-offs between biodiversity con-servation and economic profit. Nevertheless, other parameter such as climate and soil interplay, override and alter the effects of land use history and management.

TI  - Assessment of the impact of aquaculture facilities on transplanted mussels<i> (Mytilus</i><i> galloprovincialis):</i> Integrating plasticizers and physiological analyses as a biomonitoring strategy
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing plastic production and its continuous use is a significant problem. In addition, aquaculture practices have experienced a considerable growth and plastic is widely used in these activities, hence plasticizers must be considered due to their potential ecotoxicological impacts on species. Mussels placed inside an Integrated MultiTrophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system and at two control locations were employed to quantify the ingestion of anthropogenic particles and associated chemical plasticizers, such as bisphenol A (BPA) jointly to bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), and phthalates represented by diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). In addition, some metabolism and oxidative stress related parameters were measured in mussels' whole soft tissue. Anthropogenic particle ingestion of mussels increased over time at the three locations and the following order of abundance of pollutants was observed: BPA> BPF> DEHP> DBP> BPS> DEP. Even though no differences according to location were found for pollutants' occurrence, time trends were evidenced for BPA and DEHP. On the other hand, a location effect was observed for biomarkers with highest values detected in mussels located at the vicinities of the aquaculture facility. In addition, a reduced detoxification activity was observed over time parallel to BPA decrease.

TI  - Worlds Apart? Atheist, Agnostic, and Humanist Worldviews in Three European Countries
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Secular worldviews are widespread and growing. What are the differences between secular self-identifications? This study examined if self-identified atheists, agnostics, and humanists differed systematically with regard to worldview dimensions. Cultural and gender effects were examined as secondary study objectives. A total of 1,814 nonreligious individuals from Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands completed questionnaires measuring degrees of atheism, agnosticism, humanism, personal responsibility, scientism, economic materialism, skepticism, dogmatism, existential search, and concealment and disclosure of convictions. As expected, self-identified atheists, agnostics, and humanists differed substantially in their worldview positions and communication. Across all three countries, atheists endorsed atheism to a very high degree. Compared to agnostics and humanists, they were more convinced of scientism and less of skepticism. Agnostics scored highest in agnosticism and skepticism and lowest in dogmatism. Humanists mostly held distinguishable middle positions between atheists and agnostics. Analyses of cultural differences supported the hypothesis that more religious contexts give rise to secular countermovements: In (more religious/less secular) Austria and Germany, atheism, scientism, personal responsibility, and disclosure were more pronounced than in the (secular) Netherlands, where agnosticism and skepticism were more prevalent. Regarding gender, men scored higher on atheism and scientism, and women on skepticism. The findings suggest a continuum from decided to open secularity, two clearly distinct positions. Decided (atheist, scientist, disclosing) secularity was more common among self-identified atheists, men, and in more religious contexts. Open (agnostic, skeptic) secularity was more prominent among self-identified agnostics, women, and in the more secular culture. Self-identified humanists occupied a middle position.

TI  - Is it Possible to Predict Non Sentinel Node Positivity on the Basis of mRNA Copy Numbers of CK19 Receptor in Breast Cancer?
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - In operable breast cancer One step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) provides intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) by assaying the mRNA copy numbers of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) receptor. If the OSNA shows macromets patients go on to have axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Several nomograms have been developed using m RNA copy numbers alone or in combination to predict in which patients the NSLN would be positive. In low risk patients ALDN can be avoided. Our study was designed to establish is there is any correlation between m RNA copy numbers and the likelihood of positive NSLN. Of the 1159 patients who had sentinel lymph node biopsy 120 underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Of the patients who had ALND 69 (57%) had positive NSLNs and 51 (43%) patients had negative non sentinel lymph nodes. The mean mRNA copy numbers respectively for the 2 groups are 609,855 and 853,665. The difference is not statistically significant. The area under curve for both the groups was similar establishing that m RNA copy numbers alone cannot be used as a discriminator in predicting the likelihood of positive NSLN.Aims: To determine if there is any correlation between the number of positive non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLN) and the mRNA copy numbers of cytokeratin 19 receptor on one step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Methods: An 8-year retrospective study of consecutive patients who had primary surgery and sentinel node biopsy for breast cancer from January 2011 to December 2018 was carried out. All these patients had intraoperative analysis of sentinel lymph nodes by OSNA. Patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant endocrine therapy were excluded. Results: There were 1159 patients with an age range of 24 to 90 years and a mean age of 63 years in this study. A total of 1324 SLNs were analyzed by OSNA. Macrometastasis was found in 120 patients and they underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). A total of 2405 NSLNs were analyzed. Of the patients who had ALND, 51 (43%) patients had negative NSLNs and 69 (57%) had positive NSLNs. The mean mRNA copy numbers respectively for the 2 groups were 853,665 and 609,855. The difference between the means is not statistically significant (P = 0.82). Also the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve of the total CK-19 mRNA copy number for both groups-negative and positive NSLN were almost identical (Figure 3) indicating mRNA copy numbers cannot be used to discriminate between positive and negative non-sentinel lymph nodes. Conclusion: It is clear from our study that in patients who have ALND due to macromets on OSNA, there is no correlation between the total tumor load as represented by mRNA copy numbers and the likelihood of positive non-sentinel lymph nodes. We therefore cannot rely solely on the mRNA copy numbers to decide on ALND.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores an optimal combination of certain selected image fusion and image classification techniques for improvement in classification accuracy. For this purpose, Sentinel-1A SAR and Sentinel-2A multispectral (MS) data have been obtained. Four fusion techniques Brovey Transform, Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV), PCA, and Gram-Schmidt (GS) Transform, have been compared along with two classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) have been explored. Improvement in five classes Urban, Water, Baresoil, Forest and Vegetation Agricultural has been analysed. The result indicates that the GS-ML combination (87.56%) gives superior classification accuracy than the GS-SVM combination (84.35%). In contrast, PCA in combination with SVM (82.62%) provides superior accuracy compared to the combination of PCA-ML (82.56%).

TI  - Top-of-Atmosphere Clear-Sky Albedo Estimation Over Ocean: Preliminary Framework for MODIS
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo is a significant factor of earth energy budget, climate change, and environmental change. As tremendous regional and global changes are happening over ocean, more details are needed to monitor the ocean environment. However, there were still no high-spatial resolution TOA albedo products over ocean. In this study, a new algorithm for clear-sky TOA albedo estimation over ocean was proposed, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Instead of building angular distribution models, direct retrieval models between TOA reflectance and TOA albedo were developed based on extensive radiative transfer (RT) simulations, covering thousands of ocean and atmosphere types. Three-component ocean water albedo model was involved to take account for the ocean surface anisotropy at different wind speed, wind direction, and chlorophyll concentration, while Modtran 5 was utilized to simulate different atmospheric conditions. Our results showed good agreement with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) based on a global comparison on August 4, 2011, with RMSE = 0.015 and bias = 0.002. And our MODIS-based products provide more spatial details due to higher spatial resolution (1 km), which will be a good data source for regional environmental and climatic research and will also enhance the understanding of Earth's radiation budget.

TI  - Impact of different urban canopy models on air quality simulation in Chengdu, southwestern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban air pollution has emerged as a prominent public health concern in megacities and highly developed city clusters. Accurate modelling of urban air quality over complex terrain is challenging due to heterogeneous urban landscapes and multiscale land-atmosphere interactions. In this study, we investigated the applicability of urban canopy models in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model and assessed the impacts of implementing these models on the urban air quality simulation in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model over the megacity Chengdu, southwestern China. The land use and land cover of Chengdu were updated in WRF by using the land-use products in 2017 from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Sensitivity experiments with various urban canopy models were conducted to investigate the feasibility of different urban canopy models on WRF-CMAQ simulations. We found that the SLAB model significantly underestimates NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations, with mean fractional bias in winter (summer) reaching 52.93% (-50.34%) and -102.82% (-23.12%), respectively. Such large biases are mainly attributed to overpredicted wind speeds resulting from the flat structure in the SLAB model. In contrast, the BEM (a multilayer urban canopy model coupled with air-conditioning systems) model yields the best model performance in both winter and summer, with mean fractional errors of 33.15% (38.96%) and 34.10% (33.15%) for NO2 and PM2.5 in winter (summer), respectively. The UCM (a single-layer urban canopy model) model illustrates good performance in summer, with MFBs of 25.61% for NO2 and 19.03% for PM2.5, while NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations are overestimated in winter, with MFBs of 62.58% and 38.19%, respectively. In contrast, BEP (a multilevel urban canopy model)modelled NO2 (MFB: 37.18%) and PM2.5 (MFB: 18.72%) correlate well with observations in winter, while significantly overestimated air pollutant concentrations in summer with MFBs of NO2 and PM2.5 of 49.70% and 44.50%, respectively. In general, the BEP model and the BEM model are well suited for air quality simulations over Chengdu in winter, and the BEM model could be considered for air quality simulations in summer. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of extensive usage of air conditioning systems in Chengdu during summertime, and the results suggest that using air conditioning systems facilitates the dispersion of air pollutants over Chengdu. This study pinpoints the limitations of default WRF configurations and tests the applicability of urban canopy models in the WRF-CMAQ model over Chengdu, in addition highlighting the crucial role of urban canopy models in urban meteorological-air quality simulations.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion characteristic and driving factor analysis of wetland evapotranspiration in the Sanmenxia Reservoir area, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration in the hydrologic cycle realizes the energy and water transport in the atmosphere. Evapotranspiration differences concerning land-use types provide data for studying the evapotranspiration of river basins. To investigate the evapotranspiration in the reservoir under artificial regulation, we selected the river basin in the Sanmenxia Reservoir as the study area. Data sources are two-period Landsat8 OIL_TIRS remote sensing images during the growing season of wetland plants. Based on meteorological data in this river basin, we investigated the evapotranspiration differences of different land-use types using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model. The FAO Penman-Monteith formula verified the remote sensing inversion results. Analysis shows that significant differences were manifested between wetland and non-wetland landscapes in evapotranspiration among different land-use types. Non-wetland landscapes accounted for about 97.23% of the river basin's total area, but their daily average evapotranspiration was only 7.26 mm/d. Those of wetland landscapes were 2.77% and 12.17 mm/d. In this river basin, the differences between the wetland and non-wetland landscapes in evapotranspiration are mainly associated with plant diversity, vegetation coverage and surface temperature (beyond other driving factors like meteorological and hydrological solar radiation factors).

TI  - Urban development trend analysis and spatial simulation based on time series remote sensing data: A case study of Jinan, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncontrolled urban growth detracts from healthy urban development. Understanding urban development trends and predicting future urban spatial states is of great practical significance. In order to comprehensively analyze urbanization and its effect on vegetation cover, we extracted urban development trends from time series DMSP/OLS NTL and NDVI data from 2000 to 2015, using a linear model fitting method. Six urban development trend types were identified by clustering the linear model parameters. The identified trend types were found to accurately reflect the on-ground conditions and changes in the Jinan area. For example, a high-density, stable urban type was found in the city center while a stable dense vegetation type was found in the mountains to the south. The SLEUTH model was used for urban growth simulation under three scenarios built on the urban development analysis results. The simulation results project a gentle urban growth trend from 2015 to 2030, demonstrating the prospects for urban growth from the perspective of environmental protection and conservative urban development.

TI  - Mining High-Resolution KH-9 Panoramic Imagery to Determine Earthquake Deformation: Methods and Applications
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake deformation is crucial for understanding fault kinematics. Modern earthquakes (moment magnitude $M_{w} >= 6$ ) have been well documented by geodetic techniques, such as radar interferometry and image correlation with unprecedented accuracy. Nonetheless, many large ( $M_{w} >= 7$ ) historical earthquakes remain unexplored due to a lack of preearthquake data. In this article, we provide the first study of using Hexagon KeyHole-9 (KH-9) panoramic imagery to investigate historical earthquakes. We propose patch-based orthorectification and test the method from analog experiments with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photographs. Using the 2013 $M_{w}$ 7.7 Balochistan as a case example, we demonstrate that KH-9 images can be used to retrieve meter-scale horizontal deformation. The displacements, derived from correlating KH-9 (preearthquake) and Sentinel-2 (postearthquake) images, are comparable with published studies. Applying the method to the 1981 $M_{w}$ 7.1 Sirch earthquake, we succeed to measure NS strike-slip motion (up to 5.9 +/- 1.6 m) along the 1981 rupture and find that most of the accumulated strain energy may be released by motion along a 25-km-long segment of the Gowk fault. The southward propagation of the rupture may be prevented by the earlier $M_{w}$ 6.6 Golbaf earthquake that released most of the accumulated strain in the south. The rapid decay of slip in the north seems to be associated with a 3-km-long, 1-km-wide step-over, which may have dissipated a large fraction of seismic energy. The KH-9 panoramic images show great potential for determining horizontal deformation, providing useful information about historical earthquakes that occurred before the era of modern geodesy.

TI  - Relationship between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and aerosol optical depth in the Arctic region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the direct and indirect effects of aerosols on climate, it is important to know the spatial and temporal variations in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. Although many types of CCN measurements are available, extensive CCN measurements are challenging because of the complexity and high operating cost, especially in remote areas. As aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be readily observed by remote sensing, many attempts have been made to estimate CCN concentrations from AOD. In this study, the CCN-AOD relationship is parameterized based on CCN ground measurements from the Zeppelin Observatory (78.91 degrees N, 11.89 degrees E, 474 m asl) in the Arctic region. The AOD measurements were obtained from the Ny-Alesund site (78.923 degrees N, 11.928 degrees E) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 reanalysis. Our results show a CCN-AOD correlation with a coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.59. Three additional estimation models for CCN were presented based on the following data: (i) in situ aerosol chemical composition, (ii) in situ aerosol optical properties, and (iii) chemical composition of AOD obtained from reanalysis data. The results from the model using in situ aerosol optical properties reproduced the observed CCN concentration most efficiently, suggesting that the contribution of BC to CCN concentration should be considered along with that of sulfate.

TI  - A Sub-Christian Epistle? Appreciating 2 Peter as an Anti-Sophistic Polemic
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing from recent ancient historical, New Testament and Second-Sophistic scholarship, this article proposes that the enigmatic 2 Peter can be better understood with closer reference to anti-sophistic polemical writings. Increasing light has been shed on the sophists' interest in wisdom, display and rhetoric in contexts such as Athens, Rome, Corinth and cities of Asia Minor in the first centuries CE. After introducing historical attempts to identify a worldview compatible with 2 Peter's polemical response, this article (1) describes the nature of the Second Sophistic in the first century with reference to two contemporary anti-sophistic polemicists, Epictetus the Stoic and Philo the Jew, (2) highlights features of 2 Peter which resonate with contemporaneous anti-sophistic writings, beginning with 2 Pet. 1.16-21 and (3) observes the way in which the Ante-Nicene Fathers, when seeking to discredit later sophistic opposition, drew heavily from 2 Pet. 2-3. It may outrun the evidence to conclude that 2 Peter's opponents were professional sigma omicron phi iota sigma tau alpha iota left-to-right mark per se. It can be affirmed, however, that 2 Peter bears significant resemblance with first- and second-century anti-sophistic polemic and may be best understood with reference to it.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS-derived estimates of the albedo over the Atacama Desert using ground-based spectral measurements
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is an important forcing parameter that drives the radiative energy budget as it determines the fraction of the downwelling solar irradiance that the surface reflects. Here we report on ground-based measurements of the spectral albedo (350-2200 nm) carried out at 20 sites across a North-South transect of approximately 1300 km in the Atacama Desert, from latitude 18 degrees S to latitude 30 degrees S. These spectral measurements were used to evaluate remote sensing estimates of the albedo derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We found that the relative mean bias error (RMBE) of MODIS-derived estimates was within +/- 5% of ground-based measurements in most of the Atacama Desert (18-27 degrees S). Although the correlation between MODIS-derived estimates and ground-based measurements remained relatively high (R= 0.94), RMBE values were slightly larger in the southernmost part of the desert (27-30 degrees S). Both MODIS-derived data and ground-based measurements show that the albedo at some bright spots in the Atacama Desert may be high enough (up to 0.25 in visible range) for considerably boosting the performance of bifacial photovoltaic technologies (6-12%).

TI  - Revisiting bathymetry dynamics in Lake Urmia using extensive field data and high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric mapping for an accurate estimation of stored water volume in drying lakes is a key information for an effective monitoring of their recession or restoration status. Extraction of bathymetry in shallow saline lakes using remote sensing techniques has always been challenging due to the complex influences imposed by the physical properties of substrate and the spatial variability of salinity. In this study, we developed a machine learning-based model to quantify the implicit, non-linear relationship between water depth and surface reflectance by leveraging extensive in-situ data and high-resolution satellite imagery. We trained and tested the learning model in the hyper-saline Lake Urmia (LU), which faced catastrophic drying over the past two decades. To this end, we used Landsat-8 imagery and 32,984 hydmgraphy data points surveyed by the Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) from 2017 to 2020 during six stages. To enhance the model accuracy, we tuned the model inputs by optimizing the spectral information and clustering in-situ data from stages with similar meteorological conditions into three classes. The results demonstrated the high accuracy of the developed intelligent model as evidenced by R-2 = 0.8 similar to 0.9 and RMSE = 7.8 similar to 17.9 cm for the three models. We found that the average water depth in the LU was increased from 0.43 m in September 2018 to 2.00 m in May 2020. In particular, the lake water volume in May 2020 was 3.6 times greater than that in February 2019, which marks a remarkable shift in the LU restoration. Dynamic bathymetric maps also witnessed considerable salt dissolution taking place across the lake during this period. Finally, we extracted the LU level-area relationship by processing 172 Landsat images between 1984 and 2020, which was validated against the field data surveyed along the lake water boundary in 2019. The results indicated that the level-area relationship follows a dual linear relationship separated at the water level of 1271.31 m.

TI  - Analysis of the impact of the South-to-North water diversion project on water balance and land subsidence in Beijing, China between 2007 and 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - After operating the middle route of South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), the total water transfer to Beijing has exceeded 5.0 km(3), bringing significant changes to the water use structure of Beijing. This article compiles historic data from 2007 to 2020 to analyze changes in water circulation, groundwater level, climate factors and subsidence patterns in Beijing following implementation of the middle SNWDP. It is found that the main current pressure on Beijing's water supply has come from improved living standards, the gradual popularization of water-using appliances, and a rapid development of the accommodation and catering industries. An InSAR time series approach was used to map subsidence in Beijing between 2007 and 2020 using satellite images from Sentinel-1A/B, Radarsat-2 and ALOS-1. Climate factors including precipitation and evapotranspiration were estimated using the Penman-Monteith-Leuning Evapotranspiration V2 (PML_V2) product. By compiling ground subsidence data for Beijing and corresponding climate data, the impact of the SNWDP and climate factors on groundwater levels and ground subsidence in Beijing were examined We identified three periods to characterize the changes of surface displacement after implementation of the SNWDP as a) the pre-effect stage, b) the effective stage, and c) the post-effective stage. The contribution of the SNWDP was apparent at the second stage, alleviating the problem of land subsidence to some extent. The ease of subsidence at different stages are accounted for 4%, 26.5%, and 41.7%, respectively, in terms of the mean velocity changes. Based on the result of some general circulation models. Precipitation in the Beijing region is expected to increase over the next decade, implying a greater likelihood of rapid groundwater recovery. However, although groundwater is expected to recover in the long run, climate extremes in the future could possibly challenge the success of SNWDP during certain dry periods.

TI  - A Machine Learning-Based Regional Hybrid Model for Remote Retrieving Turbidity From Landsat Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity [nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU)] monitoring is of great interest to water quality stakeholders. Traditional monitoring programs are limited in time and space, are expensive, and do not reflect the true extent of NTU. In contrast, remote sensing data are able to model the NTU, to monitor its spatial expansion, and are cost-effective. Models developed are usually a single-based function. This study presents a simple machine learning-based Regional hybrid model (R-HM) for NTU retrieval. The R-HM allows prior recognition of the NTU level concentration (high or low) before estimation. The calibration step highlighted that low and high NTUs are sensitive to different spectral regions, but mainly controlled by the red part. Validation was satisfactory with R-2 = 0.99, although high NTUs tend to be underestimated (BIAS = -14%). Landsat (LS) NTU products derived from R-HM were found to be only sensitive to turbidity, even under conditions of high algal blooms.

TI  - Imiquimod treatment of vulvar melanoma in situ invading the urethra
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary treatment of both in situ and invasive vulvar melanoma is wide local excision of the primary neoplasm. However, this can be a surgical challenge for size, multifocal presentation with proximity to urethra or anus and tendency for local recurrence. The data on adjuvant therapy for vulvar MIS is very limited.A 69-year-old patient with melanoma of the vulva underwent a simple vulvectomy with positive margins in pen-clitoral area, followed by modified radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinofemoral sentinel lymph node dissection with negative margins. She was later diagnosed with MIS of the vulva on different locations and had multiple wide local excisions over several years. One lesion was close to the urethra and a complete excision was difficult. Topical imiquimod x 16 weeks (5% cream) was given. The regimen was augmented from 3 to 5 times weekly. Complete resolution was found at 16 weeks and patient was disease free for 4 years. Recently however, a vaginal melanoma was detected.Imiquimod appeared to be beneficial in the treatment of melanoma in situ of the vulva/vagina when surgical options were not feasible producing local control of disease with the remaining risk for local and distant metastasis. Metastasis can appear years later, therefore long-term follow-up of patients treated with topical imiquimod is needed.

TI  - Prevalence of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in retail fresh meat products from free-range chickens in Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most prevalent zoonotic protozoan parasites worldwide and affects the vast majority of warm-blooded animal species, including humans. Postnatal infection in humans occurs through the ingestion of sporulated T. gondii oocysts or via the oral intake of parasite tissue cysts during the consumption of raw or undercooked meat. In this regard, given their high exposure to oocysts, chickens (Gallus domesticus) raised on the ground constitute a potential source of T. gondii. Material and Methods For the first time in Spain, a survey was undertaken in commercial retail free-range poultry. A total of 50 thighs from different animals were analysed. The samples were homogenised and an acid pepsin digestion procedure was applied prior to molecular analysis. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was isolated from meat by qPCR. Two sets of primers were used for DNA amplification targeting the specific sequence of a 529 bp repeat element and another set of primers was utilised for the surface antigen protein-1 gene. Results DNA extracted from 5 out of 50 tissue samples was positive for both genes by qPCR amplification. Conclusion The 10% prevalence of Toxoplasma infection found in commercial free-range chickens raises public health issues.

TI  - Omission of sentinel node biopsy for breast cancer: Historical context and future perspectives on a modern controversy
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - For older patients with clinically lymph node-negative breast cancer who have estrogen receptor-positive tumors and are treated with tamoxifen, randomized trials comparing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) versus no ALND show that the omission of ALND improves patient quality of life and has no adverse effects on mortality. These results have served to justify sentinel node biopsy (SNB) omission in selected older patients with breast cancer. More recently, clinical trials were launched to assess SNB omission in younger patients, with recurrence and survival as the primary outcomes of interest. Three important considerations serve as the basis for these ongoing trials. First, it is assumed that SNB omission will improve patient quality of life, although, to date, there is no level I evidence to support this assumption. Second, axillary surgery has never been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality, but it does reduce the risk of axillary recurrences, although adjuvant systemic therapy and radiotherapy also reduce these recurrence risks. Finally, nodal status is losing importance as a guide for adjuvant systemic therapy decision making because these decisions are now increasingly predicated on tumor biomarkers and gene profiling, but it is gaining importance for adjuvant radiotherapy decision making. Because quality-of-life considerations are the primary motivation for abandoning SNB, there is a need for randomized trials comparing SNB versus no SNB/no axillary surgery, with quality of life as the primary end point (level I evidence). Moreover, suitable alternatives to guide adjuvant radiotherapy decision making will require validation before SNB omission can be justified for patients of all ages who have clinically node-negative breast cancer. Lay Summary In this review article, the authors provide a brief historical overview of the role of axillary surgery in breast cancer management and discuss additional studies and ramifications that should be considered before abandoning the sentinel node biopsy (SNB) procedure. Specifically, there is a need for level I evidence demonstrating that omission of the SNB procedure will improve patient quality of life and a need to validate suitable alternatives to SNB as a guide for adjuvant radiotherapy decision making.

TI  - Seasonal simulations of summer aerosol optical depth over the Arabian Peninsula using WRF-Chem: Validation, climatology, and variability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the climatology and variability of summer aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Arabian Peninsula (AP) using a long-term high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with the chemistry module (WRF-Chem) simulation, available ground-based and satellite observations, and reanalysis products from 2008 to 2018. The simulated spatial distribution of the summer AOD agrees well with the satellite observations and reanalysis over the AP, with spatial correlation coefficients of 0.81/0.83/0.89 with MODIS-A/MODIS-T/MERRA-2, respectively. Higher values of summertime AOD are broadly found over the eastern AP regions and the southern Red Sea and minima over the northern Red Sea and northwest AP, consistent with observational datasets. The WRF-Chem simulation suggests that the two regions of high AOD are associated with dust advected from the Tigris-Euphrates by the northwesterly summer Shamal wind in the eastern AP and from the African Sahara via Sudan by westerly winds through the Tokar Gap for the southern AP. The high AOD over the south-central east AP is due to locally generated dust by the action of northerly winds, modulated by variations in relative humidity, vertical motion, soil moisture, and soil temperature over the desert regions. The vertical extent of this dust is primarily driven by upward motion triggered by thermal convection over the local source region. In terms of interannual variability, summer AOD exhibits significant year-to-year variations over the AP region. In particular, enhanced (reduced) AOD over the southern AP (Persian Gulf) is observed during La Nina conditions, favoured by stronger (weaker) Tokar westerly (northwesterly summer Shamal) winds.

TI  - Effect of changes in Breslow thickness between the initial punch biopsy results and final pathology reports in acral lentiginous melanoma patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the most common subtype of cutaneous melanoma among Asians; punch biopsy is widely performed for its diagnosis. However, the pathologic parameters evaluated via punch biopsy may not be sufficient for predicting disease prognosis compared to the parameters evaluated via excisional biopsy. We investigated whether changes in Breslow thickness (BT) between initial punch biopsy results and final pathology reports can affect the prognosis of ALM. Pathologic parameters were recorded from specimens acquired through the initial punch biopsy and wide excision. Patients were classified into two groups based on a change in Breslow depth: the BT increased or decreased on comparing the samples from the initial punch biopsy and final wide excision. We compared clinical characteristics, and a Cox regression model was used to identify independent prognostic factors influencing melanoma-specific death (MSD). Changes in BT did not affect MSD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.55, P = 0.447). In multivariate analysis, a higher BT (> 2 mm) (HR: 9.93, P = 0.046) and nodal metastasis (HR: 5.66, P = 0.041) were significantly associated with an increased MSD risk. The use of punch biopsy did not affect MSD despite the inaccuracy of BT measurement as long as ALM was accurately diagnosed.

TI  - A synergic method of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for retrieving soil moisture content in agricultural regions
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques, which provide timely and accurate soil moisture information to improve food production, are becoming increasingly popular among agricultural production in China and many other regions. It also shows its importance in monitoring agricultural basins where the meteorological and topographic con-ditions vary greatly. In this case, the reliability of soil moisture content (SMC) monitoring for theses basins could be promised. The main objective of this paper is to develop a synergic method of radar and optical data, as well as an on-site sampling scheme, to accurately estimate SMC in the basin. The reason is that in the winter wheat production area of Dawen River basin in China, there are few conventional SMC testing equipment. Considering the characteristics of different crops and the conditions of crops in different growth periods, the VV polarization mode of Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images was used to retrieve SMC. Combined with the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extracted from Sentinel-2 MSI optical images and the optimized Water Cloud Model (WCM), the surface backscattering coefficient was obtained by eliminating vegetation moisture content (VMC), and the SMC model was established. The results showed that from March to May in 2020, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the estimated VMC and the field observation was 0.655, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the two was 0.334. In the inversion algorithm model, the R-2 be-tween the retrieved SMC and the field measurement was 0.506, and the RMSE was 3.725.

TI  - Frequency of home visits where general practitioners are exposed to a problem different from that foreseen - a Swiss cross-sectional study
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: When a home visit is considered, patients' suspected health problems are important for correct triage, the decision for or against the visit and allocation of the visit to a general practitioner (GP) or a nurse practitioner. Misjudgment might lead to suboptimal patient outcomes.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of suspected health problems (based on pre-visit assessments) by comparing them with the actual health problems (post-visit assessments) and investigating associated factors.METHODS: GPs of the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network (Sentinella) reported pre-visit and post-visit assessments and patient characteristics for up to 20 consecutive home visits, which they conducted in 2019. Using multivariable logistic regressions, we investigated associations between patient and clinical factors and unconfirmed suspected health problems from pre-visit assessments and unforeseen actual health problems from post-visit assessments.RESULTS: Overall, 114 GP practices participated. The GPs reported 1496 patient visits with a total of 1789 and 1762 health problems from pre-visit and post-visit assessments, respectively, that were included in the analysis. Musculoskeletal and circulatory problems were the most common in patients receiving home visits. The health problems from pre-visit and post-visit assessments were unconfirmed and unforeseen in15% and 13% of the cases, respectively. Older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.1 in 10-year steps; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.0-1.3) and urgent visits (OR 1.7 compared with regular visits; 95% CI 1.1-2.6) showed a trend for more unforeseen health problems.CONCLUSION: When home visits were conducted, about one out of seven health problems from pre-visit and postvisit assessments were unconfirmed and unforeseen. Particularly when patients were older or visits were urgent, there were higher odds of unconfirmed and unforeseen health problems.These results should be considered when triaging patients.

TI  - An Interactive Strategy for the Training Set Definition Based on Active Self-Paced Learning Implemented on a Cloud-Computing Platform
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised classification of remote sensing data requires a large number of high-quality annotated samples. At the operational level, the definition of a large training set by photograph interpretation is costly and time-consuming. The manual annotation activity is typically supported by high-resolution satellite data. Therefore, when working at country or continental scale, it is necessary to efficiently access large archives of remotely sensed data. To address these issues, this letter presents an interactive strategy implemented in a cloud-computing platform for defining effective training sets with significantly reduced human effort. This is achieved by combining active learning (AL) and self-paced learning (SPL) techniques. First, an initial training set is used to classify the pool of unlabeled samples. Then, the method progressively adds high-confidence samples, selected through an SPL strategy, and low-confidence samples selected considering an AL strategy. While the high-confidence sample labels are self-paced, the low-confidence ones are manually assigned. The cloud-computing platform allows the: 1) definition of a complete training set in a fast and efficient way and 2) access to a multipetabyte catalog of satellite imagery. Experiments carried out on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy compared to the standard manual annotation.

TI  - Survival and recurrence with or without axillary dissection in patients with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate overall survival and locoregional recurrence between patients with invasive breast tumours and sentinel node metastasis undergoing sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone and those undergoing complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with invasive breast carcinoma who underwent lumpectomy at a public university hospital in Brazil between 2008 and 2018. We evaluated the overall survival and the locoregional recurrence using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, respectively. Overall, 97 participants who underwent lumpectomy were enroled; 41 in the ALND group, and 56 in the SLND group, according to Z0011 criteria. Only 17% of the patients in the ALND group had an additional biopsy-proven axillary disease, and 83% were treated with complete dissection unnecessarily. The 5-year survival rates were 80.1% and 87.5% for SLND and ALND, respectively (p = 0.376). Locoregional recurrence was rare (1.7% and 7.3% in the SLND and ALND, respectively; p = 0.3075). Overall survival and locoregional recurrence were similar between the two groups. The de-escalation of ALND to SLND in women with metastasis in the sentinel lymph node treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy that meet the Z0011 criteria is feasible even in developing countries.

TI  - Functional traits reveal the dominant drivers of long-term community change across a North American Great Lake
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems worldwide have been impacted by multiple anthropogenic stressors, yet efforts to understand and manage these impacts have been hindered by difficulties in disentangling relative stressor effects. Theoretically, the actions of individual stressors can be delineated based on associated changes in functional traits and these relationships should be generalizable across communities comprised of different species. Thus, combining trait perspectives with community composition data could help to identify the relative influence of different stressors. We evaluated the utility of this combined approach by quantifying shifts in fish species and trait composition in Lake Erie during the past 50 years (1969-2018) in relation to human-driven changes in nutrient inputs, climate warming, and biological invasions. Species and trait shifts were also compared between two Lake Erie basins, which differ in their environmental and biological characteristics, to identify trait responses that were generalizable across different ecosystems versus those that were context dependent. Our analyses revealed consistent species changes across basins, and shifts in feeding and thermal traits, that were primarily associated with altered nutrient inputs (oligotrophication followed by eutrophication). We found no or inconsistent trait-based evidence for the effects of warming and two invasive fishes. Context-dependent trait responses were also evident; nutrient inputs were related to shifts in species tolerant of turbidity in the shallow, eutrophic western basin, which contrasted to shifts between benthopelagic and benthic species in the deeper central basin. Our results reveal the dominant effects of specific stressors on a large freshwater lake and offer a framework for combining species-based and trait-based approaches to delineate the impacts of simultaneous stressors on communities of perturbed natural ecosystems.

TI  - An operational tool to detect non-native invasive grasses: Assessing temporal transferability and bias in fires to optimize performance for land management
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-native invasive grasses have spread rapidly across the American West in recent years, significantly changing the ecology of the landscape by increasing fire frequency and degrading wildlife habitat. To meet the need for national forests in California to monitor the spread of these grasses into shrub-dominated ecosystems, we developed an operational tool that produces maps of herbaceous cover on a biennial basis at 30 m scale for southern California. Because the tool is planned for deployment for the remainder of the state, we present a rigorous analysis of temporal and spatial transferability of the model to demonstrate its suitability as a broad scale technical application. Beta regression and random forest models were tested using Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imagery, including a variety of vegetation indices and spectral bands, as well as a predictor representing the time elapsed since the most recent fire. Comparing models created in six different years for which high resolution training data were available, we found that a random forest model trained using 2009 data performed better than models trained in other years in terms of variance explained by predictors (70% variance explained), inter annual temporal transferability, cross-validation predictions for withheld data (root mean square error = 4.14), and minimal bias in burned v. unburned areas. Predictors in the final model included the maximum spring value for red-green angle (RGA), mean summer RGA, and standard deviation in the spring for the normalized burn ratio (NBR); these predictors leverage the distinct phenology of annual grasses as compared to evergreen shrubs that dominate the study area. Feasibility considerations for maintenance of an operational tool were an important component of model development, and we discuss 1) leveraging data processing capabilities using Google Earth Engine, 2) a cost-benefit comparison of model re-training for future years, and 3) an assessment of training methods that relied primarily on imagery-based assessments, while reserving field visitation for targeted assessments when conditions warrant further validation. Model outputs predicted to the full raster scale indicated non-native invasive grass spread has occurred at a moderate level over the last decade, with increases in cover observed mainly in burned areas, but with expansion and density likely suppressed by recent drought.

TI  - From dispositions to positionality: Addressing dispositions of the student researcher in the ACRL framework
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - The treatment of dispositions in the ACRL framework has had little attention, for example, the ACRL document barely unpacks its meaning and pedagogy related to dispositions and learning. It is important to explore how to teach and address dispositions to acknowledge that students and researchers design and conduct research through a lens informed by their worldview. Teaching students and researchers about researcher positionality can prompt questions and reflection on one's bias and views that may influence how research is designed, and interpreted. The goals of this paper are to (a) identify the relation between disposition and positionality (b) provide an overview of positionality from different fields that highlight its use in teaching dispositions (c) identify a praxis that address positionality when teaching IL practices.

TI  - Fully Automated Classification Method for Crops Based on Spatiotemporal Deep-Learning Fusion Technology
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop mapping is essential for agricultural applications, and deep-learning methods have been applied on a range of remotely sensed data sources to classify crops. In this article, we develop a novel crop classification method based on spatiotemporal deep-learning fusion technology. However, for crop mapping, the selection and labeling of training samples is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, we propose a fully automated training-sample-selection method. First, we design the method according to image processing algorithms and the concept of a sliding window. Second, we develop the Geo-3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and Geo-Conv1D for crop classification using time-series Sentinel-2 imagery. Specifically, we integrate geographic information of crops into the structure of deep-learning networks. Finally, we apply an active learning strategy to integrate the classification advantages of Geo-3D CNN and Geo-Conv1D. Experiments conducted in Northeast China show that the proposed sampling method can reliably provide and label a large number of samples and achieve satisfactory results for different deep-learning networks. Based on the automatic selection and labeling of training samples, the crop classification method based on spatiotemporal deep-learning fusion technology can achieve the highest overall accuracy (OA) with approximately 92.50% as compared with Geo-Conv1D (91.89%) and Geo-3D CNN (91.27%) in the three study areas, indicating that the proposed method is effective and efficient in multi-temporal crop classification.

TI  - [Analysis on the imported Coronavirus Disease 2019 related cluster epidemic in rural areas of Chengdu].
T2  - Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - An epidemiological investigation was carried out on a local cluster of outbreak caused by imported cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in rural areas of Chengdu in December 2020, to find out the source of infection and the chain of transmission. According to Prevention and Control Protocol for COVID-19 (Version 7), field epidemiological investigation was adopted, combined with big data technology, video image investigation, gene sequencing and other methods to carry out investigation into COVID-19 cases and infections source tracing, analyze the epidemiological association, and map the chain of transmission. From December 7 to 17, 2020, 13 local COVID-19 confirmed cases and 1 asymptomatic case were diagnosed in Chengdu, of which 12 cases (85.71%) had a history of residence and activity in the village courtyard of Taiping (TP), Pidu (P) District, Chengdu. From November 8, 2020 to November 28, 2020, a group of inbound people form Nepal were transferred to the designated entry personnel quarantine hotel of P District which was adjacent to the TP village. During quarantine, there were 5 cases who tested positive for COVID-19. Through gene sequencing alignment, genes of local cases and Nepalese imported cases from the same period are homologous, all belong to the lineage of L2.2.3 (B.1.36 according to Pangolin lineage typing method). According to the results of field epidemiological investigation and gene sequencing analysis, the index case was most likely infected by contact with household waste of quarantine site. Under the situation of normalization prevention and control of COVID-19, sentinel monitoring of fever clinics in primary medical institutions is the key to early detection of the epidemic. The multi-department joint epidemiological investigation and the application of gene technology are the core links of the investigation and traceability of modern infectious diseases. The allocation of public health resources in rural areas needs to be strengthened. We need to improve the capacity for early surveillance and early warning of the epidemic in rural areas.
AB  - 对2020年12月成都市农村地区一起由境外输入新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）病例引发的本土聚集性疫情开展流行病学调查分析，查明感染来源和病例传播链。按照《新型冠状病毒肺炎防控方案（第七版）》要求，采用现场流行病学调查方法，结合大数据技术、视频图像调查、基因测序等方法开展新型冠状病毒（SARS-CoV-2）感染病例调查及传染源追踪溯源，分析其流行病学关联并绘制传播链。2020年12月717日成都市共确诊COVID-19本土病例13例，无症状感染者1例，其中12例（85.71%）有成都市郫都区太平（P区TP村）村院落的居住及活动史。P区TP村毗邻辖区指定的入境人员隔离酒店，该酒店11月828日入住了一批尼泊尔入境人员，且在隔离期间有5例隔离者陆续被检出SARS-CoV-2核酸阳性。通过基因测序比对，本土病例与同期尼泊尔输入病例同源，为L2.2.3分支（Pangolin分型为B.1.36），结合流行病学调查溯源线索，本土指示病例可能是由于接触隔离点生活垃圾而致感染。综上，COVID-19疫情常态化防控形势下，入境人员隔离点生活垃圾的规范管理是预防发生本土关联病例的关键环节，而基层医疗机构发热门诊哨点监测是疫情早发现关键，多部门联合流行病学调查以及基因技术的运用是现代传染病疫情调查溯源的核心环节，各地亟需加强隔离酒店管理，降低发生本土关联病例风险，同时加强农村地区公共卫生资源配置，提高农村地区疫情早期监测预警能力。.

TI  - Assessment and Error Analysis of Satellite Soil Moisture Products Over the Third Pole
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau, known as the ``Third Pole'' of the world, is extremely sensitive to global climate change. Reliable soil moisture information is essential for understanding the impact of the Tibetan Plateau on the Asian monsoon. The study assessed a total of four satellite soil moisture products, namely the SMAP-SCA (V7), ESA CCI (V0.52), AMSR2 LPRM (V001), and FY-3C (V1) over the Tibetan Plateau using three densely-instrumented soil moisture networks (i.e., Maqu, Naqu, and Pali). Moreover, the possible error sources of these products were thoroughly investigated over the Tibetan Plateau, which had not yet been fully explored in previous studies. The results reveal the ESA CCI (V0.52) and SMAP-SCA (V7) generally perform better in the three networks with higher correlation coefficient (R) and lower standard deviation of the difference (STDD) compared to other products. The bias of ESA CCI (V0.52) is demonstrated to be dependent on the GLDAS Noah soil moisture, but it correlates much better with soil moisture measurements and also displays lower STDD value than the GLDAS Noah. SMAP brightness temperatures demonstrate much higher sensitivity to soil moisture than the AMSR2 C-band and FY-3C X-band measurements regardless of vegetation, surface roughness, and land cover heterogeneity. The auxiliary surface temperature used in SMAP-SCA (V7) also performs better than that used in AMSR2 LPRM (V001) and FY-3C (V1) though it is slightly colder than the ground measurements. These factors contribute to the better performance of SMAP-SCA (V7) soil moisture product compared to other satellite datasets. The AMSR2 LPRM (V001) product produces evidently larger absolute values than ground observations, but it can track the temporal trend of soil moisture in sparsely vegetated areas (Naqu and Pali). The FY-3C (V1) product exhibits some abnormal saturation values in Maqu with the highest vegetation biomass, while it performs better in Naqu and Pali with relatively lower vegetation coverage. The surface temperature derived from AMSR2 LPRM and FY-3C shows large uncertainties over the Tibetan Plateau which may be caused by the limited data used to calibrate the empirical surface temperature models.

TI  - Detecting urban markets with satellite imagery: An application to India
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a methodology for defining urban markets based on builtup landcover classified from daytime satellite imagery. Compared to markets defined using minimum thresholds for nighttime light intensity, daytime imagery identify an order of magnitude more markets, capture more of India's urban population, are more realistically jagged in shape, and reveal more variation in the spatial distribution of economic activity. We conclude that daytime satellite data are a promising source for the study of urban forms.

TI  - Spatio-temporal surface temperature variations detected by satellite thermal infrared images at Merapi volcano, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Merapi volcano is located in central Java and is the most active volcano in Indonesia. Many thousands live on the volcano's flanks which itself is 28 km (17 mi) north of Yogyakarta and its 2.4 million inhabitants. Given this population at risk, and a history of 73 recorded eruptions in the past 500 years, the hazards posed by Merapi are worthy of study. Merapi is monitored by networks of on-site seismology, deformation, and gas emission instruments and, like all volcanoes globally, is also routinely observed by satellite remote sensors. Here, we conduct a temporal and spatial time series analysis of land surface temperature (LST) observations of Merapi, as derived from MODIS (1 km spatial resolution), ASTER (90 m) and Landsat (30 m) thermal infrared imagery. The time series derived from MODIS is decomposed with the Seasonal Trend Decomposition using a Loess (STL) technique and this reveals thermal anomaly peaks caused by the eruptions and a subtle rising tendency in LST since the launch of MODIS in 2000. ASTER surface temperature time series is used for the cross validation of the MODIS LST time series and again, demonstrates thermal anomaly peaks and a longer term upward trend. For a detailed delineation of thermal features at Merapi, the 30 m pixel Landsat thermal imagery derived brightness temperature (BT) distribution during the period from 1988 to 2019 is presented. Finally, change detections (i.e., pixel-by pixel comparison) of BT distribution from 1988 to 2019 are performed to inspect the spatial temperature variations of Merapi volcano. Positive thermal anomaly areas are identified and these correspond to local heat sources revealed by seismic imaging and resistivity tomography. In summary, the satellite remote sensing approach provides insights into thermal features at a higher spatial and temporal scale than has been conducted in the past and these observations complement ongoing ground-based measurements. The results of this study will feed into both an enhanced understanding of Merapi's thermally anomalous subsurface structures and facilitation of volcano monitoring and hazard assessment.

TI  - <i>Ziyuan</i>: Film mining and cinephilic expedition and exploitation in twenty-first century China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHINESE CINEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay studies the Chinese spectators' active releasing, searching for, and illicit sharing of imported, voluntarily subtitled, and secretly stored foreign films and videos by offering an etymological study of ziyuan (literally translated to English as'resource'), the most pervasively used term inthe lexicon of contemporary Chinese cinephilia. Delineating the semantic shift of ziyuan from a concept of computer networking to a film and media idiom, I examines how the discursive practice of calling a digitalized film or video 'ziyuan' and the corresponding metadata model of representing a video by its digital identification and location information provide the mechanism both for locating and retrieving films as digital files from the Internet and for hiding them away from clear recognition and immediate access. As the neologism replacing daoban, the Chinese equivalent of 'piracy; ziyuan as the popular argot, I argue, rehabilitates Chinese cinephilia thriving on piracy by metaphorically reconceptualizing the global Internet as a vast reservoir and the Internet-based media files as untapped natural resources with potential use value. The common use of this term thus mounts a collective resistance to both the unequal global capitalist order and the party-state intervention in the media market by symbolically exonerating participators and beneficiaries of making, disseminating, downloading, or streaming unauthorized films of any blame or criminal charges.

TI  - Development of a novel nomogram-based online tool to predict axillary status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cN plus breast cancer: A multicentre study on 1,950 patients
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Type of axillary surgery in breast cancer (BC) patients who convert from cN + to ycN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is still debated. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a preoperative predictive nomogram to select those patients with a low risk of residual axillary disease after NAC, in whom axillary surgery could be minimized. Patients and methods: 1950 clinically node-positive BC patients from 11 Breast Units, treated by NAC and subsequent surgery, were included from 2005 to 2020. Patients were divided in two groups: those who achieved nodal pCR vs. those with residual nodal disease after NAC. The cohort was divided into training and validation set with a geographic separation criterion. The outcome was to identify independent predictors of axillary pathologic complete response (pCR). Results: Independent predictive factors associated to nodal pCR were axillary clinical complete response (cCR) after NAC (OR 3.11, p < 0.0001), ER-/HER2+ (OR 3.26, p < 0.0001) or ER+/HER2+ (OR 2.26, p = 0.0002) or ER-/HER2-(OR 1.89, p = 0.009) BC, breast cCR (OR 2.48, p < 0.0001), Ki67 > 14% (OR 0.52, p = 0.0005), and tumor grading G2 (OR 0.35, p = 0.002) or G3 (OR 0.29, p = 0.0003). The nomogram showed a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 73% (AUC 0.77, 95%CI 0.75-0.80). After external validation the accuracy of the nomogram was confirmed. Conclusion: The accuracy makes this freely-available, nomogram-based online tool useful to predict nodal pCR after NAC, translating the concept of tailored axillary surgery also in this setting of patients.

TI  - Principal component analysis and biophysical parameters in the assessment of soil salinity in the irrigated perimeter of Bahia, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is an environmental concern which can lead to land desertification. It is a common problem in the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil and its impacts extend from the environment to the economy. The objective of this study was to evaluate soil salinity in the dry period in an agricultural area of irrigated Manicoba perimeter, in Juazeiro, State of Bahia, Brazil. The study was carried out in an agricultural area of the irrigated perimeter in Juazeiro of Bahia, Brazil, where 98 disturbed soil samples were collected in different areas, being 33 samples to obtain Electrical Conductivity (EC) (dS m-1) and regression models, and 65 samples to validate the models. Images from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites were used to obtain the biophysical parameters: NDVI, SAVI, EVI, and GDVI vegetation indices, SI-1, SI-2, SI-3, and IB salinity indices, albedo, temperature (TSUP), and real evapotranspiration (ETR). Descriptive statistics and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to identify majors EC and biophysical parameters relationships, and select the best predictors to generate equations capable of estimating soil salinity across the irrigated perimeter. The EC showed a high standard deviation and coefficient of variation compared to the other variables, with higher concentrations observed in areas of bare soil, followed by natural vegetation and agricultural vegetation. TSUP and GDVI were the predictors most strongly related to EC, for images Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 respectively, with R2 of 73% and 71%. The application of the generated models presented satisfactory validation for two distinct areas. The maps obtained were similar in terms of the distribution of soil saline levels, confirming what was observed in the field scale, with a greater level of detail for the map from Sentinel-2.

TI  - Observation of nearshore crescentic sandbar formation during storm wave conditions using satellite images and video monitoring data
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crescentic nearshore sandbars (CNSBs) that are observed in the shallow waters (< 10 m) of sandy beaches are important for understanding coastal dynamics because of their strong interaction with nearshore circulation. However, their formation, originating from shore-parallel straight nearshore sandbars (SNSBs), has rarely been observed in the field because their occurrence is typically short (less than a week). In this study, a process in which a nearly SNSB changed into a fully developed CNSB was observed using satellite images, field surveys, and video monitoring data at a sandy beach in South Korea. Freely available Sentinel-2 satellite images and the bathymetry data measured by echosounders were used to find out formation of an SNSB system after attack of Typhoon Tapah in September 2019 and that the SNSB changed to a CNSB in February 2020. The process was narrowed down using video monitoring data and hydrodynamic measurements, observing that two storm waves with maximum wave heights of >3 m developed in the site over a one-month period in January 2020 when the CNSB formed. The first storm wave had a sharp peak wave height that reached similar to 5 m and lasted similar to 2 days. The second storm wave had lower wave energy but several peak waves of similar to 4 m height and a total storm period of similar to 6 days. During both storm periods, the infragravity wave energy increased and strong (>0.5 m/s) offshore and longshore (northwest) currents developed for similar to 1 day and similar to 3 days for the first and second storm respectively. The results from video monitoring data show that a nearly developed SNSB system transformed into a weakly developed CNSB system after the first storm when alongshore variability on the nearly SNSB was intensified to become horns and bays of the weak CNSB. During the second storm, the CNSB system fully developed as the horns moved further onshore and the bays further offshore shaping the clear horn and bay pattern. This indicates that positive feedback between the flows and sediments played a key role for the formation of the CNSB and, therefore, the self-organization mechanism might be appropriate to describe the process during the two storm periods. Specifically, the high infragravity wave energy and strong quasi-steady currents were important because they could trigger the development of rip channels during the first storm whereas the channels were further strengthened by the long consistency of currents during the second storm.

TI  - Spatial and temporal trends of urban green spaces: an assessment using hyper-temporal NDVI datasets
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the last couple of decades urban areas of developing countries have been experiencing unprecedented growth. However, this growth is not well planned in most of the cities. Even in recent days, there is no significant change in city planning and still, there is a lack of concern regarding environmental issues especially the changing green covers in cities. Identifying the green space dynamics of major cities is crucial considering strategic planning of smart cities, policy intervention and combating the problems associated with degreening. The present study attempts to assess the potentiality of hyper-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its temporal trend as an indicator of greening or de-greening process in Delhi National Capital Territory (NCT) and its peri-urban areas. Ten days composite hyper-temporal SPOT-VGT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation) NDVI images (1998-2013) have been used for identifying the vegetation trend and further, it was compared with long-term CHIRPS (climate hazards centre infrared precipitation with station data) rainfall data to unveil the root causes behind the variation in vegetation trend specifically the contribution of natural and anthropogenic factor in changing scenario of urban green space. The study shows that hyper-temporal NDVI data with sufficient temporal depth can be highly convenient to explore the trend of vegetation and changes in green space. The spatio-temporal pattern of NDVI trend indicates a significant part of the area including Noida, Gurgaon etc. experienced decreasing vegetation trend which can be explained by large scale conversion of vegetated land into built-up areas due to establishment of new multi-storied buildings. The strong negative correlation (r <= - 0.8) between rainfall-NDVI indicates that rainfall is not the major controlling factor of vegetation trend in that area rather anthropogenic activities played a significant role in depletion of vegetation. During 1998-2013, the areas of bounding zone have been largely converted into built-up area and as a consequence, surface vegetation cover of these areas has been depleted. However, human induced greening was also observed in small pockets of Delhi NCT that can be explained by the impact of positive measures like tree plantation and proper maintenance of urban trees along roads, parks, and gardens.

T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater potential in coastal aquifers is under constant threat due to salinity hazard from saltwater intrusion. The main focus of the present study is, quantitative assessment of freshwater pockets using ground penetrating radar (GPR) investigation coupled with geospatial data of a near shore coastal aquifer, in the east coast of India. This area is suffering from saltwater intrusion and over-exploitation of groundwater. Randomly collected GPR profiles, well information, remote sensing data and soil samples were analysed. The integration of these tech-niques and data sets provided a robust platform to assess/identify the freshwater columns. The results show the seasonal water table variation from 1 to 4.25 m in pre-monsoon and 0.5 to 2.5 m in post-monsoon below ground level (BGL). The freshwater/saltwater interface zone varies from 3 to 6.0 m and 3 to 7.4 m in pre and post-monsoon respectively. The seasonal variation of freshwater column ranges from 0.5 to 4.3 m (pre-monsoon) and 1.5 to 5.3 m (post-monsoon). Aquifer potential (AP) varies from 0.01 to 6.70 million cubic meters (mcm) and 1.05 to 12.8 mcm in pre and post monsoon respectively. This study illustrates the aquifer potential and the overall groundwater dynamics for groundwater resource management.

TI  - False Negative Rate of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy on Intraoperative Frozen Section in Early Breast Cancer Patients: An Institutional Experience
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an established practice to avoid axillary clearance, in clinically negative axilla, in breast cancer patients. Sentinel nodes harvested by dual technique, if found negative on intraoperative frozen section, can prevent breast cancer patient from a potentially debilitating complete axillary clearance. Hence, analyzing the institutional accuracy of this technique and comparing it with international standards, becomes important in providing optimal treatment to these patients. A retrospective analysis of all patients who had undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy at our institute from December 2014 to December 2018 was carried out. At our institute, sentinel lymph nodes are identified using dual technique of methylene blue and radiocolloid dye. Intraoperative frozen section of these hot or blue or any enlarged nodes is performed. Patients with positive frozen section undergo complete axillary clearance. All frozen and unfrozen biopsy material is subjected to further paraffin sectioning and immunohistochemistry. False negative rate and factors associated with were analyzed. A total number of 424 patients had undergone intraoperative frozen section for the sentinel node in breast cancer at our institute during the study period. Among these, 307 patients had negative sentinel nodes and 117 had positive sentinel nodes of frozen section. Seventeen patients out of 307 had lymph node metastases in final paraffin report (false negative rate = 12.6%). Two of these were found to have macrometastasis, 13 had micrometastasis and 2 had isolated tumor cells on final immunohistochemistry report. Size of metastases to sentinel lymph node was found to be a statistically significant contributor to higher false negative rate. Sentinel lymph node biopsy using intraoperative frozen section, is a sensitive and specific technique of staging axilla in breast cancer patients. Detection of micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells present a technical challenge and are associated with higher false negative rates.

TI  - First evidence of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The uses of bivalve molluscs in environmental biomonitoring have recently gained momentum due to their ability to indicate and concentrate human pathogenic microorganisms. In the context of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, the objective of this study was to determine if the SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid genome can be detected in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters from two separate plants to support its interest as bioindicator of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contamination in water. The zebra mussels were exposed to treated wastewater through caging at the outlet of two plants located in France, as well as to raw wastewater in controlled conditions. Within their digestive tissues, our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 genome was detected in zebra mussels, whether in raw and treated wastewaters. Moreover, the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in such bivalve molluscans appeared even with low concentrations in raw wastewaters. This is the first detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the tissues of a sentinel species exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters. Despite the need for development for quantitative approaches, these results support the importance of such invertebrate organisms, especially zebra mussel, for the active surveillance of pathogenic microorganisms and their indicators in environmental waters.

TI  - Combining multi-spectral and thermal remote sensing to predict forest fire characteristics
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires preparedness strategies require the assessment of spatial and temporal variability of fire danger. While several tools have been developed to predict fire occurrence and behaviour from weather data, it is acknowledged that fire danger models may benefit from direct assessment of live fuel condition, as allowed by Earth Observation technologies. In this study, the performance of pre-fire observations of land surface temperature (LST) anomaly and of the Perpendicular Moisture Index (PMI) in predicting fire characteristics was evaluated against the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, a fire danger model adopted in several areas worldwide. To this purpose, a database of forest fires recorded in Campania (13,595 km(2)), Italy, was combined with MODIS retrievals of LST anomaly and PMI, and with FWI maps from NASA's Global Fire Weather Database. Fires were grouped in decile bins of LST anomaly, PMI and FWI System components, and probability distribution functions of burned area, fire duration and rate of spread were fitted in each bin. The dependence of probability model parameters on LST anomaly, PMI and FWI System components was assessed by means of trend analysis (coefficient of determination and p-value of the linear fit, Sen's slope and Mann-Kendall test) and likelihood ratio test versus the corresponding unconditional probability model. Finally, the probability of an extreme event, conditional to ignition, was modelled as a function of LST anomaly and PMI. Results show that the probability distribution function of burned area has a strong dependence on both LST anomaly and PMI, that the probability distribution function of fire duration has a strong dependence on LST anomaly but not on PMI, and that the probability distribution function of rate of spread has a weak dependence on LST anomaly and a strong dependence on PMI. These results are in line with expectations from models of the combustion and flames propagation processes. Trend analyses and likelihood ratio tests showed that the FWI System components are good predictors of burned area and fire duration, but not of rate of spread. They also confirmed that, where LST anomaly and PMI are covariates of the considered fire characteristic, their performance is similar or better than the FWI System components. Finally, the probability of an extreme event in terms of burned area as a joint function of LST anomaly and PMI shows a wider dynamic range than the same probability modelled as a function of these remote sensing variables individually.

TI  - Efficient measurement of large-scale decadal shoreline change with increased accuracy in tide-dominated coastal environments with Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the worlds' population relies on the processes and ecosystems in the coastal zone. Understanding the long-term change of coastlines is critical for the effective management of these complex, and heavily utilised regions. There has been a recent increase of studies focused on large-scale shoreline change mapping. However, most current methods are optimized for extracting shorelines of wave-dominated sandy beaches, which are only 30% of the global coasts, resulting in uncertainty for other environments such as tidal flats and bedrock. Here, we propose a new shoreline change mapping workflow, using the Landsat archive and Google Earth Engine, which increases compute efficiency and is suitable for retrieving shoreline changes for various coastal landforms at high tide instead of mean sea level. By validating against regional and continental datasets in Australia, we found the approach here produced high mapping accuracy and showed particularly better performance at tide-dominated coasts, where tidal flats and intertidal bars and ridges are present, when compared to past approaches. This is an important step forward since tide-dominated and tide-modified coasts are widely distributed at tropical low latitudes. We also explored the global application of the proposed method and derived hotspots of shoreline erosion and accretion that agreed with multiple regional studies across the world. Most of these hotspots were related to river sediment discharge and human intervention on the coast, as expected. Although it requires further validation, the global application of our method demonstrates the significance of this approach in identifying potential threats to coastal zones, especially in complex tide-dominated environments, which can facilitate effective coastal management.

TI  - Signal Models for Changes in Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry can improve change detection in terms of detection capabilities. In this work, we are proposing to extend the idea of target decomposition to changes affecting partial targets. This will allow the separation of polarimetric-dependent changes, providing extra information that can be used to better understand the processes affecting the targets. Three models for changes are proposed and compared. The methodologies are based on Lagrangian optimizations of distinct operators built using quadratic forms for a power ratio and a power difference. The optimizations can be accomplished by diagonalizations of specific matrices derived from polarimetric covariance matrices. These are, therefore, spectral decompositions of an appropriate matrix which we define as change matrix. The theoretical validity of the models is assessed using Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we perform real data validation exploiting L-band quad-polarimetric data from the E-SAR (DLR) SARTOM 2006 campaign and ALOS PALSAR (JAXA) acquisitions in Morecombe Bay (U.K.). We observed that the two algorithms based on power difference allow to decompose the change into the minimal set of scattering mechanisms (SMs) that have been added or removed from the scene. The two algorithms differ on the initial assumption on the change. On the other hand, the ratio operator provides a better detection performance although the eigenvalues do not correspond to meaningful SMs. A combination of the three methodologies can, therefore, improve detection and classification of changes.

TI  - Morphological changes in the hazardous zones of the Ganga and the Brahmaputra Rivers in East and Northeast India
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ganga-Brahmaputra river basin is the second-largest hydrological region in the world. This is an integrated, trans-boundary drainage system with a common terminus of two major river systems, i.e., the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. Both the rivers are undergoing a process of shifting in their courses over time, thereby making certain stretches in their respective flow paths hazardous in nature. This study analyzes the factors that influence these shifting patterns at the two most hazardous sites located along both these rivers. The study focuses on the morphological changes in these hazardous zones (Malda along the Ganga in West Bengal and Morigaon along Brahmaputra in Assam) by calculating the bank-line migration, erosion-accretion, lateral shift, land loss, and related issues. Topographical map and multispectral Landsat imageries were used for certain time periods (1955 to 2020) to analyze the chronological changes in the river morphology. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) were used to evaluate and analyze the scenario in the study area.

TI  - Argan Tree (<i>Argania spinosa</i> (L.) Skeels) Mapping Based on Multisensor Fusion of Satellite Imagery in Essaouira Province, Morocco
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species identification and their geospatial distribution mapping are crucial for forest monitoring and management. The satellite-based remote sensing time series of Sentinel missions (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) are a perfect tool to map the type, location, and extent of forest cover over large areas at local or global scale. This study is focused on the geospatial mapping of the endemic argan tree (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels) and the identification of two other tree species (sandarac gum and olive trees) using optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series. The objective of the present work is to detect the actual state of forest species trees, more specifically the argan tree, in order to be able to study and analyze forest changes (degradation) and make new strategies to protect this endemic tree. The study was conducted over an area located in Essaouira province, Morocco. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used for the classification of the two types of data. We first classified the optical data for tree species identification and mapping. Second, the SAR time series were used to identify the argan tree and distinguish it from other species. Finally, the two types of satellite images were combined to improve and compare the results of classification with those obtained from single-source data. The overall accuracy (OA) of optical classification reached 86.9% with a kappa coefficient of 0.84 and declined strongly to 37.22% (kappa of 0.29) for SAR classification. The fusion of multi sensor data (optical and SAR images) reached an OA of 86.51%. A postdassification was performed to improve the results. The classified images were smoothed, and therefore, the quantitative and qualitative results showed an improvement, in particular for optical classification with a highest OA of 89.78% (kappa coefficient of 0.88). The study confirmed the potential of the multitemporal optical data for accurate forest cover mapping and endemic species identification.

TI  - Is myopia prevalence related to outdoor green space?
T2  - OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Rapid urbanisation and lifestyle changes have been associated with a huge increase in myopia across many parts of the world. There is strong evidence that environmental factors including time outdoors and urbanisation can influence the development of myopia, particularly in school-aged children. The aim of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between the prevalence of myopia and the amount of vegetation/green spaces across different regions of the world, as a risk factor for myopia development. Methods The prevalence of myopia in the 15 to 19-year age group in Australia, Brazil, China, Finland, India, Iran, Japan, Oman, Singapore, South Africa and the UK was obtained from a meta-analysis by Holden et al. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to quantify green space exposure based on Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite data. Green space was measured in locations specific to 15 studies that reported myopia prevalence. Simple linear regression was used to analyse yearly data, and a mixed effects model was applied to assess the significance of green space when study was a random effect. Results Myopia prevalence increases significantly when green space was <-0.2, but the effect was less apparent for values >-0.1. When a mixed effects model was used, the effect of green space was found to be significantly associated with myopia prevalence (p = 0.05). Conclusions There was evidence of a weak but significant non-linear relationship between myopia and green space, with the effect most apparent at low levels of green space. A larger data sample, along with further investigations into the utilisation of green spaces, are required to understand whether increasing the amount of green space can reduce myopia incidence and progression impact.

TI  - Geographically Weighted Spatial Unmixing for Spatiotemporal Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion is a technique applied to create images with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions by blending images with different spatial and temporal resolutions. Spatial unmixing (SU) is a widely used approach for spatiotemporal fusion, which requires only the minimum number of input images. However, ignorance of spatial variation in land cover between pixels is a common issue in existing SU methods. For example, all coarse neighbors in a local window are treated equally in the unmixing model, which is inappropriate. Moreover, the determination of the appropriate number of clusters in the known fine spatial resolution image remains a challenge. In this article, a geographically weighted SU (SU-GW) method was proposed to address the spatial variation in land cover and increase the accuracy of spatiotemporal fusion. SU-GW is a general model suitable for any SU method. Specifically, the existing regularized version and soft classification-based version were extended with the proposed geographically weighted scheme, producing 24 versions (i.e., 12 existing versions were extended to 12 corresponding geographically weighted versions) for SU. Furthermore, the cluster validity index of Xie and Beni (XB) was introduced to determine automatically the number of clusters. A systematic comparison between the experimental results of the 24 versions indicated that SU-GW was effective in increasing the prediction accuracy. Importantly, all 12 existing methods were enhanced by integrating the SU-GW scheme. Moreover, the identified most accurate SU-GW enhanced version was demonstrated to outperform two prevailing spatiotemporal fusion approaches in a benchmark comparison. Therefore, it can be concluded that SU-GW provides a general solution for enhancing spatiotemporal fusion, which can be used to update existing methods and future potential versions.

TI  - An ensemble of state-of-the-art ash dispersion models: towards probabilistic forecasts to increase the resilience of air traffic against volcanic eruptions
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality volcanic ash forecasts are crucial to minimize the economic impact of volcanic hazards on air traffic. Decision-making is usually based on numerical dispersion modelling with only one model realization. Given the inherent uncertainty of such an approach, a multi-model multi-source term ensemble has been designed and evaluated for the Eyjafjallajokull eruption in May 2010. Its use for flight planning is discussed. Two multi-model ensembles were built: the first is based on the output of four dispersion models and their own implementation of ash ejection. All a priori model source terms were constrained by observational evidence of the volcanic ash cloud top as a function of time. The second ensemble is based on the same four dispersion models, which were run with three additional source terms: (i) a source term obtained from a model background constrained with satellite data (a posteriori source term), (ii) its lower-bound estimate and (iii) its upper-bound estimate. The a priori ensemble gives valuable information about the probability of ash dispersion during the early phase of the eruption, when observational evidence is limited. However, its evaluation with observational data reveals lower quality compared to the second ensemble. While the second ensemble ash column load and ash horizontal location compare well to satellite observations, 3D ash concentrations are negatively biased. This might be caused by the vertical distribution of ash, which is too much diluted in all model runs, probably due to defaults in the a posteriori source term and vertical transport and/or diffusion processes in all models. Relevant products for the air traffic management are horizontal maps of ash concentration quantiles (median, 75 %, 99 %) at a finely resolved flight level grid as well as cross sections. These maps enable cost-optimized consideration of volcanic hazards and could result in much fewer flight cancellations, reroutings and traffic flow congestions. In addition, they could be used for route optimization in the areas where ash does not pose a direct and urgent threat to aviation, including the aspect of aeroplane maintenance.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) have recently introduced considerable lithologic mapping. Thus, this study scrutinizes the efficacy of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) over hybrid datasets including optical (Sentinel 2, ASTER, Landsat OLI and Earth-observing 1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI)), radar (Sentinel 1 and ALOS PALSAR), DEMs and their derivatives (Slope, and Aspect). The study aims to (1) monitor the effect of data dimensionality in enhancing categorization accuracy. (2) disclose the most efficient MLA and most powerful dataset in labeling rock units accurately. (3) highlight the impact of embedding topographical and radar data in lithologic classification. (4) outline the best relation between the number of training pixels and number of utilized bands, in delivering reliable allocation. To achieve these aims, we selected training and testing pixels meticulously, in concordance with a recently published geological map of the study area. We adopted a stacked vector approach for handling the implemented multi-sensor data. Results show that diversifying information sources raised the classification accuracy by approximately 10% for each classifier. SVM and MLC are much better than ANN. Slope is better than aspect and both are less qualified when compared to DEM. Sentinel 1 (C-band) and ALOS PALSAR (L-band) effects are not so different whatever the implemented polarization. Landsat OLI is less qualified in lithologic classification when compared to Sentinel 2, ASTER and ALI. The utilized training pixels should be at least 30N for (N) channels submitted to the classifiers.

TI  - Mapping flood extend and its impact on land use/land cover and settlements variations: a case study of Layyah District, Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are the most frequent and most distractive natural disaster around the globe. Pakistan is facing frequent flooding since 1929 and floods in the Indus river basin cost more than 7000 lives and caused mighty changes in land use and land covers (LULC) since 1947. District Layyah hit by flood on August 1, 2010. Landsat ETM+ with 30 m spatial resolution was utilized to investigate the LULC changes in district Layyah for the 2010 flood. It was revealed water area increased 8.05% from July 3 (379.13 km(2)) to August 20 (656.02 km(2)) in district Layyah. Vegetation cover increased from 1149.62 km(2) on July 3 to 1842.23 km(2) on August 20 in district Layyah and showed a 20.13% increment. Barren/built-up area showed a decrement of 28.18% from 1911.72 km(2) in pre-flood analysis to 941.90 km(2) in the post-flood analysis. Total 15 union councils (UC) of district Layyah were affected by flood from which 10 lies in tehsil Layyah and 5 belongs to tehsil Karor Lal Esan. Flood affects 177 settlements in district Layyah from which 156 belong to tehsil Layyah and 21 were from tehsil Karor Lal Esan. These results suggest that the impacts of the flood on LULC need more attention to cope with the challenge of frequent flooding and impacts in Pakistan.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Assessment of some water quality parameters in the Red River downstream, Vietnam by combining field monitoring and remote sensing method
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Red River is the largest river in northern Vietnam, and it serves as the main water source for production and human activities in the Red River Delta region. Cities and provinces located in the Red River Delta, for example, Hanoi, Nam Dinh, and Ha Nam, have experienced rapid economic growth with various large urban, industrial zones, and agricultural areas. As a result of urbanization and industrialization, surface water in this region has been contaminated by multiple anthropogenic sources. In this study, in addition to water quality assessment using WQI, we used the reflectance values of visible and near-infrared bands and in situ data to build a regression model for several water quality parameters. Among ten parameters examined, two parameters, including total suspended solids (TSS) and turbidity, were used to construct regression correlation models using the Sentinel-2 multispectral images. Our results can contribute useful information for comprehensive monitoring, evaluation, and management scheme of water quality in the Red River Delta. The application of this method can overcome the limitation of actual observation results that only reflect local contamination status and require a lot of sampling and laboratory efforts.

AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the data from patients >= 70 years old treated between January 2012 and January 2017. Axillary staging was scarcely used in the therapeutic algorithm but arm lymphedema was significantly associated to axillar dissection (p=0.04) and regional nodal irradiation (p = 0.02). Aggressive management of axilla did not provide relevant information for deciding chemotherapy but added morbidity.

TI  - Impact of single-stage laparoscopic trans-cystic exploration on hospital procedures, admissions and length-of-stay in common bile duct stone clearance
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 89th Annual Scientific Congress of the Royal-Australasian-College-of-Surgeons (RACS ASC)
CL  - Melbourne, AUSTRALIA
AB  - Background: Single-stage approach with bile duct exploration is considered the most efficient and cost-effective method of bile duct clearance. In Australia, apart from centres with subspecialty interests, notably in Brisbane, Queensland, a multi-stage approach with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is used more frequently. We aim to evaluate the impact of single stage laparoscopic trans-cystic exploration (LTCE) versus multi-stage approach for choledocholithiasis.Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Medicare Benefits Schedule codings were used to identify patients who had the following procedures between December 2011 and December 2019: laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and ERCP, LC and LTCE, LC and LTCE and ERCP. Primary outcomes were number of hospital procedures, admissions and additive length of stay (aLOS), the cumulative hospital stay from admission to discharge.Results: Of 607 patients, 204 (34%) patients received a single-stage LTCE, while 403 (66%) patients had a multi-stage approach. In the LTCE group, 82% (168) patients and 93% (190) patients had one procedure and one admission respectively for stone clearance (P = 0.001). The median aLOS was 4 days for LTCE versus 7 days for multi-stage approach (P = 0.001; 95% CI for difference - 3 to -2). In the multi-stage group, 16% (65) patients had three or more procedures and 49% (199) patients required two or more hospital admissions to achieve stone clearance.Conclusion: LTCE for stone clearance can be successfully accomplished with reductions in hospital admissions, number of procedures and length of stay. This has further economic and health resource implications.

TI  - Target-Triggered Nanomaterial Self-Assembly Induced Electromagnetic Hot-Spot Generation for SERS-Fluorescence Dual-Mode In Situ Monitoring MiRNA-Guided Phototherapy
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A multifunctional theranostic nanosystem that integrates dynamic monitoring and therapeutic functions is necessary for precision tumor medicine. Herein, an entropy-driven self-assembly nanomachine is developed that overcomes the mechanism differences of different diagnostic modes and is applied to miRNA surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-fluorescence dual-mode dynamic monitoring and synergy phototherapy. It is worth noting that the activated dual-mode theranostic nanosystem (DTN) is capable of tumor in situ fluorescence imaging and SERS absolute quantification of the target. After being internalized into tumor cells, the DTN nanosystem is activated by the DNA cascade chain displacement of the target miR-21, resulting in the secondary release of fluorophores and the assembly of core-satellite structures (CS structures). The coupling of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in the CS structure results in the formation of numerous enhanced electric fields (hot spot) in the nanogap of the CS structure. Then the DTN nanosystem greatly improves the sensitivity and repeatability of Raman detection by converting trace targets into numerous adenines residing in the electromagnetic hot spot of the CS structure. Meanwhile, the CS structure and the loaded photosensitizer are used for synergy phototherapy under the guidance of fluorescence imaging. This proposed strategy is confirmed by in vivo and in vitro results, and it provides new ideas for tumor SERS-fluorescence dual-mode diagnosis and effective tumor therapy.

TI  - Forest classification using synthetic GF-1/WFV time series and phenological parameters
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy forest type mapping is crucial for forest resource inventory to support forest management, conservation biology, and ecological restoration. The Chinese GF-1 satellite can provide high-spatial resolution and low-cost data for forestry monitoring. However, it is difficult to obtain time-series GF-1 images with high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency because of technical constraints and cloud contamination, which affects the accuracy of forest type extraction. We proposed a method for mapping forest type using Chinese GF-1/widefield view (WFV) multi-spectral data, the fused GF-1/WFV normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series, and the phenological parameters. We used the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model algorithm to fuse Chinese GF-1/WFV and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI to generate high-spatiotemporal resolution NDVI time-series image data and extract phenological parameters in the northeastern part of Hubei Province, China. We then designed four different combinations of GF-1/WFV spectral features, the fused NDVI time-series features, and the phenological parameters. Finally, a random forest algorithm is used to classify forest types in the study area. The results showed that the proposed method can obtain satisfactory results. The overall accuracy based on the combination of GF-1/WFV spectral features, high-resolution time-series NDVI, and phenological features was 89.68%. Compared with the classification using only GF-1/WFV spectral data, the overall accuracy was improved by 9.60% points. These results demonstrate that the proposed method can support forest type survey and mapping at the regional or global scale. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Performance Assessment of InSAR-Based Vertical Displacement Monitoring of Sluices in Coastal Soft Soil Area
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sluices are main flood control infrastructures in coastal areas, where soft rock and soft soil are widely distributed. In soft soil areas, the vertical displacement of sluice is common, which is the main factor affecting the sluice safety. So, it is very important for sluice safety control according to the prototypical observations on deformation. Considering some drawbacks of leveling, such as it can only provide a limited number of points and requires time-consuming field work, this paper evaluates the performance of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)-based method in monitoring long-term vertical displacement deformations of sluices. Taking 12 sluices in Northern Jiangsu, China as an example, 129 Sentinel-1 C-band VV-polarizatio ascending SAR images that span the period from April 2015 to January 2020 were used to monitor their vertical displacement deformations. The leveling results are made to verify the accuracy and reliability of Permanent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) method. The validation indicates good agreement between PSInSAR results and leveling results. Considering the higher accuracy of leveling, PSInSAR method is more suitable as an auxiliary technology besides leveling method to focus on the early warning of sluice deformation risk events.

TI  - Investigating anthropogenically transformed landscapes with remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of the current state and spatio-temporal changes in natural landscapes is crucial, among others, for the agro-industrial and agricultural sectors of every country, including Ukraine. The main objective of this paper is to estimate the state and spatio-temporal changes in landscapes with land-cover identification using remote sensing data processing and geographic information technologies. The generalized scheme of the present study consists in the analysis of natural and anthropogenic changes of Ukraine's capital city of Kiev landscapes using satellite data. The processing involved step-by-step decipherment of Kiev's landscapes using cluster analysis, namely supervised and unsupervised classification based on a series of satellite images from Landsat missions 5, 7, 8 (1985-2020) and Sentinel-2 MSI (2015-2020). Spectral signatures were determined, and their quality was estimated based on the classification. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated for vegetated landscapes. The following landscapes were identified: water bodies, vegetation, urban areas, and bare soil. Two land cover maps were compiled from Sentinel-2 MSI images for 2015 and 2020 with an overall accuracy of 89.76% and 82.05%, respectively. Two maps of anthropogenic transformations of Kiev's landscapes were also compiled. According to Landsat data (spatial resolution 30 m), the area of urban landscapes increased by about 41% from 1985 to 2020, and according to Sentinel-2 MSI data (spatial resolution 10 m), it grew around 5% from 2015 to 2020.

T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multiple Classifier System (or classifier ensemble) is the consensus of different clustering algorithms that can provide high accuracy for the best partition and thus overcome the constraints of conventional approaches based on single classifiers. The MCS is divided into two stages: Partition creation and partition combining. The potential benefits of this methodology in unsupervised land cover categorization utilizing synthetic, composite, and remotely sensed data are investigated in this paper. Four clustering algorithms are used for the MCS's first step, and according to the WB index, the best-unsupervised classification is obtained. In the second stage, relabeling and, voting approaches are then applied. The MCS's experimental results outperform the individual clustering outcomes in terms of accuracy.

TI  - Diagnostic efficacy of sentinel lymph node in breast cancer under percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound: An updated meta-analysis
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To investigate the diagnostic efficacy of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in breast cancer by percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) through pooled analysis of relevant studies published before June 2021. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies by searching the electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and VIP and the studies were screened according to their inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (+LR), negative likelihood ratio (-LR) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated by Meta-disc 1.4 software and the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and area under the curve of ROC (AUC) were constructed. Results Twenty-two publications evaluating the diagnostic efficacy of SLN in breast cancer under percutaneous CEUS were included in the meta-analysis. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83-0.88) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.91) for SLN in breast cancer detected by percutaneous CEUS respectively using a random effect model. The +LR and -LR were combined in a random effect model due to significant statistical heterogeneity (p < 0.05). The pooled +LR, -LR were 7.06 (95% CI: 4.34-11.50), and 0.17 (95% CI: 0.12-0.24), respectively. The combined DOR was 53.32 (95% CI: 29.74-95.61) for SLN diagnosis in breast cancer by percutaneous CEUS under a random effect model. The AUC was 0.94 which indicated that CEUS had high diagnostic efficacy of SLN in patients with breast cancer. Conclusions CEUS is a noninvasive method for the detection SLN in patients of breast cancer with relative high prediction efficacy.

TI  - Gingival bleeding on brushing as a sentinel sign of gingival inflammation: A diagnostic accuracy trial for the discrimination of periodontal health and disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To assess the accuracy of self-reported gingival bleeding on brushing (GBoB) for differentiating between periodontal health and disease and explore the optimal haemoglobin concentration that enables visual detection of GBoB. Materials and methods Self-assessment of GBoB was conducted in supervised sessions for 408 consecutive adults. The haemoglobin levels in saliva/toothpaste slurry (TPS) were analysed, followed by a full-mouth periodontal examination. Periodontal diagnoses were made based on the 2017 classification of periodontal diseases. Gingival inflammation was defined as presence of at least 10% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP). Logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analyses were applied to assess the accuracy of GBoB. Results Overall, 37.1% of the subjects claimed self-reported GBoB, and they had higher values of BOP (median: 25.0%; interquartile range (IQR): 16.0%-37.5%) than those without GBoB (median: 13.5%; IQR: 8.0%-24.8%, p < .001). The concentration/total amount of haemoglobin in TPS was positively correlated with the number of bleeding sites (r = .409/r = .520, p < .001). Haemoglobin concentration of 90.58 mu g/ml or 0.51 mu l blood volume enabled visual detection of GBoB with an AUROC of 0.848. Self-reported GBoB exhibited significantly increased values of diagnostic odds ratios (3-8) for varying degrees of gingival inflammation and periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). It showed low to moderate accuracy for discriminating periodontitis and gingivitis from periodontal health, with a sensitivity of 37.1% and 61.3% and a specificity of 84.8% and 84.4%, respectively. Absence of self-reported GBoB and low levels of haemoglobin had 93%-98% predictive values for periodontal health. Conclusions Despite its low sensitivity for the discrimination of periodontitis, self-reported GBoB is a promising sentinel sign for periodontal health and disease, and gingival inflammation in particular. It is visually detectable after minor blood loss. After validation in an independent population, identification of GBoB may promote earlier detection and better prevention and treatment of periodontal disease, thereby eventually reducing the global burden of the disease.

TI  - Banditry or business? Rebel labor markets and state economic intervention
T2  - INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stationary banditry is ubiquitous in civil war, with some rebel groups even investing in and profiting from primary commodities for years or decades. But for many of these groups, labor is a necessary component of resource production, such that laborers' economic participation is vital for rebel funding and survival. States, meanwhile, are eager to prevent rebels from establishing these economic footholds. In areas where rebels can assert control of primary commodity markets, military competition between states and rebels may be supplemented by economic competition over laborers' efforts. Under what conditions do governments wage local economic war by providing incentives to laborers to minimize the appeal of economically partnering with rebels? I argue that laborers' economic loyalty is a central and under-considered component to resource-driven conflicts. When rebels seek to establish stationary banditry, states incentivize laborers to participate in the legal economy rather than rebel-controlled markets. Specifically, states will pursue economic counterinsurgency policies in areas where rebels are most likely to profit from labor-intensive primary commodities. I find support for this argument using municipal-level Colombian data about the FARC's involvement in the coca trade and government provision of agricultural credits. El bandolerismo estacionario es omnipresente en la guerra civil, yalgunos grupos rebeldes incluso invierten en productos basicos yse benefician de ellos durante anos odecadas. No obstante, para muchos de estos grupos, el trabajo es un componente necesario de la produccion de recursos, de modo que la participacion economica de los trabajadores es clave para la financiacion yla supervivencia de los rebeldes. Por su parte, los Estados ansian impedir que los rebeldes establezcan este tipo de apoyo economico. En las zonas donde los rebeldes pueden imponer el control de los mercados de productos basicos, la competencia militar entre los Estados ylos rebeldes se puede complementar con la competencia economica por el esfuerzo de los trabajadores. En que condiciones los gobiernos desatan una guerra economica local al ofrecer incentivos alos trabajadores afin de minimizar el atractivo de asociarse anivel economico con los rebeldes? Sostengo que la lealtad economica de los trabajadores es un componente fundamental ypoco considerado en los conflictos relacionados con los recursos. Cuando los rebeldes pretenden imponer un bandolerismo estacionario, los Estados incentivan alos trabajadores aparticipar en la economia legal en lugar de en los mercados controlados por los rebeldes. En concreto, los Estados promulgaran politicas de contrainsurgencia economica en las zonas donde los rebeldes tienen mas probabilidades de beneficiarse de los productos basicos que requieren mucha mano de obra. Respaldo este argumento mediante datos que compartio Colombia anivel municipal sobre la participacion de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) en el comercio de coca yla provision de creditos agricolas por parte del gobierno. Le banditisme stationnaire est omnipresent dans les guerres civiles, certains groupes rebelles investissant dans et profitant meme des produits primaires pendant des annees ou des decennies.Mais pour nombre de ces groupes, la main-d'oe uvre est une composante necessaire a la production de ressources, et la participation economique des travailleurs est donc essentielle au financement et a la survie de ces rebelles. Dans le meme temps, les etats souhaitent ardemment empecher les rebelles d'etablir ces points d'ancrage economiques. Dans les zones ou les rebelles peuvent affirmer leur controle sur les marches des produits primaires, la concurrence militaire entre les etats et les rebelles peut etre completee par une concurrence economique sur les efforts des travailleurs. Dans quelles conditions les gouvernements menent-ils une guerre economique locale en offrant des incitations aux travailleurs pour minimizer l'attrait d'un partenariat economique avec les rebelles ? Je soutiens que la loyaute economique des travailleurs est une composante centrale et insuffisamment prise en consideration dans les conflits reposant sur des ressources. Lorsque les rebelles cherchent a etablir un banditisme stationnaire, les etats incitent les travailleurs a participer a l'economie legale plutot qu'aux marches controles par les rebelles. Plus precisement, les etats meneront des politiques economiques de contre-insurrection dans les zones ou les rebelles sont les plus susceptibles de tirer profit des produits primaires exigeant beaucoup de main-d'oe uvre. J'ai trouve du soutien a cet argument en m'appuyant sur des donnees colombiennes au niveau municipal concernant l'implication des FARC dans le commerce de la coca et l'octroi de credits agricoles par le gouvernement.

TI  - High-resolution inventory to capture glacier disintegration in the Austrian Silvretta
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new high-resolution glacier inventory captures the rapid decay of the glaciers in the Austrian Silvretta for the years 2017 and 2018. Identifying the glacier outlines offers a wide range of possible interpretations of glaciers that have evolved into small and now totally debris-covered cryogenic structures. In previous inventories, a high proportion of active bare ice allowed a clear delineation of the glacier margins even by optical imagery. In contrast, in the current state of the glacier only the patterns and amounts of volume change allow us to estimate the area of the buried glacier remnants. We mapped the glacier outlines manually based on lidar elevation models and patterns of volume change at 1 to 0.5m spatial resolution. The vertical accuracy of the digital elevation models (DEMs) generated from six to eight lidar points per square metre is of the order of centimetres. Between 2004/2006 and 2017/2018, the 46 glaciers of the Austrian Silvretta lost 29 +/- 4% of their area and now cover 13.1 +/- 0.4 km(2). This is only 32 +/- 2% of their Little Ice Age (LIA) extent of 40.9 +/- 4.1 km(2). The area change rate increased from 0.6 %/yr (1969-2002) to 2.4 %/yr (2004/2006-2017/2018). The Sentinel-2-based glacier inventory of 2018 deviates by just 1% of the area. The annual geodetic mass balance referring to the area at the beginning of the period showed a loss increasing from -.2 +/- 0.1mw.e./yr (1969-2002) to -0.8 +/- 0.1mw.e./yr (2004/2006-2017/2018) with an interim peak in 2002-2004/2006 of -1.5 +/- 0.7mw.e./yr. To keep track of the buried ice and its fate and to distinguish increasing debris cover from ice loss, we recommend inventory repeat frequencies of 3 to 5 years and surface elevation data with a spatial resolution of 1 m.

TI  - Comparing the performance of machine learning algorithms for remote and in situ estimations of chlorophyll-a content: A case study in the Tri An Reservoir, Vietnam
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is one of the most important indicators of the trophic status of inland waters, and its continued monitoring is essential. Recently, the operated Sentinel-2 MSI satellite offers high spatial resolution images for remote water quality monitoring. In this study, we tested the performance of the three well-known machine learning (ML) (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], and Gaussian process [GP]) and the two novel ML (extreme gradient boost (XGB) and CatBoost [CB]) models for estimation a wide range of Chl-a concentration (10.1-798.7 mu g/L) using the Sentinel-2 MSI data and in situ water quality measurement in the Tri An Reservoir (TAR), Vietnam. GP indicated the most reliable model for predicting Chl-a from water quality parameters (R-2 = 0.85, root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 56.65 mu g/L, Akaike's information criterion [AIC] = 575.10, and Bayesian information criterion [BIC] = 595.24). Regarding input model as water surface reflectance, CB was the superior model for Chl-a retrieval (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 46.28 mu g/L, AIC = 229.18, and BIC = 238.50). Our results indicated that GP and CB are the two best models for the prediction of Chl-a in TAR. Overall, the Sentinel-2 MSI coupled with ML algorithms is a reliable, inexpensive, and accurate instrument for monitoring Chl-a in inland waters. Practitioner points Machine learning algorithms were used for both remote sensing data and in situ water quality measurements. The performance of five well-known machine learning models was tested Gaussian process was the most reliable model for predicting Chl-a from water quality parameters CatBoost was the best model for Chl-a retrieval from water surface reflectance

TI  - Geographical Knowledge-Driven Representation Learning for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of remote sensing satellites has resulted in a massive amount of remote sensing images. However, due to human and material resource constraints, the vast majority of remote sensing images remain unlabeled. As a result, it cannot be applied to currently available deep learning methods. To fully utilize the remaining unlabeled images, we propose a Geographical Knowledge-driven Representation (GeoKR) learning method for remote sensing images, improving network performance and reduce the demand for annotated data. The global land cover products and geographical location associated with each remote sensing image are regarded as geographical knowledge to provide supervision for representation learning and network pretraining. An efficient pretraining framework is proposed to eliminate the supervision noises caused by imaging times and resolutions difference between remote sensing images and geographical knowledge. A large-scale pretraining dataset Levir-KR is constructed to support network pretraining. It contains 1,431,950 remote sensing images from Gaofen series satellites with various resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms ImageNet pretraining and self-supervised representation learning methods and significantly reduces the burden of data annotation on downstream tasks, such as scene classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and cloud/snow detection. It demonstrates that our proposed method can be used as a novel paradigm for pretraining neural networks. Codes will be available on https://github.com/flyakon/Geographical-Knowledge-driven-Representaion-Learning.

TI  - Seasonal Predictions of Holopelagic Sargassum Across the Tropical Atlantic Accounting for Uncertainty in Drivers and Processes: The SARTRAC Ensemble Forecast System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The holopelagic macroalgae sargassum has proliferated across the tropical Atlantic since 2011, of consequence for coastal populations from West Africa to the Caribbean with limited early warning of major beaching events. As part of an interdisciplinary project, 'Teleconnected SARgassum risks across the Atlantic: building capacity for TRansformational Adaptation in the Caribbean and West Africa' (SARTRAC), an ensemble forecast system, SARTRAC-EFS, is providing seasonal predictions of sargassum drift. An eddy-resolving ocean model hindcast provides the winds and currents necessary to generate ensemble members. Ensemble forecasts are then obtained for different combinations of 'windage', the fractional influence of winds on sargassum mats, and in situ rates of growth, mortality, and sinking. Forecasts for north and south of Jamaica are evaluated with satellite-observed distributions, associated with beaching events in specific years of heavy inundation, 2015 and 2018-20. These seasonal forecasts are evaluated, on lead times of up to 180 days. Forecasts are subject to leading modes of tropical climate variability, in particular the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM). More accurate forecasts for a given year are obtained with ensemble members from hindcast years with a similar spring AMM-index. This is most clearly evident during negative AMM phases in spring of 2015 and 2018, when positive sea surface temperature anomalies and anomalously weak trade winds were established across the northern tropics. On this evidence, SARTRAC-EFS is potentially useful in providing early warning of high sargassum prevalence. Extended to sargassum drift off West Africa, extensive cloud cover limits availability of the satellite data needed for full application and evaluation of SARTRAC-EFS in this region, although experimental forecasts off the coast of Ghana are found highly sensitive to the windage that is associated with strong onshore winds during boreal summer. Alongside other forecast systems, SARTRAC-EFS is providing useful early warnings of sargassum inundation at seasonal timescale.

TI  - Explainable machine learning models of major crop traits from satellite-monitored continent-wide field trial data
T2  - NATURE PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite, and perhaps because of, extensive data regarding agricultural variables and plant traits, finding connections to crop yields can be difficult to compile. Machine learning models detailed here can provide accurate predictions to tease out behaviours.Four species of grass generate half of all human-consumed calories. However, abundant biological data on species that produce our food remain largely inaccessible, imposing direct barriers to understanding crop yield and fitness traits. Here, we assemble and analyse a continent-wide database of field experiments spanning 10 years and hundreds of thousands of machine-phenotyped populations of ten major crop species. Training an ensemble of machine learning models, using thousands of variables capturing weather, ground sensor, soil, chemical and fertilizer dosage, management and satellite data, produces robust cross-continent yield models exceeding R-2 = 0.8 prediction accuracy. In contrast to 'black box' analytics, detailed interrogation of these models reveals drivers of crop behaviour and complex interactions predicting yield and agronomic traits. These results demonstrate the capacity of machine learning models to interrogate large datasets, generate new and testable outputs and predict crop behaviour, highlighting the powerful role of data in the future of food.

TI  - Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems in the Eastern Tropical Pacific: The current state of knowledge and the spatial variability of their depth boundaries
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCEs) are limited by oceanographic conditions and are thought to be mostly absent. However, considering the currently discussed more flexible approach to define mesophotic boundaries, based on light availability, we performed a systematic search to assess their current state of knowledge. Using MODIS-Aqua satellite data (Kd490), we calculated the mesophotic boundaries in the ETP, based on optical depths, and performed a bibliographic search of studies carried out at those depths, including those present in turbid waters with KdPAR values up to 0.2 m-1. Seventy-seven papers on MCEs research were compiled in this review, recording a total of 138 species. The studies focus almost exclusively on taxonomy, ecosystem function, and reviews, indicating the need for future research regarding aspects, such as structuring environmental variables, molecular ecology, and natural resource management. Furthermore, remote sensing data show that there exists a high spatial variability of water transparency in the ETP, resulting in significant differences in KdPAR between oceanic and continental locations, mostly related to the occurrence of seasonal upwelling in the latter. Based on KdPAR, we estimated the mesophotic depth boundaries (z10%, z1%, z0.1%) for specific locations within the ETP and found that MCEs can potentially occur as shallow as 13-15 m in coastal regions. Also, we compared the calculated boundaries with the respective deepest records of lightdependent corals. With one exception, the presence of the corals was restricted to the upper mesophotic subzone (z10%-z1%), which agrees with reports for other regions, showing that light availability is one of the main drivers for the bathymetric distribution of MCEs and can be used as a first approach to identify their potential presence, though other local factors (e.g., geomorphology, temperature, internal waves) should also be considered, as they can cause shifts in depth limits.

TI  - Analysing the day/night seasonal and annual changes and trends in land surface temperature and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) for Indian cities
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the patterns and possible causes of urban heat islands (UHI) effect due to urbanisation-induced anthropogenic activities is an important area in urban climatic research. Few studies on long-term thermal behaviour of Indian cities are available in the literature. Towards this, the present study investigates the day/ night seasonal and annual changes and trends in land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) during the last two decades for three Indian cities (Lucknow, Kolkata and Pune) with distinct urban, physiographic and climatic setting. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data products acquired during daytime and nighttime from 2001 to 2018 are processed and analysed for this purpose. MODIS-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) products are used to understand the plausible reasons of change in LST and SUHII patterns. The urban (contiguous built-up) and nonurban (surrounding rural) areas are delineated by applying city clustering algorithm on MODIS Land Cover datasets of 500 m spatial resolution. Mann-Kendall and Seasonal-Kendall tests along with Theil-Sen estimator are used for trend analysis. The findings show that the diurnal temperature range (DTR) has decreased from 2001 to 2018 due to higher increase in nighttime LST as compared to daytime. Nighttime LST is a better indicator to study the urban heating effect due to its sensitivity towards urbanisation. Positive trends in mean annual daytime (0.003 to 0.059 degrees C/year) and nighttime (0.030 to 0.078 degrees C/year) LST are observed in all cities, except in Pune where urban cooling occurs during daytime. Increase in aerosol loading (with consequent decrease in air temperature and surface insolation) and vegetative cover over time are attributed as the primary reasons of urban cooling effect in Pune during daytime. Seasonal analysis indicate high warming rates during monsoon and summer seasons, particularly during nighttime (0.062 to 0.1 degrees C/year). Nighttime SUHII is positive for all cities with mean annual SUHII ranging from 1.34 to 2.07 degrees C. Statistically significant (p<0.01) increasing trends are observed in mean annual SUHII (0.009 degrees C/year to 0.022 degrees C/year) for Kolkata and Pune. Decreasing trend in SUHII is observed over Lucknow due to higher rate of increase in LST in non-urban area as compared to urban area. The study highlights that geographical, physiographic and climatic setting along with anthropogenic processes in urban and its surrounding non-urban areas are critical towards understanding the causative factors in exacerbating the phenomenon of urban heating.

TI  - Modeling the Pathways and Accumulation Patterns of Micro- and Macro-Plastics in the Mediterranean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean is considered a hot-spot for plastic pollution, due to its semi-enclosed nature and heavily populated coastal areas. In the present study, a basin-scale coupled hydrodynamic/particle drift model was used to track the pathways and fate of plastics from major land-based sources (coastal cities and rivers), taking into account of the most important processes (advection, stokes drift, vertical and horizontal mixing, sinking, wind drag, and beaching). A hybrid ensemble Kalman filter algorithm was implemented to correct the near- surface circulation, assimilating satellite data (sea surface height, temperature) in the hydrodynamic model. Different size classes and/or types of both micro- and macroplastics were considered in the model. Biofouling induced sinking was explicitly described, as a possible mechanism of microplastics removal from the surface. A simplified parameterization of size-dependent biofilm growth has been adopted, as a function of bacterial biomass (obtained from a biogeochemical model simulation), being considered a proxy for the biofouling community. The simulated distributions for micro- and macroplastics were validated against available observations, showing reasonable agreement, both in terms of magnitude and horizontal variability. An 8-year simulation was used to identify micro- and macroplastics accumulation patterns in the surface layer, water column, seafloor and beaches. The impact of different processes (vertical mixing, biofouling, and wind/wave drift) was identified through a series of sensitivity experiments. For both micro- and macroplastics, distributions at sea surface were closely related to the adopted sources. The microplastics concentration was drastically reduced away from source areas, due to biofouling induced sinking, with their size distribution dominated by larger (>1 mm) size classes in open sea areas, in agreement with observations. High concentration patches of floating plastics were simulated in convergence areas, characterized by anticyclonic circulation. The distribution of macroplastics on beaches followed the predominant southeastward wind/wave direction. In the water column, a sub-surface maximum in microplastics abundance was simulated, with increasing contribution of smaller particles in deeper layers. Accumulation of microplastics on the seafloor was limited in relatively shallow areas (<500 m), with bottom depth below their relaxation depth due to defouling. The simulated total amount of floating plastics (similar to 3,760 tonnes) is comparable with estimates from observations.</p>

TI  - Geomorphological characterization of the 2014-2015 Holuhraun lava flow-field in Iceland
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption extruded>1 km(3) of lava in a barren region of the Icelandic highlands. Due to its large volume and the abundance of data for this eruption, Holuhraun is an ideal site to investigate fissure-fed eruption products for comparison with other large lava flow-fields on Earth and on other planetary bodies. To characterize lava morphologies associated with this event, we used 0.01-0.5 m/pixel image data, acquired from aerial surveys and small Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (sUAS) to create a 1:800-scale facies map that was ground-truthed using field observations during the summers of 2015-2019. Each facies region exhibits similar attributes in the remote sensing data, including albedo, surface texture, and geomorphology. However, at our mapping scale of 1:800, the facies typically include mixtures of lava types. Results show that transitional lava types (e.g., rubbly pahoehoe, slabby pahoehoe, and spiny pahoehoe) dominate the 2014-2015 Holuhraun lava flow-field (83.82 km(2)), rather than the traditional end-members of 'a'(a) over bar and classical pahoehoe. At 1:800-scale, we distinguish the following eight facies (with the percentage of total flow-field area shown in parentheses): rubbly (57.35%), spiny (25.96%), undifferentiated rubbly-spiny (9.59%), shelly (5.58%), pahoehoe (1.24%), flat-lying-knobby (0.58%), vent-proximal edifice (0.19%), and channel interior (0.16%). Field observations showthat initial coherent pahoehoe surfaces were episodically disrupted to produce slabby and rubbly textures that resemble 'a'(a) over bar in remote sensing data. Our observations also show that continued solidification of the lava beneath brecciated surfaces can cause the surfaces of disrupted lobes to stabilize, or restabilize and undergo inflation. These factors complicate the use of surface texture as a direct indicator of emplacement style, which can change over the course of an eruption. This complexity has important implications for reconstructing the emplacement history of flow-fields on Earth and other planetary bodies. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Using the Google Earth Engine to rapidly monitor impacts of geohazards on ecological quality in highly susceptible areas
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent geohazards have knock-on effects on ecological quality. Timely and dynamically monitoring the damage of geohazards to ecological quality is important to the geological hazards prevention, ecological restoration, and policy formulation. Existing studies mainly focused on the impacts of climate change, urbanization, and extreme weather on the ecological quality, largely ignoring the role of frequent geohazards in the highly susceptible area. At present, the impact mechanism of the high susceptibility of geohazards on ecological quality remains unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we use the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI, a widely accepted ecological quality index) calculated on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, geohazard density data, and the Landsat series of surface reflectance datasets to explore the mechanism that drives spatial-temporal variations of ecological quality. Taking the Danba County as the study area, our results indicate that the total number of geohazards is 944 during 1995-2019, and the number of geohazards fluctuates and rises every year (10 in 1995 and 82 in 2019). A conceptual framework was proposed to quantify the impact of the high susceptibility of geohazards on ecological quality by separately exploring its impact on the 4 ecological components of RSEI (i.e., greenness, wetness, dryness, and heat). We found that the density of geohazards is significantly negatively correlated with greenness (R = 0.48, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) = -0.528, p < 0.01), and humidity (R = 0.45, PCC = -0.364, p < 0.01), whereas it is significantly positively correlated with dryness (R = 0.63, PCC = -0.335, p < 0.01) and heat (R = 0.47, PCC = -0.368, p < 0.01). Therefore, geohazards make a negative contribution to ecological quality by reducing greenness and humidity and increasing dryness and heat. This study provides insights on the mechanism of geohazards on ecological quality, benefiting stakeholders in designing better management plans for sustainable ecosystem cycling, application of GEE, and geological remote sensing.

T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - On September 28th, 2018, a supershear earthquake of moment magnitude (Mw) 7.5 struck the Palu area in central Sulawesi, Indonesia. To gain insight into landslides triggered by the Palu earthquake, a detailed landslide interpretation project was carried out in the meizoseismal area. To establish a co-seismic landslide inventory, we collected high-resolution images, including Worldview pre- and post- earthquake images, Sentinel pre- and post-earthquake images and Google Earth pre- and post- earthquake images. The results show that the Palu event triggered at least 7063 co-seismic landslides, including 8 flowslides. The total landslide area is 29.7 km(2), with the highest density being 96 landslides/km(2). The rock type (Kambuno granite) is a dominant factor influencing the landslide distribution; the average landslide H/L (H is the fall height and L is the horizontal length of an entire landslide) is 0.56. The flowslides that occurred in the Palu Basin are seismic liquefaction-induced landslides that failed along very gentle slopes (generally, slopes that are <3 degrees) and traveled hundreds to thousands of meters, and the average H/L was 0.021.

TI  - Evaluation of forest carbon uptake in South Korea using the national flux tower network, remote sensing, and data-driven technology
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests provide most of the carbon sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2); however, accurately quantifying the uptake amount over a region remains challenging. For reginal or national estimates, the forest productivity model and forest inventories are used which provide information for national greenhouse gas inventories. However, it has some limitations, such as not considering below-ground biomass, its lack of species-specific allometric models, the restrictions it places during fieldwork, and the long period it takes to complete the survey. In contrast to inventory-based biomass estimates, the eddy covariance (EC) method can assess net CO2 exchange of a whole ecosystem continuously and automatically with a high temporal resolution. Since, these measurements only represent a site-level observation scale (similar to 1 km(2)), upscaling via linkages with observation data, remote sensing, and modeling methods has been used to estimate regional or national land-atmosphere carbon fluxes. In this study, we employ a data-driven method to estimate the national-scale gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) by combining EC flux data from 10 sites in South Korea with remote sensing data through a machine learning algorithm based on support vector regression (SVR) for the period 2000-2018. Site-level evaluation of estimated GPP and NEE from the SVR-based model shows equivalent performance compared to other continental and global upscaled models. The mean estimated annual GPP and NEE of the South Korea forests region over the period 2000-2018 were 1465 +/- 37 and -243 +/- 32 g C m(2) year(-1) respectively. The SVR-based net primary production (NPP) was consistent with the biometric-based NPP = 0.46, p < 0.05). This study shows that combining data from a national flux network and remote sensing using a data-driven approach can be used to estimate forest CO2 fluxes on a national scale.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose an operational solution for the yearly classification of crop parcels at national scale (namely France) for Land Parcel Identification System updating, under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) umbrella. Our pipeline is based on the iota(2) open-source framework and fed with both time series of Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical images, with complementary contributions. Three conceivable scenarios are investigated with two sets of nomenclatures (17 and 43 classes): early, on-line, and late classifications. Experiments performed on 2017 show very satisfactory results (82-97%), locally almost on-par with state-of-the-art deep-based methods. We can conclude our framework offers a strong basis for country-scale operational deployment for 2020+CAP.

TI  - The utilisation of sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial cancer in Australia and New Zealand
T2  - AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims The aim of this study was to identify to what extent the sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique is utilised by gynaecological oncologists in Australia and New Zealand, identifying the techniques used, any barriers to uptake, and management of isolated tumour cells (ITCs) and micrometastases. Materials and methods We conducted an online survey of all practising gynaecological oncologists in Australia and New Zealand. They were asked whether they utilised SLN biopsy and in what circumstances, how they managed non-mapping and how their multidisciplinary team managed small volume disease. Those who did not were asked to identify their concerns with the procedure, reasons for non-uptake and their alternate technique. Results We surveyed 63 gynaecological oncologists of whom 59 were practising, and 48 (81%) responded. Six members (11%) do not utilise SLN biopsy, and 42 (89%) do. Areas where clinicians differ in practice are those areas that are most controversial and include the use of SLN biopsy in complex atypical hyperplasia, the management of ITCs and micrometastases and procedures on unilateral or bilateral non-mapping. Those who do not utilise the technique cite concerns about the false-negative rate, equipment and training issues. Conclusions The utilisation of SLN biopsy in endometrial cancer is well established in Australia and New Zealand, with similar practices and concerns to those of other international groups.

TI  - Effect of surface emissivity and retrieval algorithms on the accuracy of Land Surface Temperature retrieved from Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the important variables in the retrieval of Land Surface Temperature (LST) is surface emissivity. The main aim of this study is to test how surface emissivity estimated using different methods affect the accuracy of the retrieved LST. The emissivity was estimated from Landsat data using different variants of the vegetation index (VI) based model and also obtained from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Emissivity Dataset (ASTER GED). The LST was retrieved using Statistical Mono Window (SMW) and Generalized Single Channel (GSC) algorithms. The retrieved LSTs were compared with the Landsat collection-2, level-2 surface temperature (L2ST) product and also validated against ground measurements over eight sites across India. From the results, it was observed that the emissivity estimated by different methods resulted in LST with no significant differences in accuracy between them. However, the LST retrieved from the SMW algorithm performed better than the LST from the GSC algorithm. In addition, the LST from the L2ST product performed relatively poorer in comparison with the SMW algorithm. The results indicated that the accuracy of retrieved LST is highly dependent on the LST retrieval algorithm as different surface emissivity methods caused only minor variations in LST values.

TI  - Smartphone-based estimation of green cover depends on the camera used
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Smartphone-based visual assessment of vegetation cover is a promising, fast, and repeatable approach that allows land managers to compare measurements on their farm with other farms. This study determined the influence of the smartphone device on green cover measurements on several crops. The hypothesis was that different smartphones would provide similar green cover (reflectance) for management purposes (i.e., <10% difference). Forty fields in Finland were sampled between 10 and 28 July 2020 with Motorola Moto G7 and Samsung Galaxy A6 smartphones. The results were compared also with Sentinel-2 remote sensing of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and biomass quadrants. The two smartphones had different green reflectance values that were correlated to each other. Both green reflectance measurements correlated with the NDVI that was measured with the Sentinel 2 satellite sensor and biomass. These findings suggest that smartphone-based monitoring can be used at least to classify vegetation to low, medium, and high density but that results from different cameras should not be compared.

TI  - Long term trend in aerosol direct radiative effects over Indian Ocean region from multi- satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term (2000-2020) trend in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the associated radiative effect over Indian Ocean region (Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal) during winter time south Asian outflow is investigated using multi-satellite data. Analysis revealed a statistically significant increasing trend of similar to 0.01 year(-1) over the study regions. This study revealed that aerosols are confined within 2 km from ocean surface, and the trend in columnar AOD is significantly modulated by aerosol loading at higher altitudes. Although there has been no significant change in aerosol direct radiative forcing efficiency, the significant enhancement in AOD over the study region has induced an increase in cooling at the top of the atmosphere by similar to 0.1 to 0.2 W m(-2) year(-1).

TI  - Understanding Inflammation-associated Ophthalmic Pathologies: A Novel 3D Co-culture Model of Monocyte-myofibroblast Immunomodulation
T2  - OCULAR IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Inflammation is associated with, and may be causal of, a variety of ophthalmic pathologies. These pathologies are currently difficult to model in vitro because they involve complex interactions between the innate immune system, stromal cells, and other cells that normally maintain ocular tissue homeostasis. Using transscleral drainage channel fibrosis after glaucoma surgery as an example of inflammation-associated ocular fibrosis, we have assessed a simple but novel 3D cell culture system designed to reveal the immunomodulatory impacts of ocular connective tissue cells on monocytes, a major cellular component of the circulating immune system.Methods: Primary human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts derived from five unrelated patients were activated into myofibroblasts in 3D collagen matrices under isometric tension, with and without exposure to an inflammatory cytokine-enhanced milieu, and co-cultured with an immortalized human monocyte cell line (THP-1 cells). Quantitative PCR analyses were performed on 8 candidate genes to assess the impacts of inflammatory cytokines on the myofibroblasts and the monocytes in mono-cultures and compared to cells in co-culture to clearly distinguish any co-culture-induced impacts on gene expression.Results: Our data indicate that both Tenon's capsule myofibroblasts in 3D mono-culture and THP-1 monocytes in suspension mono-culture were responsive to inflammatory cytokine stimuli. Co-culture with Tenon's capsule myofibroblasts significantly modulated the gene expression responses of THP-1 monocytes to inflammatory cytokine stimulation, indicative of an immunomodulatory "feedback" system between these cell types.Conclusion: Our findings provide proof of principle for the use of simple 3D co-culture systems as a means to enhance our understanding of ocular stromal cell interactions with cells of the innate immune system and to provide more informative in vitro models of inflammation-associated ophthalmic pathologies.

TI  - Short-term sediment plume event in the coral reef area of a small island captured by the Planet Dove satellite constellation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment discharge from tropical and subtropical islands significantly influence the habitat and survival of the surrounding corals. However, severe observational difficulties have hitherto prevented all the efforts to capture these events and estimate their corresponding effects. Herein, we first report the details about a short but significant sediment plume event in coral reef areas of Kumejima Island, a small island near Okinawa, Japan, based on remote sensing data of high spatio-temporal resolution obtained by the Planet Dove satellite constellation. We developed a model for estimating the concentration of suspended solids (SS) based on laboratory spectral measurements and applied it to the red band of optical satellite data to quantify and map SS concentrations of the plume event. During this event, the level of SS concentrations near the coast were high that can cause acute negative impacts on corals. Our study emphasizes the importance of capturing such short-term events and providing essential information as reference basis for formulating countermeasures to control soil discharges and propose spatial strategies on land aimed at the conservation of coral reef ecosystems.

TI  - Exploiting Sentinel-1 data time-series for crop classification and harvest date detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Light source independence and the advantage of being less affected by weather conditions than optical remote sensing, as well as the sensitivity to dielectric properties and targets structure, make Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly time-series data, a relevant tool for crop processes monitoring. This study aims to benefit from all the amplitude and phase SAR data to perform both a crop classification and a harvest date detection algorithm, supported by the first one for corn and soybean fields. Study area was located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. To achieve this goal, time-series of Interferometric Coherence (IC) and backscattering values in vertical transmit and vertical receive (sigma(0)(VV)), and vertical transmit and horizontal receive (sigma(0)(VH)) polarizations were generated from Single Look Complex images acquired from C-band SAR satellites Sentinel-1A and -1B. The crop classification was performed using a Random Forest classifier with an overall accuracy of 97%. For its training, both sigma(0)(VV) and sigma(0)(VH) time-series along the entire crops life cycle were used. Harvest detection algorithm was accomplished by analysing both the IC and sigma(0)(VH) time-series in an individual way for both crops. IC changes could be linked to plant structure characteristics along their life cycle (from seeding to harvesting), surface structure induced by harvest operations and post-harvest crops stubble. Based on the latter, individual criteria for corn and soybean were adopted. Crop depending on the determination of the harvest date detection was supported by the crop classification obtained. Harvest detection accuracy over 80 fields was superior to 93% for both crops. The proposed methodology for harvest detection is focused on the crops structural characteristics along its life cycle and the post-harvest stubble, which could lead to different IC behaviours.

TI  - Phenology-based delineation of irrigated and rain-fed paddy fields with Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice agriculture is practiced in both rain-fed and irrigated ecosystems in the Philippines. However, small farms are prevalent in the region, and current satellite-based mapping techniques do not distinguish between the two ecosystems at farm scales. This study developed an approach to rapidly map irrigated and rain-fed paddy rice in Iloilo, Philippines at 10 m resolutions using Google Earth Engine. This approach used an ensemble of classifiers based on time-series vegetation indices to produce dry and wet seasonal maps for the entire province. Results showed a predominance of rain-fed rice areas in both seasons, with irrigated rice making up only one-fourth of the total rice area. The overall accuracy was achieved at 68% for the dry season and 75% for the wet season based on ground-acquired points and very high-resolution imagery. The two types of paddies were classified at accuracies up to 87%. Furthermore, the land cover maps showed a strong agreement with the municipal statistics. The resultant maps complement current official statistics and demonstrate the prowess of phenology-based mapping to create paddy inventories in a timely manner to inform food security and agricultural policies.

TI  - Object-based modelling and accuracy assessment of Gordion tumuli using very high-resolution stereo satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high-resolution (VHR) stereo satellite images provide detailed spatial and spectral information for detecting and monitoring artificial or natural objects. This information can also be used for object-based change detection. This study aims to reveal the potential of three-dimensional (3D) information generated from VHR stereo satellite images to determine the physical changes that may occur on Gordion tumuli. For this purpose, point cloud data were generated from WorldView-3 and KOMPSAT-3 stereo satellite images. The accuracy of these datasets was tested using 161 check points (CPs). On the other hand, digital surface models (DSMs) generated from VHR stereo satellite images were used for object-based modelling of tumuli. The vertical accuracy of these DSMs was tested by comparing them with reference DSMs extracted from Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) images. As a result of the vertical accuracy assessment of the point cloud data, 0.16 m and 0.53 m root mean square error (RMSE) values were obtained for WorldView-3 and KOMPSAT-3 data, respectively. The average RMSE values obtained as a result of the model-based comparison of DSMs are 0.28 m for WorldView-3 and 0.57 m for KOMPSAT-3. These results demonstrate that the sub-metre level physical changes occurring on tumuli can be determined by VHR stereo satellite images.

TI  - Vegetation cover monitoring in tropical regions using SAR-C dual-polarization index: seasonal and spatial influences
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An approach to monitor vegetation without the influence of cloud cover and employing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was developed by the DPSVI (Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index), based on Sentinel-1 mission data. However, DPSVI performance in areas of dense vegetation and variation in vegetation classes is unknown. Thus, this paper aimed to investigate the performance of DPSVI in the monitoring of vegetation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome, as well as to propose modifications to improve its capacity to monitor the vegetation and investigate seasonal and spatial influences on the performance of the proposed index (DPSVIm). Three approaches were adopted: 1) use Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 scenes obtained from four hydrological years (2015-2016 to 2018-2019), to compute monthly DPSVI, DPSVIm, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) indices, to investigate seasonal influences; 2) perform topographic correction in Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 data to verify the influence of relief on DPSVIm performance; and 3) confronting DPSVIm with an attribute of Atlantic Forest fragments: the above ground biomass (AGB). The scenes were processed on the Google Earth Engine platform. The DPSVIm was able to better distinguish the vegetation, compared to the DPSVI, mainly in forest planting areas and Atlantic Forest, which evidences the proposed improvements. The rainfall regime made the DPSVIm performance seasonal in comparison with the NDVI and EVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index), presenting better agreements in the dry season and worse in the rainy season. There was a greater agreement between DPSVIm and EVI in the results to monitor dense vegetation since EVI does not saturate as NDVI does. Finally, the DPSVIm has a good fit to AGB, being able to distinguish different levels of AGB from 50 to 200 Mg ha, approximately. The study allowed improving the DPSVI making the DPSVIm adequate to quantify vegetation in the study area, even considering the effects of topography and rainfall regime. The latter environmental factor should be addressed in future studies, searching to mitigate this source of temporal uncertainty in DPSVIm.

TI  - A life course approach to understanding associations between natural environments and mental well-being for the Danish blood donor cohort
T2  - HEALTH & PLACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural environments have been associated with mental health benefits, but globally access to these benefits is threatened by urban development and densification. However, it remains unclear how natural environments relate to mental health and how consistent the association is across populations. Here we use a life-course approach with a population consisting of 66 194 individuals from the Danish Blood Donor Study (DBDS) to investigate the association between green and blue space (e.g. parks and lakes) and self-evaluated mental well-being. Green and blue space was identified from remotely-sensed images from the Landsat program, while mental well-being was based on the mental component score (MCS) calculated using the 12-item short form health survey. We use multivariate linear regression models and logistic regression models to quantify the as-sociations. We adjust for additional environmental (urbanization, and air pollution) and lifestyle factors (smoking, body mass index, socioeconomic status, and physical activity) and specifically evaluate the role of physical activity and air pollution as possible mediating factors. We found a positive association between the MCS and current and childhood green space, and a non-significant association for current and childhood blue space. Adjusting for environmental and the other factors attenuated the effect sizes indicating that a broad range of factors determine mental well-being. Physical activity and air pollution were both associated with the MCS as possible mediators of green space associations. In addition, the odds for successfully completing tasks', seeing others, and feeling less downhearted increased with higher levels of green space, and the odds of feeling calm increased with higher levels of blue space. In conclusion, we found support for an association between green and, to less degree, blue space and mental well-being throughout different life stages. In addition, we found a positive association with individual indicators of mental well-being such as being productive, feeling less downhearted and calmer, and being social. The healthy blood donor effect and the bias towards urban residency may explain why we found smaller effect sizes between green and blue space and mental well-being for this generally healthy and resourceful cohort compared to previous studies.

TI  - Machine learning approach to predict leaf colour change in <i>Fagus sylvatica L</i>. (Spain)
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is one of the most important deciduous tree species in Europe. In this study, we analyse the autumn senescence dynamics of Spanish beech forests using time series satellite data between 2001 and 2017. In addition, we used nine Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the day of the year (DOY) in which their leaf colour change is at 75% (75CF), 10 days ahead, using precipitation and temperature data. The used algorithms were generalized linear model (glm), ridge regression (ridge), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), bayesian generalized linear models (bayesglm), partial least squares (pls),weighted k-nearest neighbours (kknn), extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree), support vector machine radial (svmRadial) and random forest (rf). The time series analysis of the actual 75CF did not show any acceleration or deceleration over time. Nevertheless, we noticed a decreasing negative trend between the mean elevation above the mean sea level of the forests and their actual 75CF in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The best performing ML model was kknn with RMSE = 3 days and R-2 = 0.94. To further explore the predictive capacity of the models in a realistic scenario, we held out the last year of the time series (2017) and trained the models with data from 2001 to 2016. The test results proved that rf was the best method in this hypothetical scenario with RMSE = 8 days and R-2 = 0.67. This study provides a cost-effective method to predict leaf colour change in beech forests, reducing the shortcomings of previous approaches with a similar goal. It can be used with management purposes for local or regional authorities, as well as being of interest to further investigate climate change impacts on tree species.

TI  - Islamic and local knowledge on social work in Malaysia and Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY IN SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Professional social work emerged on the basis of secular and Eurocentric worldview in the West in the late 19th century. As emerging nations in the 1940s, Asian Muslims were not spared being colonized in ways more than just physical presence by foreign powers. This article describes briefly how professional social work entered Malaysia and Bangladesh. The focus is to show how Western-based social work knowledge influenced the respective curriculums in the two mentioned countries. Muslims, in terms of knowledge and their religion of Islam have not made an imprint on the body of knowledge in social work. With the current ongoing discourses on the definition of social work, this article presents how Islam and local knowledge can play a mainstream role in questioning the colonial assumptions inherent in much accepted social work knowledge. While there are similarities between Western and Islamic values in reference to helping, there are also differences in which the latter is more suitable for the local population. Therefore, this article is also an initiative to start a dialog and a determined effort toward putting Islamic and local knowledge as a part of social work curricula and practice in Malaysia and Bangladesh.

TI  - A sustainable way of agricultural livelihood: edible bird's nests in Indonesia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Edible birds' nests (EBNs) have traditionally been produced in Southeast Asia. Indonesian farmers construct buildings for swiftlets and harvest their nests. EBN farming does not directly degrade forest resources and is therefore considered a sustainable means of production, whereas the expansion of other agricultural activities often relies on the degradation of natural resources. This study examines the relationship between natural resources and agricultural livelihoods, focusing on Indonesian EBN farmers. Using survey data that we collected in 2017, combined with satellite information on the extent of the forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we measured production efficiency and identified the natural and social factors that enhance production performance. The results show that a forest extent ranging between 2,000 and 6,000 meters from nesting building is positively associated with the production efficiency of EBN farming, perhaps because extensive forest could help swiftlets to collect food and build nests. Conversely, while EBN farming is a sustainable and profitable option, the initial costs of constructing buildings to house swiftlets may deter farmers from participating in the process.

TI  - Sub-pixel accuracy evaluation of FY-3D MERSI-2 geolocation based on OLI reference imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geolocation quality of satellite observation datasets is causally related to the credibility of operational products. The twice-daily global Earth observations provided by FY-3D/MERSI-2 (FengYun-3D/MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager II) have been used to generate various remote sensing application products, but their geolocation performance has not yet been documented, while the comprehensive analysis of geometric accuracy provides important guidance for improving geolocation accuracy and data application in the future. In this paper, a combination of phase-only correlation and anomaly isolation techniques was used to design a robust algorithm of sub-pixel geolocation displacement detection for MERSI-2 data with 1 km spatial resolution. Utilizing MERSI-2 data from three typical regions and monthly Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data synthesized by Google Earth Engine (GEE), an exhaustive presentation of how the developed method quantifies the geometric displacements of the Level 1 dataset to along-track and cross-track directions is described, ultimately revealing the deterioration of MERSI-2 on-orbit geolocation performance. During the 17 months of official operational products, the geolocation error increases by a factor of 1.13 in along-track direction and 1.56 in cross-track direction. But approximately 70% of the geometric displacements remain within +/- 300 m in both along-track and cross-track directions, while about 92% are within +/- 500 m. This method reliably ascertains that the geolocation accuracy of MERSI-2 matches within 1/2 Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV).

AB  - Using historical sources, I attempt to piece together the economic worldview held by the United States Treasury Department during World War II. Analyzing the Treasury's view of taxation, bond sales, and interest rates, this article considers whether and in what ways this worldview is compatible with Modern Monetary Theory. I conclude that in most regards, the two align closely, the differences being primarily attributable to the peculiarities of war finance. Finding a less clear view of national debt, an interpretation is offered based on Treasury's statements. Additional evidence shows that this view had a small but significant foothold in the era's news outlets.

TI  - A large-scale, long time-series (1984-2020) of soybean mapping with phenological features: Heilongjiang Province as a test case
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean is one of the most important crops in the world. There were dramatic changes in soybean plantation in China in recent decades. Heilongjiang Province has the greatest acreage of soybean plantation in China. Therefore, it is taken as a representative soybean region in this study for monitoring purposes. A 30-m dataset that mapped the areas of soybean planting in Heilongjiang Province was produced, for the period of 1984 similar to 2020, based on Landsat-5/7/8 images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Maps were made with a random forest classifier and had overall accuracies better than 84%. The areas planted with soybean were calculated at both the provincial and city level and these were compared with the areas obtained from official statistics. At the provincial level, for more than 85% of the time periods, the areas given in the official statistics fell within the confidence intervals of the estimates. At the city level, soybean areas were also in good agreement with the statistical data in most years giving average R-2 values as 0.75. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using phenological features extracted by a double-logistic model and a linear harmonic model with the RF classifier to obtain a long time-series of soybean maps without using samples obtained by field measurements every year.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in high-grade endometrial cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of performance characteristics
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A sentinel lymph node biopsy is widely accepted as the standard of care for surgical staging in low-grade endometrial cancer, but its value in high-grade endometrial cancer remains controversial. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the performance characteristics of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with endometrial cancer with high-grade histology (registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews with identifying number CRD42020160280).DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched the MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase databases all through the OvidSP platform. The search was performed between January 1, 2000, and January 26, 2021. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify ongoing registered clinical trials.STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included prospective cohort studies in which sentinel lymph node biopsy were evaluated in clinical stage I patients with high-grade endometrial cancer (grade 3 endometrioid, serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, mixed, undifferentiated or dedifferentiated, and high-grade not otherwise specified) with a cervical injection of indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node detection and at least a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy as a reference standard. If the data were not reported specifically for patients with high-grade histology, the authors were contacted for aggregate data.METHODS: We pooled the detection rates and measures of diagnostic accuracy using a generalized linear mixed-effects model with a logit and assessed the risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool.RESULTS: We identified 16 eligible studies of which the authors for 9 of the studies provided data on 429 patients with high-grade endometrial cancer specifically. The study-level median age was 66 years (range, 44-82.5 years) and the study-level median body mass index was 28.6 kg/m(2) (range, 19.4-43.7 kg/m(2)). The pooled detection rates were 91% per patient (95% confidence interval, 85%-95%; I-2 =59%) and 64% bilaterally (95% confidence interval, 53%-73%; I-2 =69%) . The overall node positivity rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 19%-34%; I-2 = 44%) . Of the 87 patients with positive node results, a sentinel lymph node biopsy correctly identified 80, yielding a pooled sensitivity of 92% per patient (95% confidence interval, 84%-96%; I-2 =0%), a false negative rate of 8% (95% confidence interval, 4%-16%; I-2 =0%), and a negative predictive value of 97% (95% confidence interval, 95%-99%; I-2 =0%) .CONCLUSION: Sentinel lymph node biopsy accurately detect lymph node metastases in patients with high-grade endometrial cancer with a false negative rate comparable with that observed in low-grade endometrial cancer, melanoma, vulvar cancer, and breast cancer. These findings suggest that sentinel lymph node biopsy can replace complete lymphadenectomies as the standard of care for surgical staging in patients with high-grade endometrial cancer.

TI  - A machine learning approach for spatiotemporal imputation of MODIS chlorophyll-a
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level-3 chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) product is one of the widely used ocean colour products that is often used for water quality monitoring of marine ecosystems. However, this product includes a large amount of missing data due to high surface reflectance and cloudy conditions that inevitably affect its suitability for spatiotemporal analysis of water quality. The objective of this study was to compare four Machine Learning (ML) techniques including K-nearest neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with well-known Data Interpolation Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) method for spatiotemporal missing imputation of MODIS Chl-a. The Southern Caspian Sea, which has a high Chl-a concentration, was selected as the case study. A cross-validation approach ranging missing data ratio from 0.1 to 0.8 was implemented to investigate the optimal parameters of the models and compare their performance for missing imputation. The results indicated that all ML models, except KNN, outperformed the DINEOF method for missing imputation of MODIS Chl-a. The SVR with the highest accuracy and the lowest variability of errors had the best performance among the five competing models, while the KNN showed the worst performance. The main reason for the better accuracy of the SVR than the other models is its structural risk minimization procedure that leads to the better generalization of the SVR model. The current results showed that the ML techniques used in the current study, the SVR in particular, are able to produce reliable imputations of the MODIS Chl-a missing data and can be a useful tool in water quality monitoring of marine ecosystems.

TI  - In vivo efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and amodiaquine-artesunate for uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria in Mozambique, 2018
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Mozambique since 2006, with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and amodiaquine-artesunate (AS-AQ) as the first choice. To assess efficacy of currently used ACT, an in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted. Methods The study was conducted in four sentinel sites: Montepuez, Moatize, Mopeia and Massinga. Patients between 6 and 59 months old with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria (2000-200,000 parasites/mu l) were enrolled between February and September of 2018, assigned to either an AL or AS-AQ treatment arm, and monitored for 28 days. A Bayesian algorithm was applied to differentiate recrudescence from new infection using genotyping data of seven neutral microsatellites. Uncorrected and PCR-corrected efficacy results at day 28 were calculated. Results Totals of 368 and 273 patients were enrolled in the AL and AS-AQ arms, respectively. Of these, 9.5% (35/368) and 5.1% (14/273) were lost to follow-up in the AL and AS-AQ arms, respectively. There were 48 and 3 recurrent malaria infections (late clinical and late parasitological failures) in the AL and AS-AQ arms, respectively. The day 28 uncorrected efficacy was 85.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 81.3-89.2%) for AL and 98.8% (95% CI 96.7-99.8%) for AS-AQ, whereas day 28 PCR-corrected efficacy was 97.9% (95% CI 95.6-99.2%) for AL and 99.6% (95% CI 97.9-100%) for AS-AQ. Molecular testing confirmed that 87.4% (42/48) and 33.3% (1/3) of participants with a recurrent malaria infection in the AL and AS-AQ arms were new infections; an expected finding in a high malaria transmission area. Adverse events were documented in less than 2% of participants for both drugs. Conclusion Both AL and AS-AQ have therapeutic efficacies well above the 90% WHO recommended threshold and remain well-tolerated in Mozambique. Routine monitoring of therapeutic efficacy should continue to ensure the treatments remain efficacious. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04370977

TI  - Drying conditions in Switzerland - indication from a 35-year Landsat time-series analysis of vegetation water content estimates to support SDGs
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Exacerbated by climate change, Europe has experienced series of hot and dry summer since the beginning of the 21st century. The importance of land conditions became an international concern with a dedicated sustainable development goal (SDG), the SDG 15. It calls for developing and finding innovative solutions to follow and evaluate impacts of changing land conditions induced by various driving forces. In Switzerland, drought risk will significantly increase in the coming decades with severe consequences on agriculture, energy production and vegetation. In this paper, we used a 35-year satellite-derived annual and seasonal times-series of normalized difference water index (NDWI) to follow vegetation water content evolution at different spatial and temporal scales across Switzerland and related them to temperature and precipitation to investigate possible responses of changing climatic conditions. Results indicate that there is a small and slow drying tendency at the country scale with a NDWI mean decreasing slope of -0.22%/year for the 23% significant pixels across Switzerland. This tendency is mostly visible below 2000 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.) and in all biogeographical regions. The Southern Alps regions appear to be more responsive to changing drying conditions with a significant and slight negative NDWI trend (-0.39%/year) over the last 35 years. Moreover, NDWI values are mostly a function of temperature at elevations below the tree line rather than precipitation. Findings suggest that multi-annual and seasonal NDWI can be a valuable indicator to monitor vegetation water content at different scales, but other components such as land cover type and evapotranspiration should be considered to better characterize NDWI variability. Satellite Earth Observations data can provide valuable complementary observations for national statistics on the ecological state of vegetation to support SDG 15 to monitor land affected by drying conditions.

TI  - Effects of Label Noise on Performance of Remote Sensing and Deep Learning-Based Water Body Segmentation Models
T2  - CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale management of surface water resources in urban areas can be difficult, especially if the region is subject to monsoonal waterlogging. Deep learning-based methods for computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation, can effectively be applied to remote sensing data for generating water body maps of large cities, aiding managerial entities, urban planners and policymakers. The robustness of these models to erroneous pixel level training class labels has not been studied in water body segmentation context. Label noise is commonly experienced in classification tasks and may hinder the performance. We collected and densely labeled Sentinel-2 images over Dhaka, one of the most densely populated and flood prone megacities in the world. We synthetically injected four types of label noise viz., i) Gaussian noise, ii) translation, ii) rotation, and iv) mirroring. Our primary objective is to observe and quantitatively analyze the effects of label noise on remote sensing data-driven deep learning models for water body segmentation. Our results show that salt and pepper noise (injected artificially using Gaussian noise) of only 50% can cause a massive 48.55% drop in Intersection-over-Union score. The consequences of learning from training data with different magnitudes and settings of label noise have been explored.

TI  - Diabetic eye sentinel: prescreening of diabetic retinopathy using retinal images obtained by a mobile phone camera
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, there are few ophthalmologists in Thailand and other developing countries, and their number has increased slowly. However, there is a rapid growth of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. This makes conventional diabetic retinopathy (DR) prescreening a difficult task. Advances in digital technologies allow the use of portable handheld cameras connected to a mobile phone to obtain retinal fundus images. However, the quality of the mobile phone images is significantly lower and the field of view is narrower than the images from the standard slit-lamp machines. This makes the existing segmentation techniques inefficient. The purpose of this work is to verify the applicability of a hand-held camera with fast computational methods integrated into a mobile phone. Therefore, the paper offers an effective solution called the diabetic eye sentinel (DES). The system segments hemorrhages and exudates in the mobile phone fundus images and detects the DR. The DES is composed of a front-end user interface, back-end computational modules based on a decision tree, the HSV color model, and the edge map. We discuss and analyze the accuracy of the system applied to a dataset of mobile phone images (size = 134) from patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the Thammasat Chalermprakiat Hospital, Pathum Thani, Thailand. The results are compared to a previous version of the algorithm that was based on adaptive thresholding and two other conventional segmentation methods. The numerical experiments show that the proposed system achieves an acceptable accuracy (95.23%), a low false-negative rate (4.76%), and good speed. The proposed system can be used under real clinical conditions.

TI  - A Weberian Reading of Henry James's <i>The Ambassadors</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF LITERARY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the intriguing intersection of the literary work of prolific American writer, Henry James and the theories of German sociologist, Max Weber. In James's oeuvre, The Ambassadors, stands out for depicting the impacts of ascending consumer capitalism in the early twentieth-century in a similar manner to Weber. Through the character representation, the novel symbolically engages with ideas of strict work discipline, moral devotion of Puritanism, and anti-Puritanical worldview. Furthermore, the embodiment of the controversy between supporters of the Puritanical order and the modern lax way of life are explored and represented in James's work. Drawing on this relationship, this paper argues that The Ambassadors shares many of Weber's arguments and ideas concerning the trinity of Puritanism, Protestantism, and capitalism, in spite of the fact that Weber's magnum opus was published two years after The Ambassadors. I intend to bridge the works of Weber and James by exploring how James's fiction forecasts Weberian approaches to Puritanism and the emergence of the capitalist spirit.

TI  - An assessment of Planet satellite imagery for county-wide mapping of rice planting areas in Jiangsu Province, China with one-class classification approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing demand of the spatial distribution of major crops at the field level in recent years for the precision management of farmlands in developing countries. However, most previous studies used low or medium resolution images (e.g. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat) to map the planting areas of rice in various regions of China. As a new source of satellite imagery, the 3 m Planet satellite imagery with daily revisit frequency has rarely been used for mapping crop types. In particular, it is still unclear how well the Planet imagery would perform in mapping the rice planting areas in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Plain of China where image acquisition is strongly limited by rainy and cloudy weather conditions. To overcome the spectral confusion between rice and non-rice vegetation types, this study proposed one-class classification approaches with Planet imagery from the early and late seasons of rice crops over three counties (Guanyun, Rugao and Wujiang) across Jiangsu Province in eastern China. Apart from the traditional use of mono-temporal imagery from the late season (Strategy I), we developed two strategies to make use of the bi-temporal imagery from the early and late seasons, with one being direct classification using stacked images (Strategy II) and the other being stepwise classification (Strategy III). All classifications were performed with the popular machine learning classifier one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) and evaluated from the aspects of classification accuracy and area estimation accuracy.The results showed Strategy I could achieve an overall classification accuracy of 83.02% and kappa coefficient (kappa) of 0.65. The overall accuracy (OA) can be significantly improved by Strategy II (OA = 84.44% and kappa = 0.69) and further by Strategy III (OA = 90.42% and kappa = 0.81). In terms of area estimation, the estimates from Strategy III were consistent with the government reported statistical data with a relative error (RE) within 10% at the county level. At the town level, the correspondence between Planet-derived rice planting areas and the Landsat-8 derived reference data was significantly improved with Strategy III as compared to the other two for Guanyun and Wujiang. The stepwise classification approach (Strategy III) developed with Planet imagery has great values in monitoring rice paddies over the regions with fragmentized distribution of rice fields.

TI  - Communities' Sacred Mountains vs. State-owned Natural Resources - Towards a Rights-based Governance of Cultural and Biological Diversity in China
T2  - NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the multi-nation society of China, disputes related to the beliefs and customs of indigenous communities in the process of the state's natural resources management have been increasing because of sports activities, tourism, extractive industries, hydropower and other infrastructure constructions. From a legal pluralism perspective, with a focus on the Tibetan mountain cult in the Kawagebo (Mt. Meili) mountain area, this research argues the existence of two types of governances based on different worldview, beliefs, normative frameworks and management practices: the community spiritual governance (CSG) and the state resources governance (SRG). By analysing the institutional constraints to, and the potentials of recognising the spiritual significance of, sacred mountains and rights of indigenous communities, this research justifies a pathway of turning SRG towards a 'rights-based governance' for coordinating these conflicts.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Changes of Land Surface Temperature and the Influencing Factors in the Tarim Basin, Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter that affects the water cycle, environmental changes, and energy balance at global and regional scales. Herein, a time series analysis was conducted to estimate the monthly, seasonal, and interannual variations in LST during 2001-2019 in the Tarim Basin, China. Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST, air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, elevation, and land-cover type data, we analyzed the spatio-temporal change characteristics of LST and the influencing factors. High LSTs occurred in the desert and plains and low LSTs occurred in surrounding mountain regions. The highest LST was recorded in July (25.1 degrees C) and the lowest was in January (-9.5 degrees C). On a seasonal scale, LST decreased in the order: summer > spring > autumn > winter. Annual LST showed an increasing trend of 0.2 degrees C/10 a in the desert and mountain areas, while the plains indicated a decreasing trend. In spring and autumn, western regions were dominated by a downward trend, whereas in winter a downward trend occurred in eastern regions. In summer, areas covered by vegetation were dominated by a downward trend, and desert and bare lands were dominated by an upward trend. Random forest (RF) model analysis showed that elevation was the most significant influencing factor (22.1%), followed by mean air temperature (20.1%). Correlation analysis showed that the main climatic factors air temperature, relative humidity, and elevation have a good correlation with the LST. Land-cover type also affected LST; during February-December the lowest LST was observed for permanent glacier snow and the highest was observed in the desert. El Nino and La Nina greatly influenced the LST variations. The North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation indices were consistent with the mean LST anomaly, indicating their considerable influence on LST variations.

TI  - Valuation of Ecosystem Services in South Africa, 2001-2019
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although changes in ecosystems in response to climate and land-use change are known to have implications for the provision of different environmental and ecosystem services, quantifying the economic value of some of these services can be problematic and has not been widely attempted. Here, we used a simplified raster remote sensing model based on MODIS data across South Africa for five different time slices for the period 2001-2019. The aims of the study were to quantify the economic changes in ecosystem services due to land degradation and land-cover changes based on areal values (in USD ha(-1) yr(-1)) for ecosystem services reported in the literature. Results show progressive and systematic changes in land-cover classes across different regions of South Africa for the time period of analysis, which are attributed to climate change. Total ecosystem service values for South Africa change somewhat over time as a result of land-use change, but for 2019 this calculated value is USD 437 billion, which is ~125% of GDP. This is the first estimation of ecosystem service value made for South Africa at the national scale. In detail, changes in land cover over time within each of the nine constituent provinces in South Africa mean that ecosystem service values also change regionally. There is a clear disparity between the provinces with the greatest ecosystem service values when compared to their populations and contribution to GDP. This highlights the potential for untapped ecosystem services to be exploited as a tool for regional sustainable development.</p>

TI  - An integrated approach for evaluating the flash flood risk and potential erosion using the hydrologic indices and morpho-tectonic parameters
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An arid climate and lacking adequate flood management systems are the main reasons for flash flood events in arid and semi-arid areas. The study area is a part of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, Wadi Gharandal subjected to several flooded events during the past decades. The present study incorporated hydrologic indices and morpho-tectonic parameters to identify the potential sediment accumulation and erosion. Integration of hydrologic indices, stream power index, sediment transport, and topographic wetness indices with morpho-tectonic parameters to produce and detect erosion and sedimentation associated with flash floods is the main objective. Consequently, the geographic information system (GIS) and the fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm were implemented for spatial data classification and management. The applied method revealed that the hydrologic and morphometric parameters play major roles in flash flood contributing factors. The low slope areas are associated with low run-off connected with a high sediment accumulation. Conversely, a high level of erosion is encountered in the steeper slope areas. Furthermore, terrain and lithology are decisive in sediment accumulation and erosion risk in the study area. The present study demonstrates the hydrologic and morpho-tectonic parameters with remote sensing data set are efficient tools in evaluating flash floods, potential erosion, and management, supporting the urban planner for future development.

TI  - Remote sensing techniques for tracking changes caused by illegal gold mining in Madre de Dios, Peru
T2  - MISCELLANEA GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal extraction of gold has grown to be a problem in many countries, causing the degradation of the environment. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate changes in tree cover and surface pollution. The development of a mine site has been observed and analysed with images acquired from Landsat and the Sentinel missions. The results of the study showed changes in the state of the environment, strongly suggesting the possibility of ongoing pyrite weathering processes and the transportation of clay materials down watercourses, which can cause not only the further deterioration of the environment but also slow down the natural regeneration of the forest. In addition, research has found disturbing changes in vegetation, showing a loss of tree cover in the Amazon Rainforest as high as 17%. The validity of using remote sensing methods to observe the development of individual mining sites and their characteristics was confirmed.

TI  - Linear features in Osun State, Southwestern Nigeria: qualitative and quantitative study using magnetic and satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzed satellite and aeromagnetic data over Osun State, Southwestern, Nigeria with a view to assessing the surface and subsurface structural settings that may favour mineralization in the study area. To accomplish this goal, airborne magnetic data, Aster Digital Elevation Map, and Landsat-7 ETM + scenes of Osun State were acquired and processed. Several enhancement techniques were applied to improve the quality of the various remotely sensed data sets for visualization and interpretation. The preferential orientations of structural features in the investigated area are northeast-southwest, north-northeast-south-southwest, and northwest-southeast. The northeast-southwest orientation characterized the primary geologic events in the area. The lineament's density analysis revealed that the rocks were affected by high lineament concentration. Remarkable correlations exist between regions of high lineament density and the areas of known mineral occurrences. The lineament seems to play a significant role in providing favorable pathways for the migration and ascent of mineralized fluids to depositional sites. The findings of the present study provide significant information on the linear features and their influence on mineral occurrence in the study area.

TI  - Estimating the phenological dynamics of irrigated rice leaf area index using the combination of PROSAIL and Gaussian Process Regression.
T2  - International journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation : ITC journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The growth of rice is a sequence of three different phenological phases. This sequence of change in rice phenology implies that the condition of the plant during the vegetative phase relates directly to the health of leaves functioning during the reproductive and ripening phases. As such, accurate monitoring is important towards understanding rice growth dynamics. Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important indicator of rice yields and the availability of this information during key phenological phases can support more informed farming decisions. Satellite remote sensing has been adopted as a proxy to field measurements of LAI and with the launch of freely available high resolution Satellite images such as Sentinel-2, it is imperative that accurate retrieval methods are adopted towards monitoring LAI at irrigated rice fields. Here, we evaluate the potential of a hybrid radiative transfer model (i.e., PROSAIL - Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), for estimating the phenological dynamics of irrigated rice LAI using imager derived from the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument. LAI field measurements were obtained from an experimental rice field in Nasarawa state, Nigeria during the dry season. We used the PROSAIL radiative transfer model to create a look up table (LUT) that was subsequently used to train a GPR model. Afterwards, we evaluated the potential of the hybrid modelling approach by assessing the overall model accuracy and the extent to which LAI was able to accurately predict LAI during key rice phenological phases. We compared the predicted hybrid GPR LAI values with LAI values generated from the SNAP toolbox, based on a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling approach. Our results show that the overall predictive accuracy of the hybrid GPR model (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 1.65) was more accurate than that of the hybrid ANN model (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 3.89) for retrieving LAI values from Sentinel-2 imagery. Both models underestimated LAI values during the reproductive and ripening phases . However, the accuracy during the phenological phases were more significant when using the hybrid GPR model (P < 0.05). During the different phenological phases, the hybrid GPR model predicted LAI more accurately during the reproductive (R2 = 0.7) and ripening (R2 = 0.59) phases compared to the hybrid ANN reproductive and ripening phases. When monitoring LAI phenological profiles of both hybrid models, the hybrid GPR and ANN models underestimated LAI during the reproductive and ripening phases. However, the ANN model underestimations were statistically significantly greater than those for the hybrid GPR model (P < 0.05). Our results highlight the potential of hybrid GPR models for estimating the phenological dynamics of irrigated rice LAI from Sentinel-2 data. They provided more accurate estimation of LAI patterns from varying nitrogen and water applications than hybrid ANN models.

T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are common over north-west parts of India during the pre-monsoon season. The main objective of this study is to assess the movement of dust over Indian region during a dust event using the dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) forecast from an operational numerical weather prediction model. Observed values of visibility, wind speed are used to identify the dust events over a point location. In addition, satellite observations for the days prior to, during and after dust events are utilized to ascertain the dust event. The performance of operational NCMRWF Unified Model (NCUM) is analyzed in predicting the values of dust AOD during dust events over north west parts of India. Predicted values of dust AOD are compared with observations available from satellite and ground based network of Aerosol Observation Network (Aeronet).The dust event of 25th May, 2016 observed at Jaipur and Lucknow is well captured by NCUM up to Day-3 forecast. The comparison of predicted dust AOD at point locations Jaipur and Kanpur reveals that NCUM is capable in predicting the high values of AODs during dust event.

TI  - A Review of Crop Water Stress Assessment Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Currently, the world is facing high competition and market risks in improving yield, crop illness, and crop water stress. This could potentially be addressed by technological advancements in the form of precision systems, improvements in production, and through ensuring the sustainability of development. In this context, remote-sensing systems are fully equipped to address the complex and technical assessment of crop production, security, and crop water stress in an easy and efficient way. They provide simple and timely solutions for a diverse set of ecological zones. This critical review highlights novel methods for evaluating crop water stress and its correlation with certain measurable parameters, investigated using remote-sensing systems. Through an examination of previous literature, technologies, and data, we review the application of remote-sensing systems in the analysis of crop water stress. Initially, the study presents the relationship of relative water content (RWC) with equivalent water thickness (EWT) and soil moisture crop water stress. Evapotranspiration and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence are then analyzed in relation to crop water stress using remote sensing. Finally, the study presents various remote-sensing technologies used to detect crop water stress, including optical sensing systems, thermometric sensing systems, land-surface temperature-sensing systems, multispectral (spaceborne and airborne) sensing systems, hyperspectral sensing systems, and the LiDAR sensing system. The study also presents the future prospects of remote-sensing systems in analyzing crop water stress and how they could be further improved.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Urban Sprawl Modeling Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Markov Chain in Baghdad, Iraq
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global and regional land use/cover changes (LUCCs) are experiencing widespread changes, particularly in Baghdad City, the oldest city of Iraq, where it lacks ecological restoration and environmental management actions at present. To date, multiple land uses are experiencing urban construction-related land expansion, population increase, and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the effect of urban sprawl and its rapid LUCC are of great importance to managing land surface resources for sustainable development. The present research applied remote sensing data, such as Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operation Land Imager, on selected images between July and August from 1985 to 2020 with the use of multiple types of software to explore, classify, and analyze the historical and future LUCCs in Baghdad City. Three historical LUCC maps from 1985, 2000, and 2020 were created and analyzed. The result shows that urban construction land expands quickly, and agricultural land and natural vegetation have had a large loss of coverage during the last 35 years. The change analysis derived from previous land use was used as a change direction for future simulation, where natural and anthropogenic factors were selected as the drivers' variables in the process of multilayer perceptron neural network Markov chain model. The future land use/cover change (FLUCC) modeling results from 2030 to 2050 show that agriculture is the only land use type with a massive decreasing trend from 1985 to 2050 compared with other categories. The entire change in urban sprawl derived from historical and FLUCC in each period shows that urban construction land increases the fastest between 2020 and 2030. The rapid urbanization along with unplanned urban growth and rising population migration from rural to urban is the main driver of all transformation in land use. These findings facilitate sustainable ecological development in Baghdad City and theoretically support environmental decision making.

TI  - Post-Drought Groundwater Storage Recovery in California's Central Valley
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater depletion is a major threat to agricultural and municipal water supply in California's Central Valley. Recent droughts during 2007-2009 and 2012-2016 exacerbated chronic groundwater depletion. However, it is unclear how much groundwater storage recovered from drought-related overdrafts during post-drought years, and how climatic conditions and water management affected recovery times. We estimated groundwater storage change in the Central Valley for April 2002 through September 2019 using four methods: GRACE satellite data, a water balance approach, a hydrologic simulation model, and monitoring wells. We also evaluated the sensitivity of drought recovery to different climate scenarios (recent climate +/- droughts and future climate change scenarios: 20 GCMs and 2 RCPs) using water balance method and statistical sampling of historical climate data. Estimated Central Valley groundwater loss during the two droughts ranged from 19 km(3) (2007-2009) to 28 km(3) (2012-2016) (median of four methods). Median aquifer storage recovery was 34% and 19% of the overdraft during the 2010-2011 and 2017-2019 post-drought years, respectively. Numerical experiments show that recovery times are sensitive to climate forcing, with longer recovery times for a future climate scenario that replicate historical climatology relative to historical forcing with no droughts. Overdraft recovery times decrease by similar to 2x with implementation of pumping restrictions (30th to 50th percentiles of historical groundwater depletion) to constrain groundwater depletion relative to no restrictions with a no-drought future climatology. This study highlights the importance of considering water management implications for future drought recoveries within the context of climate change scenarios.

TI  - Mapping Kuwait bathymetry using passive multispectral remote sensing
T2  - KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping bathymetry is essential for many fields, including science, engineering, and the military, among others. Bathymetry is extremely important in the scientific field because it is linked to many physical and environmental issues such as coastal erosion, sea-level rise, and water quality. Traditionally, conventional methods, such as pre-measured cable passage, were used to estimate depths. Lately, echo-sounder assessments were used on hydrograph ships. This method is effective, but it is very costly in both economic and time terms. Remote sensing technology provides modern methods for mapping bathymetry, such as the use of active and passive remote sensing. Many satellite sensors cover multispectral bands. Some are commercial, such as IKONOS and WorldView, while others are freely available, such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. In this study, Landsat 8 (15 meters spatial resolution) was used to estimate the depths of the waters of Kuwait, an Arabian Gulf country located on the Northwestern side of the gulf. Ground truthing points (GTPs) were used to build a bathymetric model of Kuwaiti territorial water (KTW) using the ratio transform algorithm (RTA) applied on Landsat 8 data. The results showed a good ability of Landsat 8 and RTA to estimate the depths of Kuwait's waters, where the relationship between the derived model from Landsat 8 and the GTPs was positive (r(2) = 0.9634). Meanwhile, the accuracy of the derived bathymetric model was evaluated by computing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = +/- 1.66 meters) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE +/- = 1.29).

TI  - Spatial-temporal agricultural production of <i>Citrus x limon</i> and <i>Mangifera indica</i>, using spectral signatures and satellite images
T2  - SCIENTIA AGROPECUARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural production of Citrus x limon (lemon) and Mangifera indica (mango) in the Piura region is often affected by environmental-climatic factors, mainly by possible seasonal changes or extreme weather events, such as droughts or El Nino. The objective is to analyze the spatial-temporal agricultural production of lemon and mango, measuring with the FieldSpec4 spectroradiometer, the spectral signature (SF) and Sentinel 2 satellite images (ISS2) of the Chulucanas criollo mango in crops of Pampa Larga-Alvarados-Suyo-Ayabaca and INIA-Hualtaco-Tambogrande-Piura mango germplasm bank, respectively. The method consists of entering each EF in the ISS2 (2019) mosaic of tiles 17MMR-17MNR-17MPR-17MMQ-17MNQ-17MPQ-17MMP-17MMP-17MNP-17MPP, using SEN2COR280 in SNAP software. The time series of monthly/annual production of lemon and mango were analyzed using data from INEI and SIEA-MIDAGRI-PERU. The results obtained estimate a lemon cultivated area of 27 451.84 ha and mango cultivated area of 22000 ha; higher than the reported harvested area of 16113 ha and 20606 ha, respectively. Mango production 1970-2020, is higher in November-December-January-February, explained by the harvested area in 84.1%, showing seasonality, exponential growth behavior and positive (2003-2020) and negative (1970-2002) anomalies. Monthly lemon production 2007-2020 is seasonal, the annual trend increases by 2.8% despite the existence of negative anomalies in 2017, generated by the effects of the 'Coastal El Nino' in its evolutionary flowering process, forecasting improvement in lemon production in Piura, between 2021 and 2022.

Being profoundly influenced by Dutch neo-Calvinist theology, members of CRCNA promote an idea of confessional plurality, which has resulted in building relationships with Muslim communities. This study is based on fifteen interviews with participants of several Reformed Christian-Muslim groups, a content analysis of mass and social media and a variety of theological documents. Our findings show that these interfaith meetings help develop cohesive neighbourhoods and communities which facilitate new Muslim immigrants' settlement and adjustment in Canada. This paper also points out the opportunities for further fruitful interfaith cooperation, both in the social and political spheres. However, some of the research participants are challenged with distinguishing missionary work and dialogue, which might undermine the work of the community in building bridges between Reformed Christians and Muslims.

TI  - Flood Mitigation in the Transboundary Chenab River Basin: A Basin-Wise Approach from Flood Forecasting to Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and reliable flood information is crucial for minimizing post-event catastrophes in the complex river basins of the world. The Chenab River basin is one of the complex river basins of the world, facing adverse hydrometeorological conditions with unpredictable hydrologic response. Resultantly, many vicinities along the river undergo destructive inundation, resulting in huge life and economic losses. In this study, Hydrologic Engineering Centre-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and HEC-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) models were used for flood forecasting and inundation modeling of the Chenab River basin. The HEC-HMS model was used for peak flow simulation of 2014 flood event using Global Precipitation Mission (GMP) Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals-Final (IMERG-F), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission_Real Time (TRMM_3B42RT), and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation_Near Real Time (GSMaP_NRT) precipitation products. The calibration and validation of the HEC-RAS model were carried out for flood events of 1992 and 2014, respectively. The comparison of observed and simulated flow at the outlet indicated that IMERG-F has good peak flow simulation results. The simulated inundation extent revealed an overall accuracy of more than 90% when compared with satellite imagery. The HEC-RAS model performed well at Manning's n of 0.06 for the river and the floodplain. From the results, it can be concluded that remote sensing integrated with HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS models could be one of the workable solutions for flood forecasting, inundation modeling, and early warning. The concept of integrated flood management (IFM) has also been translated into practical implementation for joint Indo-Pak management for flood mitigation in the transboundary Chenab River basin.

TI  - Role Plays to Enhance Readiness for Practicum: Perceptions of Graduate & Undergraduate Social Work Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although field education is considered the signature pedagogy of social work education, there is a paucity of research examining how Bachelors of Social Work (BSW) and foundation year-Masters of Social Work (FY-MSW) students perceive strategies designed to prepare them for field placement. To enhance readiness for practicum, an interactive role play activity was introduced to BSW and FY-MSW students, and their perspectives of the activity were elicited using focus groups. A thematic analysis of the transcripts resulted in five themes: enhanced perspective-taking, "we have a voice", reflections on supervisory relationship, pressure to excel in student role, and opportunity to practice in a safe space. The findings provide guidance for implementing pre-practicum activities appropriate to students' level of education and training.

TI  - Recurrence plots for quantifying the vegetation indices dynamics in a semi-arid grassland
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands in the Iberian Peninsula are some of the most valuable ecosystems in Europe and are vulnerable because of their location in arid-semiarid regions. Remote sensing techniques have the potential for monitoring grasslands using vegetation indices (VIs), which can reveal bare soil and non-photosynthetic vegetation reflectance in these regions. The temporal variability of the VI time-series is commonly measured as the standard deviation of the records, insufficient to study the system dynamics. Recurrence plots (RP) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) allow us to visualize and quantify system dynamics based on topology. These advanced analyses calculate stochasticity through determinism (DET) and predictability degree based on the average length of diagonal structures (LT). This study aims to evaluate RPs, Cross Recurrence Plots (CRP), and RQA to visualize and quantify VIs and climatic series and their anomalies responses dynamics.The approach was tested at two sites with different agro-climatic characteristics in Central Spain: Guadalix de la Sierra (ZGU) and Soto del Real (ZSO). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), which includes a soil factor, were calculated from MODIS images. Temperature (TEMP) and precipitation (PCP) series were acquired from two meteorological stations close to each site. All the anomalies series were obtained seasonally adjusted to the original ones.RPs showed the different VIs responses in both areas. The MSAVI patterns showed a clear structure, while NDVI presented a noisy pattern showing a higher random behaviour. To quantify these visual differences with RQA, four parameters were calculated, including DET and LT. The MSAVI series and the corresponding anomaly series presented higher DET and LT than the NDVI in both sites. CRPs of VIs with TMIN shows a higher DET in ZGU, suggesting that time synchronization is higher than in ZSO. When CRPs were applied over anomalies series, we could observe that precipitation is more synchronized with VIs anomalies, most likely because of the influence of soil moisture. LT of CRPs in all the cases was low and close to 2, indicating low predictability. Overall, our results suggest that VI time series show a more evident pattern and differentiate both sites better when a variable soil adjustment factor is included. Therefore, in arid-semiarid grasslands, a soil factor should be considered in VI calculations.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Land Cover and the Effects on Ecosystem Service Values in Rupandehi, Nepal from 2005 to 2020
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) is a crucial parameter for studying environmental phenomena. Cutting-edge technology such as remote sensing (RS) and cloud computing have made LC change mapping efficient. In this study, the LC of Rupandehi District of Nepal were mapped using Landsat imagery and Random Forest (RF) classifier from 2005 to 2020 using Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. GEE eases the way in extracting, analyzing, and performing different operations for the earth's observed data. Land cover classification, Centre of gravity (CoG), and their trajectories for all LC classes: agriculture, built-up, water, forest, and barren area were extracted with five-year intervals, along with their Ecosystem service values (ESV) to understand the load on the ecosystem. We also discussed the aspects and problems of the spatiotemporal analysis of developing regions. It was observed that the built-up areas had been increasing over the years and more centered in between the two major cities. Other agriculture, water, and forest classes had been subjected to fluctuations with barren land in the decreasing trend. This alteration in the area of the LC classes also resulted in varying ESVs for individual land cover and total values for the years. The accuracy for the RF classifier was under substantial agreement for such fragmented LCs. Using LC, CoG, and ESV, the paper discusses the need for spatiotemporal analysis studies in Nepal to overcome the current limitations and later expansion to other regions. Studies such as these help in implementing proper plans and strategies by district administration offices and local governmental bodies to stop the exploitation of resources.

TI  - Shallow Water Bathymetry Retrieval Using a Band-Optimization Iterative Approach: Application to New Caledonia Coral Reef Lagoons Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve high accuracy bathymetry retrieval using remote sensing images with robust performance in a 0 to 25 m-deep lagoon with sharp bottom depth variations, a new Iterative Multiple Band Ratio (IMBR) algorithm is tested against known Multiple Band Ratio (MBR) and Single Band Ratio (SBR) algorithms. The test was conducted using the five multispectral bands, at 10 to 60 m resolution, of a Sentinel-2 image of the 25 km(2) Poe lagoon, a UNESCO World Heritage Area. The IMBR approach requires training datasets for the definitions of depth threshold at which optimal band ratios vary. IMBR achieved accuracy, quantified with an original block cross-validation procedure across the entire depth range reached a mean absolute error of 46.0 cm. It compares very favorably against MBR (78.3 cm) and the various SBR results (188-254 cm). The method is suitable for generalization to other sites pending a minimal ground-truth dataset crossing all the depth range being available. We stress that different users may need different precisions and can use MBR or SBR algorithms for their applications. For the hydrodynamic modelling applications that are developing in New Caledonia, the IMBR solutions applied to Sentinel imagery are optimal.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Aedes aegypti Oviposition Temporal Patterns and Their Relationship with Environment and Dengue Incidence
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species that transmits dengue virus among others, is fully adapted to thrive in urban areas. Their activity, however, varies in time and space and this might imply different transmission risk. We hypothesize that the temporal differences in mosquito activity are determined by local environmental conditions. Hence, we explore the existence of groups of temporal patterns in weekly time series of ovitraps records and we associate those patterns to environmental variables derived from remote sensing data and also to dengue incidence. We found three groups of temporal patterns that showed association with land cover diversity, heterogeneity and variability in vegetation and humidity indices estimated over 50-m radius buffer areas surrounding ovitraps. Dengue incidence on a neighborhood basis showed a weak but positive association with the percentage of pixels belonging to one of the patterns detected. The understanding of the spatial distribution of temporal patterns and their environmental determinants might then become relevant to guide the allocation of prevention and monitoring interventions.Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species transmitting dengue, zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses, is fully adapted to thrive in urban areas. The temporal activity of this mosquito, however, varies within urban areas which might imply different transmission risk. In this work, we hypothesize that temporal differences in mosquito activity patterns are determined by local environmental conditions. Hence, we explore the existence of groups of temporal patterns in weekly time series of Ae. aegypti ovitraps records (2017-2019) by means of time series clustering. Next, with the aim of predicting risk in places with no mosquito field data, we use machine learning classification tools to assess the association of temporal patterns with environmental variables derived from satellite imagery and predict temporal patterns over the city area to finally test the relationship with dengue incidence. We found three groups of temporal patterns that showed association with land cover diversity, variability in vegetation and humidity and, heterogeneity measured by texture indices estimated over buffer areas surrounding ovitraps. Dengue incidence on a neighborhood basis showed a weak but positive association with the percentage of pixels belonging to only one of the temporal patterns detected. The understanding of the spatial distribution of temporal patterns and their environmental determinants might then become highly relevant to guide the allocation of prevention and potential interventions. Further investigation is still needed though to incorporate other determinants not considered here.

TI  - Determine the Land-Use Land-Cover Changes, Urban Expansion and Their Driving Factors for Sustainable Development in Gazipur Bangladesh
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, urbanization is a very common phenomenon around the world, especially in developing countries, and has a significant impact on the land-use/land-cover of specific areas, producing some unwanted effects. Bangladesh is a tightly inhabited country whose urban population is increasing every day due to the expansion of infrastructure and industry. This study explores the land-use/land-cover change detection and urban dynamics of Gazipur district, Bangladesh, a newly developed industrial hub and city corporation, by using satellite imagery covering every 10-year interval over the period from 1990 to 2020. Supervised classification with a maximum likelihood classifier was used to gather spatial and temporal information from Landsat 5 (TM), 7 (ETM+) and 8 (OLI/TIRS) images. The Geographical Information System (GIS) methodology was also employed to detect changes over time. The kappa coefficient ranged between 0.75 and 0.90. The agricultural land was observed to be shrinking very rapidly, with an area of 716 km(2) in 2020. Urbanization increased rapidly in this area, and the urban area grew by more than 500% during the study period. The urbanized area expanded along major roads such as the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway and Dhaka bypass road. The urbanized area was, moreover, concentrated near the boundary line of Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. Urban expansion was found to be influenced by demographic-, economic-, location- and accessibility-related factors. Therefore, similarly to many countries, concrete urban and development policies should be formulated to preserve the environment and, thereby, achieve sustainable development goal (SDG) 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

TI  - The Estimation of Iron Oxide Content in Soil based on Landsat 8 OLI TIRS Imagery in Wetland Areas
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland areas are volatile and have high iron content. In this study, through a remote sensing approach, especially using Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) imagery, we discussed the method to estimate the presence of iron oxide in the wetlands of South Kalimantan in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Interpretation of the Landsat OLI TIRS was employed in April 2018, August 2018, February 2019, August 2019, March 2020, and August 2020. The band ratio method was used to determine the distribution of samples in this study. The results of the iron oxide index from the image were performed regression and correlation analysis with field measurement and laboratory test results to validate the oxide index values. The results showed that the iron oxide index value in the dry season was higher than in the rainy season. Iron oxide index value in open land was higher than in vegetation cover. The wetland was in dry condition during the dry season, making it easier to detect iron oxide values. Vegetation cover could reduce the iron oxide index value on the soil surface so that the iron oxide value was more easily identified in open land. The results of linear regression testing for the wet season sample obtained a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.413, while the results of linear regression testing for the dry season sample obtained a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.667. Thus, the Landsat image has strong enough to estimate the iron oxide index in the wetland area of Kalimantan.

TI  - Diagnostic Performance of FDG-PET/CT Scan as Compared to US-Guided FNA in Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Involvement in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic ability of 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-d-glucose (F-18-FDG) PET/non-contrast CT compared with those of ultrasound (US)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) for axillary lymph node (ALN) staging in breast cancer patients.Patients and MethodsPreoperative F-18-FDG PET/non-contrast CT was performed in 268 women with breast cancer, as well as ALN dissection or sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. One hundred sixty-four patients underwent US-guided FNA in combination with F-18-FDG PET/CT. The diagnostic performance of each modality was evaluated using histopathologic assessments as the reference standard. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were compared to evaluate the diagnostic ability of several imaging modalities.ResultsAxillary F-18-FDG uptake was positive in 180 patients, and 125 patients had axillary metastases according to the final pathology obtained by ALN dissection and/or SLN dissection. Of the patients with positive F-18-FDG uptake in the axilla, 21% had false-positive results, whereas 79% were truly positive. Eighty-eight patients had negative F-18-FDG uptake in the axilla, among which 25% were false-negative. F-18-FDG-PET/CT had a sensitivity of 86.59% and a specificity of 63.46% in the assessment of ALN metastasis; on the other hand, US-guided FNA had a sensitivity of 91.67% and a specificity of 87.50%. The mean primary cancer size (p = 0.04) and tumor grade (p = 0.04) in combination were the only factors associated with the accuracy of F-18-FDG PET/CT for detecting metastatic ALNs.ConclusionThe diagnostic performance of F-18-FDG PET/CT for the detection of axillary node metastasis in breast cancer patients was not significantly different from that of US-guided FNA. Combining F-18-FDG PET/CT with US-guided FNA or SLN biopsy could improve the diagnostic performance compared to F-18-FDG PET/CT alone.

TI  - Evaluation of AIRS and CrIS SST Measurements Relative to Three Globally Gridded SST Products Between 2013 and 2019
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally gridded sea surface temperatures (SSTs) provide key data for long-term monitoring of the stability of satellite data. Despite apparent limitations, accurate hyperspectral data can provide useful independent information to critique the stability of global SST products on the annual-to-decadal time scale. We compared data from atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) on EOS Aqua and Crosstrack Interferometer Sounder (CrIS) on SNPP with the SST products from NOAA/NESDIS [real time global (RTG)], the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC), and the U.K. Met Office [Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA)]. For the 2013-2019 period, the overall standard deviation of the difference between AIRS and the RTG was 0.55 K, with an increasing trend over time. In contrast, the standard deviation of the difference between the AIRS, the CMC, and the OSTIA dropped steadily to below 0.4 K, a level previously seen only in SST products relative to independent buoy data. Unexplained biases between the observed and the gridded SSTs at the 100-mK level are consistent with the already existing estimates of the AIRS and CrIS absolute calibration accuracy. However, the AIRS and CrIS observations both show artifacts in all three SST products, increasing with distance from the equator, with the CMC artifacts being the smallest. Even with the CMC, a trend of 4 mK per year relative to AIRS and CrIS was observed between 2013 and 2019 for the 30S-30N oceans. Investigation of the underlying causes of the observed discrepancies requires further work.

TI  - Evaluation of the Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance Algorithm for Large-Scale Mangrove Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are of high biological, economic, and ecological importance globally. Growing within the intertidal zone, they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change in addition to being threatened on local scales by over-exploitation and aquaculture expansion. Long-term monitoring of global mangrove populations is therefore highly important to understanding the impact of these threats. However, data availability from satellites is often limited due to cloud cover. This problem can be mitigated using a season-trend modelling approach such as Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD). COLD operates by using every available observation on a pixel-wise basis, removing the need for whole cloud free images. The approach can be used to better classify land cover by taking into account the underlying seasonal variability, and can also be used to extrapolate between data points to obtain more accurate long term trends. To demonstrate the utility of COLD for global mangrove monitoring, we applied it to five study sites chosen to represent a range of mangrove species, forest types, and quantities of available data. The COLD classifier was trained on the Global Mangrove Watch 2010 dataset and applied to 30 years of Landsat data for each site. By increasing the period between model updates, COLD was successfully applied to all five sites (2253 scenes) in less than four days. The method achieved an overall accuracy of 92% with a User's accuracy of 77% and a Dice score of 0.84 for the mangrove class. The lowest User's accuracy was for North Kalimantan (49.9%) due to confusion with mangrove palms. However, the method performed extremely well for the Niger Delta from the 2000s onwards (93.6%) despite the absence of any Landsat 5 data. Observation of trends in mangrove extent over time suggests that the method was able to accurately capture changes in extent caused by the 2014/15 mangrove die-back event in the Gulf of Carpentaria and highlighted a net loss of mangroves in the Matang Forest Reserve over the last two decades, despite ongoing management. COLD is therefore a promising methodology for global, long-term monitoring of mangrove extent and trends.

TI  - On the TEC bias of altimeter satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 altimeter missions have provided 27 + years of uninterrupted Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements since 1992, with unprecedented precision. Nevertheless, the issue of a possible systematic bias in the data was identified immediately after first TOPEX measurements were compared with measurements from other sources. The bias issue has remained open for decades, and it has increased in complexity because each new mission had its different bias. The purpose of this paper is to assess the problem of TEC bias of altimeters. Two approaches have been followed. The first one relied on the TEC data series of the four altimeters to determine inter-mission systematic biases using the last available data versions for each mission. The second approach consisted of inspecting the missions' official reports to trace changes of the inter-mission and inter-version biases, including biases relative to DORIS ionospheric measurements. Both approaches have converged and resulted in the determination of a reference frame where missions, instruments and ionospheric reference levels could be compared. This reference frame was also used to analyze results published in representative papers during the last decades, including ionospheric data from the ENVISAT mission. This reference frame could help to assess TEC levels of the announced new data version of Jason-2, Jason-3 and the imminent Jason-CS/Sentinel missions. The main conclusion of this work is that Jason-1, 'E' data version, defines a TEC reference level which is compatible with most of the results found in the literature.

TI  - A Deep Learning and GIS Approach for the Optimal Positioning of Wave Energy Converters
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable Energy Sources provide a viable solution to the problem of ever-increasing climate change. For this reason, several countries focus on electricity production using alternative sources. In this paper, the optimal positioning of the installation of wave energy converters is examined taking into account geospatial and technical limitations. Geospatial constraints depend on Land Use classes and seagrass of the coastal areas, while technical limitations include meteorological conditions and the morphology of the seabed. Suitable installation areas are selected after the exclusion of points that do not meet the aforementioned restrictions. We implemented a Deep Neural Network that operates based on heterogeneous data fusion, in this case satellite images and time series of meteorological data. This fact implies the definition of a two-branches architecture. The branch that is trained with image data provides for the localization of dynamic geospatial classes in the potential installation area, whereas the second one is responsible for the classification of the region according to the potential wave energy using wave height and period time series. In making the final decision on the suitability of the potential area, a large number of static land use data play an important role. These data are combined with neural network predictions for the optimizing positioning of the Wave Energy Converters. For the sake of completeness and flexibility, a Multi-Task Neural Network is developed. This model, in addition to predicting the suitability of an area depending on seagrass patterns and wave energy, also predicts land use classes through Multi-Label classification process. The proposed methodology is applied in the marine area of the city of Sines, Portugal. The first neural network achieves 98.7% Binary Classification accuracy, while the Multi-Task Neural Network 97.5% in the same metric and 93.5% in the F1 score of the Multi-Label classification output.

TI  - Investigating Controls on Barrier Island Overwash and Evolution during Extreme Storms
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Over short periods of time, extreme storms can significantly alter barrier island morphology, increasing the vulnerability of coastal habitats and communities relative to future storms. These impacts are complex and the result of interactions between oceanographic conditions and the geomorphic, geological, and ecological characteristics of the island. A 2D XBeach model was developed and compared to observations in order to study these interactions along an undeveloped barrier island near the landfall of Hurricane Florence in 2018. Beachface water levels during the storm were obtained from two cross-shore arrays of pressure sensors for comparison to model hydrodynamics. Aerial drone imagery was used to derive pre-storm and post-storm elevation data in order to quantify spatially varying erosion and overwash. Sediment grain size was measured in multiple locations, and we estimated spatially varying friction by using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The high spatial and temporal resolution of satellite imagery provided an efficient method for incorporating pre-storm spatially varying land cover. While previous studies have focused on the use of spatially varying friction, we found that the utilization of local median grain sizes and full directional wave spectra was critical to reproducing observed overwash extent.

TI  - Hurricane Irma impact on biophysical and biochemical features of canopy vegetation in the Santa Fe River Basin, Florida
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes of biophysical and biochemical features in canopy cover over space and time can be used to elucidate watershed resilience to climate change or extreme weather. Geospatial technologies such as satellite remote sensing are helpful to identify such vegetation dynamics. This paper investigates the landfall impact of Hurricane Irma on canopy cover in the Santa Fe River Basin (Florida), which occurred in August 2017. Specifically, this study explores the effect of Hurricane Irma on vegetation dynamics via biophysical and biochemical features during the pre and post hurricane landfall. The geospatial analysis compares a suite of remote sensing spectral indices including enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and global vegetation moisture index (GVMI). It is noticeable that paired spectral indices such as EVI-LST, GVMI-LST, LAI-LST, EVI-GVMI, EVI-LAI, LAI-FPAR, EVI-FPAR, and LAI-GVMI reflecting the dependent relationships between biophysical and biochemical features reveal varying level of logistic trends under Irma landfall impact. In addition, the evolution of these biophysical and biochemical features associated with the vegetation cover was analyzed in terms of the functional capacity over grassland, evergreen forested land, deciduous forested land, and agricultural land, to understand watershed response following Irma landfall. The functional capacity of the ecosystem reduced in terms of EVI and LAI over these four land-over patterns due to the landfall of Hurricane Irma. The interactions between agricultural land variation and flooding impact before and after the hurricane landfall further entail human impact on natural system in a food-water nexus.

TI  - Hybrid MSRM-Based Deep Learning and Multitemporal Sentinel 2-Based Machine Learning Algorithm Detects Near 10k Archaeological Tumuli in North-Western Iberia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for large-scale automatic detection of burial mounds, one of the most common types of archaeological sites globally, using LiDAR and multispectral satellite data. Although previous attempts were able to detect a good proportion of the known mounds in a given area, they still presented high numbers of false positives and low precision values. Our proposed approach combines random forest for soil classification using multitemporal multispectral Sentinel-2 data and a deep learning model using YOLOv3 on LiDAR data previously pre-processed using a multi-scale relief model. The resulting algorithm significantly improves previous attempts with a detection rate of 89.5%, an average precision of 66.75%, a recall value of 0.64 and a precision of 0.97, which allowed, with a small set of training data, the detection of 10,527 burial mounds over an area of near 30,000 km(2), the largest in which such an approach has ever been applied. The open code and platforms employed to develop the algorithm allow this method to be applied anywhere LiDAR data or high-resolution digital terrain models are available.</p>

TI  - Technologic (R)Evolution Leads to Detection of More Sentinel Nodes in Patients with Melanoma in the Head and Neck Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SN) biopsy (SNB) has proven to be a valuable tool for staging melanoma patients. Since its introduction in the early 1990s, this procedure has undergone several technologic refinements, including the introduction of SPECT/CT, as well as radioguidance and fluorescence guidance. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of this technologic evolution on SNB in the head and neck region. The primary endpoint was the false-negative (FN) rate. Secondary endpoints were number of harvested SNs, overall operation time, operation time per harvested SN, and postoperative complications. Methods: A retrospective database was queried for cutaneous head and neck melanoma patients who underwent SNB at The Netherlands Cancer Institute between 1993 and 2016. The implementation of new detection techniques was divided into 4 groups: 1993-2005, with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative use of both a y-ray detection probe and patent blue (n = 30); 2006-2007, with addition of preoperative road maps based on SPECT/CT (n = 15); 2008-2009, with intraoperative use of a portable y-camera (n = 40); and 2010-2016, with addition of near-infrared fluorescence guidance (n = 192). Results: In total, 277 patients were included. At least 1 SN was identified in all patients. A tumor-positive SN was found in 59 patients (21.3%): 10 in group 1 (33.3%), 3 in group 2 (20.0%), 6 in group 3 (15.0%), and 40 in group 4 (20.8%). Regional recurrences in patients with tumor negative SNs resulted in an overall FN rate of 11.9% (group 1, 16.7%; group 2, 0%; group 3, 14.3%; group 4, 11.1%). The number of harvested nodes increased with advancing technologies (P = 0.003), whereas Breslow thickness and operation time per harvested SN decreased (P = 0.003 and P = 0.017, respectively). There was no significant difference in percentage of tumor-positive SNs, overall operation time, and complication rate between the different groups. Conclusion: The use of advanced detection technologies led to a higher number of identified SNs without an increase in overall operation time, possibly indicating an improved surgical efficiency. Operation time per harvested SN decreased; the average FN rate remained 11.9% and was unchanged over 23 y. There was no significant change in postoperative complication rate.

AB  - Since the publication of the 2018 FIGO Cancer Report, giant strides have been made in the global effort to reduce the burden of cervical cancer, with the World Health Organization (WHO) rolling out a global strategy for cervical cancer elimination, aiming for implementation by 2030. In over 130 countries, including low- and middle-income countries, HPV vaccination is now included in the national program. Screening has seen major advances with wider implementation of HPV testing. These interventions will take a few years to show their impact. Meanwhile, over half a million new cases are added each year. FIGO's revised staging of cervical cancer (2018) has been widely implemented and retrospective analyses of data based on the new staging have been published. Minimally invasive surgery has been shown to be disadvantageous in women with cervical cancer. This chapter discusses the management of cervical cancer based on the stage of disease, including attention to palliation and quality of life issues.

TI  - Estimation of biophysical parameters of rice using Sentinel-1A SAR data in Udham Singh Nagar (Uttarakhand)
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Udham Singh Nagar is the major rice producing area of Uttarakhand state, and falls in Tarai region. Sentinel-1A satellite launched in 2014 as part of the European Union's Copernicus program provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. SAR images are independent of weather conditions and solar illumination and allow observations of different features of earth. The dual polarized (VH and VV) sentinel 1A data has been used to estimate the rice biophysical parameters which are Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR), Crop Height, Biomass and Water Content. The revisit time of Sentinel 1A is 12 days and a higher resolution of 20m. SAR data were pre-processed by applying European Space Agency's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). The SAR maps for various biophysical parameters (Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR), Crop Height, Biomass and Water Content) of rice crop were developed in ENVI- 4.8. The relationship between Sentinel-1A backscattering coefficients sigma 0VV, sigma 0VH and (sigma 0VV/sigma 0VH ) were analyzed, for this multitemporal data of Sentinel-1A were taken from June 2017 to September 2017 over Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand. The regression models were developed between biophysical parameters and ratio of backscattering coefficients (sigma 0VV/sigma 0VH). The value of coefficient of determination for Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR), Crop Height, Biomass and Water Content were found as 0.53, 0.47, 0.50, 0.63, 0.34 respectively which exhibit that these biophysical parameters are significantly, consistently and positively correlated with the ratio of backscattering coefficients (sigma 0VV/sigma 0VH) throughout all growth stages from transplanting, tillering and heading. On the basis of results obtained it can be concluded that Sentinel-1A SAR data has great potential for estimation of biophysical parameters of rice crop.

TI  - Chemical and Biological Oceanographic Conditions in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence during 2020.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - An overview of chemical and biological oceanographic conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2020 is presented as part of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP). AZMP data as well as data from regional monitoring programs are analyzed and presented in relation to long-term means in the context of a strong warming event that began in 2010. These long-term means are now calculated on data from 1999-2020 (1999-2015 in earlier reports). Oxygen levels at 300 m reached a record low concentration in the Estuary and at Rimouski station. Nitrate inventories in the surface layer (0-50 m) of the Gulf were either near or slightly above normal. Nitrate mid layer inventories (50-150 m) were above normal in the northern and central Gulf, while they were close to normal in Magdalen Shallows and Cabot Strait. In the bottom layer (150 m-bottom), positive nitrate anomalies were found in all Gulf regions. Positive deep nitrate anomalies have been observed regularly since 2012 in Cabot Strait and the central Gulf in association with intrusions of warm and salty waters, but they have been rare in the Estuary over the last decade. The recent increase in the nitrate inventory of the bottom layer is mostly associated with negative anomalies of the N:P ratio and positive anomalies of the Si: N ratio. There were strong positive anomalies of vertically integrated chlorophyll a (chl a; 0-100 m) during late summer in the northeast Gulf, during fall in the Estuary, and, to a lesser extent, in the central Gulf during both seasons. Elsewhere, vertically integrated phytoplankton biomass was close to normal except in Cabot Strait, where it was below normal. Most regions have shown either near-normal or above-normal chl a inventories during fall since about 2014. In contrast, phytoplankton biomass derived from satellite data showed negative annual and fall anomalies in most of the ocean colour averaging areas over the last three years. Spring bloom metrics were mostly near normal, except for high bloom amplitudes and magnitudes in the Magdalen Shallows and Cabot Strait boxes. Zooplankton biomass was close to normal almost everywhere in the Gulf; it was only below normal in the central Gulf/Cabot Strait region. Calanus finmarchicus, C. hyperboreus, and large calanoid abundances were also generally close to normal, except that C. hyperboreus abundance was above normal in the northwest Gulf and below normal on the Magdalen Shallows. Small calanoid abundances were near normal everywhere despite record low abundance of Pseudocalanus spp. on the Magdalen Shallows and low abundances in the northwest Gulf and at Rimouski station. Abundances of warm-water associated copepods were slightly above normal in most regions and at a record high on the Magdalen Shallows. The lack of sampling during spring precluded characterization of Calanus finmarchicus phenology at Rimouski station this year.

TI  - Drivers and Barriers Influencing the Willingness to Adopt Technologies for Variable Rate Application of Fertiliser in Lower Austria
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though a broad range of technologies for variable rate application of nitrogen fertiliser is available, there are hardly any documented cases of their use in Austria. In this study, the drivers and barriers of adoption have been investigated. A survey of 242 farmers in Lower Austria was conducted. The survey covered the farmers' economic situation, concerns, and expectations regarding the future of their farms and their interest in precision farming technologies. A choice experiment was included in the survey to elicit farmers' preferences for different features of variable rate application technologies. A series of multinomial logit, mixed logit and latent class logit models were run to analyze the choice experiment. Most farmers were interested in variable rate application, whereas technology costs, yield and environmental improvements were found to be important drivers of adoption. Also, farm size, farming system, technological level and network activities seem to play an important role in the uptake of variable rate application technologies.

TI  - Detection and Analysis of the Causes of Intensive Harmful Algal Bloom in Kamchatka Based on Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the causes of the anomalous harmful algal bloom which occurred in the fall of 2020 in Kamchatka have been detected and analyzed using a long-term time series of heterogeneous satellite and simulated data with respect to the sea surface height (HYCOM) and temperature (NOAA OISST), chlorophyll-a concentration (MODIS Ocean Color SMI), slick parameters (SENTINEL-1A/B), and suspended matter characteristics (SENTINEL-2A/B, C2RCC algorithm). It has been found that the harmful algal bloom was preceded by temperature anomalies (reaching 6 degrees C, exceeding the climatic norm by more than three standard deviation intervals) and intensive ocean level variability followed by the generation of vortices, mixing water masses and providing nutrients to the upper photic layer. The harmful algal bloom itself was manifested in an increase in the concentration of chlorophyll-a, its average monthly value for October 2020 (bloom peak) approached 15 mg/m(3), exceeding the climatic norm almost four-fold for the region of interest (Avacha Gulf). The zones of accumulation of a large amount of biogenic surfactant films registered in radar satellite imagery correlate well with the local regions of the highest chlorophyll-a concentration. The harmful bloom was influenced by river runoff, which intensively brought mineral and biogenic suspensions into the marine environment (the concentration of total suspended matter within the plume of the Nalycheva River reached 10 mg/m(3) and more in 2020), expanding food resources for microalgae.

TI  - Optimizing Top Dressing Nitrogen Fertilization Using VENμS and Sentinel-2 L1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental and economic constraints are forcing farmers to be more precise in the rates and timing of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to wheat. In practice, N is frequently applied without knowledge of the precise amount needed or the likelihood of significant protein enhancement. The objective of this study was to help farmers optimize top dress N application by adopting the use of within-field reference N strips. We developed an assisting app on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to map the spatial variability of four different vegetation indices (VIs) in each field by calculating the mean VI, masking extreme values (three standard deviations, 3 sigma) of each field, and presenting the anomaly as a deviation of +/-sigma and +/- 2 sigma or deviation of percentage. VIs based on red-edge bands (REIP, NDRE, ICCI) were very useful for the detection of wheat above ground N uptake and in-field anomalies. VEN mu S high temporal and spatial resolutions provide advantages over Sentinel-2 in monitoring agricultural fields during the growing season, representing the within-field variations and for decision making, but the spatial coverage and accessibility of Sentinel-2 data are much better. Sentinel-2 data is already available on the GEE platform and was found to be of much help for the farmers in optimizing topdressing N application to wheat, applying it only where it will increase grain yield and/or grain quality. Therefore, the GEE anomaly app can be used for top-N dressing application decisions. Nevertheless, there are some issues that must be tested, and more research is required. To conclude, satellite images can be used in the GEE platform for anomaly detection, rendering results within a few seconds. The ability to use L1 VEN mu S or Sentinel-2 data without atmospheric correction through GEE opens the opportunity to use these data for several applications by farmers and others.

TI  - SENTINEL 2 IMAGERY AND BURN RATIOS FOR ASSESSING THE JULY 5, 2021 WILDFIRES SEVERITY IN THE REGION OF KHENCHELA (NORTHEAST ALGERIA)
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire events are majeure natural risks occurring in multiple ecosystems worldwide, and lead to significant damages on their human, ecological and socioeconomic components. This research interested on evaluating and mapping the recent and exceptional wildfires occurred in the Aures Mounts System near Ain Mimoun in July 5, 2021. Multidates Sentinel 2 images, the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio dNBR and its Relativized dNBR (RdNBR) have been used for extract and evaluate the recently burned areas. Results reveal that he July 5 wildfires lead to the loss of 6,607 ha (9 %) of Aleppo pine forest cover and municipalities of Tamza and Chelia were more damaged, with respectively 4,143 and 2,166 ha of burned superficies. In addition to the high-vulnerability to fire risk occurrence, essentially due to topographic and morphological features, the study area exhibited also favoring climatic features before and during the fire event occurrence, high daily temperatures and high variable wind directions were prominent factors in accelerating the fire spreading and increasing the fire extent. This study concludes that Sentinel 2, dNBR and especially RdNBR are effective geoinformatic data and indices for assessing, classifying and mapping burn severity extent due to wildfire events. To attenuate damages, it is necessary to adopt risk mitigation plans based on efficient measures to be applied before, during and after the fire events occurrence.

TI  - Improving living biomass C-stock loss estimates by combining optical satellite, airborne laser scanning, and NFI data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Policy measures and management decisions aimed at enhancing the role of forests in mitigating climate change require reliable estimates of carbon (C)-stock dynamics in greenhouse gas inventories (GHGIs). The aim of this study was to assemble design-based estimators to provide estimates relevant for GHGIs using National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. We improve basic expansion (BE) estimators of living-biomass C-stock loss using only field data, by leveraging with remote sensing auxiliary data in model-assisted (MA) estimators. Our case studies from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Latvia covered an area of >70 Mha. Landsat-based forest cover loss (FCL) and one-time wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning (ALS) served as auxiliary data. ALS provided information on the C stock before a potential disturbance indicated by FCL. The use of FCL in MA estimators resulted in considerable efficiency gains, which in most cases were further increased by adding ALS. A doubling of efficiency was possible for national estimates and even larger efficiencies were observed at the subnational level. Average annual estimates were considerably more precise than pooled estimates of the NFI data from all years at once. The combination of remotely sensed and NFI field data yields reliable estimators, which is not necessarily the case when using remotely sensed data without reference observations.

TI  - Identification of Infiltration Features and Hydraulic Properties of Soils Based on Crop Water Stress Derived from Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties is important for many reasons, e.g., for soil erosion protection, or the assessment of surface and subsurface runoff. Nowadays, precision agriculture is gaining importance for which knowledge of soil hydraulic properties is essential, especially when it comes to the optimization of nitrogen fertilization. The present work aimed to exploit the ability of vegetation cover to identify the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties through the expression of water stress. The assessment of the spatial distribution of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and field water capacity (FWC) was based on a combination of ground-based measurements and thermal and hyperspectral airborne imaging data. The crop water stress index (CWSI) was used as an indicator of crop water stress to assess the hydraulic properties of the soil. Supplementary vegetation indices were used. The support vector regression (SVR) method was used to estimate soil hydraulic properties from aerial data. Data analysis showed that the approach estimated Ks with good results (R2 = 0.77) for stands with developed crop water stress. The regression coefficient values for estimation of FWC for topsoil (0-0.3 m) ranged from R-2 = 0.38 to R-2 = 0.99. The differences within the study sites of the FWC estimations were higher for the subsoil layer (0.3-0.6 m). R-2 values ranged from 0.12 to 0.99. Several factors affect the quality of the soil hydraulic features estimation, such as crop water stress development, condition of the crops, period and time of imaging, etc. The above approach is useful for practical applications for its relative simplicity, especially in precision agriculture.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Using an AutoML Framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The risks associated with landslides are increasing the personal losses and material damages in more and more areas of the world. These natural disasters are related to geological and extreme meteorological phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes) occurring in regions that have already suffered similar previous natural catastrophes. Therefore, to effectively mitigate the landslide risks, new methodologies must better identify and understand all these landslide hazards through proper management. Within these methodologies, those based on assessing the landslide susceptibility increase the predictability of the areas where one of these disasters is most likely to occur. In the last years, much research has used machine learning algorithms to assess susceptibility using different sources of information, such as remote sensing data, spatial databases, or geological catalogues. This study presents the first attempt to develop a methodology based on an automatic machine learning (AutoML) framework. These frameworks are intended to facilitate the development of machine learning models, with the aim to enable researchers focus on data analysis. The area to test/validate this study is the center and southern region of Guerrero (Mexico), where we compare the performance of 16 machine learning algorithms. The best result achieved is the extra trees with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.983. This methodology yields better results than other similar methods because using an AutoML framework allows to focus on the treatment of the data, to better understand input variables and to acquire greater knowledge about the processes involved in the landslides.</p>

TI  - Weather Conditions Conducive for the Early-Season Production and Dispersal of <i>Cercospora beticola</i> Spores in the Great Lakes Region of North America
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - In many parts of the world including the Great Lakes region of North America, Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), caused by the fungal pathogen Cercospora beticola, is a major foliar disease of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). Management of CLS involves an integrated approach which includes the application of fungicides. To guide fungicide application timings, disease prediction models are widely used by sugar beet growers in North America. While these models have generally worked well, they have not included information about pathogen presence. Thus, incorporating spore production and dispersal could make them more effective. The current study used sentinel beets to assess the presence of C. beticola spores in the environment early in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. Weather variables including air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, leaf wetness, wind speed, and solar radiation were collected. These data were used to identify environmental variables that correlated with spore levels during a time when CLS is not generally observed in commercial fields. C. beticola spores were detected during mid-April both years, which is much earlier than previously reported. A correlation was found between spore data and all the weather variables examined during at least one of the two years, except for air temperature. In both years, spore presence was significantly correlated with rainfall (P < 0.0001) as well as relative humidity (P < 0.0090). Rainfall was particularly intriguing, with an adjusted R-2 of 0.3135 in 2017 and 0.1652 in 2018. Efforts are ongoing to investigate information on spore presence to improve prediction models and CLS management.

TI  - Satellite and Ground Estimates of Surface and Canopy-Layer Urban Heat Island: Comparison and Caveats
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOSPATIAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect is one of the prominent impacts of urbanization that affects human health and energy consumption. As the data is limited and inconsistent, UHI comparative studies between UHIUCL and UHISurf on the seasonal scale are limited. The use of only daytime summer imagery reporting "Inverted UHI" undermines the holistic view of the phenomenon. Therefore, this study analyses the seasonal patterns for UHISurf and UHIUCL in three climate zones (Delhi, Pune, and Montreal). The three cities experience a high traditional night-time UHIUCL (Delhi 7 degrees C, Pune 6 degrees C, Montreal 1.89 degrees C). Landsat captures a prominent daytime UHISurf (15 degrees C) in Montreal with temperate climate and daytime inverted UHISurf (-4 degrees C) for Delhi in summer. Seasonally, the nighttime UHI is prominent in summer and monsoon for Delhi, summer and spring for Pune, and summer for Montreal. Due to UHI effect, the heatwaves can be more intense in semi-arid and tropical cities than temperate cities.

TI  - Monitoring of Expansive Clays over Drought-Rewetting Cycles Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - New capabilities for measuring and monitoring are needed to prevent the shrink-swell risk caused by drought-rewetting cycles. A clayey soil in the Loire Valley at Chaingy (France) has been instrumented with two extensometers and several soil moisture sensors. Here we show by direct comparison between remote and in situ data that the vertical ground displacements due to clay expansion are well-captured by the Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) technique. In addition to the one-year period, two sub-annual periods that reflect both average ground shrinking and swelling timeframes are unraveled by a wavelet-based analysis. Moreover, the relative phase difference between the vertical displacement and surface soil moisture show local variations that are interpreted in terms of depth and thickness of the clay layer, as visualized by an electrical resistivity tomography. With regard to future works, a similar treatment relying fully on remote sensing observations may be scaled up to map larger areas in order to better assess the shrink-swell risk.</p>

TI  - Fusion of Multi-Temporal PAZ and Sentinel-1 Data for Crop Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate identification of crops is essential to help environmental sustainability and support agricultural policies. This study presents the use of a Spanish radar mission, PAZ, to classify agricultural areas with a very high spatial resolution. PAZ was recently launched, and it operates at X band, joining the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation along with TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites. Owing to its novelty and its ability to classify crop areas (both taking individually its time series and blending with the Sentinel-1 series), it has been tested in an agricultural area of the central-western part of Spain during 2020. The random forest algorithm was selected to classify the time series under five alternatives of standalone/fused data. The map accuracy resulting from the PAZ series standalone was acceptable, but it highlighted the need for a denser time-series of data. The overall accuracy provided by eight PAZ images or by eight Sentinel-1 images was below 60%. The fusion of both sets of eight images improved the overall accuracy by more than 10%. In addition, the exploitation of the whole Sentinel-1 series, with many more observations (up to 40 in the same temporal window) improved the results, reaching an overall accuracy around 76%. This overall performance was similar to that obtained by the joint use of all the available images of the two frequency bands (C and X).

TI  - Urban Water Quality Assessment Based on Remote Sensing Reflectance Optical Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, increasing water pollution means that monitoring and evaluating urban water quality are of great importance. Although highly accurate, traditional evaluation methods are time consuming, laborious, and vastly insufficient in terms of the continuity of spatiotemporal coverage. In this study, a water quality assessment method based on remote sensing reflectance optical classification and the traditional grading principle is proposed. In this method, an optical water type (OWT) library was first constructed using the measured in situ remote sensing reflectance dataset based on fuzzy clustering technology. Then, comprehensive scoring rules were established by combining OWTs and 12 water quality parameters, and water quality was graded into different urban water quality levels (UWQLs) based on the scoring results. Using the proposed method, the relative water quality of urban waterbodies was qualitatively evaluated at the macro level based on images from the multispectral imager of Sentinel-2. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the UWQLs and the water quality index (WQI). These results indicate the potential of this method for quantitative assessment of urban water quality, providing a new way to evaluate water quality using remote sensing algorithms in the future.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance for bacterial pneumonia and meningitis in children under the age of 5 in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Colombia-2016
T2  - BIOMEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Bacterial pneumonia and meningitis are vaccine-preventable diseases. Sentinel surveillance provides relevant information about their behavior.Objective: To present the data from sentinel surveillance carried out at the Fundacion HOMI, Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico La Misericordia in 2016.Materials and methods: We conducted a descriptive study from January 1 to December 31, 2016, on the daily surveillance of patients under 5 years of age diagnosed with pneumonia or bacterial meningitis according to PAHO's definitions. We identified the microorganisms using the automated VITEK (TM) 2 system. Bacterial isolates were sent to the Microbiology Group at the Colombian Instituto Nacional de Salud for confirmation, serotyping, phenotypic, and genotypic characterization. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were established.Results: From 1,343 suspected cases of bacterial pneumonia, 654 (48.7%) were probable, 84% had complete Hib vaccination schedules, and 87% had complete pneumococcal vaccination schedules for age. Blood culture was taken in 619 (94.6%) and 41 (6.6%) were positive while S. pneumoniae was isolated in 17 (41%) of them. The most frequent serotype was 19A in five cases (29.4%), and four 19A serotypes were associated with the reference isolate ST320. The incidence rate of probable bacterial pneumonia was 7.3 cases/100 hospitalized patients, and lethality was 2.1%. As for bacterial meningitis, 22 suspected cases were reported, 12 (54%) were probable, four (33%) were confirmed: two by Escherichia coli and two by group C N. meningitidis. The incidence of probable bacterial meningitis was 0.14 cases/100 hospitalized patients.Conclusion: Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 19A and 3 were the most frequent cause of pneumonia. Spn19A is related to the multi-resistant clone ST320. Strengthening and continuing this strategy will allow understanding the impact of vaccination.

AB  - We present a case of a 49-year Turkish woman who had synchronous renal leiomyoma and breast cancer. The patient was evaluated for a suspicious breast mass; and renal mass was detected incidentally by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Diagnostic tru-cut biopsy was performed for both masses. Breast mass biopsy was reported as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) while renal biopsy was described as benign mesenchymal tumour. According to the biopsy results, the renal mass was followed for six months. For breast cancer, segmental mastectomy and concomitant sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Histologically, the tumour was reported as IDC and low-grade cribriform ductal carcinoma in situ (less than 1%). Six months later, renal mass was excised by laparoscopic approach. Histopathological examination was consistent with renal leiomyoma. For both tumours, no recurrence within one year was found on follow-up.

TI  - Assessing the burden of dengue among household members in Alaminos, Laguna, the Philippines: a prospective cohort study
T2  - ASIAN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The incidence of dengue is increasing rapidly and is a challenging health issue in the Philippines. Epidemiological data are largely based on a passive-surveillance reporting system, which leads to substantial underreporting of cases. Objectives: To estimate dengue infection and disease incidence prospectively at the community level in an endemic area of the Philippines using an active surveillance strategy. Methods: We implemented active surveillance in the highly endemic community of Alaminos, Laguna. The study consisted of a 1-year follow-up with 2 visits scheduled at the start and end of the study, as well as regular active surveillance in between and unscheduled visits for suspected cases. Blood samples were collected and analyzed to detect dengue during the first scheduled visit and all unscheduled visits, and clinical examination was performed at all visits (registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT02766088). Results: We enrolled 500 participants, aged from 6 months to 50 years; 76.2% were found positive for immunoglobulin G (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.9-80.0), with 92.0% among those aged 9-17 years. Active (weekly) surveillance identified 4 virologically confirmed cases of dengue (incidence proportion 0.8; 95% CI 0.3-2.1); all in participants aged <= 14 years. Conclusions: Routine surveillance programs such as sentinel sites are needed to characterize the entire clinical spectrum of symptomatic dengue, disease incidence, and transmission in the community.

TI  - All-sky Data Assimilation of MWTS-2 and MWHS-2 in the Met Office Global NWP System
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave radiances from passive polar-orbiting radiometers have been, until recently, assimilated in the Met Office global numerical weather prediction system after the scenes significantly affected by atmospheric scattering are discarded. Recent system upgrades have seen the introduction of a scattering-permitting observation operator and the development of a variable observation error using both liquid and ice water paths as proxies of scattering-induced bias. Applied to the Fengyun 3 Microwave Temperature Sounder 2 (MWTS-2) and the Microwave Humidity Sounder 2 (MWHS-2), this methodology increases the data usage by up to 8% at 183 GHz. It also allows for the investigation into the assimilation of MWHS-2 118 GHz channels, sensitive to temperature and lower tropospheric humidity, but whose large sensitivity to ice cloud have prevented their use thus far. While the impact on the forecast is mostly neutral with small but significant short-range improvements, 0.3% in terms of root mean square error, for southern winds and low-level temperature, balanced by 0.2% degradations of short-range northern and tropical low-level temperature, benefits are observed in the background fit of independent instruments used in the system. The lower tropospheric temperature sounding Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) channels see a reduction of the standard deviation in the background departure of up to 1.2%. The Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit A (AMSU-A) stratospheric sounding channels improve by up to 0.5% and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) humidity sounding channels improve by up to 0.4%.

TI  - The Role of High-Volume Ranches as Cattle Suppliers: Supply Chain Connections and Cattle Production in Mato Grosso
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's zero-deforestation Cattle Agreements (CAs) have influenced the supply chain but their impact on deforestation has been limited in part because slaughterhouses monitor deforestation only on the properties they buy from directly. Consequently, deforestation continues to enter the supply chain indirectly from properties that are not monitored. Knowledge gaps and data limitations have made it challenging to close this loophole and achieve meaningful reductions in deforestation. Here we leverage our large property-level supply chain database that links together six years of records from the Animal Transport Guide (GTA), high-resolution satellite data, property boundaries, and land cover data to quantify different types of supply chain connections and characterize cattle production in Mato Grosso. We find that a relatively small number of high-volume suppliers-defined as the top 5% of cattle suppliers in terms of the volume of cattle sold-supplied 50-60% of the total volume purchased by major slaughterhouses. One-fourth of high-volume direct suppliers cleared forest between 2009-2018, and 90% of them also bought from indirect suppliers with deforestation, leading these high-volume direct suppliers to act as funnels for deforestation into the supply chain. Because they serve as important hubs in the supply chain, high-volume suppliers may represent a key starting point to expand the CAs to cover large numbers of indirect suppliers.

TI  - Estimating Corn Canopy Water Content From Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI): An Optimized NDWI-Based Scheme and Its Feasibility for Retrieving Corn VWC
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, four normalized difference water index (NDWI) variants, i.e., NDWI(860,970), NDWI(860,1240), NDWI(860,1640), and NDWI(1240,1640) are generated from the corn-oriented PROSAIL radiative transfer model. It is found that, instead of the linear relationship derived in previous studies, corn canopy water content (CWC) is best approximated as an exponential function of NDWI. Following the analysis of the PROSAIL-generated results, a newly optimized NDWI-based scheme is proposed for estimating corn CWC according to variations in the performance of the four NDWI variants under different CWC conditions. Validation results based on independent field data from the SMEX02, HiWATER2012, and Baoding2018 field experiments verify that this optimized NDWI-based corn CWC estimating scheme has a higher accuracy (R = 0.87 +/- 0.03, RMSE = 0.2068 +/- 0.0145 kg/m(2)) than existing NDWI-based strategies for corn CWC retrieval. The feasibility of retrieving corn vegetation water content (VWC) based on the optimized NDWI-based scheme is also investigated, and the superiority of the optimized NDWI-based scheme for retrieving corn VWC is assessed. By comparing with four other NDWI-based corn VWC estimating methods, as well as the corn VWC parameterization scheme applied in the SMAP soil moisture algorithm, it is shown that our optimized NDWI-based scheme has the best VWC estimation accuracy, with the highest R of 0.89 +/- 0.02 and the lowest RMSE of 0.7179 +/- 0.0555 kg/m(2).

TI  - Evaluating the Ability to Use Contextual Features Derived from Multi-Scale Satellite Imagery to Map Spatial Patterns of Urban Attributes and Population Distributions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With an increasing global population, accurate and timely population counts are essential for urban planning and disaster management. Previous research using contextual features, using mainly very-high-spatial-resolution imagery (<2 m spatial resolution) at subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps, textures, and the raw spectral signatures calculated over groups of pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally, previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka, Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These relationships were compared to determine what components of the human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial resolution and location impact the predictive power of these relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R-2 values up to 93%. Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2 contextual features explained up to 84% of the out-of-sample variation for population density.

TI  - Evaluation of Clumping Effects on the Estimation of Global Terrestrial Evapotranspiration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In terrestrial ecosystems, leaves are aggregated into different spatial structures and their spatial distribution is non-random. Clumping index (CI) is a key canopy structural parameter, characterizing the extent to which leaf deviates from the random distribution. To assess leaf clumping effects on global terrestrial ET, we used a global leaf area index (LAI) map and the latest version of global CI product derived from MODIS BRDF data as well as the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) to estimate global terrestrial ET. The results show that global terrestrial ET in 2015 was 511.9 +/- 70.1 mm yr(-1) for Case I, where the true LAI and CI are used. Compared to this baseline case, (1) global terrestrial ET is overestimated by 4.7% for Case II where true LAI is used ignoring clumping; (2) global terrestrial ET is underestimated by 13.0% for Case III where effective LAI is used ignoring clumping. Among all plant functional types (PFTs), evergreen needleleaf forests were most affected by foliage clumping for ET estimation in Case II, because they are most clumped with the lowest CI. Deciduous broadleaf forests are affected by leaf clumping most in Case III because they have both high LAI and low CI compared to other PFTs. The leaf clumping effects on ET estimation in both Case II and Case III is robust to the errors in major input parameters. Thus, it is necessary to consider clumping effects in the simulation of global terrestrial ET, which has considerable implications for global water cycle research.

TI  - Missing Burns in the High Northern Latitudes: The Case for Regionally Focused Burned Area Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global estimates of burned areas, enabled by the wide-open access to the standard data products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are heavily relied on by scientists and managers studying issues related to wildfire occurrence and its worldwide consequences. While these datasets, particularly the MODIS MCD64A1 product, have fundamentally improved our understanding of wildfire regimes at the global scale, their performance may be less reliable in certain regions due to a series of region- or ecosystem-specific challenges. Previous studies have indicated that global burned area products tend to underestimate the extent of the burned area within some parts of the boreal domain. Despite this, global products are still being regularly used by research activities and management efforts in the northern regions, likely due to a lack of understanding of the spatial scale of their Arctic-specific limitations, as well as an absence of more reliable alternative products. In this study, we evaluated the performance of two widely used global burned area products, MCD64A1 and FireCCI51, in the circumpolar boreal forests and tundra between 2001 and 2015. Our two-step evaluation shows that MCD64A1 has high commission and omission errors in mapping burned areas in the boreal forests and tundra regions in North America. The omission error overshadows the commission error, leading to MCD64A1 considerably underestimating burned areas in these high northern latitude domains. Based on our estimation, MCD64A1 missed nearly half the total burned areas in the Alaskan and Canadian boreal forests and the tundra during the 15-year period, amounting to an area (74,768 km(2)) that is equivalent to the land area of the United States state of South Carolina. While the FireCCI51 product performs much better than MCD64A1 in terms of commission error, we found that it also missed about 40% of burned areas in North America north of 60 & DEG; N between 2001 and 2015. Our intercomparison of MCD64A1 and FireCCI51 with a regionally adapted MODIS-based Arctic Boreal Burned Area (ABBA) shows that the latter outperforms both MCD64A1 and FireCCI51 by a large margin, particularly in terms of omission error, and thus delivers a considerably more accurate and consistent estimate of fire activity in the high northern latitudes. Considering the fact that boreal forests and tundra represent the largest carbon pool on Earth and that wildfire is the dominant disturbance agent in these ecosystems, our study presents a strong case for regional burned area products like ABBA to be included in future Earth system models as the critical input for understanding wildfires' impacts on global carbon cycling and energy budget.</p>

TI  - Employing deep learning for automatic river bridge detection from SAR images based on Adaptively effective feature fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic river bridge detection is a typical and valuable application for SAR image analysis. However, the background information of SAR image is complex, and there are many specious targets with similar features, such as road, ponds and ridges, which usually cause false alarms. And current river bridge detection methods fail to handle these interference efficiently. Therefore, this paper applies deep learning to SAR and proposes a new river bridge detection algorithm, which is named as Single Short Detection-Adaptively Effective Feature Fusion (SSD-AEFF). It can effectively reduce the interference of noisy information, and achieve fast and high-precision detection of river bridges in complex SAR imagery. SSD-AEFF is based on SSD, and AEFF module is innovated to enhance the multi-scale feature maps together with effective Squeeze-Excitation (eSE) module to further fuse effective features and decrease the interference of background information. Additionally, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is used to screen out redundant candidate boxes to produce the final detection result. Moreover, Gradient Harmonizing Mechanism (GHM) loss function is introduced to solve the problem of sample imbalance in the training process. Experimental results on TerraSAR data compared with existing baseline models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SSD-AEFF algorithm.

TI  - Sub-annual tropical forest disturbance monitoring using harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate sub-annual detection of forest disturbance provides timely baseline information for understanding forest change and dynamics to support the development of sustainable forest management strategies. Tradi-tionally, Landsat imagery was widely used to monitor forest disturbance, but the low temporal density of Landsat observations limits the timely detection of forest disturbance. Recently a new harmonized dataset of Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery (HLS) has been created to increase the density of observations and provide more frequent images, but the added-value of this dataset for sub-annual tropical forest disturbance monitoring has not been investigated yet. Here, we used all available HLS images acquired from 2016 to 2019 to detect forest disturbance at two tropical forest sites in Tanzania and Brazil. Based on HLS data, forest disturbance was detected by combining normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series using BFAST monitor and random forest algorithms. To assess the added-value of the HLS time series, we also detected forest disturbance from (i) Landsat-8/OLI time series only and (ii) Sentinel-2 time series only data. The spatial accuracy assessment of forest disturbance detection at the Tanzania site shows that the com-bined Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2 data achieved the highest overall accuracy (84.5%), more than 3.5% higher than the accuracy of using only Landsat-8/OLI or Sentinel-2. Similarly, for the Brazil site, the overall accuracy of using the combined Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2 data was 95.5%, at least 2% higher than others. In terms of temporal accuracy, the mean time lag of 2.0 months, was achieved from the combined data and Sentinel-2 only at the Tanzania site. This mean time lag is at least one month shorter than that of using Landsat-8/OLI only (3.3 months). At the Brazil site, the mean time lag of forest disturbance detection based on the combined data was 0.22 months, shorter by 0.50 and 0.15 months when compared to using Landsat-8/OLI only (0.72 months) or Sentinel-2 only (0.37 months), respectively. Our results indicate that HLS data is promising for accurate and timely forest disturbance detection particularly in the moist forest where cloud cover is often high.

TI  - Rapid Mapping and Annual Dynamic Evaluation of Quality of Urban Green Spaces on Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to green spaces, monitoring dynamic urban green spaces (UGSs) in cities around the world is crucial. Continuous dynamic UGS mapping is challenged by large computation, time consumption, and energy consumption requirements. Therefore, a fast and automated workflow is needed to produce a high-precision UGS map. In this study, we proposed an automatic workflow to produce up-to-date UGS maps using Otsu's algorithm, a Random Forest (RF) classifier, and the migrating training samples method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We took the central urban area of Beijing, China, as the study area to validate this method, and we rapidly obtained an annual UGS map of the central urban area of Beijing from 2016 to 2020. The accuracy assessment results showed that the average overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (KC) were 96.47% and 94.25%, respectively. Additionally, we used six indicators to measure quality and temporal changes in the UGS spatial distribution between 2016 and 2020. In particular, we evaluated the quality of UGS using the urban greenness index (UGI) and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) at the pixel level. The experimental results indicate the following: (1) The UGSs in the center of Beijing increased by 48.62 km(2) from 2016 to 2020, and the increase was mainly focused in Chaoyang, Fengtai, and Shijingshan Districts. (2) The average proportion of relatively high and above levels (UGI > 0.5) in six districts increased by 2.71% in the study area from 2016 to 2020, and this proportion peaked at 36.04% in 2018. However, our result revealed that the increase was non-linear during this assessment period. (3) Although there was no significant increase or decrease in SHDI values in the study area, the distribution of the SHDI displayed a noticeable fluctuation in the northwest, southwest, and northeast regions of the study area between 2016 and 2020. Furthermore, we discussed and analyzed the influence of population on the spatial distribution of UGSs. We found that three of the five cold spots were located in the east and southeast of Haidian District. Therefore, the proposed workflow could provide rapid mapping and dynamic evaluation of the quality of UGS.</p>

TI  - The Influence of Sky View Factor on Daytime and Nighttime Urban Land Surface Temperature in Different Spatial-Temporal Scales: A Case Study of Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban building morphology has a significant impact on the urban thermal environment (UTE). The sky view factor (SVF) is an important structure index of buildings and combines height and density attributes. These factors have impact on the land surface temperature (LST). Thus, it is crucial to analyze the relationship between SVF and LST in different spatial-temporal scales. Therefore, we tried to use a building vector database to calculate the SVF, and we used remote sensing thermal infrared band to retrieve LST. Then, we analyzed the influence between SVF and LST in different spatial and temporal scales, and we analyzed the seasonal variation, day-night variation, and the impact of building height and density of the SVF-LST relationship. We selected the core built-up area of Beijing as the study area and analyzed the SVF-LST relationship in four periods in 2018. The temporal experimental results indicated that LST is higher in the obscured areas than in the open areas at nighttime. In winter, the maximum mean LST is in the open areas. The spatial experimental results indicate that the SVF and LST relationship is different in the low SVF region, with 30 m and 90 m pixel scale in the daytime. This may be the shadow cooling effect around the buildings. In addition, we discussed the effects of building height and shading on the SVF-LST relationship, and the experimental results show that the average shading ratio is the largest at 0.38 in the mid-rise building area in winter.

TI  - A Feature Discretization Method for Classification of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images in Coastal Areas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature discretization is one of the most relevant techniques for data preprocessing in remote sensing research area. Its main goal is to transform the continuous features of images into discrete ones to improve the efficiency of intelligent image processing algorithms, thus helping experts to more easily understand and use the acquired remote sensing data. In this article, we focus on feature discretization for classification of high-resolution remote sensing images in coastal areas. In these images, interactions among multiple bands exist, noises interfere, and maritime domain-specific prior knowledge is difficult to get. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid metric method, based on information entropy and chi-square test, to calculate the stability of the discrete interval and the similarity of adjacent intervals. In addition, we use the degree of dependence among knowledge from the rough set theory as the evaluation criterion for discretization schemes and then scan each band in turn with the strategy of first splitting then merging, to obtain the optimal set of discrete features. Our method has been compared with the best state-of-the-art discretization algorithms on the GF-2 and Landsat 8 satellite datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves better classification accuracy for high-resolution remote sensing images in coastal areas. It can not only effectively mine the correlation between features but also filter the outliers in bands, thus producing as few discrete intervals as possible while ensuring data consistency.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing and Numerical Modeling to Quantify the Water Balance of Climate-Induced Intermittent Wetlands
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are an important habitat for many species but over the past few decades ecosystem biodiversity and function have been threatened. Due to their shallow and fluctuating water levels, wetlands are particularly vulnerable to climate variability. This is especially a risk for ephemeral and intermittent wetlands with limited hydrologic connections to deep aquifers, designated herein as Climate-induced Intermittent Wetlands (CiIWs). However, the response of CiIW systems to long-term climate variability has received limited research attention, partly because continuous ground surface monitoring data is rarely available over inter-decadal periods. An alternative to ground surface data is the use of satellite imagery to estimate the temporal water extent variability. An integrated remote sensing and modeling approach is presented here to provide a novel method for investigating historical water storage variations in a CiIW system. The new method estimates water levels in a shallow wetland using Landsat data and was successfully validated against field water level data. The new method performed better than five existing algorithms. A water balance model was calibrated using the combined remotely sensed and local field data to derive daily water level time series since 1900. The validated water balance model results indicated that most of the water level fluctuations in the intermittent wetland can be explained by climatic drivers and subsurface flow interactions. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of an integrated remote sensing and water balance modeling approach for hydroclimatic analysis of intermittent wetlands.

TI  - Retrieving Accurate Soil Moisture over the Tibetan Plateau Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data Assimilation with Simultaneous State and Parameter Estimations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation provides a practical way to improve the accuracy of soil moisture simulation by integrating a land surface model and satellite data. This study establishes a multisource remote sensing data assimilation framework by incorporating a simultaneous state and parameter estimation method to acquire an accurate estimation of the soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau. The brightness temperature of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is directly assimilated into the coupled system of the Common Land Model (CoLM) and a microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) to improve the soilmoisture simulation. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature product and the Beijing Normal University (BNU) leaf area index product are employed to not only improve the estimation of temperature and vegetation variables from the CoLM, but they also provide more accurate background information for the RTM during the brightness temperature assimilation. In situ measurements from the Naqu network are used to evaluate the results. The model simulation showed an obvious underestimation of soil moisture and overestimation of soil temperature, which was alleviated by the assimilation experiments, particularly in the shallow soil layers. The estimated parameters also showed advantages in the soilmoisture simulation when compared with the default parameters. The assimilation experiment presents promising results in the combination of model and multisource remote sensing data for estimating soil moisture over the complex mountainous region in Tibet.

TI  - A Framework to Assess the Potential Uncertainties of Three FPAR Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing products of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) are widely used in large-scale terrestrial vegetation condition monitoring and ecological modeling. However, the validation and evaluation of these products are still insufficient due to limited ground measurements. A framework is proposed in this study that does not rely on ground FPAR observations to evaluate the potential uncertainties of three FPAR data sets over a large scale. Two independent methods, including a statistical method named extended triple colocation (ETC) and FPAR-based gross primary production (GPP) comparative evaluation at the site level, are integrated. The framework was applied to three widely used FPAR products, including GLASS (Global Land Surface Satellite), GEOV2 (version 2 of the COPERNICUS 1-km product), and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), in China from 2001-2015. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R) based on the ETC method showed that at the national spatial scale, GEOV2-FPAR had the highest precision (RMSEFPAR = 0.0367, R-FPAR = 0.9012), followed by MODIS-FPAR (RMSEFPAR = 0.0482, R-FPAR = 0.8392) and GLASS-FPAR (RMSEFPAR = 0.0536, R-FPAR = 0.736). In particular, each FPAR data set was locally optimal over some regions. Using a light use efficiency model, GPP was calculated using these three FPAR data sets and other identical variables and parameters at 22 eddy flux sites. General coherent results were found in both GPP evaluation and site-level ETC analysis of these three FPAR data sets. Therefore, we conclude that this framework is reliable and applicable in evaluating the potential uncertainties of FPAR.

TI  - OO Dra: An Algol-type Binary Formed through an Extremely Helium-poor Mass Accretion Revealed by Asteroseismology
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on 2 minutes of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we analyzed intrinsic oscillations of the primary component and identified seven confident independent delta Scuti frequencies (f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(7), f(11), and f (12)). Both single-star evolutionary models and mass-accreting models are computed to reproduce the delta Scuti frequencies and the fitting results match well with each other. The stellar parameters of the primary star yielded by asteroseismology are M = 1.92(-0.02)(+0.10) M (circle dot), Z = 0.011(-0.001)(+0.006) R = 2.068(-0.007)(+0.050) R-circle dot, log g 4.090(-0.002)(+0.010), T-eff = 8346(-320)(+244) K, and L = 18.65(-2.82)(+3.31) L-circle dot, which match well with the dynamic ones using the binary model. Furthermore, our asteroseismic results show that OO Dra is another Algol system that has just undergone the rapid mass-transfer stage. The fitting results of single-star evolutionary models indicate that the pulsator is a helium-poor star with an age of 8.22(-1.33)(+0.12) Myr, and the further mass-accreting models show that the primary star looks like an almost unevolved star formed by an extremely helium-poor mass accretion in the Case A evolutionary scenario.

TI  - Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Soil Moisture Data in Agricultural Drought Monitoring: Application in Northeastern China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is the costliest disaster around the world and in China as well. Northeastern China is one of China's most important major grain producing areas. Frequent droughts have harmed the agriculture of this region and further threatened national food security. Therefore, the timely and effective monitoring of drought is extremely important. In this study, the passive microwave remote sensing soil moisture data, i.e., the SMOS soil moisture (SMOS-SM) product, was compared to several in situ meteorological indices through Pearson correlation analysis to assess the performance of SMOS-SM in monitoring drought in northeastern China. Then, maps based on SMOS-SM and in situ indices were created for July from 2010 to 2015 to identify the spatial pattern of drought distributions. Our results showed that the SMOS-SM product had relatively high correlation with in situ indices, especially SPI and SPEI values of a nine-month scale for the growing season. The drought patterns shown on maps generated from SPI-9, SPEI-9 and sc-PDSI were also successfully captured using the SMOS-SM product. We found that the SMOS-SM product effectively monitored drought patterns in northeastern China, and this capacity would be enhanced when field capacity information became available.

TI  - Behaviors of the Yukon River Sediment Plume in the Bering Sea: Relations to Glacier-Melt Discharge and Sediment Load
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment plumes, released to the Bering Sea from the delta front of the Yukon River, Alaska, are initiated mainly by glacier-melt sediment runoffs in the glacierized regions of the Yukon River drainage basin. The surface sediment plumes are extended around the fan-shaped Yukon River delta, which is followed by the northwestward dispersion. During continuous measurements of the Yukon River discharge and sediment load, behaviors of the sediment plumes were explored by shipboard and coastal observations in the Bering Sea. At the high river sediment load of ca. 2500 kg/s, the plume partially plunged into the sea bottom layer. The plunging probably originated in the nepheloid-layer formation from the flocculation of river-suspended sediment, of which more than 90% wt. is silt and clay (grain size d < 63 mu m). In order to numerically obtain the area of the surface sediment plumes, a satellite image analysis was performed by using three near-infrared bands in MODIS/Aqua or MODIS/Terra. The plume area was significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.735, p < 0.01) to the sediment load averaged for the two days with time lags of 20 days and 21 days to the date of a certain satellite image. Hence, the dispersion of plume-suspended sediment appears to be controlled by the sediment runoff events in the Yukon River rather than the northward "Alaskan Coastal Water ".

TI  - Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT Constellation Mission InSAR Assessment of Slope Movements in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are the most common natural hazard in British Columbia. The province has recorded the largest number of historical landslide fatalities in Canada, and damage to infrastructure comes at a great cost. In order to understand the potential impacts of landslides, radar remote sensing has become a cost-effective method for detecting downslope movements. This study investigates downslope movements in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada, with Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The 2-dimensional time-series analysis with Sentinel-1 ascending and descending InSAR pairs from October 2017 to June 2021 observed distinct earthflow movements of up to similar to 15 cm/year in the east-west direction. The Grinder Creek, Red Mountain, Yalakom River, and Retaskit Creek earthflows previously documented are still active, with east-west movements of similar to 30 cm over the past four years. New RCM data acquired from June 2020 to September 2020 with a 4-day revisit capability were compared to 12-day Sentinel-1 InSAR pairs. The 4-day RCM InSAR pairs at higher spatial resolution showed better performance by detecting relatively small-sized slope movements within a few hundred meters, which were not clearly observed by Sentinel-1. The temporal variabilities observed from the RCM InSAR showed great potential for observing detailed slope movements within a narrower time window.

TI  - Is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Breast Cancer with Cytology-Proven Axillary Metastasis Safe? A Prospective Single-Arm Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate pathologic lymph node metastasis in breast cancer with cytology-proven axillary metastasis. This study was designed prospectively. We performed axillary lymph node dissections (ALND) after lymphatic mapping by near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with Indocyanine Green (ICG). We evaluated 72 breast cancer patients with cytology-proven axillary metastasis by curative surgery at the Samsung Medical Center between May of 2016 and December of 2017. Among the 72 patients with cytology-proven axillary metastasis, 14 of 39 patients (35.9%) with one or two sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases were metastasized to post-sentinel lymph node. Thirteen of fourteen patients had additional non-sentinel lymph node metastases, seven of thirteen patients also had additional level II lymph node metastases, and one patient had only one additional level II lymph node metastasis. Of T1 or T2 stage patients, 10 of 33 patients (30.3%) with one or two sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases were metastasized to post-sentinel lymph node. Even in patients without SLN metastasis, 50% of the patients had at least three LN metastases, and 40% in the T1 or T2 stage patients. Sentinel lymph node biopsy without ALND might be not safe for patients with cytology-proven axillary metastasis.

TI  - Breast Cancer Skip Metastases: Frequency, Associated Tumor Characteristics, and Role of Staging Nodal Ultrasound in Detection
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND. Staging nodal ultrasound (US) evaluates locations beyond those assessed during routine surgical dissection and has an increasing role in breast cancer management given the growing use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy before surgical staging.OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to identify the patterns of nodal spread of breast cancer observed at staging nodal US and to determine the frequency of skip metastases and associated tumor characteristics.METHODS. This retrospective study included 1269 consecutive patients (31 with bilateral synchronous cancers) who had 1300 newly diagnosed, untreated, invasive breast cancers and underwent US examination of the ipsilateral regional nodal basins from January 2016 through March 2017. Cases with suspicious nodes on US underwent fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Cases with benign results on FNA and no suspicious nodes on US underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Results of US with FNA were compared with final surgical pathology. Skip metastases were defined as spread across discontiguous nodal levels or distant metastases in the absence of ipsilateral nodal metastases. The incidence and patterns of spread of skip metastases were summarized; associations with tumor characteristics were tested using the Fisher exact test.RESULTS. A total of 591 metastatic cases (45.5%) were confirmed by needle biopsy or sentinel lymph node biopsy, comprising 463 nodal metastases (N+) confirmed by FNA, 121 nodal metastases (N+) confirmed by sentinel lymph node biopsy, and seven distant organ metastases without nodal metastases (N0M1) confirmed by CT-guided biopsy. US with FNA had sensitivity of 86.0%, specificity of 100.0%, PPV of 100.0%, NPV of 89.5%, and accuracy of 93.6%. There were 34 skip metastases, for an incidence of 2.6% (34/1300) (95% CI, 1.8-3.6%) among all invasive cancers and 7.2% (34/470) (95% CI, 5.1-9.9%) among metastatic cancers detected by US and FNA. Skip metastases occurred to axillary level III (n = 4), the supraclavicular nodal basin (n = 21), the contralateral axilla (n = 2), and distant organs (n = 7). Cancers with skip metastases, compared with those with nonskip metastases, had higher rates (p = .005) of lobular histology (23.5% vs 6.7%) and mixed ductal and lobular histology (11.8% vs 6.7%). Skip metastases were not associated with grade, T category, or molecular subtype (p > .05).CONCLUSION. Skip metastases to locations beyond standard surgical axillary dissection occur in 7.2% of metastatic breast cancers.CLINICAL IMPACT. Staging nodal US identifies skip metastases that otherwise would be undetected, helping to achieve more accurate staging and minimize undertreatment.

TI  - Tree Cover Loss in the Mediterranean Region-An Increasingly Serious Environmental Issue
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean Region currently faces major environmental issues that require constant analysis and monitoring. This study presents a thorough approach based on the application of Landsat imagery from Global Forest Change during 2001-2019. Spatial distribution mapping was one of the objectives of the study. We approached the analysis of tree cover loss areas by analyzing the cumulative tree cover loss and Tree Cover Loss Rate. This indicator offers information about the trend of tree cover loss in each Mediterranean country. A total of 581 Mha of deforested area was mapped during the analyzed period. Analysis was further supplemented by some statistical operations (distributions shown via histograms, validation via Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and testing via one-sample t-test). Agricultural expansion, intense forest fires, illegal logging, overgrazing (especially in the northern part of Africa), and extensive livestock farming have influenced the Mediterranean forest ecosystem's stability. The continuation of these activities could cause extreme climatic events, severe degradation, and desertification.</p>

TI  - Polygenic basis and biomedical consequences of telomere length variation
T2  - NATURE GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Telomeres, the end fragments of chromosomes, play key roles in cellular proliferation and senescence. Here we characterize the genetic architecture of naturally occurring variation in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and identify causal links between LTL and biomedical phenotypes in 472,174 well-characterized UK Biobank participants. We identified 197 independent sentinel variants associated with LTL at 138 genomic loci (108 new). Genetically determined differences in LTL were associated with multiple biological traits, ranging from height to bone marrow function, as well as several diseases spanning neoplastic, vascular and inflammatory pathologies. Finally, we estimated that, at the age of 40 years, people with an LTL >1 s.d. shorter than the population mean had a 2.5-year-lower life expectancy compared with the group with >= 1 s.d. longer LDL. Overall, we furnish new insights into the genetic regulation of LTL, reveal wide-ranging influences of LTL on physiological traits, diseases and longevity, and provide a powerful resource available to the global research community.Genome-wide association and Mendelian randomization analyses in the UK Biobank identify genetic variants associated with leukocyte telomere length and highlight putative causal links between telomere length and biomedical phenotypes.

TI  - Sentinel-1-based monitoring services at regional scale in Italy: State of the art and main findings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Italy, three different operational continuous monitoring experiences based on the exploitation of Multi Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar data (MTInSAR) Sentinel-1 data are here depicted, and the results obtained in one year have been analysed. Tuscany region (Central Italy) has been the first region to implement such service, followed by Valle d'Aosta and Veneto regions (North-West and North-East Italy, respectively). In detail, the services benefit from regularly updated deformation maps (every 12 days) to promptly detect anomalies of deformation, i.e., trend variations in the time series of displacement. In this work, anomalies detected between September 2019 and September 2020 are thus correlated with several types of factors, either related to the environment, intrinsic of the data or derived from ancillary data. A statistical analysis has been performed on the three regions, and are discretized into five macro-areas, namely: i) spatial and temporal statistics, related to the geographic setting and the temporal distribution of the anomalies; ii) parametric, i.e., related to the interferometric processing; iii) triggering factors; iv) environmental and geological factors; v) urban setting. The results derived from the analysis of this work show the obvious differences between the three regions, highlighting distinct distributions of the anomalies according to the different settings of each study area. Furthermore, results were analyzed, to provide a summary of the main findings obtained, giving a first evaluation of the services and hypothesizing future further improvements and applications.

TI  - Assessing Drought Vegetation Dynamics in Semiarid Grass- and Shrubland Using MESMA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought intensity and duration are expected to increase over the coming century in the semiarid western United States due to anthropogenic climate change. Historic data indicate that megadroughts in this region have resulted in widespread ecosystem transitions. Landscape-scale monitoring with remote sensing can help land managers to track these changes. However, special considerations are required: traditional vegetation indices such as NDVI often underestimate vegetation cover in semiarid systems due to short and multimodal green pulses, extremely variable rainfall, and high soil fractions. Multi-endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) may be more suitable, as it accounts for both green and non-photosynthetic soil fractions. To determine the suitability of MESMA for assessing drought vegetation dynamics in the western US, we test multiple endmember selection and model parameters for optimizing the classification of fractional cover of green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil (S) in semiarid grass- and shrubland in central New Mexico. Field spectra of dominant vegetation species were collected at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge over six field sessions from May-September 2019. Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery from 2009 (two years pre-drought), and Landsat Operational Land Imager imagery from 2014 (final year of drought), and 2019 (five years post-drought) was unmixed. The best fit model had high levels of agreement with reference plots for all three classes, with R-2 values of 0.85 (NPV), 0.67 (GV), and 0.74 (S) respectively. Reductions in NPV and increases in GV and S were observed on the landscape after the drought event, that persisted five years after a return to normal rainfall. Results indicate that MESMA can be successfully applied for monitoring changes in relative vegetation fractions in semiarid grass and shrubland systems in New Mexico.

TI  - Global Contexts: How Countries Shape the COVID-19 Experience of Amish and Mennonite Missionaries Abroad
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the globe, governments restricted social life to slow the spread of COVID-19. Several conservative Protestant sects resisted these policies in the United States. We do not yet know if theology shaped the resistance or if it was more a product of a polarized national political context. We argue that the country context likely shapes how conservative Protestants' moral worldview affects their perceptions of the pandemic and government restrictions. Countries implementing more regulations, those with limited access to healthcare, food, and other essential services, and those with past histories of epidemics may all shape residents' perceptions. Drawing on the case of American Amish and Mennonite missionaries stationed abroad, we content-analyzed accounts of the pandemic from an international Amish and Mennonite correspondence newspaper. We found that the missionaries' perceptions of the pandemic and governmental restrictions differ from those of their U.S. counterparts, which suggests that context likely shapes how religious moral worldviews express themselves concerning public health interventions.

TI  - A Framework for Calculating Peak Discharge and Flood Inundation in Ungauged Urban Watersheds Using Remotely Sensed Precipitation Data: A Case Study in Freetown, Sierra Leone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the human population increases, land cover is converted from vegetation to urban development, causing increased runoff from precipitation events. Additional runoff leads to more frequent and more intense floods. In urban areas, these flood events are often catastrophic due to infrastructure built along the riverbank and within the floodplains. Sufficient data allow for flood modeling used to implement proper warning signals and evacuation plans, however, in least developed countries (LDC), the lack of field data for precipitation and river flows makes hydrologic and hydraulic modeling difficult. Within the most recent data revolution, the availability of remotely sensed data for land use/land cover (LULC), flood mapping, and precipitation estimates has increased, however, flood mapping in urban areas of LDC is still limited due to low resolution of remotely sensed data (LULC, soil properties, and terrain), cloud cover, and the lack of field data for model calibration. This study utilizes remotely sensed precipitation, LULC, soil properties, and digital elevation model data to estimate peak discharge and map simulated flood extents of urban rivers in ungauged watersheds for current and future LULC scenarios. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis was proposed to predict a future LULC. Additionally, return period precipitation events were calculated using the theoretical extreme value distribution approach with two remotely sensed precipitation datasets. Three calculation methods for peak discharge (curve number and lag method, curve number and graphical TR-55 method, and the rational equation) were performed and compared to a separate Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) analysis to determine the method that best represents urban rivers. HEC-RAS was then used to map the simulated flood extents from the peak discharges and ArcGIS helped to determine infrastructure and population affected by the floods. Finally, the simulated flood extents from HEC-RAS were compared to historic flood event points, images of flood events, and global surface water maximum water extent data. This analysis indicates that where field data are absent, remotely sensed monthly precipitation data from Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) where GPM is the Global Precipitation Mission can be used with the curve number and lag method to approximate peak discharges and input into HEC-RAS to represent the simulated flood extents experienced. This work contains a case study for seven urban rivers in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

TI  - Enhancing Animal Movement Analyses: Spatiotemporal Matching of Animal Positions with Remotely Sensed Data Using Google Earth Engine and R
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Movement ecologists have witnessed a rapid increase in the amount of animal position data collected over the past few decades, as well as a concomitant increase in the availability of ecologically relevant remotely sensed data. Many researchers, however, lack the computing resources necessary to incorporate the vast spatiotemporal aspects of datasets available, especially in countries with less economic resources, limiting the scope of ecological inquiry. We developed an R coding workflow that bridges the gap between R and the multi-petabyte catalogue of remotely sensed data available in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to efficiently extract raster pixel values that best match the spatiotemporal aspects (i.e., spatial location and time) of each animal's GPS position. We tested our approach using movement data freely available on Movebank (movebank.org). In a first case study, we extracted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index information from the MOD13Q1 data product for 12,344 GPS animal locations by matching the closest MODIS image in the time series to each GPS fix. Data extractions were completed in approximately 3 min. In a second case study, we extracted hourly air temperature from the ERA5-Land dataset for 33,074 GPS fixes from 12 different wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) in approximately 34 min. We then investigated the relationship between step length (i.e., the net distance between sequential GPS locations) and temperature and found that animals move less as temperature increases. These case studies illustrate the potential to explore novel questions in animal movement research using high-temporal-resolution, remotely sensed data products. The workflow we present is efficient and customizable, with data extractions occurring over relatively short time periods. While computing times to extract remotely sensed data from GEE will vary depending on internet speed, the approach described has the potential to facilitate access to computationally demanding processes for a greater variety of researchers and may lead to increased use of remotely sensed data in the field of movement ecology. We present a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the code and adapt it to other data products that are available in GEE.</p>

TI  - Vegetation Coverage Prediction for the Qinling Mountains Using the CA-Markov Model
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinling Mountains represent the dividing line of the natural landscape of north-south in China. The prediction on vegetation coverage is important for protecting the ecological environment of the Qinling Mountains. In this paper, the data accuracy and reliability of three vegetation index data (GIMMS NDVI, SPOT NDVI, and MODIS NDVI) were compared at first. SPOT, NDVI, and MODIS NDVI were used for calculating the vegetation coverage in the Qinling Mountains. Based on the CA-Markov model, the vegetation coverage grades in 2008, 2010, and 2013 were used to simulate the vegetation coverage grade in 2025. The results show that the grades of vegetation coverage of the Qinling Mountains calculated by SPOT, NDVI, and MODIS NDVI are highly similar. According to the prediction results, the grade of vegetation coverage in the Qinling Mountains has a rising trend under the guidance of the policy, particularly in urban areas. Most of the vegetation coverage transit from low vegetation coverage to middle and low vegetation coverage. The grades of the vegetation coverage, which were predicted by the CA-Markov model using SPOT, NDVI, and MODI NDVI, are consistent in spatial distribution and temporal variation.</p>

TI  - From parcel to continental scale-A first European crop type map based on Sentinel-1 and LUCAS Copernicus in-situ observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed parcel-level crop type mapping for the whole European Union (EU) is necessary for the evaluation of agricultural policies. The Copernicus program, and Sentinel-1 (S1) in particular, offers the opportunity to monitor agricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so far the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on the unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first continental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A and S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random Forest classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3 M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99 (rape and turnip rape). Finally, we discuss how the framework presented here can underpin the operational delivery of inseason high-resolution based crop mapping.

TI  - Active Landslide Detection Based on Sentinel-1 Data and InSAR Technology in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, Northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zhouqu County in Gansu Province, Northwest China, is typically highly prone to landslides. On July 12, 2018, a landslide blocked the Bailong River near Zhouqu County, posing a serious threat to the life and property of local residents and the safety of infrastructure. Small baseline subset interferometry synthetic aperture radar technology (SBAS-InSAR) was adopted to identify the potential active landslides in the surrounding area of Zhouqu County, using ascending and descending orbit Sentinel-1 satellite images taken from October 2017 to December 2018. The surface deformation areas detected by SBAS-InSAR were verified by optical remote sensing image interpretation and field investigation, and a total of 23 active landslides were identified finally. The deformation characteristics of four typical landslides are analysed in detail using deformation velocity and rainfall data. It is found that the deformation velocity of landslides in this area is mainly affected by rainfall and there is a lag effect. The results can provide a reference for the prevention and control of landslide risk in Zhouqu County.

TI  - The World Trade Center Health Program: Twenty years of health effects research
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - It has been 20 years since the devastating terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Thousands were injured or killed during the attacks and many more are at risk of adverse health stemming from physical, psychological, and emotional stressors born out of the attacks. Private, federal, state, and local resources were gathered soon after the attacks to address impacts to the community, including the health and well-being of both responders and survivors. Many of these efforts are now largely consolidated under the federally mandated World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program. This program provides medical monitoring and treatment of qualifying conditions among the 9/11-exposed population and supports related physical and mental health research. In this commentary, we describe the WTC Health Program, with emphasis on the health-effects research it has funded since inception in 2011. We describe sentinel research publications, and how science has impacted the program. We provide examples relating studies in this special issue to important roles in the WTC Health Program research agenda. Finally, we provide a perspective on future research needs.

TI  - Study of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) Using Remote Sensing Data/Techniques: A Systematic Review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Islands (UHI) consist of the occurrence of higher temperatures in urbanized areas when compared to rural areas. During the warmer seasons, this effect can lead to thermal discomfort, higher energy consumption, and aggravated pollution effects. The application of Remote Sensing (RS) data/techniques using thermal sensors onboard satellites, drones, or aircraft, allow for the estimation of Land Surface Temperature (LST). This article presents a systematic review of publications in Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) on UHI analysis using RS data/techniques and LST, from 2000 to 2020. The selection of articles considered keywords, title, abstract, and when deemed necessary, the full text. The process was conducted by two independent researchers and 579 articles, published in English, were selected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Cfa climate areas are the most represented, as the Northern Hemisphere concentrates the most studied areas, especially in Asia (69.94%); Landsat products were the most applied to estimates LST (68.39%) and LULC (55.96%); ArcGIS (30.74%) was most used software for data treatment, and correlation (38.69%) was the most applied statistic technique. There is an increasing number of publications, especially from 2016, and the transversality of UHI studies corroborates the relevance of this topic.

TI  - PRINCIPLE trial demonstrates scope for in-pandemic improvement in primary care antibiotic stewardship: a retrospective sentinel network cohort study.
T2  - BJGP open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older peoPLE (PRINCIPLE) has provided in-pandemic evidence that azithromycin and doxycycline were not beneficial in the early primary care management of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19).AIM: To explore the extent of in-pandemic azithromycin and doxycycline use, and the scope for trial findings impacting on practice.DESIGN & SETTING: Crude rates of prescribing and respiratory tract infections (RTI) in 2020 were compared with 2019, using the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC).METHOD: Negative binomial models were used to compare azithromycin and doxycycline prescribing, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and influenza-like illness (ILI) in 2020 with 2019; reporting incident rate ratios (IRR) between years, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).RESULTS: Azithromycin prescriptions increased 7% in 2020 compared with 2019, whereas doxycycline decreased by 7%. Concurrently, LRTI and URTI incidence fell by over half (58.3% and 54.4%, respectively) while ILI rose slightly (6.4%). The overall percentage of RTI-prescribed azithromycin rose from 0.51% in 2019 to 0.72% in 2020 (risk difference 0.214%; 95% CI = 0.211 to 0.217); doxycycline rose from 11.86% in 2019 to 15.79% in 2020 (risk difference 3.93%; 95% CI = 3.73 to 4.14). The adjusted IRR showed azithromycin prescribing was 22% higher in 2020 (IRR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.26; P<0.0001). For every unit rise in confirmed COVID-19 there was an associated 3% rise in prescription (IRR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.03; P<0.0001); whereas these measures were static for doxycycline.CONCLUSION: PRINCIPLE demonstrates scope for improved antimicrobial stewardship during a pandemic.

TI  - Impacts of a large hydroelectric dam on the Madeira River (Brazil) on floodplain avifauna
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydroelectric dams represent an important threat to seasonally flooded environments in the Amazon basin. We aimed to evaluate how a dam in the Madeira River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazonas River, affected floodplain avifauna. Bird occurrence was recorded through simultaneous passive acoustic monitoring in early successional vegetation and floodplain forest downstream from the dam and upstream in sites impacted by permanent flooding after dam reservoir filling. Species were identified through manual inspection and semi-automated classification of the recordings. To assess the similarity in vegetation between downstream and upstream sites, we used Landsat TM/ETM+ composite images from before (2009-2011) and after (2016-2018) reservoir filling. Downstream and upstream floodplain forest sites were similar before, but not after dam construction. Early successional vegetation sites were already different before dam construction. We recorded 195 bird species. While species richness did not differ between upstream and downstream sites, species composition differed significantly. Ten species were indicators of early successional vegetation upstream, and four downstream. Ten species were indicators of floodplain forest upstream, and 31 downstream. Seven of 24 floodplain specialist species were detected by the semi-automated classification only upstream. While we found some bird species characteristic of early successional vegetation in the upstream sites, we did not find most species characteristic of tall floodplain forest. Predominantly carnivorous, insectivorous, and nectarivorous species appear to have been replaced by generalist and widely distributed species.

TI  - Sensitivity of Guillain-Barre Syndrome Surveillance in the Brazilian Federal District, using the Capture-Recapture Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyneuropathy that compromises the peripheral and cranial nerves. It is characterized by rapid-onset paresthesia accompanied by progressive weakness in the lower extremities followed by symmetric ascending paralysis. Methodology: assessment of sensitivity to detect GBS between March 2017 and May 2019 in a public referral hospital, using the capture recapture method based on the Chapman estimator and comparing three GBS data sources: the hospital-based sentinel surveillance system (VSBH), Human Immunoglobulin Dispensing Records System (RDIH), and Hospital Information System (SIH). Results: A total of 259 possible cases were identified (captured). Of these, 58 were confirmed and most resided in the Federal District. The VSBH showed the greatest sensitivity in case identification. The temporal distribution of cases showed periods with no cases identified, and more were registered during the rainy season from October to May, when high temperatures also occur. Conclusions: Increased circulation of arboviruses and gastrointestinal infections during the rainy season may explain the greater concentration of GBS cases. It is important to note that one-third of the cases identified in the different data sources do not converge, demonstrating that no single surveillance system is 100% effective. The severity and possible increase in cases related to GBS demonstrates the need for an improved surveillance system capable of monitoring and following-up cases involving neurological syndromes, regardless of the event preceding infection.

TI  - A Multidisciplinary Investigation of the First Chikungunya Virus Outbreak in Matadi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Early March 2019, health authorities of Matadi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alerted a sudden increase in acute fever/arthralgia cases, prompting an outbreak investigation. We collected surveillance data, clinical data, and laboratory specimens from clinical suspects (for CHIKV-PCR/ELISA, malaria RDT), semi-structured interviews with patients/caregivers about perceptions and health seeking behavior, and mosquito sampling (adult/larvae) for CHIKV-PCR and estimation of infestation levels. The investigations confirmed a large CHIKV outbreak that lasted February-June 2019. The total caseload remained unknown due to a lack of systematic surveillance, but one of the two health zones of Matadi notified 2686 suspects. Of the clinical suspects we investigated (n = 220), 83.2% were CHIKV-PCR or IgM positive (acute infection). One patient had an isolated IgG-positive result (while PCR/IgM negative), suggestive of past infection. In total, 15% had acute CHIKV and malaria. Most adult mosquitoes and larvae (> 95%) were Aedes albopictus. High infestation levels were noted. CHIKV was detected in 6/11 adult mosquito pools, and in 2/15 of the larvae pools. This latter and the fact that 2/6 of the CHIKV-positive adult pools contained only males suggests transovarial transmission. Interviews revealed that healthcare seeking shifted quickly toward the informal sector and self-medication. Caregivers reported difficulties to differentiate CHIKV, malaria, and other infectious diseases resulting in polypharmacy and high out-of-pocket expenditure. We confirmed a first major CHIKV outbreak in Matadi, with main vector Aedes albopictus. The health sector was ill-prepared for the information, surveillance, and treatment needs for such an explosive outbreak in a CHIKV-naive population. Better surveillance systems (national level/sentinel sites) and point-of-care diagnostics for arboviruses are needed.

TI  - Spatial distribution and interannual variability of coastal fog and low clouds cover in the hyperarid Atacama Desert and implications for past and present <i>Tillandsia landbeckii</i> ecosystems
T2  - PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyperarid Atacama Desert coast receives scarce moisture inputs mainly from the Pacific Ocean in the form of marine advective fog. The collected moisture supports highly specialized ecosystems, where the bromeliad Tillandsia landbeckii is the dominant species. The fog and low clouds (FLCs) on which these ecosystems depend are affected in their interannual variability and spatial distribution by global phenomena, such as ENSO. Yet, there is a lack of understanding of how ENSO influences recent FLCs spatial changes and their interconnections and how these variations can affect existing Tillandsia stands. In this study, we analyze FLCs occurrence, its trends and the influence of ENSO on the interannual variations of FLCs presence by processing GOES satellite images (1995-2017). Our results show that ENSO exerts a significant influence over FLCs interannual variability in the Atacama at similar to 20 degrees S. Linear regression analyses reveal a relation between ENSO3.4 anomalies and FLCs with opposite seasonal effects depending on the ENSO phase. During summer (winter), the ENSO warm phase is associated with an increase (decrease) of the FLCs occurrence, whereas the opposite occurs during ENSO cool phases. In addition, the ONI Index explains up to similar to 50 and similar to 60% variance of the interannual FLCs presence in the T. landbeckii site during summer and winter, respectively. Finally, weak negative (positive) trends of FLCs presence are observed above (below) 1000 m a. s. l. These results have direct implications for understanding the present and past distribution of Tillandsia ecosystems under the extreme conditions characterizing our study area.

TI  - An approach for reflectance anisotropy retrieval from UAV-based oblique photogrammetry hyperspectral imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflectance Anisotropy (RA) contains crucial information about the optical behavior and structure of ground objects and is typically described by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). However, traditional RA-retrieval methods from satellites or the ground are constrained due to the low spatial resolution, illumination conditions, and instrument-associated limitations. In this study, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based oblique photography technology is applied to RA retrieval, aiming to explore the feasibility of UAV to obtain spatially continuous RA data with high spatial resolution and high accuracy. The Monte Carlo method is used to select and optimize the combination of multi-angle observation data of a variety of ground objects obtained by UAV-based oblique photogrammetry. The accuracy and applicability of two BRDF inversion models, namely the linear semi-empirical kernel-driven (LSEKD) model and the non-linear Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model, are analyzed, and the effects of different sampling window sizes on the BRDF results of various ground objects are compared. The main conclusions are: 1) Oblique photogrammetry is a highly efficient method for RA measurement at the centimeter-level resolution for spatially continuous regions, because it enables cameras with a narrow field of view (FOV) to obtain observation data with a wider viewing angle and more directions, ensuring the robustness and accuracy of the BRDF inversion model, with RMSE in the visible and near-infrared bands are about 0.003 and 0.019 (8-14%); 2) Both the LSEKD and the RPV model are suitable for the inversion of the BRDF with comparable accuracy, but the kernel functions for the LSEKD need to be carefully chosen in advance according to the characteristics of the ground object, while the RPV is adaptive for most objects; 3) The Monte Carlo method can ensure that the multi-angle observation data is distributed evenly in the hemisphere, thus providing the optimal dataset for a high-accuracy BRDF inversion; and 4) The RA of ground objects may change with the change of spatial resolution; the extremely high-resolution RA provides the ability to study ground objects at a finer scale. This study expands the methods for obtaining high-spatial resolution, high-accuracy, and spatially continuous RA. It has significant application potential in areas such as quantitative remote sensing, calibration of high-accurate remote-sensing products, and bridging the scale gap between satellite and ground-collected RA data.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Approach for High Space and Time Resolution Land Surface Temperature
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-atmosphere fluxes and their drivers vary across space and time. A growing area of interest is in downscaling, localizing, and/or resolving sub-grid scale energy, water, and carbon fluxes and drivers. Existing downscaling methods require inputs of land surface properties at relatively high spatial (e.g., sub-kilometer) and temporal (e.g., hourly) resolutions, but many observed land surface drivers are not continuously available at these resolutions. We evaluate an approach to overcome this challenge for land surface temperature (LST), a World Meteorological Organization Essential Climate Variable and a key driver for surface heat fluxes. The Chequamegon Heterogenous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors (CHEESEHEAD19) field experiment provided a scalable testbed. We downscaled LST from satellites (GOES-16 and ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station [ECOSTRESS]) with further refinement using airborne hyperspectral imagery. Temporally and spatially downscaled LST compared well to independent observations from a network of 20 micrometeorological towers and piloted aircrafts in addition to Landsat-based LST retrieval and drone-based LST observed at one tower site. The downscaled 50-m hourly LST showed good relationships with tower (r(2) = 0.79, RMSE = 3.5 K) and airborne (r(2) = 0.75, RMSE = 2.4 K) observations over space and time, with precision lower over wetlands and lakes, and some improvement for capturing spatio-temporal variation compared to a geostationary satellite. Further downscaling to 10 m using hyperspectral imagery resolved hot and cold spots across the landscape as evidenced by independent drone LST, with significant reduction in RMSE by 1.3 K. These results demonstrate a simple pathway for multi-sensor retrieval of high space and time resolution LST.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we propose a sequence-to-sequence neural network architecture to jointly estimate the plant area index (PAI) and wet biomass of canola and soybean. The PAI and wet biomass have considerable importance for crop growth stage mapping and monitoring. RADARSAT-2 quad-pol data along with in situ measurements of canola and soybean obtained from the SMAPVEX16 campaign over Manitoba, Canada, are utilized for evaluating the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed estimation methodology. The analysis indicates promising results for the two crops with a correlation coefficient (r) in the range of 0.69-0.87. The results also confirm intercorrelation between the PAI and wet biomass for canola and soybean.

TI  - Deep Learning Approaches to Earth Observation Change Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The interest in change detection in the field of remote sensing has increased in the last few years. Searching for changes in satellite images has many useful applications, ranging from land cover and land use analysis to anomaly detection. In particular, urban change detection provides an efficient tool to study urban spread and growth through several years of observation. At the same time, change detection is often a computationally challenging and time-consuming task; therefore, a standard approach with manual detection of the elements of interest by experts in the domain of Earth Observation needs to be replaced by innovative methods that can guarantee optimal results with unquestionable value and within reasonable time. In this paper, we present two different approaches to change detection (semantic segmentation and classification) that both exploit convolutional neural networks to address these particular needs, which can be further refined and used in post-processing workflows for a large variety of applications.</p>

TI  - Long-Term Shoreline Evolution Using DSAS Technique: A Case Study of Quang Nam Province, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Quang Nam coastline, located in the central of Vietnam, has been strongly affected by severe erosion and accretion due to climate change and human activities. Thus, understanding the causes and mechanisms of coastal morphology changes is essential to offer optimal coastal management and protection solutions. In this research, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) technique developed by the United States Geological Survey was adopted to calculate rate-of-change statistics from multiple historical coastline positions of Quang Nam province extracted from satellite images, i.e., Landsat and Sentinel images from 1990 to 2019. The coastal dynamic was digitized, visualized, and compared by two statistical parameters provided in DSAS, namely End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR). The final results reveal that the Quang Nam coast experienced remarkable phenomena of erosion and accumulation over the past three decades. The total number of erosional and accretional transects obtained from the EPR results are 401 and 414, with annual change rates of -1.7 and 0.77 m/year, respectively. The LRR parameter was also considered and illustrated a significant correlation with the EPR, as the obtained R-2 value of 0.96. The lowest value of EPR over the period 1990-2019 is -42.4 m/year, highlighting the most significant erosion at the north of Cua Dai estuary, whereas coastline advance is recorded in the south segment. As a result, this study's outcomes provide helpful information for better and sustainable coastal management in Quang Nam province of Vietnam.</p>

TI  - Urban cycles of human activity do not significantly alter the behaviour of a duetting bird
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The weekend effect hypothesis predicts that weekly cycles of human activity impact animal behaviour and physiology. This hypothesis has been supported in the context of recreational activity in natural environments but it is unknown whether it also applies to urban animals. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the sentinel (territorial vigilance), foraging and vocal behaviours of an urban-dwelling bird, the Rufous Hornero Furnarius rufus, between weekdays and weekends (and holidays) within a university campus in central Brazil. The level of human activity (noise, traffic and pedestrian flow) increases greatly on weekdays on this campus. We predicted that the birds would perceive a greater predation risk and would need to adjust their acoustic signals in response to anthropogenic noise on weekdays. Thus, we expected that the birds would spend more time as sentinels and less time foraging, and would sing for longer periods and at a higher pitch on weekdays than on weekends. We also expected weaker duet responsiveness (answering partner-initiated song) on noisier weekdays than on weekends, assuming that noise would disrupt signal transmission between partners. We found that birds spent slightly more time (similar to 4%) in sentinel behaviour and less time (similar to 2-5%) foraging on weekdays than on weekends, but these effects were small and not statistically significant. Birds were equally likely to sing solos, start duets and answer partner-initiated duets on weekends and weekdays. Finally, phrase duration and acoustic parameters of duets were similar on weekends and weekdays. Our results provide little support for the weekend effect hypothesis, suggesting that these urban-dwelling birds may be habituated or indifferent to periodic variation in human activity levels.

TI  - Automated Coastline Extraction Using the Very High Resolution WorldView (WV) Satellite Imagery and Developed Coastline Extraction Tool (CET)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate extraction of a coastline is necessary for various studies of coastal processes, as well as for the management and protection of coastal areas. Very high-resolution satellite imagery has great potential for coastline extraction; however, noises in spectral data can cause significant errors. Here, we present a newly developed Coastal Extraction Tool (CET) that overcomes such errors and allows accurate and time-efficient automated coastline extraction based on a combination of World View-2 (WV-2) multispectral imagery and stereo-pair-derived digital surface model (DSM). Coastline extraction is performed and tested on the IZ-Rava island group, situated within the Northern Dalmatian archipelago (Croatia). Extracted coastlines were compared to (a) coastlines extracted from state topographic map (1:25,000), and (b) coastline extracted by another available tool. The accuracy of the extracted coastline was validated with centimeter accuracy reference data acquired using a UAV system (Matrice 600 Pro + MicaSense RedEdge-MX). Within the study area, two small islets were detected that have not been mapped during the earlier coastline mapping efforts. CET proved to be a highly accurate coastline mapping technique that successfully overcomes spectral-induced errors. In future research, we are planning to integrate data obtained by UAVs infrared thermography (IRT) and in situ sensors, measuring sea and land surface temperatures (SST and LST), into the CET, given that this has shown promising results. Considering its accuracy and ease of use, we suggest that CET can be applied for automated coastline extraction in other large and indented coastal areas. Additionally, we suggest that CET could be applied in longitudinal geomorphological coastal erosion studies for the automated detection of spatio-temporal coastline displacement.

TI  - KappaMask: AI-Based Cloudmask Processor for Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) provides comprehensive and continuous multi-spectral observations of all the Earth's land surface since mid-2015. Clouds and cloud shadows significantly decrease the usability of optical satellite data, especially in agricultural applications; therefore, an accurate and reliable cloud mask is mandatory for effective EO optical data exploitation. During the last few years, image segmentation techniques have developed rapidly with the exploitation of neural network capabilities. With this perspective, the KappaMask processor using U-Net architecture was developed with the ability to generate a classification mask over northern latitudes into the following classes: clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent cloud (thin clouds), cloud and invalid. For training, a Sentinel-2 dataset covering the Northern European terrestrial area was labelled. KappaMask provides a 10 m classification mask for Sentinel-2 Level-2A (L2A) and Level-1C (L1C) products. The total dice coefficient on the test dataset, which was not seen by the model at any stage, was 80% for KappaMask L2A and 76% for KappaMask L1C for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent and cloud classes. A comparison with rule-based cloud mask methods was then performed on the same test dataset, where Sen2Cor reached 59% dice coefficient for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent and cloud classes, Fmask reached 61% for clear, cloud shadow and cloud classes and Maja reached 51% for clear and cloud classes. The closest machine learning open-source cloud classification mask, S2cloudless, had a 63% dice coefficient providing only cloud and clear classes, while KappaMask L2A, with a more complex classification schema, outperformed S2cloudless by 17%.

TI  - Monitoring the summer flooding in the Poyang Lake area of China in 2020 based on Sentinel-1 data and multiple convolutional neural networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise monitoring of floods is significant in disaster management and loss reduction; however, remote sensing data resource and methods can largely affect the monitoring accuracy of flooded areas. In this study, we use cloud-free Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, preferable to the optical imagery. We have used 5 convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including HRNet, DenseNet, SegNet, ResNet and DeepLab v3 + for flood monitoring in the Poyang Lake area, and compared their performances with the traditional methods - the bimodal threshold segmentation (BTS) and the OSTU method. The HRNet has superior performance in water body identification with the highest precision and efficiency, based on a parallel structure to not only extract rich semantic information but also maintain high-resolution features in the whole process. Besides, speckle noise reduction by deep convolutional neural networks in SAR imagery is better compared with the Refined Lee filter. The CNNs are then used to monitor the temporal evolution of summer flooding (May-Nov.) in 2020. Results show the smallest water coverage of Poyang Lake in late May; it gradually increases to the maximum in mid-July, and then shows a downward trend until November.

TI  - Orbit error removal in InSAR/MTInSAR with a patch-based polynomial model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The orbit error caused by the inaccuracy of the orbit state vector can lead to fringes in differential interferograms, which can impede the estimation of deformation in differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) applications. Usually, a set of polynomial coefficients for an entire SAR image is obtained for orbit error removal. However, the orbit error plane is influenced by overfitting in the case that the SAR satellites do not have a precise orbit. In this paper, a patch-based polynomial method is proposed to fit the orbit error plane. The new method divides an SAR image into several overlapping patches in the azimuth and range directions. Every patch obtains its own polynomial coefficients, and an iterative least-square method is used to mosaic the orbit plane. This method is tested and validated via a simulated dataset and then applied to ALOS1/2 PALSAR and Sentinel-1A datasets. The accuracy of deformation is evaluated by in situ GPS datasets. The results show that the patch-based method can fit the orbit phase plane more accurately than the traditional polynomial model with millimeter-level displacement improvement, especially in the margin areas of ALOS1/2 and for the wide-coverage Sentinel-1A datasets. Moreover, in the MTInSAR parameter calculations, the new method improves the accuracy of mean velocity calculations for ALOS1 time series, with a reduction of RMSE from 4.47 mm/yr to 3.17 mm/yr. Additionally, the new method reduces the spatial correlation of the residual topographic phase, with a mean value reduction from 0.32 m to 0.13 m.

TI  - Comparisons of CODE and CNES/CLS GPS satellite bias products and applications in Sentinel-3 satellite precise orbit determination
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - To resolve undifferenced GNSS phase ambiguities, dedicated satellite products are needed, such as satellite orbits, clock offsets and biases. The International GNSS Service CNES/CLS analysis center provides satellite (HMW) Hatch-Melbourne-Wubbena bias and dedicated satellite clock products (including satellite phase bias), while the CODE analysis center provides satellite OSB (observable-specific-bias) and integer clock products. The CNES/CLS GPS satellite HMW bias products are determined by the Hatch-Melbourne-Wubbena (HMW) linear combination and aggregate both code (C1W, C2W) and phase (L1W, L2W) biases. By forming the HMW linear combination of CODE OSB corrections on the same signals, we compare CODE satellite HMW biases to those from CNES/CLS. The fractional part of GPS satellite HMW biases from both analysis centers are very close to each other, with a mean Root-Mean-Square (RMS) of differences of 0.01 wide-lane cycles. A direct comparison of satellite narrow-lane biases is not easily possible since satellite narrow-lane biases are correlated with satellite orbit and clock products, as well as with integer wide-lane ambiguities. Moreover, CNES/CLS provides no satellite narrow-lane biases but incorporates them into satellite clock offsets. Therefore, we compute differences of GPS satellite orbits, clock offsets, integer wide-lane ambiguities and narrow-lane biases (only for CODE products) between CODE and CNES/CLS products. The total difference of these terms for each satellite represents the difference of the narrow-lane bias by subtracting certain integer narrow-lane cycles. We call this total difference "narrow-lane" bias difference. We find that 3% of the narrow-lane biases from these two analysis centers during the experimental time period have differences larger than 0.05 narrow-lane cycles. In fact, this is mainly caused by one Block IIA satellite since satellite clock offsets of the IIA satellite cannot be well determined during eclipsing seasons. To show the application of both types of GPS products, we apply them for Sentinel-3 satellite orbit determination. The wide-lane fixing rates using both products are more than 98%, while the narrow-lane fixing rates are more than 95%. Ambiguity-fixed Sentinel-3 satellite orbits show clear improvement over float solutions. RMS of 6-h orbit overlaps improves by about a factor of two. Also, we observe similar improvements by comparing our Sentinel-3 orbit solutions to the external combined products. Standard deviation value of Satellite Laser Ranging residuals is reduced by more than 10% for Sentinel-3A and more than 15% for Sentinel-3B satellite by fixing ambiguities to integer values.

TI  - Mapping saffron fields and their ages with Sentinel-2 time series in north-east Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is the most expensive spice worldwide and is predominantly produced in the Khorasan Province situated in north-east Iran. Climatic shifts and lowering groundwater tables negatively affect saffron yields in this region, which are determined by environmental factors, agronomical practices, and crop age. Nonetheless, spatially explicit information on changes in saffron cultivation is scarce, underlining a need for better monitoring tools. This study aims to evaluate the utility of Sentinel-2 (S2) time series in accurately mapping saffron fields and their ages (i.e., how many years saffron was cultivated in a field), based on its unique phenology. To separate saffron from other land covers, we first derived 252 spectral-temporal features by calculating 21 spectral features (10 individual bands plus 11 vegetation indices) for each of the 12 months. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm was then used in combination with field data to retain only features of high importance for saffron classification. These features comprised vegetation indices that incorporated spectral information from red, and near-and shortwave infrared bands during the phenological phases of the rapid green up (February to March) and the dormant period (August to October). The RF classifier resulted in a saffron map for the year 2019 with a high classification accuracy based on these features. Compared against an independent in-situ saffron field dataset, 87.6% of the existing fields were correctly classified as saffron. To assess saffron field ages, we analysed the spectral separability of different age groups using the NDVI time series. We found that NDVI levels between December and May allowed for effectively separating 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th-6th, and 7th-8th year saffron fields. An RF-based classification of field ages resulted in an overall accuracy of 86.8%. This study demonstrated that S2 time series data allow for accurately mapping saffron fields and their age groups. Our findings provide a solid basis for mapping saffron across larger areas and for monitoring changes in saffron distribution. Such information is crucial for understanding how anthropogenic and climate change impacts will affect the future of saffron cultivation.

TI  - Thinking, Feeling and Experiencing the "Empty Shot" in Cinema
T2  - FILM-PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces the unique Asian film technique of the "empty shot" (kong jingtou (sic)) from the perspective of Chinese philosophical thought and aesthetics. In Chinese cinema, the "empty shot" is understood as a shot comprised of nonhuman subjects, distinct from both the establishing shot and the cutaway. Perhaps due to the lack of understanding of its philosophical grounding, the "empty shot" has not received much attention in Anglophone film studies, and has been criticized as an overgeneralised concept. This article first relates the "empty shot" to the more widely accepted "pillow shot" in Anglophone studies of Japanese cinema. This article aims to make visible a non-anthropocentric worldview conveyed through the "empty shot", and to make space for the potentialities of this film device, which may also be found in non-Chinese cinemas. It explains the "empty shot"'s central features: firstly, its visible scenes are imbued with invisible emotion, leaving space for the audience to feel what the characters are feeling. Second, it facilitates the generation of qi or "air" in a film, indicating the circulation of qi in a process of dynamic transformation between "actual" and "virtual". Thirdly, the "empty shot" communicates with the audience, allowing them to more fully experience natural scenery and to encounter other beings while suspending everyday experiences, existing biases, and the separation between self and other.

TI  - Tracking changes in aquaculture ponds on the China coast using 30 years of Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although coastal aquaculture ponds provide high-quality fish protein for billions of people, they are threatened by urbanization, pollution, and climate change. Moreover, colossal aquaculture ponds pose damages such as natural wetland shrinkage and water quality deterioration. However, understanding the trends and drivers of coastal aquaculture ponds on a national scale remains a challenge. In this study, a decision-tree classifier was used to quantify the spatiotemporal distribution of aquaculture ponds over last 30 years in 12 provinces located on the coast of China. Moreover, we analyzed their trends and drivers, including geographical conditions, socioeconomic factors, and development policies. The key results of the study include the following: (1) from 1990 to 2020, the cumulative area and holding area of aquaculture ponds reached 21997.90 km(2) and 9613.66 km(2), representing 3.7-fold and 1.6-fold increase, respectively, than the 1990 values. Based on geographical conditions, most aquaculture ponds tend to be located in coastal plains and bays following the distribution of low-lying land. (2) Influenced by different levels of socioeconomic development and changed policies, the holding area of aquaculture ponds experienced a "rapidly increasing period" from 1990 to 2011, growing by 246 km(2) per year; "stable period" between 2011 and 2017; and "sharply shrinking period" after 2017 declining by 417 km(2)/year. (3) Coastal land reclamation played a critical role in the expansion of aquaculture ponds by cumulatively contributing approximately 22% of the land resource in the past 30 years. In the future, as a result of increasing land competition, the extent of aquaculture ponds on the China coast tends to decrease continually.

TI  - PSInSAR and GNSS derived deformation study in the west part of Narmada Son Lineament (NSL), western India
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Narmada Son Lineament located in the middle part of the Indian plate is to be considered seismically active part and already experienced six moderate earthquakes in the last century. The geological studies summarize that the reactivation of existing faults of the paleo-rift are the main source of the tectonic deformation in this part. In the present study the PSInSAR technique with Sentinel 1A dataset, 2016-2019, is being applied for the measurement of deformation pattern of NSL. The derived results were collectively analyzed with the time-series dataset (2009-2019) of a GNSS site located in the study area. The results reveal association of very low amount of deformation along the Son Narmada Fault (SNF). The area towards south of the SNF portrays approximately 2.0 mm of annual Line of Sight (LoS) displacement, which we believe is significant for this region. The estimated deformation lies mainly along the Tapti North Fault (TNF) and Barwani Sukta Fault (BSF) and represented by the existence of a number of transverse faults in the area. The presence of seismic activity in this part justifies the area of maximum deformation accumulation.

TI  - Transfer of information between a highly social species and heterospecific community members
T2  - BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many group-living individuals produce specific vocalizations while mobbing (when individuals move toward and harass a predator), a behavior that can recruit conspecifics. Although these vocalizations may be a source of information for heterospecifics, it remains largely unknown how heterospecifics respond to mobbing calls given by group-living species. In this study, we investigate whether the mobbing calls given by Western Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen dorsalis) lead to the recruitment of heterospecifics. By presenting a taxidermied red fox (Vulpes vulpes)-representing a terrestrial predator threat-to a population of magpies and heterospecific species occupying the same area, we demonstrate that magpie calls given in response to a terrestrial predator recruit heterospecifics to the mobbing event. Heterospecifics are more likely to approach and engage in mobbing behavior when the predator is associated with magpie presence than when magpies are absent. We found that larger magpie groups produced more alarm calls than did smaller groups, but we found no evidence that group size affected heterospecific recruitment to the mobbing site. Therefore, the occurrence of magpie alarm calls, rather than the number of individuals giving alarm calls, seems to be the primary predictor of heterospecific recruitment to a mobbing site. Moreover, we used a playback experiment to test if heterospecifics responded more to single-magpie mobbing alarm calls than to single mobbing alarm calls given by a non-social species (red wattlebird, Anthochaera carunculata). We found that heterospecifics responded more to the playbacks of magpie than to red wattlebird alarm calls. Our study therefore suggests that Australian magpies may play a central role as information sources for heterospecific species during predator detection and mobbing events. Significance statement Mobbing-when individuals move toward and vocalize or harass a predator-is a good example of interspecific communication. Loud vocalizations produced during mobbing behavior have been known to not only modify the behavior of the predator but to also recruit individuals to the mobbing event from a variety of different species. Although the response to heterospecific mobbing calls is becoming well documented, it remains largely unknown how heterospecifics respond to the mobbing calls of group-living species, even though these species can provide significant benefits for heterospecific species sharing the same habitat (via increased vigilance and predator detection rates for example). By presenting a predator model and using a series of playback experiments, we demonstrate that group-living Western Australian magpies may play a central role as information sources during predator detection and mobbing events.

TI  - Predicting the impacts of land use/land cover change on land surface temperature using remote sensing approach in Al Kut, Iraq
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) classes significantly impact land surface temperature (LST). This study predicted LULC change and their impacts on seasonal (summer and winter) LST variations in Al Kut, Iraq. Landsat TM/OLI images for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 were used to estimate LULC and LST's past status using remote sensing (RS) techniques. Based on the past characteristics of the images future LULC and seasonal LST were predicted for year 2030. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify the LULC classes. Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was used to predict the future LST considering the LULC indexes as influential variables. Results suggest a significant increase in urban area by +8.74% and reduction in green cover by -25.87% from 2000 to 2020. Increment in maximum LST took place for both summer and winter season by 3.79 degrees C and 3.16 degrees C in last two decades. Maximum LST was recorded in urban area (48 degrees C) and water bodies (35 degrees C) exhibit minimum LST. The correlation study demonstrates a strong positive relation of LST with Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and negative relation with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The prediction result also demonstrates increase in urban area (+17.02%) and loss of vegetation cover (-15.57%) for 2030. The maximum LST will likely to increase by 1.62 degrees C and 2.68 degrees C for summer and winter seasons in predicted year 2030. This study will provide effective guidelines for urban planners of Kut city for ensuring planned and sustainable urban development in future.

TI  - Affectonyms: Semantics, Pragmatics, and Cultural Linguistics
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses Russian affectonyms (affectionate vocatives) as an important part of emotive vocabulary, speech etiquette, and linguistic worldview. Affectonyms are a unique phenomenon of the language system. Despite their high level of intimacy, they indicate not only a tight circle of close people (lovers, married couples, parents and children), but also everyday communication between acquaintances and, occasionally, strangers. The main pragmatic goal of affectionate vocatives is to form the favorable climate of trust and mutual understanding. The analysis of affectonyms as universal and ideo-ethnic entities is based on the concepts of modem East European linguists. There are some basic universal characteristics of affectonyms: (1) they have a high degree of expressiveness sometimes revealed only in the diachronic aspect; (2) from a historical perspective, they are a product of melioration of lexical meaning; (3) they demonstrate the emotiogenity as the ability to evoke an emotional state in a recipient; (4) the range of their pragmatic meanings is extremely wide; (5) they implement phatic and appellate functions of language. The analysis of the data of the Russian National Corpus allows to drawing a number of conclusions about additional semantic and pragmatic meanings of affectonyms, including the following: affection, familiarity, condescension, irony, reproach, soft and extreme aggression. The detailed comparative analysis of the Dictionary of Russian Speech Etiquette by A.G. Balakay and the data of the Russian National Corpus reveals some unique features of Russian affectonyms: (1) they have rich word derivation, especially due to diminutive forms; (2) they are closely related to the traditional linguistic picture of the world, which is sometimes quite obscure for native speakers; (3) they always reflect the rules of etiquette of a particular time; (4) they have gender specification, represented by gender neutral/specific and gender fluid (diachronically) names; (5) they are actively used for creating ironic senses. The findings suggest that this research could also be useful for a future study into a new linguistic direction (Peace Linguistics), which is part of the interdisciplinary Peace Studies.

TI  - Modeling and Spatiotemporal Mapping of Water Quality through Remote Sensing Techniques: A Case Study of the Hassan Addakhil Dam
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - With its high water potential, the Ziz basin is one of the most important basins in Morocco. This paper aims to develop a methodology for spatiotemporal monitoring of the water quality of the Hassan Addakhil dam using remote sensing techniques combined with a modeling approach. Firstly, several models were established for the different water quality parameters (nitrate, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a) by combining field and satellite data. In a second step, the calibration and validation of the selected models were performed based on the following statistical parameters: compliance index R-2, the root mean square error and p-value. Finally, the satellite data were used to carry out spatiotemporal monitoring of the water quality. The field results show excellent quality for most of the samples. In terms of the modeling approach, the selected models for the three parameters (nitrate, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a) have shown a good correlation between the measured and estimated values with compliance index values of 0.62, 0.56 and 0.58 and root mean square error values of 0.16 mg/L, 0.65 mg/L and 0.07 mu g/L for nitrate, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a, respectively. After the calibration, the validation and the selection of the models, the spatiotemporal variation of water quality was determined thanks to the multitemporal satellite data. The results show that this approach is an effective and valid methodology for the modeling and spatiotemporal mapping of water quality in the reservoir of the Hassan Addakhil dam. It can also provide valuable support for decision-makers in water quality monitoring as it can be applied to other regions with similar conditions.

TI  - Vegetation Productivity Losses Linked to Mediterranean Hot and Dry Events
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent hot and dry conditions play an important role in vegetation dynamics, being generally associated with reduced activity. In the Mediterranean region, ecosystems are adapted to such conditions. However, prolonged and intense heat and drought or the occurrence of compound hot and dry events may still have a negative impact on vegetation activity. This work aims to study how the productivity of Mediterranean vegetation is affected by hot and dry events, examining a set of severe episodes that occurred in three different regions (Iberian Peninsula, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Europe) between 2001 and 2019. The analysis relies on remote sensing products, namely Gross Primary Production from MODIS to detect and monitor vegetative stress and LST from MODIS and SM from ESA CCI to evaluate the influence of temperature and soil water availability on stressed vegetation. Of all events, the 2005 episode in the Iberian Peninsula was the most significant, affecting large sectors of low tree cover areas and crops and leading to reductions of annual plant productivity in affected vegetation of similar to 47 TgC/year. The obtained results highlight the influence of land-atmosphere coupling on vegetation productivity and clarified the role of warm springs on vegetation activity and soil moisture that may amplify summer temperatures. The functional recovery of affected vegetation productivity after these episodes varied across events, ranging from months to years. This work highlights the influence of hot and dry events on vegetation productivity in the Mediterranean basin and the usefulness of remote-sensing products to assess the response of different land covers to such episodes.

TI  - Empirical Modelling of Public Lighting Emission Functions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Study of light at night has increased in recent decades due to the recognition of its impact on the environment, potential health concerns, as well as both the financial and carbon cost of energy waste. The advent of more extensive and improved ground-based measurements together with quantifiable satellite data has revolutionised the field, and provided data to test improved theoretical models. However, "closing the loop " and finding a detailed connection between these measurements requires knowledge of the "city emission function ", the angular distribution of upwelling radiation with zenith distance. Simplified analytical functions have been superseded by more complex models involving statistical approximation of emission sources and obstructions and inversion techniques now permit the estimation of emission functions from the observed sky brightness measurements. In this paper, we present an efficient GIS-based method to model public lighting using real-world photometric data and high-resolution digital elevation maps of obstructions such as buildings and trees at a 1 m scale. We discuss the results of this work for a sample of Irish towns as well as a city area. We also compare our results to previous emission functions as well as to observed asymmetries in emission detected by satellites such as SUOMI VIIRS.

TI  - Evaluation of Economic Linkage between Urban Built-Up Areas in a Mid-Sized City of Uyo (Nigeria)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth has transformed many mid-sized cities into metropolitan areas. One of the effects of this growth is a change in urban growth patterns, which are directly linked with household income. Hence, this paper aims to assess the effect of different economic variables that trigger urban built-up patterns, using economic indicators such as city administrative taxes, a socio-economic survey of living standards, household income and satellite data. The regression model was used and adapted, and a case study is presented for the mid-sized city of Uyo in southeastern Nigeria. The result shows sparse built-up growth patterns with numerous adverse effects. Although, there is awareness of the impact of unregulated sparse built-up growth patterns in the literature, little attention has been given to this growth pattern in Africa. The results also show that increases in federal allocation (27%), investment tax (22%), direct tax (52%) and indirect tax (26%) have led to urban expansion into vegetative land and have a causal correlation with different built-up areas. Hence, medium and high-income earners migrate to suburban areas for bigger living space and a lack of basic social amenities affects the land value in suburban areas. They also assist in the provision of social amenities in the neighborhood.

TI  - Evidence of Smoke From Wildland Fire in Surface Water of an Unburned Watershed
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large wildland fires generate smoke that can compromise air quality over a wide area. Limited studies have suggested that smoke constituents may enter natural water bodies. In an 18-year water monitoring study, we examined whether smoke from distant wildland fires had a detectable effect on ion content in a mountain river in an unburned watershed. Significant local smoke occurred in six years as traced by MODIS satellite data of fires, regional and local atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and the amount of potassium (K+) in PM2.5 as a marker of vegetation combustion. Rainwater had elevated K+ and calcium (Ca2+, also associated with wildland fire smoke) in high-smoke years compared to low-smoke years, and was the primary route of atmospheric deposition. Similarly, river water in high-smoke years had elevated concentrations of K+ and Ca2+, with a higher ratio of K+ to Ca2+ compared to low-smoke years. River concentrations were generally unrelated to river discharge and observed K+ concentrations in high-smoke and low-smoke years could be accounted for by atmospheric deposition. Our study provides early evidence that wildland fires affect water quality far beyond the watersheds where they occur. Wildland fires distribute vast quantities of smoke containing nutrients, toxins and microbes and are increasing in North America. Potassium is a routinely-measured water quality parameter that can act as an indicator of biomass smoke inputs. Further work is needed on the patterns and processes by which wildfire smoke enters water as well as on the consequences for ecosystems and human health.

TI  - Application of Carbon Nanoparticles in Tracing Sentinel Lymph Node in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon nanoparticle (CNP) tracer technology is a new type of tracing method adopted in the medical field. It can black stain the pelvic lymph node of endometrial cancer and has many advantages such as non-invasiveness and easy tolerance. To analyze the indicative role of CNP in the diagnosis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in endometrial cancer (EC) patients, 102 patients who were diagnosed as EC by hysteroscopy were deemed as the research objects. The two-point method was adopted to inject CNP suspension into the cervix of the patients. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) was adopted for lymph node metastasis detection. The cytokeratin pathological micro metastasis detection method was employed to detect whether the lymph node was metastasized, and its distribution area was recorded. Moreover, the detection rate, diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of SLN was recorded. The results showed that the proportion of stage I patients was 74.37%, the proportion of stage II patients was 15.68%, and the proportion of stage III patients was 9.95%. The proportion of well-differentiated patients was 51.47%, the proportion of moderately differentiated patients was 38.94%, and the proportion of poorly differentiated patients was 9.59%. The number of lymph node dissections was 2305, of which 590 was SLN and 1715 was NSLN. The SLN distribution areas were common iliac area (45.17%), obturator area (34.44%), externaliliac area (11.15%), and internaliliac area (9.34%). 18 patients IP: 182.75.50.34 On: Thu, 03 Feb 2022 07:24:28 had SLN pelvic cavity metastasis, and no signs of NSLN mtastasis were found. The detection rate of SLN was Copyright: American Scientific Publishers 95.26%. The diagnosis accuracy was 98.55%, the sensitivity was 95.27%, and the specificity was 87.28%. In short, CNP played an imperative role in the diagnosis of SLN metastasis in EC patients. The main distribution areas of patients with SLN were common iliac area and obturator area. The lymph node detection rate and accuracy were high.

TI  - Forest fire probability under ENSO conditions in a semi-arid region: a case study in Guanajuato
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires can pose a threat to forest ecosystems when those ecosystems are not fire-adapted or when forest community conditions make them vulnerable to wildfires. Thus, investigating fire-prone environmental conditions is urgently needed to create action plans that preserve these ecosystems. In this sense, climate variables can determine the environmental conditions favorable for forest fires. Our study confirms that vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is an essential climate indicator for forest fires, as it is related to maximum temperatures and low humidity, representing the stress conditions for vegetation prone to fires. This study explores the extent to which ENSO phases can modulate climatic conditions that lead to high VPD over Guanajuato, a semi-arid region in central Mexico, during the dry season (March-April-May). Using fire occurrence data from MODIS (2000-2019) and Landsat 5 (1998-1999), we developed a climatic probability model for the occurrence of forest fires using VPD estimated from ERA5 reanalysis for each ENSO phase. We found that VPD and the occurrence of forest fires were higher during El Nino than under Neutral and La Nina years, with a higher risk of forest fire occurrence in Guanajuato's southern region. This study concludes that it is necessary to implement regional and local fire management plans, especially where the largest number of natural protected areas is located.

TI  - A Training Sample Migration Method for Wetland Mapping and Monitoring Using Sentinel Data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems due to their critical services to both humans and the environment. Therefore, wetland mapping and monitoring are essential for their conservation. In this regard, remote sensing offers efficient solutions due to the availability of cost-efficient archived images over different spatial scales. However, a lack of sufficient consistent training samples at different times is a significant limitation of multi-temporal wetland monitoring. In this study, a new training sample migration method was developed to identify unchanged training samples to be used in wetland classification and change analyses over the International Shadegan Wetland (ISW) areas of southwestern Iran. To this end, we first produced the wetland map of a reference year (2020), for which we had training samples, by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images and the Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC) of this reference map were 97.93% and 0.97, respectively. Then, an automatic change detection method was developed to migrate unchanged training samples from the reference year to the target years of 2018, 2019, and 2021. Within the proposed method, three indices of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the mean Standard Deviation (SD) of the spectral bands, along with two similarity measures of the Euclidean Distance (ED) and Spectral Angle Distance (SAD), were computed for each pair of reference-target years. The optimum threshold for unchanged samples was also derived using a histogram thresholding approach, which led to selecting the samples that were most likely unchanged based on the highest OA and KC for classifying the test dataset. The proposed migration sample method resulted in high OAs of 95.89%, 96.83%, and 97.06% and KCs of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.96 for the target years of 2018, 2019, and 2021, respectively. Finally, the migrated samples were used to generate the wetland map for the target years. Overall, our proposed method showed high potential for wetland mapping and monitoring when no training samples existed for a target year.

TI  - Mapping of plastic greenhouses and mulching films from very high resolution remote sensing imagery based on a dilated and non-local convolutional neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the important components of modern facility agriculture, both plastic greenhouses and mulching films have been widely utilized in agriculture production. Due to the similarity of spectral signatures, it remains a challenging task to separate plastic greenhouses and mulching films from each other. Meanwhile, deep learning has achieved great performance in many computer vison tasks, and has become a research hotspot in remote sensing image analysis. However, deep learning has been rarely studied for the accurate mapping of agricultural plastic covers, especially for the long-neglected issue of the separation between plastic greenhouses and mulching films. Therefore, this study aims to propose a deep learning model to detect and separate plastic greenhouses and mulching films from very high resolution (VHR) remotely sensed data, providing the agricultural plastic covered maps for relevant decision-makers. In specific, the proposed model is a dilated and non-local convolutional neural network (DNCNN), which consists of several multi-scale dilated convolution blocks and a non-local feature extraction module. The former contains a series of dilated convolutions with various dilated rates, which is to aggregate multi-level spatial features hence to account for the scale variations of land objects. While the latter utilizes a non-local module to extract the global and contextual features to further enhance the interclass separability. Experimental results from Shenxian, China and Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia show that the DNCNN in this study obtains a high accuracy with an overall accuracy of 89.6% and 92.6%, respectively. Compared to standard convolution, the inclusion of dilated convolution could raise the classification accuracy by 2.7%. In addition, ablation analysis shows that the non-local feature extraction module could also improve the classification accuracy by about 2%. This study demonstrates that the proposed DNCNN yields an effective approach for the accurate agricultural plastic cover mapping from VHR remotely sensed imagery.

TI  - The Politics of Russian Revisionism: Diplomacy of a Worldview, 2011-14
T2  - RUSSIAN POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Russia's use of force in Ukraine has been described as a challenge to the rule of international law and an event of unilateral intervention. This paper provides a reinterpretation of this standard history of Russian revisionism. Our new history places this practice in a global governance context through an analysis of the politics concerning the international legal norm of `non-intervention' and its legitimate/illegitimate exceptions for collective intervention. This analysis discloses a practice of Russian diplomacy that emerges out of resistance to humanitarian interventions advocated for by Western states. This practice justifies its own state-bound humanitarian intervention as the legitimate exception to the foundation of international order, which Russian diplomacy had previously sought to restore. We argue the political discourse of the worldview of `state civilization' explains these events of Russian revisionism. We conclude with an analysis of the international paradoxes of peace and conflict contingent on this Russian worldview.

TI  - Weak turbulence effects on different beams carrying orbital angular momentum
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been of interest for its use in free-space optical communications (FSOC), directed energy applications, and remote sensing (RS). For FSOC and RS, it is necessary to measure the wavefront of the beam to recover transmitted or environmental information, respectively. In this computational study, common OAM beams such as the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG), Bessel-Gaussian (BG), and Bessel beams are propagated through atmospheric turbulence and compared to their Gaussian beam counterpart. The turbulence is simulated using multiple phase screens within the framework of a split-step method. Beam metrics used to quantify beam propagation will include the spatial coherence radius, OAM spectrum, on-axis intensity, spot size, divergence, and on-axis scintillation. Atmospheric turbulence along the path is limited to the weak scintillation limit, where beam parameters can be predicted analytically using the Rytov approximation. The results show that BG beams and multiplexed BG beams retain more OAM information than their LG and Bessel beam counterparts. The LG beam on-axis intensity and on-axis scintillation are seen to be independent of OAM mode. The scintillation of the LG beam is less than a BG, Bessel, and Gaussian beam across low-and high-order OAM modes. Insight into these results is discussed through studying the beam divergence, while the initial spot sizes of the Gaussian, LG, and BG beams are limited to the same spatial extent.

TI  - Peace without Impunity: Worldview in the Settlement of Civil Wars
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Peace processes can bring to the fore a host of normative and practical questions that produce heated public disagreement. These disagreements can generate political obstacles to the successful negotiation and implementation of settlements. Here, I argue that public dissatisfaction with peace processes is in part rooted in core, fundamental differences in worldview, which have been found to inform how citizens form preferences over a wide array of security-related policy issues. Drawing on an original survey fielded at the height of the Colombian peace process, I show that the core values that guide people's everyday lives have implications for how they think about and behave during peace processes. Results from a conjoint experiment indicate that individuals with more fixed, or "authoritarian," worldviews hold strong preferences for more punitive agreements than individuals who score low on these qualities. These same individuals were also more likely than their counterparts to abstain from the 2016 peace referendum, although surprisingly not more likely to vote against than in favor. The study sheds light on the microfoundations of public barriers to conflict termination and suggests that core, fundamental differences underlie public discord on the merits of conflict negotiations.

TI  - COASTAL RESPONSE TO THE PASSAGE OF TROPICAL CYCLONE JULIETTE ON THE CENTRAL PACIFIC COAST OF MEXICO
T2  - GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ coastal oceanographic and meteorological data were collected on the Mexican Tropical Pacific coast near Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, Mexico, during September 2001 from before, during and after the passing of Hurricane Juliette. The hurricane resulted in a significant deepening of the thermocline, mixing of the upper 40 m of the water column, and a rise in sea level of almost 50 cm at the coast, with effects lasting for about 5 days. A decrease in temperature and an increase in salinity occurred in the upper 20 m of the water column, with the opposite occurring below 20 m. Although analyses of open ocean responses to hurricanes are widely available from satellite data, in situ coastal water-column and sea-level data are difficult to acquire, yet crucial to inform modeling studies. This data set provides a rare opportunity to explore in situ hurricane effects on this coast.

AB  - In the summer of 1943 Edgar Zilsel resigned from his membership in the exile organization of Austrian Social Democrats, a political movement he had joined as a young man back in Vienna. Zilsel (1891-1944) is known as an innovative scholar bridging philosophy, history and sociology of science, and belonging to the so-called left wing of the Vienna Circle of Logical Emipricism. Details of his political convictions are less recognized. A recently detected manuscript illuminates his worldview: His resignation letter had been accompanied by a short exposition of his interpretation of socialism near the end of World War II. The article introduces Zilsel, his life and work and publishes for the first time Zilsel's statement from 1943.

TI  - Within-Field Rice Yield Estimation Based on Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is considered one of the most important crops in the world. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), rice production has increased significantly (156%) during the last 50 years, with a limited increase in cultivated area (24%). With the recent advances in remote sensing technologies, it is now possible to monitor rice crop production for a better understanding of its management at field scale to ultimately improve rice yields. In this work, we monitor within-field rice production of the two main rice varieties grown in Valencia (Spain) JSendra and Bomba during the 2020 season. The sowing date of both varieties was May 22-25, while the harvesting date was September 15-17 for Bomba and October 5-8 for JSendra. Rice yield data was collected over 66.03 ha (52 fields) by harvesting machines equipped with onboard sensors that determine the dry grain yield within irregular polygons of 3-7 m width. This dataset was split in two, selecting 70% of fields for training and 30% for validation purposes. Sentinel-2 surface reflectance spectral data acquired from May until September 2020 was considered over the test area at the two different spatial resolutions of 10 and 20 m. These two datasets were combined assessing the best combination of spectral reflectance bands (SR) or vegetation indices (VIs) as well as the best timing to infer final within-field yields. The results show that SR improves the performance of models with VIs. Furthermore, the correlation of each spectral band and VIs with the final yield changes with the dates and varieties. Considering the training data, the best correlation with the yields is obtained on July 4, with R-2 for JSendra of 0.72 at 10 m and 0.76 at 20 m resolution, while the R-2 for Bomba is 0.87 at 10 m and 0.92 at 20 m resolution. Based on the validation dataset, the proposed models provide within-field yield modelling Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.254 t.ha(-1) (Mean Absolute Percentage Error, MAPE, of 3.73%) for JSendra at 10 m (0.240 t.ha(-1); 3.48% at 20 m) and 0.218 t.ha(-1) (MAPE 5.82%) for Bomba (0.223 t.ha(-1); 5.78% at 20 m) on July 4, that is three months before harvest. At parcel level the model's MAE is 0.176 t.ha(-1) (MAPE 2.61%) for JSendra and 0.142 t.ha(-1) (MAPE 4.51%) for Bomba. These results confirm the close correlation between the rice yield and the spectral information from satellite imagery. Additionally, these models provide a timeliness overview of underperforming areas within the field three months before the harvest where farmers can improve their management practices. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of optimum agronomic management of rice plants during the first weeks of rice cultivation (40-50 days after sowing) to achieve high yields.

TI  - A Technical Review of Planet Smallsat Data: Practical Considerations for Processing and Using PlanetScope Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - With the ability to capture daily imagery of Earth at very high spatial resolutions, commercial smallsats are emerging as a key resource for the remote sensing community. Planet (Planet Labs, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) operates the largest constellation of Earth imaging smallsats, which have been capturing multispectral imagery for consumer use since 2016. Use of these images is growing in the remote sensing community, but the variation in radiometric and geometric quality compared to traditional platforms (i.e., Landsat, MODIS, etc.) means the images are not always 'analysis ready' upon download. Neglecting these variations can impact derived products and analyses. Users also must contend with constantly evolving technology, which improves products but can create discrepancies across sensor generations. This communication provides a technical review of Planet's PlanetScope smallsat data streams and extant literature to provide practical considerations to the remote sensing community for utilizing these images in remote sensing research. Radiometric and geometric issues for researchers to consider are highlighted alongside a review of processing completed by Planet and innovations being developed by the user community to foster the adoption and use of these images for scientific applications.

TI  - Standardized comparison of radioguided surgery with indocyanine green detection of the sentinel lymph node in early stage breast cancer patients: Personal experience and literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) by means of radio-guided surgery (RGS) is the standard for pathologic staging of axillary lymph nodes in breast patients. Herein, a prospective clinical study was performed to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of indocyanine green (ICG) compared to RGS.Patients and Methods: Between 2016 and 2017, 54 patients with early-stage breast cancer <2 cm and clinically negative lymph node underwent combined SLNB by means of ICG with HyperEye Medical System (HEMS) and standard RGS at the Breast Unit of "Ospedale Policlinico San Martino" in Genoa-Italy.Results: At least one sentinel lymph node was identified by ICG in 52 out of 54 patients with 96.3% detection rate of ICG as compared to 100% with RGS. ICG detection was cheaper if the cost of the device was not included; when also this cost was added, the breakeven point could have been reached when at least 118 patients undergo ICG detection of SLNB, with an expected saving of about 254.00 (sic) per patient.Conclusions: The efficacy of ICG was quite acceptable and, as regards its effectiveness, the amortization of the higher costs of HEMS will be faster in high-volume as compared to low-volume centers (3 months vs. 17 months) due to the initial cost of the instrumentation.

TI  - AGO Recommendations for the Surgical Therapy of the Axilla After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: 2021 Update
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - For many decades, the standard procedure to treat breast cancer included complete dissection of the axillary lymph nodes. The aim was to determine histological node status, which was then used as the basis for adjuvant therapy, and to ensure locoregional tumour control. In addition to the debate on how to optimise the therapeutic strategies of systemic treatment and radiotherapy, the current discussion focuses on improving surgical procedures to treat breast cancer. As neoadjuvant chemotherapy is becoming increasingly important, the surgical procedures used to treat breast cancer, whether they are breast surgery or axillary dissection, are changing. Based on the currently available data, carrying out SLNE prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended. In contrast, surgical axillary management after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered the procedure of choice for axillary staging and can range from SLNE to TAD and ALND. To reduce the rate of false negatives during surgical staging of the axilla in pN+(CNB) stage before NACT and ycN0 after NACT, targeted axillary dissection (TAD), the removal of > 2 SLNs (SLNE, no untargeted axillary sampling), immunohistochemistry to detect isolated tumour cells and micro-metastases, and marking positive lymph nodes before NACT should be the standard approach. This most recent update on surgical axillary management describes the significance of isolated tumour cells and micro-metastasis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the clinical consequences of low volume residual disease diagnosed using SLNE and TAD and provides an overview of this year's AGO recommendations for surgical management of the axilla during primary surgery and in relation to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic absolute sea level variations were analyzed based on multi-mission satellite altimetry data and tide gauge observations for the period of 1993-2018. The range of linear absolute sea level trends were found -2.00 mm/a to 6.88 mm/a excluding the central Arctic, positive trend rates were predominantly located in shallow water and coastal areas, and negative rates were located in high-latitude areas and Baffin Bay. Satellite-derived results show that the average secular absolute sea level trend was (2.53 +/- 0.42) mm/a in the Arctic region. Large differences were presented between satellite-derived and tide gauge results, which are mainly due to low satellite data coverage, uncertainties in tidal height processing and vertical land movement (VLM). The VLM rates at 11 global navigation satellite system stations around the Arctic Ocean were analyzed, among which 6 stations were tide gauge co-located, the results indicate that the absolute sea level trends after VLM corrected were of the same magnitude as satellite altimetry results. Accurately calculating VLM is the primary uncertainty in interpreting tide gauge measurements such that differences between tide gauge and satellite altimetry data are attributable generally to VLM.

TI  - Characteristics of the Annual Maximum and Minimum Water Temperatures in Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia from 2000 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tonle Sap Lake contains unique hydrological environments and ecosystems. Although water temperature is an important consideration in lake management, information on the water temperature of the lake is limited. Thus, we investigated the characteristics of the daytime water temperatures of the Tonle Sap Lake from 2000 to 2019 using MOD11A1, a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) product. Moreover, the relationship between water temperature fluctuations and hydrological-meteorological conditions was analyzed. The maximum and minimum daytime water temperatures were recorded in May (30.7 degrees C) and January (24.6 degrees C), respectively, each a month after the maximum and minimum air temperatures were recorded. The annual maximum, average, and minimum water levels showed a downward trend (0.14, 0.08, and 0.01 m/y, respectively). The annual maximum water temperature increased at a rate of 0.17 degrees C/decade, whereas the annual minimum water temperature decreased at a rate of 0.91 degrees C/decade. The annual maximum daytime water temperature had a strong negative correlation with water level change (flood pulse) and a weaker correlation with air temperature. The annual minimum daytime water temperature presented the strongest positive correlation with water level change (flood pulse) in the previous year. However, there was no correlation between the annual minimum daytime water temperature and air temperature. These results indicate that water temperature in the Tonle Sap Lake is mainly affected by water level fluctuations, which are mainly driven by flood pulses.

TI  - Detecting the Surface Signature of Riverine and Effluent Plumes along the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast Using Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The clear and reliable detection of effluent plumes using satellite data is especially challenging. The surface signature of such events is of a small scale; it shows a complex interaction with the local environment and depends greatly on the effluent and marine water constitution. In the context of remote sensing techniques for detecting treated wastewater discharges, we study the surface signature of small river plumes, as they share specific characteristics, such as higher turbidity levels and increased nutrient concentration, and are fresh compared to the salty marine water. The Bulgarian Black Sea zone proves to be a challenging study area, with its optically complex waters and positive freshwater balance. Additionally, the Bulgarian Black Sea coast is a known tourist destination with an increased seasonal load; thus, the problem of the identification of wastewater discharges is a topical issue. In this study, we analyze the absorption components of the Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) for 84 study points that are located at outfall discharging areas, river estuaries and at different distances from the shoreline, reaching the open sea area at a bottom depth of more than 2000 m. The calculations of IOPs take into account all available Sentinel 2 cloudless acquisitions for three years from 2017 until 2019 and are performed using the Case-2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) processor, implemented in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). The predominant absorber for each study area and its temporal variation is determined, deriving the specific characteristics of the different areas and tracking their seasonal and annual course. Optical data from the Galata AERONET-OC site are used for validating the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton pigment. A conclusion regarding the possibility of distinguishing riverine, marine and coastal water is derived. The study provides a sound basis for estimating the advantages and drawbacks of optical satellite data for tracking the extent of effluent and fluvial plumes with unknown concentrations of optically significant seawater constituents.</p>

TI  - DOES EVOLUTION REVEAL A WORLD WITHOUT INTELLIGENT DESIGN? A PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTION ON THE ATHEISTIC READING OF DARWINISM
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the atheistic reading of Darwinism, Evolution reveals a world without design and challenges the belief in the Divine Origin and supernatural causes. But it is only by relying on 'Ontological Naturalism' as a philosophical worldview that one can offer such an atheistic version of Evolution. In this paper, I show by a critical approach that the naturalists' reading of Evolution has severe faults and shortcomings due to ontological, epistemological and methodological problems. Therefore, by relying on the atheistic reading of Darwinism, one cannot reject the Intelligent Design of the world and prove the needlessness of creatures from supernatural causes. Research findings show that ontologically, evolutionary naturalists, based on material reductionism, ignore a large part of world phenomena - supernatural identities. Epistemologically, the fact that they consider the theory of evolution to be in conflict with belief in God and supernatural causes is indicative of a 'personal ideological decision' rather than a 'neutral scientific position'. But methodologically, the natural sciences and 'scientific method' cannot negatively or positively judge the existence or non-existence of God; because the issue of proving or denying the supernatural goes beyond the expertise of the experiential scientists and their scientific means and methods. Based on these basic deficiencies, ultimately, the naturalists' reading of evolution cannot prove that the world is without intelligent design.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Cloud Removal Considering Ground Changes by Fusing Multitemporal SAR and Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Publicly available optical remote sensing images from platforms such as Sentinel-2 satellites contribute much to the Earth observation and research tasks. However, information loss caused by clouds largely decreases the availability of usable optical images so reconstructing the missing information is important. Existing reconstruction methods can hardly reflect the real-time information because they mainly make use of multitemporal optical images as reference. To capture the real-time information in the cloud removal process, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can serve as the reference images due to the cloud penetrability of SAR imaging. Nevertheless, large datasets are necessary because existing SAR-based cloud removal methods depend on network training. In this paper, we integrate the merits of multitemporal optical images and SAR images to the cloud removal process, the results of which can reflect the ground information change, in a simple convolution neural network. Although the proposed method is based on deep neural network, it can directly operate on the target image without training datasets. We conduct several simulation and real data experiments of cloud removal in Sentinel-2 images with multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR images and Sentinel-2 optical images. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms those state-of-the-art multitemporal-based methods and overcomes the constraint of datasets of those SAR-based methods.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval over a Vegetation-Covered Area Using ALOS-2 L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a significant part in regional hydrological and meteorological systems throughout Earth. It is considered an indispensable state variable in earth science. The high sensitivity of microwave remote sensing to soil moisture, and its ability to function under all weather conditions at all hours of the day, has led to its wide application in SM retrieval. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of ALOS-2 data to estimate SM in areas with high vegetation coverage. Through the water cloud model (WCM), the article simulates the scene coupling between active microwave images and optical data. Subsequently, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize back propagation (GA-BP) neural network technology to retrieve SM. The vegetation descriptors of the WCM, derived from optical images, were the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI). In the vegetation-covered area, 240 field soil samples were collected simultaneously with the ALOS-2 SAR overpass. Soil samples at two depths (0-10 cm, 20-30 cm) were collected at each sampling site. The backscattering of the ALOS-2 with the copolarization was found to be more sensitive to SM than the crosspolarization. In addition, the sensitivity of the soil backscattering coefficient to SM at a depth of 0-10 cm was higher than at a depth of 20-30 cm. At a 0-10 cm depth, the best results were the mean square error (MAE) of 2.248 vol%, the root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.146 vol%, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.056 vol%, when the vegetation is described as by the NDVI. At a 20-30 cm depth, the best results were an MAE of 2.333 vol%, an RMSE of 2.882 vol%, a MAPE of 0.067 vol%, with the NMDI as the vegetation description. The use of the GA-BP NNs method for SM inversion presented in this paper is novel. Moreover, the results revealed that ALOS-2 data is a valuable source for SM estimation, and ALOS-2 L-band data was sensitive to SM even under vegetation cover.

TI  - Secrets of the Astute Red Fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes,</i> Linnaeus, 1758): An Inside-Ecosystem Secret Agent Serving One Health
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An ecosystem's health is based on a delicate balance between human, nonhuman animal, and environmental health. Any factor that leads to an imbalance in one of the components results in disease. There are several bioindicators that allow us to evaluate the status of ecosystems. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes, Linnaeus, 1758) has the widest world distribution among mammals. It is highly adaptable, lives in rural and urban areas, and has a greatly diverse diet. Being susceptible to environmental pollution and zoonotic agents, red foxes may act as sentinels to detect environmental contaminants, climatic changes and to prevent and control outbreaks of emerging or re-emerging zoonosis. This paper aims to compile the latest information that is related to the red fox as a sentinel of human, animal, and environmental health.

TI  - Combining Remote Sensing and Species Distribution Modelling to Assess <i>Pinus hartwegii</i> Response to Climate Change and Land Use from Izta-Popo National Park, Mexico
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - A detailed analysis of distribution shifts in Pinus hartwegii Lindl. is provided across time for Izta-Popo National Park (Mexico). Combining satellite images, species distribution models, and connectivity analysis we disentangled the effect of climate change and anthropogenic land use on the habitat availability. Twenty-four Maxent habitat suitability models with varying complexity were combined with insights on vegetation and land cover change derived from two Landsat satellite images at 30-m resolution from 1993 and 2013. To evaluate effects of climate change on Izta-Popo's P. hartwegii forest, projections for future climatic conditions (averaged for 2050 and 2070) were derived using two General Circulation Models under three Representative CO2 concentration pathways (RCPs). Calculated fragmentation and connectivity indexes (Equivalent Connected Area and Probability of Connectivity metrics) showed significant habitat loss and habitat fragmentation that weakens P. hartwegii dispersion flux and the strength of connections. Projections of future climate conditions showed a reduction of P. hartwegii habitat suitability as populations would have to migrate to higher altitudes. However, the impact of anthropogenic land use change documented over the 20 years masks the predicted impact of climate change in Izta-Popo National Park.</p>

TI  - Extended-Spectrum β-Lactam Resistant <i>Klebsiella</i> <i>pneumoniae</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> in Wild European Hedgehogs (<i>Erinaceus europeus</i>) Living in Populated Areas
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;The alarming emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in human and veterinary medicine has activated awareness for monitoring the levels of AMR pollution in the environment and wildlife. European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are common wild species habiting urban areas in Europe. In this study, the occurrence and distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactam (ESBL) resistant enterobacteria and AMR genes were assessed in wild European hedgehogs in Catalonia, NE Spain. The results showed that 36.8% of the animals were detected as carriers of beta-lactamase/carbapenemase resistance genes, with a special occurrence of human nosocomial bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter freundii. In addition, more than half of the enterobacteria presented a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype and 31% of the isolates had an extended XDR profile. No differences in the spatial distribution of animals with AMR genes were observed within the study region. The results of this study suggest that the close contact with human areas predispose the transmission of AMR genes to wild hedgehogs because they either inhabit and/or feed in an anthropogenic environment. In conclusion, hedgehogs could be good sentinels or bioindicators of AMR environmental pollution, especially in highly populated areas with high human activity.Wildlife has been suggested to be a good sentinel of environmental health because of its close interaction with human populations, domestic animals, and natural ecosystems. The alarming emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in human and veterinary medicine has activated/triggered the awareness of monitoring the levels of AMR pollution in wildlife. European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are common wild species habiting urban areas in Europe. However, there are few studies conducted in hedgehogs as reservoirs of AMR bacteria or genes. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence and distribution of ESBL, AmpC, and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria and AMR genes in wild European hedgehogs in Catalonia, a densely populated region of NE Spain. A total of 115 hedgehogs admitted at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Torreferrussa were studied. To our knowledge, this is the first description of beta-lactam resistant enterobacteria in wild hedgehogs. Interestingly, 36.8% (42/114) of the animals were detected as carriers of beta-lactamase/carbapenemase resistance genes. Klebsiella spp. (59.6%), and specifically K. pneumoniae (84.6%), were the bacteria with the highest proportion of resistance genes, followed by E. coli (34.6%) and C. freundii (5.8%). The most frequently detected genetic variants were blaCTX-M-15 (19.3%), blaSHV-28 (10.5%), blaCMY-1 (9.7%), blaCMY-2 (8.8%), and blaOXA-48 (1.7%). In addition, 52% (27/52) of the isolates presented a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype and 31% had an extended drug resistance (XDR) profile. No clustering of animals with AMR genes within the study region was shown in the spatial analysis, nor differences in the proportion of positive animals among regions, were detected. The results of this study suggest that wild European hedgehogs could be good sentinels of AMR environmental pollution, especially in areas with a high human population density, because they either inhabit and/or feed in an anthropogenic environment. In conclusion, it is crucial to raise awareness of the strong interconnection between habitats and compartments, and therefore this implies that AMR issues must be tackled under the One Health approach.

TI  - A new Philippine geoid model from airborne and terrestrial gravity data
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the computation and re-computations of the preliminary Philippine Geoid Model 2014 (PGM2014) into PGM2016 and then PGM2018 with the technical assistance of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU-Space) using data from land gravity, airborne gravity, marine satellite altimetry and satellite gravity data from the ESA GOCE mission. Digital terrain models used in the computation process were based on 15 '' SRTM data, and all data combined with remove-restore state-of-the art geoid determination methods. The preliminary 2014 geoid model was computed in a global vertical reference system with an estimated standard deviation around 0.25 m, then fitted to GNSS/Leveling with an a priori RMS value of only 0.50 m at that point in time, highlighting the challenges in the geodetic infrastructure of the Philippines, with extreme gravity field variations, and geodynamics which can make GNSS-levelling comparison geoid values highly error-prone. To improve the PGM2014, an interim PGM2016 hybrid geoid was computed using reprocessed, reanalyzed and densified land gravity and improved GNSS/Leveling data. Significant improvement was seen in the reprocessed gravity data as well as the final geoid (SD = 0.022 m; RMS = 0.054 m) after a more tight GNSS fit, taking into account the different vertical datum used in the islands. In 2018, with new satellite data available, densified gravity data, and additional GNSS/Leveling points were used in a new geoid computation. The new computed geoid has an improved fit to GNSS/Leveling of 2 cm. The formal error estimate of the new hybrid geoid across the Philippines is around 10 cm rms, still limited to some degree by island height system and geodynamics effects.

TI  - Determinants for the Development of the Activity of the Catholic Church in Poland in the Field of Social Communication
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Catholic Church has been forced to change its attitude towards social communication and mass media. It has had to face not only religious but image challenges. Worldview matters, contemporary problems regarding the institution of marriage or pedophilia in the Church are constantly being debated in mass media, thus creating dangers in terms of critical public reception. This situation has also been occurring in Poland in recent years. The observed progress regarding opening the Church to media relations and the use of rich instruments of social communication have their reasons rooted not only in the history of the social and political events of the past several decades but also in the changes in the sphere of mass media and social communication. This article is an attempt to generate a peculiar typology of determinants regarding the development of social communication within the institutional church in Poland. Within our framework of methodological conditions, a literature query with available statistical analyses and observations of current events was applied. Our conclusions show the current attitude of the Catholic Church in Poland regarding issues related to the marketization of faith and the medialization of religion.

TI  - Transferable deep learning model based on the phenological matching principle for mapping crop extent
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop mapping is essential for global food security assessments; however, conventional crop mapping models are usually applicable to specific spatial or temporal scales, i.e. "one-time, one-place" model. Moreover, the extensive application of a trained model to other regions is challenging when sufficient groundtruth samples used for training process are unavailable. This study exploited Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and Landsat data for Arkansas, United States (US), to train a U-Net model and then extensively tested the generalization ability of the model in the Corn Belt and California in the US, and even further tested in Liaoning, China, on a transcontinental scale. Two temporal images were generated by compositing the median values of images obtained during two crop growing time windows representing the sowing (from March to May) and vigorous growth periods (from June to August). In order to ensure the consistency of the data distribution between the target areas (testing areas) and the training area, we shifted the time windows of the target areas to match that of the training area following the phenological matching principle. Then we can composite the target data (testing data) according to the time windows matched in the target areas. The results showed a satisfactory accuracy. The average optimal Overall Accuracy of crop mapping in all the target areas exceeded 87%. The average optimal F1-score of corn and rice was 0.79. Finally, we compared the generalization performance of U-Net and Random Forest (RF) classifiers. The results showed that U-Net performed better in all the target areas in the US while RF performed better in target areas where the plots were smaller. The procedure and strategy developed will facilitate the realization of high-performance and automated global model transfer.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of Oral Injury in Suspected Child Abuse Cases One Health System's Experience
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Accurately differentiating inflicted from accidental injury in infants and toddlers is critical. Many studies have documented characteristics of inflicted bruises, fractures, and head injuries facilitating the development of clinical tools. There are few studies characterizing inflicted oral injuries, and no clinical tools exist. This study identified characteristics that differentiated inflicted from accidental oral injuries in children younger than 24 months. Methods Retrospective review using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision billing codes and an internal clinical database tool identified children younger than 24 months between 2004 and 2014. Two groups were created according to the presence or absence of a child abuse diagnosis resulting in an accidental injury and suspected child abuse (SCA) group. Statistical analyses were performed on patient demographics, history of trauma, oral injury characterization, bruises, and fractures. Results Billing codes were applied differently between the accidental injury and SCA groups, even when the same injury was described. Patients with SCA were younger and less mobile when compared with those with accidental injuries (P < 0.0001). Tongue injuries (P < 0.0001) and oropharynx bruising (P = 0.0018) were observed more and lacerations were observed less (P < 0.0001) in the SCA group. The SCA group was less likely to have a trauma history than those with accidental injury (P < 0.0001). Conclusions Several differences in patient characteristics, trauma history, injury type, and location were identified between the accidental versus SCA groups. A future clinical tool that incorporates age, history of trauma on presentation, tongue injury, and oropharynx bruising may assist medical providers in placing child physical abuse in the differential diagnosis.

T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study tried to assess and monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban sprawl and its growth pattern in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia for the last three and half decades (1984 - 2019). Supervised maximum likelihood technique has been used to map the land use land cover of Bahir Dar from 1984 to 2019 using Landsat TM and OLI datasets. Post classification comparison, spatial landscape metrics, and Shannon's entropy index were used to detect changes in land use land cover, investigate the complex spatiotemporal dynamics and degree of urban sprawl. Findings of this study indicated that in the study periods, the built-up area increased at the expanse of cropland and forest. The values of Shannon's entropy index were scaled from 0.45 to 0.74 between 1984 and 2019. Spatial metrics analysis was also computed using CA (261-2566), NP (371 - 3576), PD (1.74 - 9.72), LPI (12-52), ED (7.09 - 46.77) and FRAC-AM (1.12 - 1.25); indicated the existence of sprawl with high dispersion and heterogeneity which gradually expanded from central business district (CBD) to the periphery. The rapid urban expansion which in turn results in urban sprawl has various socio-economic and environmental consequences if sustainable urban planning and management policies are not properly prepared and utilized. The study can enable to devise proper policies and strategies for effective utilization of resources and allocation of infrastructure by controlling improper enforcement of land use.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Polarimetric SAR Data and Experimental Observations in an Arid Environment
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a critical component for Earth science studies, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have high potential for retrieving soil moisture using backscattering models. In this study, polarimetric SAR (PALSAR: Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) data and polarimetric decompositions including span, entropy/H/alpha, and anisotropy, in combination with surface properties resulting from field and laboratory measurements, are used to categorize the natural surface condition and discriminate the backscatter parameter in the test site for applying the inversion soil moisture retrieval. The work aims to introduce the better of two examined models in the research for soil moisture retrieval over the bare land and sparse vegetation in arid regions. After soil moisture retrieval using the two different models, the results of comparison and validation by field measurement of soil moisture have shown that the Oh model has a more realiable accuracy for soil moisture mapping, although it was very difficult to find the best model due to different characteristics in land cover. It seems the inversion model, with the field observation and polarimetric SAR data, has a good potential for extracting surface natural conditions such as surface roughness and soil moisture; however, over- and under-estimation are observed due to land cover variability. The estimation of accurate roughness and moisture data for each type of land cover can increase the accuracy of the results.

TI  - Airborne Lidar Survey, Density-Based Clustering, and Ancient Maya Settlement in the Upper Usumacinta River Region of Mexico and Guatemala
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present results from the archaeological analysis of 331 km(2) of high-resolution airborne lidar data collected in the Upper Usumacinta River basin of Mexico and Guatemala. Multiple visualizations of the DEM and multi-spectral data from four lidar transects crossing the Classic period (AD 350-900) Maya kingdoms centered on the sites of Piedras Negras, La Mar, and Lacanja Tzeltal permitted the identification of ancient settlement and associated features of agricultural infrastructure. HDBSCAN (hierarchical density-based clustering of applications with noise) cluster analysis was applied to the distribution of ancient structures to define urban, peri-urban, sub-urban, and rural settlement zones. Interpretations of these remotely sensed data are informed by decades of ground-based archaeological survey and excavations, as well as a rich historical record drawn from inscribed stone monuments. Our results demonstrate that these neighboring kingdoms in three adjacent valleys exhibit divergent patterns of structure clustering and low-density urbanism, distributions of agricultural infrastructure, and economic practices during the Classic period. Beyond meeting basic subsistence needs, agricultural production in multiple areas permitted surpluses likely for the purposes of tribute, taxation, and marketing. More broadly, this research highlights the strengths of HDBSCAN to the archaeological study of settlement distributions when compared to more commonly applied methods of density-based cluster analysis.

TI  - Impact of Noah-LSM Parameterizations on WRF Mesoscale Simulations: Case Study of Prevailing Summer Atmospheric Conditions over a Typical Semi-Arid Region in Eastern Spain
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study evaluates the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to forecast surface energy fluxes over a region in Eastern Spain. Focusing on the sensitivity of the model to Land Surface Model (LSM) parameterizations, we compare the simulations provided by the original Noah LSM and the Noah LSM with multiple physics options (Noah-MP). Furthermore, we assess the WRF sensitivity to different Noah-MP physics schemes, namely the calculation of canopy stomatal resistance (OPT_CRS), the soil moisture factor for stomatal resistance (OPT_BTR), and the surface layer drag coefficient (OPT_SFC). It has been found that these physics options strongly affect the energy partitioning at the land surface in short-time scale simulations. Aside from in situ observations, we use the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor to assess the Land Surface Temperature (LST) field simulated by WRF. Regarding multiple options in Noah-MP, WRF has been configured using three distinct soil moisture factors to control stomatal resistance (beta factor) available in Noah-MP (Noah, CLM, and SSiB-types), two canopy stomatal resistance (Ball-Berry and Jarvis), and two options for surface layer drag coefficients (Monin-Obukhov and Chen97 scheme). Considering the beta factor schemes, CLM and SSiB-type beta factors simulate very low values of the latent heat flux while increasing the sensible heat flux. This result has been obtained independently of the canopy stomatal resistance scheme used. Additionally, the surface skin temperature simulated by Noah-MP is colder than that obtained by the original Noah LSM. This result is also highlighted when the simulated surface skin temperature is compared to the MSG-SEVIRI LST product. The largest differences between the satellite data and the mesoscale simulations are produced using the Noah-MP configurations run with the Monin-Obukhov parameterization for surface layer drag coefficients. In contrast, the Chen97 scheme shows larger surface skin temperatures than Monin-Obukhov, but at the expense of a decrease in the simulated sensible heat fluxes. In this regard, the ground heat flux and the net radiation play a key role in the simulation results.</p>

TI  - Spectral Reflectance Estimation of UAS Multispectral Imagery Using Satellite Cross-Calibration Method
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a satellite-based cross-calibration (SCC) method for spectral reflectance estimation of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) multispectral imagery. The SCC method provides a low-cost and feasible solution to convert high-resolution UAS images in digital numbers (DN) to reflectance when satellite data is available. The proposed method is evaluated using a multispectral data set, including orthorectified KHawk UAS DN imagery and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager Level-2 surface reflectance (SR) data over a forest/grassland area. The estimated UAS reflectance images are compared with the National Ecological Observatory Network's imaging spectrometer (NIS) SR data for validation. The UAS reflectance showed high similarities with the NIS data for the near-infrared and red bands with Pearson's r values being 97 and 95.74, and root-mean-square errors being 0.0239 and 0.0096 over a 32-subplot hayfield.

TI  - Temporally Generalizable Land Cover Classification: A Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network Unveils Major Coastal Change through Time
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to accurately classify land cover in periods before appropriate training and validation data exist is a critical step towards understanding subtle long-term impacts of climate change. These trends cannot be properly understood and distinguished from individual disturbance events or decadal cycles using only a decade or less of data. Understanding these long-term changes in low lying coastal areas, home to a huge proportion of the global population, is of particular importance. Relatively simple deep learning models that extract representative spatiotemporal patterns can lead to major improvements in temporal generalizability. To provide insight into major changes in low lying coastal areas, our study (1) developed a recurrent convolutional neural network that incorporates spectral, spatial, and temporal contexts for predicting land cover class, (2) evaluated this model across time and space and compared this model to conventional Random Forest and Support Vector Machine methods as well as other deep learning approaches, and (3) applied this model to classify land cover across 20 years of Landsat 5 data in the low-lying coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. We observed striking changes related to sea level rise that support evidence on a smaller scale of agricultural land and forests transitioning into wetlands and "ghost forests". This work demonstrates that recurrent convolutional neural networks should be considered when a model is needed that can generalize across time and that they can help uncover important trends necessary for understanding and responding to climate change in vulnerable coastal regions.

TI  - Relationship between land surface temperature and normalized difference water index on various land surfaces: A seasonal analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study examines the seasonal relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) on various land surfaces in Raipur City of India by using a series of Landsat images for four specific seasons since 1991-92. The LST is retrieved using the mono-window algorithm technique. The results show that the LST of the study area is noticeably affected by surface composition. The best correlation (correlation coefficient r = 0.42) between the LST and NDWI is achieved in the post-monsoon season, followed by the monsoon season (r = 0.33), pre-monsoon season (r = 0.25), and winter season (r = 0.04). There is a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.49, -0.33, -0.31, and -0.25 in the pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter season, respectively) generated between the LST and NDWI on water bodies. On green vegetation, this LST-NDWI correlation is moderate positive (r = 0.67, 0.43, 0.50, and 0.25 in the pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter season, respectively). On human settlement and barren land surface, the correlation is weak positive (r = 0.24, 0.21, 0.27, and 0.15 in the pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter season, respectively). The output of the research work can be used in the town planning section of any urban agglomeration.

TI  - Remote sensing techniques to assess chlorophyll fluorescence in support of crop monitoring in Poland
T2  - MISCELLANEA GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in demand for food and the need to predict the impact of a warming climate on vegetation makes it critical that the best tools for assessing crop production are found. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been proposed as a direct indicator of photosynthesis and plant condition. The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility of estimating ChlF from spectral vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2, in order to monitor crop stress and investigate ChlF changes in response to surface temperatures and meteorological observations. The regressions between thirty three Sentinel-2-derived VIs, and ChlF measured on the ground were evaluated in order to estimate the best predictors of ChlF. The r-Pearson correlation and polynomial linear regression were used. For maize, the highest correlation between ChlF and VIs were found for NDII (r=0.65) and for SIPI (r=-0.68). The weakest relationship between VIs and ChlF were found for sugar beets. Despite this, it should be noted that the highest correlation for sugar beets appeared for EVI (r=0.45) and S2REP (r=0.43). The results of this study indicate the need for a synergy of low and high resolution satellite data that will enable a more detailed analysis for estimating fluorescence and its relation to climatic conditions, environmental aspects, and VIs derived from satellite images.

TI  - Temporal Influences of Vegetation Cover (<i>C</i>) Dynamism on MUSLE Sediment Yield Estimates: NDVI Evaluation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover is an important factor controlling erosion and sediment yield. Therefore, its effect is accounted for in both experimental and modelling studies of erosion and sediment yield. Numerous studies have been conducted to account for the effects of vegetation cover on erosion across spatial scales; however, little has been conducted across temporal scales. This study investigates changes in vegetation cover across multiple temporal scales in Eastern Cape, South Africa and how this affects erosion and sediment yield modelling in the Tsitsa River catchment. Earth observation analysis and sediment yield modelling are integrated within this study. Landsat 8 imagery was processed, and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were extracted and applied to parameterise the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) vegetation (C) factor. Imagery data from 2013-2018 were analysed for an inter-annual trend based on reference summer (March) images, while monthly imagery for the years 2016-2017 was analysed for intra-annual trends. The results indicate that the C exhibits more variation across the monthly timescale than the yearly timescale. Therefore, using a single month to represent the annual C factor increases uncertainty. The modelling shows that accounting for temporal variations in vegetation cover reduces cumulative simulated sediment by up to 85% across the inter-annual and 30% for the intra-annual scale. Validation with observed data confirmed that accounting for temporal variations brought cumulative sediment outputs closer to observations. Over-simulations are high in late autumn and early summer, when estimated C values are high. Accordingly, uncertainties are high in winter when low NDVI leads to high C, whereas dry organic matter provides some protection from erosion. The results of this study highlight the need to account for temporal variations in vegetation cover in sediment yield estimation but indicate the uncertainties associated with using NDVI to estimate C factor.

TI  - Validation of MCD64A1 and FireCCI51 cropland burned area mapping in Ukraine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Small fires represent an important under-represented fire type within active fire and burned area datasets in addition to fire emission inventories, especially in regions with substantial agricultural areas. In order to improve regional and global burned area and fire emissions inventories, active fire and burned area algorithm developers are focusing on improving the mapping accuracy of the timing and spatial extent of these small fires. However, product developers have often relied on burned area validation methods that are designed for larger wildfires, and which are therefore not appropriate for these small fire types. Specifically, validation of crop residue burns using pre-and post-Landsat and Sentinel imagery (as recommended by the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites Working Group on Calibration and Validation (CEOS) Land Product Validation protocol) breaks down because the short duration (less than 1 day) between the burn and the subsequent field plowing removes the burned signature before the next sensor overpass. Here we describe an alternate approach that allowed us to rigorously validate two widely available, coarse-resolution global burned area products - MCD64A1 and FireCCI51 - in cropland through using exhaustively-mapped field-level burned area reference maps produced for seven reference areas in Ukraine in 2016 and 2017. Our results highlight the overall high omission errors (MCD64A1: 71-76% and FireCCI51: 63-99%) and commission errors (MCD64A1: 62-81% and FireCCI51: 49-93%) for both products within cropland, while also demonstrating the difficulty of mapping crop residue burned area within the spring, pre-planting mapping period compared to the summer, post-harvest mapping period. Product-specific artifacts and errors are also demonstrated including the confusion with the larger harvest spectral signal (MCD64A1) and the large swaths of unmapped pixels clustered in regular geometric shapes (FireCCI51). These validation results will be used to help guide the upcoming MCD64A1 Collection 7 burned area product improvements within cropland.

TI  - Detection of Arctic Summer Melt Ponds Using ICESat-2 Altimetry Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the Arctic melt ponds play an important role in determining the interannual variation of the sea ice extent and changes in the Arctic environment, it is crucial to monitor the Arctic melt ponds with high accuracy. Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), which is the NASA's latest altimeter satellite based on the green laser (532 nm), observes the global surface elevation. When compared to the CryoSat-2 altimetry satellite whose along-track resolution is 250 m, ICESat-2 is highly expected to provide much more detailed information about Arctic melt ponds thanks to its high along-track resolution of 70 cm. The basic products of ICESat-2 are the surface height and the number of reflected photons. To aggregate the neighboring information of a specific ICESat-2 photon, the segments of photons with 10 m length were used. The standard deviation of the height and the total number of photons were calculated for each segment. As the melt ponds have the smoother surface than the sea ice, the lower variation of the height over melt ponds can make the melt ponds distinguished from the sea ice. When the melt ponds were extracted, the number of photons per segment was used to classify the melt ponds covered with open-water and specular ice. As photons are much more absorbed in the water-covered melt ponds than the melt ponds with the specular ice, the number of photons per segment can distinguish the water- and ice-covered ponds. As a result, the suggested melt pond detection method was able to classify the sea ice, water-covered melt ponds, and ice-covered melt ponds. A qualitative analysis was conducted using the Sentinel-2 optical imagery. The suggested method successfully classified the water- and ice-covered ponds which were difficult to distinguish with Sentinel-2 optical images. Lastly, the pros and cons of the melt pond detection using satellite altimetry and optical images were discussed.

TI  - Analyzing the Spatial Heterogeneity of the Built Environment and Its Impact on the Urban Thermal Environment-Case Study of Downtown Shanghai
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing urban expansion has accelerated the explosive growth of urban populations and has led to a dramatic increase in the impervious surface area within urban areas. This, in turn, has exacerbated the surface heat island effect within cities. However, the importance of the surface heat island effect within urban areas, scilicet the intra-SUHI effect, has attracted less concern. The aim of this study was to quantitatively explore the relationship between the spatial heterogeneity of a built environment and the intra-urban surface heat island (intra-SUHI) effect using the thermally sharpened land surface temperature (LST) and high-resolution land-use classification products. The results show that at the land parcel scale, the parcel-based relative intensity of intra-SUHI should be attributed to the land parcels featured with differential land developmental intensity. Furthermore, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling quantified the relative importance of the spatial heterogeneity indices of the built environment that exhibit a negative contribution to decreasing the parcel-based intra-SUHI effect or a positive contribution to increasing the intra-SUHI effect. Finally, based on the findings of this study, some practical countermeasures towards mitigating the adverse intra-SUHI effect and improving urban climatic adaption are discussed.</p>

T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, the remote sensing based on meteorological satellite observations has become an important tool for assessing global ecological conditions. Since the early 2000, Fengyun (FY) satellite data have been widely used to derive the key parameters of ecological environment in China. An integrated earth-observation system has been developed in China through using FY satellite data, including retrievals the key ecological parameters as well as to constructions of long-term data records of vegetation index, land surface temperature, net primary production, vegetation health index, and so on. Considerable progress has thus been made in the application and service for prevention of air pollution, management and control of ecological redline, ecological monitoring for the Belt and Road Initiative, and assessment of ecological environment for human settlement. In order to monitor the ecological parameters in real time and with a full dynamic coverage, it is necessary to improve the technology in application of ecological remote sensing from meteorological satellites, and further enhance the ecological meteorological service.

TI  - Flood Hazard Mapping of Rivers in Snow- and Glacier-Fed Basins of Different Hydrological Regimes Using a Hydrodynamic Model under RCP Scenarios
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The global warming trends have accelerated snow and glacier melt in mountainous river basins, which has increased the probability of glacial outburst flooding. Recurrent flood events are a challenge for the developing economy of Pakistan in terms of damage to infrastructure and loss of lives. Flood hazard maps can be used for future flood damage assessment, preparedness, and mitigation. The current study focused on the assessment and mapping of flood-prone areas in small settlements of the major snow- and glacier-fed river basins situated in Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) under future climate scenarios. The Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model was used for flood simulation and mapping. The ALOS 12.5 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to extract river geometry, and the flows generated in these river basins using RCP scenarios were used as the inflow boundary condition. Severe flooding would inundate an area of ~66%, ~86%, ~37% (under mid-21st century), and an area of ~72%, ~93%, ~59% (under late 21st century RCP 8.5 scenario) in the Chitral, Hunza, and Astore river basins, respectively. There is an urgent need to develop a robust flood mitigation plan for the frequent floods occurring in northern Pakistan.

TI  - Mapping Seasonal High-Resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations with Spatiotemporal Bagged-Tree Model across China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are well known to reduce environmental quality, visibility, atmospheric radiation, and damage the human respiratory system. Satellite-based aerosol retrievals are widely used to estimate surface PM2.5 levels because satellite remote sensing can break through the spatial limitations caused by sparse observation stations. In this work, a spatiotemporal weighted bagged-tree remote sensing (STBT) model that simultaneously considers the effects of aerosol optical depth, meteorological parameters, and topographic factors was proposed to map PM2.5 concentrations across China that occurred in 2018. The proposed model shows superior performance with the determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.84, mean-absolute error (MAE) of 8.77 mu g/m(3) and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 15.14 mu g/m(3) when compared with the traditional multiple linear regression (R-2 = 0.38, MAE = 18.15 mu g/m(3), RMSE = 29.06 mu g/m(3)) and linear mixed-effect (R-2 = 0.52, MAE = 15.43 mu g/m(3), RMSE = 25.41 mu g/m(3)) models by the 10-fold cross-validation method. The results collectively demonstrate the superiority of the STBT model to other models for PM2.5 concentration monitoring. Thus, this method may provide important data support for atmospheric environmental monitoring and epidemiological research.</p>

TI  - Extraction of Abandoned Land in Hilly Areas Based on the Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hilly areas are important parts of the world's landscape. A marginal phenomenon can be observed in some hilly areas, leading to serious land abandonment. Extracting the spatio-temporal distribution of abandoned land in such hilly areas can protect food security, improve people's livelihoods, and serve as a tool for a rational land plan. However, mapping the distribution of abandoned land using a single type of remote sensing image is still challenging and problematic due to the fragmentation of such hilly areas and severe cloud pollution. In this study, a new approach by integrating Linear stretch (Ls), Maximum Value Composite (MVC), and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) was proposed to analyze the time-series changes and extract the spatial distribution of abandoned land. MOD09GA, MOD13Q1, and Sentinel-2 were selected as the basis of remote sensing images to fuse a monthly 10 m spatio-temporal data set. Three pieces of vegetation indices (VIs: ndvi, savi, ndwi) were utilized as the measures to identify the abandoned land. A multiple spatio-temporal scales sample database was established, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to extract abandoned land from cultivated land and woodland. The best extraction result with an overall accuracy of 88.1% was achieved by integrating Ls, MVC, and FSDAF, with the assistance of an SVM classifier. The fused VIs image set transcended the single source method (Sentinel-2) with greater accuracy by a margin of 10.8-23.6% for abandoned land extraction. On the other hand, VIs appeared to contribute positively to extract abandoned land from cultivated land and woodland. This study not only provides technical guidance for the quick acquirement of abandoned land distribution in hilly areas, but it also provides strong data support for the connection of targeted poverty alleviation to rural revitalization.

TI  - Landslides Triggered by the 2020 Qiaojia <i>M</i><sub>w</sub>5.1 Earthquake, Yunnan, China: Distribution, Influence Factors and Tectonic Significance
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On May 18, 2020, an M(w)5.1 earthquake occurred in Qiaojia County, Yunnan Province, China. This moderate-sized event triggered massive coseismic landslides, resulting in some damage. In this work, through visual interpretation of high-resolution (0.8-2 m) Gaofen satellite images before and after the earthquake, 167 landslides were delineated, 18 of which were inspected in the field. Using the landslide number density (LND) and landslide area percentage (LAP), we characterized the spatial distribution of these landslides, and analyzed their possible influence factors and tectonic significance. The results show that these landslides are distributed mostly in the NW-SE direction, roughly parallel to the long axis of seismic intensity zones and the strike of the Xiaohe-Baogunao fault (XBF). The LND and LAP decrease with increasing distances to the fault and from the epicenter to fault ends of the XBF. These permit to suggest that the seismogenic fault of the Qiaojia earthquake is likely a hidden branch of the XBF. All of the landslides induced by this event occurred in the region with the seismic intensity of six degrees or greater of the 2014 M(w)6.2 Ludian earthquake. Therefore, it was inferred that the 2020 Qiaojia earthquake was probably the subsequent release of accumulated elastic strain after the 2014 Ludian earthquake in a same tectonic stress regime.

TI  - Inland Reservoir Water Quality Inversion and Eutrophication Evaluation Using BP Neural Network and Remote Sensing Imagery: A Case Study of Dashahe Reservoir
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an inland reservoir water quality parameters' inversion model was developed using a back propagation (BP) neural network to conduct reservoir eutrophication evaluation, according to multi-temporal remote sensing images and field observations. The inversion model based on the BP neural network (the BP inversion model) was applied to a large inland reservoir in Jiangmen city, South China, according to the field observations of five water quality parameters, namely, Chlorophyl-a (Chl-a), Secchi Depth (SD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and Permanganate of Chemical Oxygen Demand (CODMn), and twelve periods of Landsat8 satellite remote sensing images. The reservoir eutrophication was evaluated. The accuracy of the BP inversion model for each water parameter was compared with that of the linear inversion model, and the BP inversion models of two parameters (i.e., Chl-a and CODMn) with larger fluctuation range were superior to the two multiple linear inversion models due to the ability of improving the generalization of the BP neural network. The Dashahe Reservoir was basically in the state of mesotrophication and light eutrophication. The area of light eutrophication accounted for larger proportions in spring and autumn, and the reservoir inflow was the main source of nutrient salts.

TI  - Can't see the wood for the trees? An assessment of street view- and satellite-derived greenness measures in relation to mental health
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenness in the urban living environment is inconsistently associated with mental health. Satellite-derived measures of greenness may inadequately characterize how people encounter greenness visually on site, but systematic comparisons are lacking. We aimed 1) to compare associations between remotely sensed and street view (SV) greenness, and 2) to examine whether these greenness metrics are differently associated with mental health outcomes. We used cross-sectional depressive and anxiety symptoms data on adults in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We employed a convolutional neural network to segment greenness in SV panoramas. Greenness was measured top-down by normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) from 1 m resolution orthophotos (OP) and 30 m resolution Landsat-8 (LS) imagery per postal code, and 100 and 300 m concentric and streetnetwork buffers at the home address. Correlation analyses assessed associations across greenness measures. Covariate-adjusted regressions (e.g., noise, air pollution, deprivation) were conducted to assess associations between each greenness metric and mental health outcomes. Correlations between greenness metrics were significantly positive and moderately high. SV greenness was less sensitive across scales and residential contexts than OP and LS greenness. There was no statistically significant evidence that people with less urban residential greenness had higher depression or anxiety scores than those exposed to higher levels. Nor did different greenness measures, scales, or residential context definitions alter our null associations. This suggests that even though SV and remotely sensed measures capture different aspects of greenness, these differences across exposure metrics did not translate into an association with mental health outcomes.

TI  - Short-Term Variability in Alaska Ice-Marginal Lake Area: Implications for Long-Term Studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Lakes in direct contact with glaciers (ice-marginal lakes) are found across alpine and polar landscapes. Many studies characterize ice-marginal lake behavior over multi-decadal timescales using either episodic similar to annual images or multi-year mosaics. However, ice-marginal lakes are dynamic features that experience short-term (i.e., day to year) variations in area and volume superimposed on longer-term trends. Through aliasing, this short-term variability could result in erroneous long-term estimates of lake change. We develop and implement an automated workflow in Google Earth Engine to quantify monthly behavior of ice-marginal lakes between 2013 and 2019 across south-central Alaska using Landsat 8 imagery. We employ a supervised Mahalanobis minimum-distance land cover classifier incorporating three datasets found to maximize classifier performance: shortwave infrared imagery, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and spatially filtered panchromatic reflectance. We observe physically-meaningful ice-marginal lake area variance on sub-annual timescales, with the median area fluctuation of an ice-marginal lake found to be 10.8% of its average area. The median signal (slow lake growth) to noise (physically-meaningful short-term area variability) ratio is 1.5:1, indicating that short-term variability is responsible for similar to 33% of observed area change in the median ice-marginal lake. The magnitude of short-term area variability is similar for ice-marginal and nonglacial lakes, suggesting that the cause of observed variations is not of glacial origin. These data provide a new context for interpreting behaviors observed in multi-decadal studies and encourage attention to sub-annual behavior of ice-marginal lakes even in long-term studies.

TI  - Immune disorders associated with juvenile recurrent chronic parotitis
T2  - ANALES DE PEDIATRIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Juvenile recurrent chronic parotitis is a rare disease of unknown cause. There is a growing interest in its autoimmune aetiology and its relationship with dysfunctions of cellular and humoral immunity, although there is no agreed protocol for complementary investigations for its study. A consecutive series of cases is presented where the immune alterations and associated autoimmune disorders are investigated, proposing a study algorithm. Patients and methods: A retrospective study was carried out on patients who had juvenile recurrent chronic parotitis during the period from 2013 to 2016 and a follow-up of at least 2 years. After its clinical and ultrasound diagnosis, complementary examinations were syste-matically carried out to investigate infectious, immune, and autoimmune diseases. Results: Of a total of 36 patients with inclusion criteria, 16 (44%) were found with some analyti-cal alteration of a non-specific immunological nature (positive ANA, high IgG, low complement factor 4), or associated with a specific diagnosis, as occurred in 11 patients: Selective IgA defi-ciency (2), Sjogren's syndrome associated or not with systemic lupus erythematosus (3), coeliac disease associated or not with diabetes mellitus (4), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (1), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (1). Conclusion: Juvenile recurrent chronic parotitis can be considered a sentinel sign of other diseases of immunological/autoimmune aetiology for which the diagnosis, monitoring and early treatment can improve its prognosis. Viral infectious aetiology, with the exception of HIV, is not a priority in the study of recurrences. (c) 2021 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - Indocyanine Green Fluorescence-Guided Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Within a North African Population: A Retrospective Study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Radio isotopes and blue dyes alone or in combination arc the most commonly used tracer agents in sentinel node (SN) biopsy for early breast cancer. Recent studies have found fluorescence method using indocyanine green (ICG) as a promising technology with fewer disadvantages.Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of our database that included patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer scheduled for breast surgery and SN biopsy between 2016 and January 2021. Patients who underwent detection using fluorescence-ICG were included in this study.Results: A total of 47 patients were included. Median age was 50 (range: 24-78) years. Mean tumor size was 3.4 +/- 1.5 cm. All patients received ICG injection and 11 received a combination of ICG and blue dye. Forty-live successful SN identifications with ICG were performed and 99 nodes retrieved. Eleven procedures were undertaken after initial systemic therapy. Twenty-four patients had at least one positive SN for malignancy. Mean follow up was 29.2 months and no axillary recurrence was noted during the study period.Conclusion: ICG appears to be a feasible and accurate method for SN biopsy with high identification rate. This is the first study of ICG in sentinel node biopsy in a North African population.

TI  - Patient Selection for Surgery vs Radiotherapy for Early Stage Oropharyngeal Cancer
T2  - CANCER CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgery and radiation therapy are both commonly used in the treatment of early stage (AJCC stages T1-T2 N0-M0) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have been reported to result in similar survival and disease control outcomes. However, their side effect profiles widely differ. Nevertheless, patients who experience the worst side effects and quality of life are the ones who receive the combination of TORS and adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation therapy. Thus, appropriate patient selection for surgery to minimize the need for multimodality therapy is key. We propose, in this paper, the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the node negative (N0) neck as a means that is worth exploring for selecting patients to either radiation therapy or surgery. Patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) would be better directed to upfront radiation. On the contrary, patients with a negative SLN biopsy would be more confidently directed towards TORS and neck dissection alone.

TI  - Assessment of the Temperature Effects in <i>SMAP</i> Satellite Soil Moisture Products in Oklahoma
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a notably important component in various studies in water sciences, including hydrology, agriculture, and water management. To achieve extensive or global spatial coverage, satellites focusing on soil moisture observation have been launched, and many satellite products, such as SMAP and SMOS soil moisture products, have been provided. Most of these satellite observations are based on the dielectric properties of wet soil, and most soil moisture retrieval algorithms are calibrated or evaluated using in situ soil moisture. While the in situ data observed by dielectric sensors, which are the most widely used, are reported to include errors caused by the so-called "temperature effects " of these sensors, the temperature dependency of bulk soil dielectric constant has rarely been discussed on satellite data. Since both in situ dielectric measurements and satellite observations are based on the same physical variable, the dielectric constant and the dielectrically measured in situ soil moisture data are also used as ground truth, it is necessary to assess the impact of temperature effects on satellite products. In this work, we attempted to identify the existence of the temperature effects and evaluate the consequences of removing these effects on in situ and satellite soil moisture and the relationships between the brightness temperature at the soil surface and the brightness temperature provided by satellite observation. To achieve the goals of this study, we analyzed the temperature effects on surface soil moisture data provided by a SMAP mission in Oklahoma, the United States. The results show that temperature effects exist in SMAP soil moisture products in Oklahoma, and the removal of these effects will potentially improve the accuracy of these products.

TI  - Feasibility and Diagnostic Accuracy of Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Screening in Educational Settings and Children Aged < 12 Years
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Children have been disproportionately affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess a saliva-based algorithm for SARS-CoV-2 testing to be used in schools and childcare institutions under pandemic conditions. A weekly SARS-CoV-2 sentinel study in primary schools, kindergartens, and childcare facilities was conducted over a 12-week-period. In a sub-study covering 7 weeks, 1895 paired oropharyngeal and saliva samples were processed for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing in both asymptomatic children (n = 1243) and staff (n = 652). Forty-nine additional concurrent swab and saliva samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (patient cohort). The Salivette(R) system was used for saliva collection and assessed for feasibility and diagnostic performance. For children, a mean of 1.18 mL saliva could be obtained. Based on results from both cohorts, the Salivette(R) testing algorithm demonstrated the specificity of 100% (95% CI 99.7-100) and sensitivity of 94.9% (95% CI 81.4-99.1) with oropharyngeal swabs as reference. Agreement between sampling systems was 100% for moderate to high viral load situations (defined as Ct-values < 33 from oropharyngeal swabs). Comparative analysis of Ct-values derived from saliva vs. oropharyngeal swabs demonstrated a significant difference (mean 4.23; 95% CI 2.48-6.00). In conclusion, the Salivette(R) system proved to be an easy-to-use, safe and feasible saliva collection method and a more pleasant alternative to oropharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing in children aged 3 years and above.</p>

TI  - Response of grassland net primary productivity to dry and wet climatic events in four grassland types in Inner Mongolia.
T2  - Plant-environment interactions (Hoboken, N.J.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Increasing frequency and intensity of climate extremes have profound impacts on grassland biodiversity functioning and stability. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) net primary productivity (NPP) data and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, we assessed the response of NPP to growing-season and annual climate extremes and time-lag of climatic conditions across four grassland types (meadow steppe, typical steppe, steppe desert, and desert steppe) in Inner Mongolia, China from the period 2000 to 2019. Results showed that annual NPP varied significantly across four grassland types, with the highest NPP in meadow steppe and the lowest in desert steppe. Annual NPP of all grassland types increased over the past 20years, but NPP in meadow steppe and typical steppe decreased for the period 2012-2019. Irrespective of grassland type, the 1- and 2-month time-lag of climatic conditions showed significant effects on annual NPP. Growing-season climate was found the better predictor of annual NPP in all grassland types than the annual climate. Compared with growing-season normal climates, annual NPP was lowest in extreme dry events in all grasslands, while highest in extreme wet events in meadow steppe and typical steppe, and in moderate wet events in steppe desert and desert steppe. Typical steppe and steppe desert are highly vulnerable to the increasing intensity of climate extremes, as we found that the losses of NPP in these grasslands in extreme dry were almost double than that of moderate dry events. Surprisingly, for meadow steppe and desert steppe, the losses of NPP for both moderate and extreme dry events were almost the same, which highlights that a low-intensity drought may have profound impacts on the annual NPP of these grasslands. The study provides the key insight in scientific basis to improve our understanding of the effects of climate extremes on grassland NPP, which is critical to sustainable management of grassland and maintain ecosystem stability.

TI  - How is urbanization shaping agricultural land-use? Unraveling the nexus between farmland abandonment and urbanization in China
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization often results in agricultural expansion but can also lead to farmland abandonment. However, it remains unclear about the extent, exact timing and determinants of farmland abandonment in response to ongoing urbanization. Using the example of China's Sunan economic region, we present the spatiotemporal trajectories of farmland abandonment and recultivation from 2001 to 2018. We classified Landsat satellite image time-series with a regression trees classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Further, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and rates of farmland abandonment and recultivation. Spatially-explicit logistic regressions were applied to explore the determinants of farmland abandonment in space and time. Our results show widespread farmland abandonment: approximately 232,700 ha of farmland had ever been abandoned from 2001 to 2018, with the highest annual abandonment rate (8.5%) in 2017. Approximately 66,200 ha of abandoned fields were later recultivated, with the maximum recultivated area (13,600 ha) in 2018. Approximately 92% of abandoned fields were later recultivated or reused as the impervious surface within two years of the first detection of abandonment, suggesting more rapid land transformation. The regressions reveal that locational and socio-economic factors determined farmland abandonment patterns. Specifically, a higher likelihood of farmland abandonment was statistically associated with an increased distance from the nearest settlements; the significantly positive relationship between 'Non-agricultural GDP' and farmland abandonment strengthened over time. In contrast, a lower likelihood of farmland abandonment was observed in areas with more cash crops. The statistical results may extend the application of the Ricardian comparative advantage theory along with Alonso's bid rent theory to explain and predict abandonment patterns in response to ongoing urbanization. Our study is the first attempt in China to apply 30-m Landsat imageries to reconstruct abandonment patterns over long timeseries. The findings provide important insights into adjusting land-management practices for preventing farmland abandonment due to urbanization.

TI  - Block PS-InSAR ground deformation estimation for large-scale areas based on network adjustment
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) is a widely used technique for local ground deformation estimation due to its millimetric accuracy and full-resolution results. However, with the enhancement of data acquisition capability of the SAR sensors, larger coverage and higher temporal-spatial resolution of SAR images can cause explosive increase and uneven distribution of PS points. PS network constructed between PSs with different qualities may cause spatial-error propagation. Large PS points list with large amount of data also have high requirements on computing performance and storage space. Those problems can bring big challenge for PS-InSAR technique in processing capacity, deformation monitoring accuracy and algorithm efficiency. In order to effectively overcome those limitations, this paper proposed a novel block PS-InSAR method that uses the approach of partitioning a study area into regular blocks with overlapping regions, selecting a high-quality reference point for each block and eliminating the discontinuity of the parameter calculating results in adjacent blocks by the weighted least square method. We used this approach to analyze ground subsidence in over 13,000 km(2) of southern California, and it performed successfully when 69 Sentinel-1 images were used and 21,029,968 PSs were selected. Only approximately 10 h was needed for this experiment. Comparing the deformation rate and time series of the InSAR results with 29 GPS observations, the mean and standard deviation of difference of deformation rate were - 0.63 mm/yr and 1.53 mm/yr, respectively, and the average root mean squared error of deformation time series was 3.7 mm. The experiment demonstrated that this method could achieve high accuracy results without spatial discontinuity and increase the computational efficiency significantly.

Observations from coastal radars in northern Taiwan, along with several drifters and satellite data, reveal a detailed ECS surface flow structure and thermal front. Drifter trajectories followed the seasonal flow field and were oscillatory and trapped due to strong tidal currents. Three drifters crossed the oceanic front off the northern coast of Taiwan following the tidal motion with a rapid change in the sea surface temperature by 2.5 degrees C, which was recorded within a small distance of 500 m. A significant seasonal water mass exchange cycle occurred in the southern ECS. Starting in October, the Kuroshio Current intrudes onto the ECS shelf, causing the formation of a southwestward Northern Taiwan Coastal Current that mixes with the China Coastal Current to form a southward flow in the northern Taiwan Strait. Beginning in March, the ocean current off northwestern Taiwan shifts northward and then gradually flows eastward into the Kuroshio region. With satellite-derived and model-simulated surface currents contradicting each other over long periods of time, hourly coastal radar data have not only successfully explained the spatiotemporal variations in the sea surface temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll concentration observed by satellites but have also resolved the long-standing disputes over the surface currents in the southern ECS.

TI  - Comparing the Thermal Structures of Tropical Cyclones Derived From Suomi NPP ATMS and FY-3D Microwave Sounders
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the thermal structures of tropical cyclones (TCs) is essential for monitoring and forecasting their intensity and location. In this study, a scene-dependent 1-D variation (SD1DVAR) algorithm is developed to retrieve atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles under all-weather conditions. In SD1DVAR, the background and observation error matrix varies according to the scattering intensity. Especially, the observation error matrix increases in precipitating atmospheres due to a larger uncertainty in the forward operator. With the data from the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) onboard Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, SD1DVAR can retrieve better thermal structures in the storm life cycle than NOAA Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MIRS). Comparing with the aircraft dropsonde observations, the temperature and humidity errors from SD1DVAR are about 3 K and 20%, respectively, whereas those from MIRS are around 4 K-5 K and 30%, respectively. SD1DVAR is also applied for Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) onboard FengYun3D (FY-3D) satellite. The MWTS and MWHS data sets are first combined into a single Comprehensive MicroWave Suite (CMWS) data stream and then used to retrieve the hurricane thermal structures. It is shown that the hurricane structure from CMWS is very similar to that from ATMS. However, due to the availability of 118-GHz measurements from the CMWS, the hurricane temperature vertical structure is better resolved, and the humidity error is also reduced by about 5%.

TI  - Satellite Retrieval of Microwave Land Surface Emissivity under Clear and Cloudy Skies in China Using Observations from AMSR-E and MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave land surface emissivity (MLSE) is an important geophysical parameter to determine the microwave radiative transfer over land and has broad applications in satellite remote sensing of atmospheric parameters (e.g., precipitation, cloud properties), land surface parameters (e.g., soil moisture, vegetation properties), and the parameters of interactions between atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystem (e.g., evapotranspiration rate, gross primary production rate). In this study, MLSE in China under both clear and cloudy sky conditions was retrieved using satellite passive microwave measurements from Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), combined with visible/infrared observations from Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmosphere reanalysis dataset of ERA-20C. Attenuations from atmospheric oxygen and water vapor, as well as the emissions and scatterings from cloud particles are taken into account using a microwave radiation transfer model to do atmosphere corrections. All cloud parameters needed are derived from MODIS visible and infrared instantaneous measurements. Ancillary surface skin temperature as well as atmospheric temperature-humidity profiles are collected from ECMWF reanalysis data. Quality control and sensitivity analyses were conducted for the input variables of surface skin temperature, air temperature, and atmospheric humidity. The ground-based validations show acceptable biases of primary input parameters (skin temperature, 2 m air temperature, near surface relative humidity, rain flag) for retrieving using. The subsequent sensitivity tests suggest that 10 K bias of skin temperature or observed brightness temperature may result in a 4% (similar to 0.04) or 7% (0.07) retrieving error in MLSE at 23.5 GHz. A nonlinear sensitivity in the same magnitude is found for air temperature perturbation, while the sensitivity is less than 1% for 300 g/m(2) error in cloud water path. Results show that our algorithm can successfully retrieve MLSE over 90% of the satellite detected land surface area in a typical cloudy day (cloud fraction of 64%), which is considerably higher than that of the 29% area by the clear-sky only algorithms. The spatial distribution of MLSE in China is highly dependent on the land surface types and topography. The retrieved MLSE is assessed by compared with other existing clear-sky AMSR-E emissivity products and the vegetation optical depth (VOD) product. Overall, high consistencies are shown for the MLSE retrieved in this study with other AMSR-E emissivity products across China though noticeable discrepancies are observed in Tibetan Plateau and Qinling-Taihang Mountains due to different sources of input skin temperature. In addition, the retrieved MLSE exhibits strong positive correlations in spatial patterns with microwave vegetation optical depth reported in the literature.

TI  - Revisiting Daily MODIS Evapotranspiration Algorithm Using Flux Tower Measurements in China
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the major component of the hydrology cycle. Satellites provide a convenient way for gathering information to estimate regional ET. The most widely applied method for converting the instantaneous satellite measurement to daily scale assumes that evaporative fraction (EF), defined as the ratio of ET to the available energy, is constant during the daytime. However, this method was proved to underestimate the daily ET. This study implemented a theoretically improved EF algorithm to calculate daily ET with the decoupling factor method based on the Penman-Monteith and McNaughton-Jarvis equations. Seven improved algorithms were developed by assuming that various parameters remain constant during the day. The satellite-based ET estimates were compared with seven local flux tower measurements in China. The results showed that: (a) The original ET method calculated the daily evaporation more accurately than the other algorithms. However, the good fit was based on two compensating inaccuracies. Compared to the flux tower measurement, the original ET method underestimated the daily EF by 26% and overestimated the daily net radiation by 30%. (b) Six of the seven proposed algorithms underpredicted the daily ET by 30%-60%, mainly due to the inaccurate daily net radiation. (c) The algorithm that assumed that the instantaneous decoupling parameter Omega* was equal to its daily value method calculated EF and ET with relative errors of 8% and 10% separately when the inaccurate estimated daily net radiation was replaced by the observed flux tower data.

TI  - The nexus between growth strategies of master plans and spatial dynamics of a metropolitan city: The case of Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Master plans are prepared in many countries to manage and guide spatial growth of cities. Nevertheless, these are much criticised for being rigid in terms of growth strategies and implementation. In case of a metropolitan city, relationship between growth strategies of master plan and spatial dynamics is complex and hence it hampers implementation. This research aims to critically analyse the practices of spatial growth management in the capital city of Punjab, Pakistan. A hybrid approach of quantitative and qualitative methods is utilised in this research, wherein, GIS technique with Landsat imagery is used to determine the spatio-temporal dynamics of the city. Interviews with experts, who were either involved in preparation or implementation of spatial growth strategies of various development plans (DPs), are also conducted. This research presents historic evolution of spatial growth strategies of Lahore from 1966 to 2016, determines their extent of implementation and consequences in the light of views of the experts. Findings reveal that out of all the DPs prepared for Lahore, some of the growth strategies were based on ground realities but could not be fully implemented due to the administrative, fiscal and enforcement issues which led to inadvertent land use conversion and urban sprawl. All the DPs were also deficient in forming an effective evaluation mechanism. The basis of growth strategies and the implementation mechanism need to be revisited for making better growth strategies.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential habitat mapping of Meretrix lyrata which is found in large parts of South East Asian tidal flat was carried out to find out causes of collective death. Frequency Ratio (FR) method, one of geospatial statistical method, was employed with some benthic environmental factors; Digital elevation model (DEM) made from Landsat imagery, slope, tidal channel distance, tidal channel density, sedimentary faces from WorldView-02 image. Field survey was carried out to measure elevation of each station and to collect surface sediment and benthos samples. Potential habitat maps of the all clams and the juvenile clams were made and accuracy of each map showed a good performance, 76.82 % and 69.51 %. Both adult and juvenile clams prefer sand dominant tidal flat. But suitable elevation of adult clams is ranged from-0.2 to 0.2 m, and that of juvenile clams is ranged from 0 to 0.3 m. Tidal channel didn't affect the habitat of juvenile clams, but it affected the adult clams. In the further study, comparison with case of Korean tidal flat will be carried out to improve a performance of the potential habitat map. Change in the benthic echo-system caused by climate change will be predictable through potential habitat mapping of macro benthos.

TI  - Integration of satellite imagery and in situ soil moisture data for estimating irrigation water requirements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images provide a reliable approach to monitor crop physiological development and can be used to assess crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and irrigation water requirements (IWR). This study compared the suitability of multispectral images acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV-MSI), PlanetScope, and Sentinel-2A & 2B satellite platforms for estimating ETc. It integrated this ETc data with in situ soil moisture data to estimate IWR of field gown tomato crops (Lycopersicum esculentum) in southeastern Canada. The experimental field was divided into three (3) blocks, and irrigation scheduling consisted of 100, 80, and 60% of soil's field capacity, corresponding to three irrigation regimes. Plants were selected from each of the three blocks, through a systematic grid sampling approach. The sampled plants were georeferenced and identified in the images. Normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) obtained from the remote sensing platforms were evaluated for estimating the crop consumptive coefficient and ETc. The ETc predicted from satellite images were compared with estimates of ETc obtained from the FAO 56 Penman-Monteith module of the AquaCrop model. ETc maps from Sentinel-2 were combined with soil moisture data to predict IWR. The results indicate a significant difference in average NDVI values obtained from the UAV-MSI (0.87 +/- 0.03) and satellite platforms (0.71 +/- 0.03 and 0.82 +/- 0.05, for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2, respectively), which suggests that the UAV-MSI overestimated the field NDVI values. There was a good agreement between Kc and NDVI values extracted from satellite images, with R-2 = 0.98, p < 0.001, for Sentinel-2 and R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001, for PlanetScope. ETc values estimated from Sentinel-2 satellite platform were closely corroborated with AquaCrop model (with R-2 = 0.94; p < 0.01), which shows the suitability of Sentinel-2 imagery for assessing crop canopy cover and IWR at the field scale. The amount of irrigation water that the grower applied using micro-drip irrigation system (342 and 416 mm in 2017 and 2018 growing seasons, respectively) exceeded the estimated IWR (165 and 199 mm in 2017 and 2018 growing seasons, respectively), which suggests that the field was over-irrigated. This study has shown the practicality of integrating soil moisture measurements and remotely sensed crop parameters for mapping actual irrigation requirements. It indicates a significant progress towards the development of a near real-time approach for supporting precision irrigation.

TI  - Tree Species Mapping on Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery with Weakly Supervised Classification and Object-Wise Sampling
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on forest composition, specifically tree types and their distribution, aids in timber stock calculation and can help to better understand the biodiversity in a particular region. Automatic satellite imagery analysis can significantly accelerate the process of tree type classification, which is traditionally carried out by ground-based observation. Although computer vision methods have proven their efficiency in remote sensing tasks, specific challenges arise in forestry applications. The forest inventory data often contain the tree type composition but do not describe their spatial distribution within each individual stand. Therefore, some pixels can be assigned a wrong label in the semantic segmentation task if we consider each stand to be homogeneously populated by its dominant species. Another challenge is the spatial distribution of individual stands within the study area. Classes are usually imbalanced and distributed nonuniformly that makes sampling choice more critical. This study aims to enhance tree species classification based on a neural network approach providing automatic markup adjustment and improving sampling technique. For forest species markup adjustment, we propose using a weakly supervised learning approach based on the knowledge of dominant species content within each stand. We also propose substituting the commonly used CNN sampling approach with the object-wise one to reduce the effect of the spatial distribution of forest stands. We consider four species commonly found in Russian boreal forests: birch, aspen, pine, and spruce. We use imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite, which has multiple bands (in the visible and infrared spectra) and a spatial resolution of up to 10 meters. A data set of images for Leningrad Oblast of Russia is used to assess the methods. We demonstrate how to modify the training strategy to outperform a basic CNN approach from F1-score 0.68 to 0.76. This approach is promising for future studies to obtain more specific information about stands composition even using incomplete data.

TI  - The Influence of Preexisting Stratification and Tropical Rain Modes on the Mixed Layer Salinity Response to Rainfall
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The freshwater input from rain to the surface ocean is a key component of the global water cycle. Frequent rainfall in the inter-tropical convergence zone creates regions of strong surface stratification and low salinity, which vary seasonally. We evaluate how variations in rain type and preexisting upper ocean stratification influence the timing and duration of the salinity response to rainfall using the General Ocean Turbulence Model. A series of model simulations was run by prescribing three typical background stratification conditions and idealized rain and wind forcing that was consistent with observed convective, stratiform, and mixed convective and stratiform rainfall. Background stratification was assessed using underway CTD observations and rain forcing was identified from mooring observations collected in the eastern tropical Pacific during the second Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study. Model results show that strong stratification, whether preexisting or from convective rainfall, inhibits downward mixing of freshwater and allows near-surface salinity anomalies to persist following rain. In contrast, when stratiform rain precedes convective rain, salinity anomalies are quickly mixed downward and longer lasting deeper in the mixed layer. This implies that accurately quantifying the salinity structure following rain should consider preexisting stratification and the type of rainfall. Furthermore, patterns of rainfall and stratification likely affect the bias between salinity observations at the surface and deeper in the mixed layer. Because satellite rain data do not correctly represent the small scales of rain forcing, the small-scale surface salinity response to rain cannot be predicted from satellite data.

TI  - A Remote Sensing and Machine Learning-Based Approach to Forecast the Onset of Harmful Algal Bloom
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last few decades, harmful algal blooms (HABs, also known as "red tides ") have become one of the most detrimental natural phenomena in Florida's coastal areas. Karenia brevis produces toxins that have harmful effects on humans, fisheries, and ecosystems. In this study, we developed and compared the efficiency of state-of-the-art machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine) in predicting the occurrence of HABs. In the proposed models the K. brevis abundance is used as the target, and 10 level-02 ocean color products extracted from daily archival MODIS satellite data are used as controlling factors. The adopted approach addresses two main shortcomings of earlier models: (1) the paucity of satellite data due to cloudy scenes and (2) the lag time between the period at which a variable reaches its highest correlation with the target and the time the bloom occurs. Eleven spatio-temporal models were generated, each from 3 consecutive day satellite datasets, with a forecasting span from 1 to 11 days. The 3-day models addressed the potential variations in lag time for some of the temporal variables. One or more of the generated 11 models could be used to predict HAB occurrences depending on availability of the cloud-free consecutive days. Findings indicate that XGBoost outperformed the other methods, and the forecasting models of 5-9 days achieved the best results. The most reliable model can forecast eight days ahead of time with balanced overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, F-Score, and AUC of 96%, 0.93, 0.97, and 0.98 respectively. The euphotic depth, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll-a are always among the most significant controlling factors. The proposed models could potentially be used to develop an "early warning system " for HABs in southwest Florida.</p>

TI  - Global, regional, and national sex-specific burden and control of the HIV epidemic, 1990-2019, for 204 countries and territories: the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019
T2  - LANCET HIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The sustainable development goals (SDGs) aim to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Understanding the current state of the HIV epidemic and its change over time is essential to this effort. This study assesses the current sex-specific HIV burden in 204 countries and territories and measures progress in the control of the epidemic.Methods To estimate age-specific and sex-specific trends in 48 of 204 countries, we extended the Estimation and Projection Package Age-Sex Model to also implement the spectrum paediatric model. We used this model in cases where age and sex specific HIV-seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care-clinic sentinel surveillance data were available. For the remaining 156 of 204 locations, we developed a cohort-incidence bias adjustment to derive incidence as a function of cause-of-death data from vital registration systems. The incidence was input to a custom Spectrum model. To assess progress, we measured the percentage change in incident cases and deaths between 2010 and 2019 (threshold >75% decline), the ratio of incident cases to number of people living with HIV (incidence-to-prevalence ratio threshold <0.03), and the ratio of incident cases to deaths (incidence-to-mortality ratio threshold <1.0).Findings In 2019, there were 36.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 35.1-38.9) people living with HIV worldwide. There were 0.84 males (95% UI 0.78-0.91) per female living with HIV in 2019, 0.99 male infections (0.91-1.10) for every female infection, and 1.02 male deaths (0.95-1.10) per female death. Global progress in incident cases and deaths between 2010 and 2019 was driven by sub-Saharan Africa (with a 28.52% decrease in incident cases, 95% UI 19.58-35.43, and a 39.66% decrease in deaths, 36.49-42.36). Elsewhere, the incidence remained stable or increased, whereas deaths generally decreased. In 2019, the global incidence-to-prevalence ratio was 0.05 (95% UI 0.05-0.06) and the global incidence-to-mortality ratio was 1.94 (1.76-2.12). No regions met suggested thresholds for progress.Interpretation Sub-Saharan Africa had both the highest HIV burden and the greatest progress between 1990 and 2019. The number of incident cases and deaths in males and females approached parity in 2019, although there remained more females with HIV than males with HIV. Globally, the HIV epidemic is far from the UNAIDS benchmarks on progress metrics. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assessing the association between lifetime exposure to greenspace and early childhood development and the mediation effects of air pollution and noise in Canada: a population-based birth cohort study
T2  - LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Exposure to greenspace is associated with improved childhood development, but the pathways behind this relationship are insufficiently understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and early childhood development and evaluate the extent to which this association is mediated by reductions in traffic-related air pollution and noise.Methods This population-based birth cohort study comprised singleton births in Metro Vancouver, BC, Canada, between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2005. Children and mothers had to be registered with the mandatory provincial health insurance programme, Medical Services Plan, and have lived within the study area from the child's birth to the time of outcome assessment. Early childhood development was assessed via teacher ratings on the Early Development Instrument (EDI), and we used the total EDI score as the primary outcome variable. We estimated greenspace using percentage vegetation derived from spectral unmixing of annual Landsat satellite image composites. Lifetime residential exposure to greenspace was estimated as the mean of annual percentage vegetation values within 250 m of participants' residential postal codes. Multilevel modelling, adjusted for eight covariates, was used to investigate associations between greenspace exposure and EDI scores. We estimated the mediation effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and noise levels using causal mediation analyses.Findings Of the 37 745 children born in Metro Vancouver between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2005, 27 372 were included in our final study sample. In the adjusted model, 1 IQR increase in percentage vegetation was associated with a 0-16 (95% CI 0-04-0.28; p=0.0073) increase in total EDI score, indicating small improvements in early childhood development. We estimated that 97-1% (95% CI 43.0-396.0), 29.5% (12.0-117.0), and 35.2% (17.9-139.0) of the association was mediated through reductions in NO2, PM2.5, and noise, respectively.Interpretation Increased exposure to residential greenspace might improve childhood development by reducing the adverse developmental effects of traffic-related exposures, especially NO2 air pollution. Our study supports the implementation of healthy urban planning and green infrastructure interventions. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Comparison of Total Column and Surface Mixing Ratio of Carbon Monoxide Derived from the TROPOMI/Sentinel-5 Precursor with In-Situ Measurements from Extensive Ground-Based Network over South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) significantly impacts climate change and human health, and has become the focus of increased air quality and climate research. Since 2018, the Troposphere Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) has provided total column amounts of CO (C-TROPOMI) with a high spatial resolution to monitor atmospheric CO. This study compared and assessed the accuracy of C-TROPOMI measurements using surface in-situ measurements (S-KME) obtained from an extensive ground-based network over South Korea, where CO level is persistently affected by both local emissions and trans-boundary transport. Our analysis reveals that the TROPOMI effectively detected major emission sources of CO over South Korea and efficiently complemented the spatial coverage of the ground-based network. In general, the correlations between C-TROPOMI and S-KME were lower than those for NO2 reported in a previous study, and this discrepancy was partly attributed to the lower spatiotemporal variability. Moreover, vertical CO profiles were sampled from the ECMWF CAMS reanalysis data (EAC4) to convert C-TROPOMI to surface mixing ratios (S-TROPOMI). S-TROPOMI showed a significant underestimation compared with S-KME by approximately 40%, with a moderate correlation of approximately 0.51. The low biases of S-TROPOMI were more significant during the winter season, which was mainly attributed to the underestimation of the EAC4 CO at the surface. This study can contribute to the assessment of satellite and model data for monitoring surface air quality and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Delimitation of ecologically sensitive areas and accumulation effect of heavy metals in Baorixile large-sized open-pit mine.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Baorixile mine is a large.sized open.pit mine in eastern Inner Mongolia, with an annu. al coal output of 35 million tons. The long.term mining activities pose a risk to the accumulation of heavy metals in soils of the mining area. Landsat images were used to delimit the ecologically sensitive area of the mining area and to analyze the ecological quality of the mining area in differ. ent life stages. Soil samples were collected following the results from ecological quality assess. ment. The cumulative effects of soil heavy metals in the ecologically sensitive area of the mining area were quantitatively analyzed, and the ecological impact scope of Baorixile mine was delinea. ted. The 8 km extension of the mining area was the ecologically sensitive area of Baorixile mine. Ecological situation was better for start. up period (from 2001 to 2007), worse for mass produc. tion period (from 2007 to 2011), tended to improve for high.yield period (from 2011 to 2013), and showed a slight deterioration for stable production period (from 2013 to 2019). The concen. tration of soil organic matter in mining area was lower than the mean value of the Second National Soil Survey of China. The concentrations of Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, As, and Ni did not exceed the national environmental quality standards (GB 15618-2018). However, the concentrations of Cr, Cd, Zn, Cu, As, and Ni were higher than the corresponding background values. Cr and Zn showed a significant accumulation in soil. Overall, the concentrations of soil heavy metals were at low risk level, but there was a potential risk for Cd pollution. Results of soil ecological quality evaluation indicated that 0-2 km extension range in the southeast of mining area was significantly affected by mining activities, and the 2-5 km extension range was not affected by mining activi. ties. Our results are conducive to grasping the ecological conditions of the mining area and taking corresponding restoration measures timely. Our results provide practical reference and guidance for ecological restoration for coal mines with similar mining scale and conditions.

TI  - A Universal Fuzzy Logic Optical Water Type Scheme for the Global Oceans
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of natural waters is a way to generalize and systematize ocean color science. However, there is no consensus on an optimal water classification template in many contexts. In this study, we conducted an unsupervised classification of the PACE (Plankton, Aerosols, Cloud, and Ocean Ecosystem) synthetic hyperspectral data set, divided the global ocean waters into 15 classes, then obtained a set of fuzzy logic optical water type schemes (abbreviated as the U-OWT in this study) that were tailored for several multispectral satellite sensors, including SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS, OLI, VIIRS, MSI, and OLCI. The consistency analysis showed that the performance of U-OWT on different satellite sensors was comparable, and the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the U-OWT could resist a certain degree of input disturbance on remote sensing reflectance. Compared to existing ocean-aimed optical water type schemes, the U-OWT can distinguish more mesotrophic and eutrophic water classes. Furthermore, the U-OWT was highly compatible with other water classification taxonomies, including the trophic state index, the multivariate absorption combinations, and the Forel-Ule Scale, which indirectly demonstrated the potential for global applicability of the U-OWT. This finding was also helpful for the further conversion and unification of different water type taxonomies. As the fundamental basis, the U-OWT can be applied to many oceanic fields that need to be explored in the future. To promote the reproducibility of this study, an IDL(R)-based standalone U-OWT calculation tool is freely distributed.

TI  - A Long-Term Ecological Vulnerability Analysis of the Tibetan Region of Natural Conditions and Ecological Protection Programs
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The combined impacts of drastic natural environment change and increasing human interference are making the uncertainty of the Tibetan Plateau's ecological vulnerability the world's largest. In this study, an ecological vulnerability index (EVI) of Tibet in the core area of the Tibetan Plateau was assessed using a selected set of ecological, social, and economic indicators and using a spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) to calculate their weights. The data included Landsat images and socio-economic data from 1990 to 2015 in five-year intervals. The results showed that the total EVI remained at a high vulnerability level, with drastic fluctuation from 1990 to 2000 (a peak in 1995, when there was a sudden increase in light vulnerability, which moved to extreme vulnerability in the next period), and minor fluctuations after 2000, gradually increasing from southeast to northwest. In addition, the spatial analysis showed a distinct positive correlation between the EVI and grassland area (0.33), land use degree (0.15), NDVI (0.14), livestock husbandry output, and a negative correlation in terms of desertification area. The artificial afforestation program (AAP) had a positive significant correlation with NDVI (R-2 = 0.88), preventing the environment from becoming more vulnerable. The results provide practical information and suggestions for planners to improve the land use degree in urban areas and the vegetation coverage in pastoral regions of the Tibetan Plateau based on the spatial-temporal heterogeneity patterns of the EVI of Tibet.

TI  - Adapting the Dark Target Algorithm to Advanced MERSI Sensor on the FengYun-3-D Satellite: Retrieval and Validation of Aerosol Optical Depth Over Land
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observation is an effective way of obtaining global aerosol information. The study focuses on developing a new scheme to apply the traditional dark target (DT) method to the advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI II), which is a part of the Chinese Fengyun-3-D satellite. Compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), MERSI II shows higher ratios between red (0.65 mu m) and near-infrared (2.13 mu m) bands in surface reflectance estimation and the green band (0.55 mu m) that is more sensitive to cloud screening. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is retrieved from earlier MERSI II observations by following the adapted DT method over land in Asia in 2018. Overall, AOD from MERSI II has a good performance compared with ground-based measurements with an expected error (EE%) of 66.38% and R-2 of 0.834, which is close to the MODIS EE% of 70.59% and R-2 of 0.829. Both sensors slightly overestimate the AOD over heavy aerosol loading regions, but MERSI-II has larger retrieval area covering a wider swath than MODIS in heavy hazy areas. On a spatial scale, the MERSI H effectively reflects the AOD distribution pattern but tends to overestimate and underestimate AOD at low and high latitudes, respectively, when compared with MODIS. The MERSI II sensor shows good aerosol detection potential, and the DT algorithm can be applied. MERSI II will provide important observation data on climate change and atmospheric pollution for the investigations in the future.

TI  - Quantifying the impact of landscape changes on hydrological variables in the alpine and cold region using hydrological model and remote sensing data
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the impact of landscape on hydrological variables is essential for the sustainable development of water resources. Understanding how landscape changes influence hydrological variables will greatly enhance the understanding of hydrological processes. Important vegetation parameters are considered in this study by using remote sensing data and VIC-CAS model to analyse the impact of landscape changes on hydrology in upper reaches of the Shule River Basin (URSLB). The results show there are differences in the runoff generation of landscape both in space and time. With increasing altitude, the runoff yields increased, with approximately 79.9% of the total runoff generated in the high mountains (4200-5900 m), and mainly consumed in the mid-low mountain region. Glacier landscape produced the largest runoff yields (24.9% of the total runoff), followed by low-coverage grassland (LG; 22.5%), alpine cold desert (AL; 19.6%), mid-coverage grassland (MG; 15.6%), bare land (12.5%), high-coverage grassland (HG; 4.5%) and shrubbery (0.4%). The relative capacity of runoff generation by landscapes, from high to low, was the glaciers, AL, LG, HG, MG, shrubbery and bare land. Furthermore, changes in landscapes cause hydrological variables changes, including evapotranspiration, runoff and baseflow. The study revealed that HG, MG, and bare land have a positive impact on evapotranspiration and a negative impact on runoff and baseflow, whereas AL and LG have a positive impact on runoff and baseflow and a negative impact on evapotranspiration. In contrast, glaciers have a positive impact on runoff. After the simulation in four vegetation scenarios, we concluded that the runoff regulation ability of grassland is greater than that of bare land. The grassland landscape is essential since it reduced the flood peak and conserved the soil and water.

TI  - Estimation of High-resolution Sea Wind in Coastal Areas Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images with Artificial Intelligence Technique
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea wind is recently drawing attraction as one of the sources of renewable energy. This study describes a new method to produce a 10 m resolution sea wind field using Sentinel-1 images and low-resolution NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction) data with artificial intelligence technique. The experiment for the South East coast in Korea, 2015-2020, showed a 40% decreased MAE (Mean Absolute Error) than the generic CMOD (C-band Model) function, and the CC (correlation coefficient) of our method was 0.901 and 0.826, respectively, for the 11 and V wind components. We created 10m resolution sea wind maps for the study area, which showed a typical trend of wind distribution and a spatially detailed wind pattern as well. The proposed method can be applied to surveying for wind power and information service for coastal disaster prevention and leisure activities.

TI  - Evaluation of methods for connecting InSAR to a terrestrial reference frame in the Latrobe Valley, Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deformation measurements from satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) are usually measured relative to an arbitrary reference point (RP) of assumed stability over time. For InSAR rates to be reliably interpreted as uplift or subsidence, they must be connected to a defined Earth-centred terrestrial reference frame (TRF), usually made through GNSS continuously operating reference stations (CORS). We adapt and compare three methods of TRF connection proposed by different studies which we term the single CORS RP (SCRP), plane-fit multiple CORS (PFMC), and the multiple CORS RP (MCRP). We generalise equations for these methods, and importantly, develop equations to propagate InSAR and GNSS uncertainties through the transformation process. This is significant, because it is important to not only estimate the InSAR uncertainties, but also to account for the uncertainties that are introduced when connecting to the CORS so as to better inform our interpretation of the deformation field and the limitation of the measurements. We then test these methods using Sentinel-1 data in the Latrobe Valley, Australia. These results indicate that differences among the three TRF connection methods may be greater than their estimated uncertainties. MCRP appears the most reliable method, although it may be limited in large study areas with sparse CORS due to long wavelength InSAR errors and that gaps and/or steps may appear at the spatial limit from the CORS. SCRP relies on the quality of the single CORS connection, but can be validated by unconnected CORS in the study area. The PFMC method is suited to larger areas undergoing slow, constant deformation covering large spatial extents where there are evenly distributed CORS across the study area. Selecting an optimal method of TRF connection is dependent on local site conditions, CORS network geometry and the characteristics of the deformation field. Hence, the choice of TRF connection method should be carefully considered, because different methods may result in significantly different transformed deformation rates. We confirm slow subsidence across the Latrobe Valley relative to the vertical component of the ITRF2014, with localised high subsidence rates near open cut mining activities. Subsidence of similar to -6 mm/year is observed in the adjacent coastal region which may exacerbate relative sea level rise along the coastline, increasing future risks of coastal inundation.

TI  - Zoonoses and global epidemics
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review The purpose of the review is to summarize recent advances in understanding the origins, drivers and clinical context of zoonotic disease epidemics and pandemics. In addition, we aimed to highlight the role of clinicians in identifying sentinel cases of zoonotic disease outbreaks. Recent findings The majority of emerging infectious disease events over recent decades, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have been caused by zoonotic viruses and bacteria. In particular, coronaviruses, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses and influenza A viruses have caused significant epidemics globally. There have been recent advances in understanding the origins and drivers of zoonotic epidemics, yet there are gaps in diagnostic capacity and clinical training about zoonoses. Identifying the origins of zoonotic pathogens, understanding factors influencing disease transmission and improving the diagnostic capacity of clinicians will be crucial to early detection and prevention of further epidemics of zoonoses.

TI  - Suitability of Earth Engine Evaporation Flux (EEFlux) Estimation of Evapotranspiration in Rainfed Crops
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated evapotranspiration (ET) estimated using the Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux), an automated version of the widely used Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Spatial Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model, via comparison with ET measured using eddy covariance flux towers at two U.S. sites (St. John, WA, USA and Genesee, ID, USA) and for two years (2018 and 2019). Crops included spring wheat, winter pea, and winter wheat, all grown under rainfed conditions. The performance indices for daily EEFlux ET estimations combined for all sites and years dramatically improved when the cold pixel alfalfa reference ET fraction (ETrF) in METRIC was reduced from 1.05 (typically used for irrigated crops) to 0.85, with further improvement when the periods of early growth and canopy senescence were excluded. Large EEFlux ET overestimation during crop senescence was consistent in all sites and years. The seasonal absolute departure error was 51% (cold pixel ETrF = 1.05) and 23% (cold pixel ETrF = 0.85), the latter reduced to 12% when the early growth and canopy senescence periods were excluded. Departures of 10% are a reasonable expectation for methods of ET estimation, which EEFlux could achieve with more frequent satellite images, better daily weather data sources, automated adjustment of daily ETrF values during crop senescence, and a better understanding of the selection of adequate cold pixel ETrF values for rainfed crops.

TI  - A Shift to Human Body Temperature (37°C) Rapidly Reprograms Multiple Adaptive Responses in <i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i> That Would Facilitate Niche Survival and Colonization
T2  - JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the first environmental cues sensed by a microbe as it enters a human host is an upshift in temperature to 37 degrees C. In this dynamic time point analysis, we demonstrate that this environmental transition rapidly signals a multitude of gene expression changes in Escherichia coli. Bacteria grown at 23 degrees C under aerobic conditions were shifted to 37 degrees C, and mRNA expression was measured at time points after the shift to 37 degrees C (t = 0.5, 1, and 4 h). The first hour is characterized by a transient shift to anaerobic respiration strategies and stress responses, particularly acid resistance, indicating that temperature serves as a sentinel cue to predict and prepare for various niches within the host. The temperature effects on a subset of stress response genes were shown to be mediated by RpoS and directly correlated with RpoS, DsrA, and RprA levels, and increased acid resistance was observed that was dependent on 23 degrees C growth and RpoS. By 4 h, gene expression shifted to aerobic respiration pathways and decreased stress responses, coupled with increases in genes associated with biosynthesis (amino acid and nucleotides), iron uptake, and host defense. ompT, a gene that confers resistance to antimicrobial peptides, was highly thermoregulated, with a pattern conserved in enteropathogenic and uropathogenic E. coli strains. An immediate decrease in curli gene expression concomitant with an increase in flagellar gene expression implicates temperature in this developmental decision. Together, our studies demonstrate that temperature signals a reprogramming of gene expression immediately upon an upshift that may predict, prepare, and benefit the survival of the bacterium within the host.IMPORTANCE As one of the first cues sensed by the microbe upon entry into a human host, understanding how bacteria like E. coli modulate gene expression in response to temperature improves our understanding of how bacteria immediately initiate responses beneficial for survival and colonization. For pathogens, understanding the various pathways of thermal regulation could yield valuable targets for antiinfective chemotherapeutic drugs or disinfection measures. In addition, our data provide a dynamic examination of the RpoS stress response, providing genome-wide support for how temperature impacts RpoS through changes in RpoS stability and modulation by small regulatory RNAs.

AB  - With a trend of the utilization of computer vision for satellite images, cloud detection using deep learning also attracts attention recently. In this study, we conducted a U-Net cloud detection modeling using SPARCS (Spatial Procedures for Automated Removal of Cloud and Shadow) Cloud Dataset with the image data augmentation and carried out 10-fold cross-validation for an objective assessment of the model. As the result of the blind test for 1800 datasets with 512 by 512 pixels, relatively high performance with the accuracy of 0.821, the precision of 0.847, the recall of 0.821, the F1-score of 0.831, and the IoU (Intersection over Union) of 0.723. Although 14.5% of actual cloud shadows were misclassified as land, and 19.7% of actual clouds were misidentified as land, this can be overcome by increasing the quality and quantity of label datasets. Moreover, a state-of-the-art DeepLab V3+ model and the NAS (Neural Architecture Search) optimization technique can help the cloud detection for CAS500 (Compact Advanced Satellite 500) in South Korea.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis for CAS500-4 Atmospheric Correction Using Simulated Images and Suggestion of the Use of Geostationary Satellite-based Atmospheric Parameters
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the next-generation Compact Advanced Satellite 500 (CAS500) project, CAS5004 is scheduled to be launched in 2025 focusing on the remote sensing of agriculture and forestry. To obtain quantitative information on vegetation from satellite images, it is necessary to acquire surface reflectance through atmospheric correction. Thus, it is essential to develop an atmospheric correction method suitable for CAS500-4. Since the absorption and scattering characteristics in the atmosphere vary depending on the wavelength, it is needed to analyze the sensitivity of atmospheric correction parameters such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and water vapor (WV) considering the wavelengths of CAS500-4. In addition, as CAS500-4 has only five channels (blue, green, red, red edge, and nearinfrared), making it difficult to directly calculate key parameters for atmospheric correction, external parameter data should be used. Therefore, this study performed a sensitivity analysis of the key parameters (AOD, WV, and O3) using the simulated images based on Sentinel-2 satellite data, which has similar wavelength specifications to CAS500-4, and examined the possibility of using the products of GEOKOMPSAT-2A (GK2A) as atmospheric parameters. The sensitivity analysis showed that AOD was the most important parameter with greater sensitivity in visible channels than in the near-infrared region. In particular, since AOD change of 20% causes about a 100% error rate in the blue channel surface reflectance in forests, a highly reliable AOD is needed to obtain accurate surface reflectance. The atmospherically corrected surface reflectance based on the GK2A AOD and WV was compared with the Sentinel-2 L2A reflectance data through the separability index of the known land cover pixels. The result showed that two corrected surface reflectance had similar Seperability index (SI) values, the atmospheric corrected surface reflectance based on the GK2A AOD showed higher SI than the Sentinel 2 L2A reflectance data in short-wavelength channels. Thus, it is judged that the parameters provided by GK2A can be fully utilized for atmospheric correction of the CAS500-4. The research findings will provide a basis for atmospheric correction of the CAS500-4 in the future.

TI  - Spectral indexation of pixels of MODIS sea surface images for detecting inconstancy of phytopigment composition in water
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the first results of a new way of using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor data to visualize phytopigment inconstancy in the near-surface layer of water basins. Other sensors of this class alike, the MODIS spectral resolution is too low to reproduce the minimums of reflectance R-rs caused by phytopigments in water. However, MODIS is remarkable for the presence of a channel at 469 nm combined with channels at 412, 443, 488, 531, 547, and 555 nm. This makes it possible to distinguish the spectral limits of preferential light absorption by chlorophyll a (412-469 nm) and by accessory pigments (469-555 nm). These capabilities were realized thanks to spectral pixel indexation (SPI) of MODIS images of the sea surface. The SPI boils down to the fact that a user determines the presence of pigment minima in spectra of every image pixel, finds the sum of the wavelengths of these minima as a WRM code and assigns it to the image pixel as one of its attributes. WRM code = 100 is assigned to pixels free of the minima. Such indexation makes it possible to examine the inconstancy of phytopigments on the background of aquatic environment variability. Application of SPI approach to MODIS images of the Gulf of Mexico and the Baltic Sea made it possible to reveal new patterns of phytopigment dynamics during HABs events.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The subsidence in coal mines induced by surface and subsurface fires leading to roof collapse, infrastructure loss, and loss of lives is a prominent concern. In the study, satellite imagery from thermal and microwave remote sensing data is used to deduce the effect of coal fires on subsidence in the Jharia Coalfields, India. The Thermal Infrared data acquired from the Landsat-8 (band 10) is used to derive the temperature anomaly maps. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry analysis was performed on sixty Sentinel-1, C-band images, the results are corrected for atmospheric error using Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) atmospheric modelling data and decomposed into vertical displacement values to quantify subsidence. A zone-wise analysis of the hazard patterns in the coalfields was carried out. Coal fire maps, subsidence velocity maps, and land cover maps were integrated to investigate the impact of the hazards on the mines and their surroundings. Maximum subsidence of approximately 20 cm/yr. and temperature anomaly of up to 25 degrees C has been observed. The findings exhibit a strong positive correlation between the subsidence velocity and temperature anomaly in the study area. Kusunda, Keshalpur, and Bararee collieries are identified as the most critically affected zones. The subsidence phenomenon in some collieries is extending towards the settlements and transportation networks and needs urgent intervention.

TI  - Surface Urban Heat Island Assessment of a Cold Desert City: A Case Study over the Isfahan Metropolitan Area of Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the diurnal, seasonal, monthly and temporal variation of land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) over the Isfahan metropolitan area, Iran, during 2003-2019 using MODIS data. It also examines the driving factors of SUHII like cropland, built-up areas (BI), the urban-rural difference in enhanced vegetation index (Delta EVI), evapotranspiration (Delta ET), and white sky albedo (Delta WSA). The results reveal the presence of urban cool islands during the daytime and urban heat islands at night. The maximum SUHII was observed at 22:30 p.m., while the minimum was at 10:30 a.m. The summer months (June to September) show higher SUHII compared to the winter months (February to May). The daytime SUHII demonstrates a robust positive correlation with cropland and Delta WSA, and a negative correlation with Delta ET, Delta EVI, and BI. The nighttime SUHII displays a negative correlation with Delta ET and Delta EVI.

TI  - Shoreline spatial and temporal response to natural and human effects in Boujagh National Park, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline variation and river deltas are among the most dynamic systems in marine environments. The related different variations in spatial and temporal scales play significant roles in land planning and different management applications. Modeling the dynamics of seashore of Boujagh National Park (BNP) which is located on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea in the Sefidrud Delta (SD), considering natural and anthropogenic factors, was the main objective of the current study. To achieve this goal, a combination of remote sensing data, historical data, and numerical simulations was utilized. The BNP covers an area of 3,270 ha and includes two international wetlands, Boujagh and Kiashahr. In earlier periods, this area faced severe morphological changes whereas recently its shoreline has experienced gradual variations. Accordingly, at the first stage, the shoreline variation from 2006 to 2017 was extracted by processing and classifying Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thematic Mapper (TM) images from Landsat satellites using the Maximum Likelihood approach. In the second stage, the two dimensional MIKE21 model was utilized to identify wave and coastal current patterns and parameters for the year 2015. Morphologically, the results showed that, the shoreline of the BNP is affected by several natural and anthropogenic factors. Seaward advancement of the shoreline occurred in zones A (east zone) and C (west zone) due to Caspian Sea Level drop and sedimentation while retreating occurred at Zone B (north zone) influenced by wave and current patterns and reduction of the Sefidrud River flows. Also, the results imply that maintaining the existing conditions results in the disappearance of a considerable part of the ecological area in the BNP. Hence, to manage and preserve the coastline of the BNP complying with the current anthropogenic and natural factors, it is vital to take necessary management measures.

TI  - Statistical Analysis of Ring Ionospheric Trough Characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the statistical characteristics of the ring ionospheric trough (RIT) are determined. The RIT is formed by the decay processes of the magnetospheric ring current; therefore, it is most clearly distinguished from the main ionospheric trough (MIT) during the recovery phase of a geomagnetic storm. The dynamics of both the troughs is considered in the case of geomagnetic disturbances with Kp indices from 4 to 9 during 2000-2003. In total, 830 RIT occurrences were identified in the CHAMP satellite data. The RIT is most often formed in the post-midnight period, less often in the evening, and never in the daytime between 10 and 14 LT. In the post-midnight period, the RIT is observed in the belt of 39 degrees-62 degrees geomagnetic latitude (in both hemispheres), with an occurrence maximum at 55 degrees (L-shell, L = 3). This finding is in good agreement with the observations of stable auroral red (SAR) arcs and a residual magnetospheric ring current. When a storm exhibits a long recovery phase, during which the geomagnetic activity periodically resumes, the RIT can exist for more than two days. The RIT is most often formed at the longitudes of South America, where the geomagnetic field is the weakest. In contrast to the MIT position, the averaged RIT position is not so strongly dependent on the longitude and Kp index. At low Kp values, the plasmapause position is close to the MIT position, while at high Kp values, the plasmapause approaches the RIT position.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of snow ablation on selected glaciers in central Spitsbergen derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of seasonal snow ablation on six glaciers in central Spitsbergen (Dicksonland) were assessed by examining a set of Sentinel-2 satellite images covering the summer ablation season for the period 2016-19. All glaciers lost 80% or more of their surface snow cover during the studied ablation seasons. This bolsters the recently observed trend of local glacier thinning, even at higher altitudes. Snow ablation dynamics are highly dependent on the glaciers altitudes, their position relative to the prevailing wind direction and the exposure to insolation. The accumulation areas of the studied glaciers were delimited based on the overlap of the minimum extent of snow-covered areas in the four consecutive studied summer seasons. The high temporal and spatial resolutions of available images enabled a detailed description of the seasonal snow ablation dynamics. Moreover, an estimate of the average number of days with below threshold glacier snow cover was made. This study contributes to our understanding of recent processes and might further support the modelling of glacier melt and subsequent runoff.

TI  - Significant Contribution of C<sub>3</sub> - Type Forest Plants' Burning to Airborne PM<sub>2.5</sub> Pollutions in Chiang Mai Province, Northern Thailand
T2  - Chiang Mai University Journal of Natural Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to identify the contributing sources of PM2.5 in Chiang Mai Province during February to April 2016. We therefore investigated the chemical compositions of PM2.5 at two different sites. An urban site is in Chiang Mai University (CMU) while a rural site is in Mae Chaem (MC) District where frequent intensive biomass burning was reported. Thirty pair samples of 24-h PM2.5 were analyzed for organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), levoglucosan and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13). The mean concentrations (Mean +/- SD) of PM2.5, OC and EC at the CMU vs MC sites were not significant different (P >0.05) including 44.5 +/- 32.1 vs 40.5 +/- 21.2 mu g/m(3); 14.9 +/- 12.5 vs 14.8 +/- 10.0 mu g/m(3); and 1.80 +/- 1.60 vs 1.62 +/- 0.80 mu g/m(3), respectively. Levoglucosan concentrations, a tracer of biomass burning from both sites were not significant different ( P >0.05) and the mean +/- SD concentrations at CMU vs MC sites were 0.46 +/- 0.56 mu g/m(3) vs 0.55 +/- 0.67 mu g/m(3), respectively. Meanwhile, the mean values of delta C-13 in total carbon (TC) at CMU vs MC sites were -27.9 +/- 0.68 vs -27.6 +/- 0.60 parts per thousand, respectively which major data (n = 48, 85.4%) fell within the ranged of C-3-type plants and minor data (n = 48, 14.6%) in C-3-type plants and motor vehicle sources. This finding corresponds to the vast biomass burning area from satellite data. Forest plants in northern Thailand, Chiang Mai particular are mostly mixed deciduous forest i.e. C-3-type plants which falling leaves in dry season and easily causing fire. The results of this study therefore strongly suggest that the burning of C-3-type forest plants attribute to airborne PM2.5 pollutants in Chiang Mai Province.

TI  - Comparison on Land-Use/Land-Cover Indices in Explaining Land Surface Temperature Variations in the City of Beijing, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban thermal environment is closely related to landscape patterns and land surface characteristics. Several studies have investigated the relationship between land surface characteristics and land surface temperature (LST). To explore the effects of the urban landscape on urban thermal environments, multiple land-use/land-cover (LULC) remote sensing-based indices have emerged. However, the function of the indices in better explaining LST in the heterogeneous urban landscape has not been fully addressed. This study aims to investigate the effect of remote-sensing-based LULC indices on LST, and to quantify the impact magnitude of green spaces on LST in the city built-up blocks. We used a random forest classifier algorithm to map LULC from the Gaofen 2 (GF-2) satellite and retrieved LST from Landsat-8 ETM data through the split-window algorithm. The pixel values of the LULC types and indices were extracted using the line transect approach. The multicollinearity effect was excluded before regression analysis. The vegetation index was found to have a strong negative relationship with LST, but a positive relationship with built-up indices was found in univariate analysis. The preferred indices, such as normalized difference impervious index (NDISI), dry built-up index (DBI), and bare soil index (BSI), predicted the LST (R-2 = 0.41) in the multivariate analysis. The stepwise regression analysis adequately explained the LST (R-2 = 0.44) due to the combined effect of the indices. The study results indicated that the LULC indices can be used to explain the LST of LULC types and provides useful information for urban managers and planners for the design of smart green cities.</p>

TI  - Vegetation Growth Analysis of UNESCO World Heritage Hyrcanian Forests Using Multi-Sensor Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freely available satellite data at Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform enables vegetation phenology analysis across different scales very efficiently. We evaluated seasonal and annual phenology of the old-growth Hyrcanian forests (HF) of northern Iran covering an area of ca. 1.9 million ha, and also focused on 15 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. We extracted bi-weekly MODIS-NDVI between 2017 and 2020 in GEE, which was used to identify the range of NDVI between two temporal stages. Then, changes in phenology and growth were analyzed by Sentinel 2-derived Temporal Normalized Phenology Index. We modelled between seasonal phenology and growth by additionally considering elevation, surface temperature, and monthly precipitation. Results indicated considerable difference in onset of forests along the longitudinal gradient of the HF. Faster growth was observed in low- and uplands of the western zone, whereas it was lower in both the mid-elevations and the western outskirts. Longitudinal range was a major driver of vegetation growth, to which environmental factors also differently but significantly contributed (p < 0.0001) along the west-east gradient. Our study developed at GEE provides a benchmark to examine the effects of environmental parameters on the vegetation growth of HF, which cover mountainous areas with partly no or limited accessibility.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on tackling the challenge of building mapping in multi-modal remote sensing data by proposing a novel, deep superpixel-wise convolutional neural network called DeepQuantized-Net, plus a new red, green, blue (RGB)-depth data set named IND. DeepQuantized-Net incorporated two practical ideas in segmentation: first, improving the object pattern with the exploitation of superpixels instead of pixels, as the imaging unit in DeepQuantized-Net. Second, the reduction of computational cost. The generated data set includes 294 RGB-depth images (256 training images and 38 test images) from different locations in the state of Indiana in the U.S., with 1024 x 1024 pixels and a spatial resolution of 0.5 ft that covers different cities. The experimental results using the IND data set demonstrates the mean F1 scores and the average Intersection over Union scores could increase by approximately 7.0% and 7.2% compared to other methods, respectively.

TI  - The Global Satellite Precipitation Constellation: Current Status and Future Requirements
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - To address the need to map precipitation on a global scale, a collection of satellites carrying passive microwave (PMW) radiometers has grown over the last 20 years to form a constellation of about 10-12 sensors at any one time. Over the same period, a broad range of science and user communities has become increasingly dependent on the precipitation products provided by these sensors. The constellation presently consists of both conical and cross-track-scanning precipitation-capable multichannel instruments, many of which are beyond their operational and design lifetime but continue to operate through the cooperation of the responsible agencies. The Group on Earth Observations and the Coordinating Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS), among other groups, have raised the issue of how a robust, future precipitation constellation should be constructed. The key issues of current and future requirements for the mapping of global precipitation from satellite sensors can be summarized as providing 1) sufficiently fine spatial resolutions to capture precipitation-scale systems and reduce the beam-filling effects of the observations; 2) a wide channel diversity for each sensor to cover the range of precipitation types, characteristics, and intensities observed across the globe; 3) an observation interval that provides temporal sampling commensurate with the variability of precipitation; and 4) precipitation radars and radiometers in low-inclination orbit to provide a consistent calibration source, as demonstrated by the first two spaceborne radar-radiometer combinations on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Core Observatory. These issues are critical in determining the direction of future constellation requirements while preserving the continuity of the existing constellation necessary for long-term climate-scale studies.

AB  - In this essay, I analyse and reconstruct Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's cosmic vision based upon his evolutionary worldview. This allows us to reveal his distinctive contributions to the contemporary Theology-Science dialogue. I highlight his creative synthesis of scientific and theological visions of the Universe, his dynamic metaphysics of cosmogenesis, his strong commitment to the Christological and eschatological orientations of the Christian faith, and his fresh reinterpretations of traditional doctrines. Despite these and other significant insights, Teilhard is often accused of the pantheistic, deterministic, and triumphalist tendencies underlying his thoughts. In the final analysis, I correct these and other misunderstandings of Teilhard's vision, and update his insights for today's Science-Theology dialogue.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the early satellite mission marine fog detection results from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager-II (GOCI-II). We investigate optical characteristics of the GOCI-II spectral bands for marine fog between October 2020 and March 2021 during the overlapping mission period of Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and GOCI-II. For Rayleigh-corrected reflection (Rrc) at 412 nm band available for the input of the GOCI-II marine fog algorithm, the inter-comparison between GOCI and GOCI-II data showed a small Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value (0.01) with a high correlation coefficient (0.988). Another input variable, Normalized Localization Standard (NLSD), also shows a reasonable correlation (0.798) between the GOCI and GOCI-II data with a small RMSE value (0.007). We also found distinctive optical characteristics between marine fog and clouds by the GOCI-II observations, showing the narrower distribution of all bands' Rrc values centered at high values for cloud compared to marine fog. The GOCI-II marine fog detection distribution for actual cases is similar to the GOCI but more detailed due to the improved spatial resolution from 500 m to 250 m. The validation with the automated synoptic observing system (ASOS) visibility data confirms the initial reliability of the GOCI-II marine fog detection. Also, it is expected to improve the performance of the GOCI-II marine fog detection algorithm by adding sufficient samples to verify stable performance, improving the post-processing process by replacing real-time available cloud input data and reducing false alarm by adding aerosol information.

However, there are insufficient research results which is monitoring the vegetation recovery using remote sensing data. This study is directed to monitoring post-wildfire vegetation restoration. It proposes a method for monitoring vegetation restoration using Sentinel-2 satellite data by compositing Tasseled Cap linear regression trend in a post wildfire study sites. Although it is a simple visualization technique using satellite images, it was able to confirm the possibility of effective monitoring.

TI  - Feasibility Study on FSIM Index to Evaluate SAR Image Co-registration Accuracy
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, as the number of high-resolution satellite SAR images increases, the demand for precise matching of SAR images in change detection and image fusion is consistently increasing. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values using GCPs (Ground Control Points) selected by analysts have been widely used for quantitative evaluation of image registration results, while it is difficult to find an approach for automatically measuring the registration accuracy. In this study, a feasibility analysis was conducted on using the FSIM (Feature Similarity) index as a measure to evaluate the registration accuracy. TerraSAR-X (TSX) stating spotlight data collected from various incidence angles and orbit directions were used for the analysis. FSIM was almost independent on the spatial resolution of the SAR image. Using a single SAR image, the FSIM with respect to registration errors was analyzed, then use it to compare with the value estimated from TSX data with different imaging geometry. FSIM index slightly decreased due to the differences in imaging geometry such as different look angles, different orbit tracks. As the result of analyzing the FSIM value by land cover type, the change in the FSIM index according to the co-registration error was most evident in the urban area. Therefore, the FSIM index calculated in the urban was most suitable for determining the accuracy of image registration. It is likely that the FSIM index has sufficient potential to be used as an index for the co-registration accuracy of SAR image.

TI  - Development of Cloud and Shadow Detection Algorithm for Periodic Composite of Sentinel-2A/B Satellite Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the utilization of optical satellite imagery, which is greatly affected by clouds, periodic composite technique is a useful method to minimize the influence of clouds. Recently, a technique for selecting the optimal pixel that is least affected by the cloud and shadow during a certain period by directly inputting cloud and cloud shadow information during period compositing has been proposed. Accurate extraction of clouds and cloud shadows is essential in order to derive optimal composite results. Also, in the case of an surface targets where spectral information is important, such as crops, the loss of spectral information should be minimized during cloud-free compositing. In this study, clouds using two spectral indicators (Haze Optimized Tranformation and MeanVis) were used to derive a detection technique with low loss of spectral information while maintaining high detection accuracy of clouds and cloud shadows for cabbage fields in the highlands of Gangwon-do. These detection results were compared and analyzed with cloud and cloud shadow information provided by Sentinel-2A/B. As a result of analyzing data from 2019 to 2021, cloud information from Sentinel-2A/B satellites showed detection accuracy with an F1 value of 0.91, but bright artifacts were falsely detected as clouds. On the other hand, the cloud detection result obtained by applying the threshold (=0.05) to the HOT showed relatively low detection accuracy (F1=0.72), but the loss of spectral information was minimized due to the small number of false positives. In the case of cloud shadows, only minimal shadows were detected in the Sentinel2A/B additional layer, but when a threshold (= 0.015) was applied to MeanVis, cloud shadows that could be distinguished from the topographically generated shadows could be detected. By inputting spectral indicators-based cloud and shadow information, stable monthly cloud-free composited vegetation index results were obtained, and in the future, high-accuracy cloud information of Sentinel-2A/B will be input to periodic cloud-free composite for comparison.

TI  - Detection of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Activities and Their Transformation Using Earth Observation, Nighttime Light, and Precipitation Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of artificially constructed mining camps has negatively impacted the camps' surrounding environment and the informal communities that have developed inside the camps. However, artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is generally informal, illegal, and unregulated; thus, transformations of the mining activities and potential social-environmental problems resulting from these changes are not revealed. This study assesses the transformation of mining activities in camp-type ASGM sectors in Gorontalo, Indonesia, during 2014-2020 using remotely sensed data, such as Landsat series, nighttime light, and precipitation data obtained through Google Earth Engine. Results show that the combined growth of the built-up areas increased 4.8-fold, and their annual mean nighttime light increased 3.8-fold during 2014-2019. Furthermore, diverse increases in the sizes of area and nighttime light intensity were identified from the mining camps. Among the studied camps, since 2017, Motomboto camp 3 showed a particularly rapid change in activity regardless of the season of the year. Hence, these approaches are capable of identifying rapid transformations in the mining activities and provide significant insight into the socio-environmental problems originating from the closed and vulnerable camp-based ASGM sector. Our results also contribute to developing rapid and appropriate interventions and strengthening environmental governance.</p>

TI  - Using Ecological Niche Models for Population and Range Estimates of a Threatened Snake Species (<i>Crotalus oreganus</i>) in Canada
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling the distribution and abundance of species at risk is extremely important for their conservation and management. We used ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict the occurrence of western rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) in British Columbia (BC), Canada. We applied this to existing population estimates to support a threshold of occurrence for management and conservation. We also identified predictors influencing rattlesnake distribution and abundance in this region. Using a Geographic Information Systems platform, we incorporated ENMs, capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and radio-telemetry results, province-wide observations, Landsat imagery and provincial databases for agricultural land use to produce quantitative, spatially explicit, population estimates across BC. Using available western rattlesnake habitat estimated at 183.9 km(2) and averaging estimates calculated from densities in three study populations, we generated a mean adult population size of 9722 (& PLUSMN;SD 3009; 0.8 relative index of occurrence [RIO] threshold). Only a small area (21.6 km(2)) of suitable land cover was located within protected areas, potentially protecting an estimated 1144 (& PLUSMN;354) adults. Most suitable land cover was within 500 m of roads (170.6 km(2)), representing potential habitat being used by an estimated 9017 (& PLUSMN;2791) adults. At the threshold RIO value chosen (0.8), only a very small area of farmland provided suitable land cover. Our results highlight the possibility of high mortality rates for western rattlesnakes near roads and the fact that protected areas do not provide sufficient coverage to conserve the population. Given that this species has relatively low mobility and high site fidelity to home ranges, our population estimate for BC provides a useful reference for the northern part of the species' range. It also fulfills a need to estimate population size within political jurisdictions where conservation management decisions are made, as well as presenting a method that can be applied to other parts of the range, including the southern United States. Our study provides an important benchmark for future monitoring of western rattlesnakes in BC using a repeatable and transparent approach. Similar applications can be extrapolated and applied for other threatened species to identify and quantify population distributions and threats, further supporting conservation prioritization tools to be used to maximize the effectiveness of conservation strategies under financial constraints.</p>

TI  - Agricultural Drought Detection with MODIS Based Vegetation Health Indices in Southeast Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts during the growing season are projected to increase in frequency and severity in Central Europe in the future. Thus, area-wide monitoring of agricultural drought in this region is becoming more and more important. In this context, it is essential to know where and when vegetation growth is primarily water-limited and whether remote sensing-based drought indices can detect agricultural drought in these areas. To answer these questions, we conducted a correlation analysis between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) within the growing season from 2001 to 2020 in Bavaria (Germany) and investigated the relationship with land cover and altitude. In the second step, we applied the drought indices Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) to primarily water-limited areas and evaluated them with soil moisture and agricultural yield anomalies. We found that, especially in the summer months (July and August), on agricultural land and grassland and below 800 m, NDVI and LST are negatively correlated and thus, water is the primary limiting factor for vegetation growth here. Within these areas and periods, the TCI and VHI correlate strongly with soil moisture and agricultural yield anomalies, suggesting that both indices have the potential to detect agricultural drought in Bavaria.

TI  - Lithium Potential Mapping Using Artificial Neural Networks: A Case Study from Central Portugal
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing importance and demand of lithium (Li) for industrial applications, in particular rechargeable Li-ion batteries, have led to a significant increase in exploration efforts for Li-bearing minerals. To ensure and expand a stable Li supply to the global economy, extensive research and exploration are necessary. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide powerful tools for exploration target identification. They can be cost-effectively applied in various geological settings. This article presents an integrated approach of Li exploration targeting using ANNs for data interpretation. Based on medium resolution geological maps (1:50,000) and stream sediment geochemical data (1 sample per 0.25 km(2)), the Li potential was calculated for an area of approximately 1200 km(2) in the surroundings of Bajoca Mine (Northeast Portugal). Extensive knowledge about geological processes leading to Li mineralisation (such as weathering conditions and diverse Li minerals) proved to be a determining factor in the exploration model. Furthermore, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was used in a separate ANN model to identify potential Li mine sites exposed on the ground surface by analysing the spectral signature of surface reflectance in well-known Li locations. Finally, the results were combined to design a final map of predicted Li mineralisation occurrences in the study area. The proposed approach reveals how remote sensing data in combination with geological and geochemical data can be used for delineating and ranking exploration targets of almost any deposit type.</p>

TI  - Estimating Vertical Distribution of Leaf Water Content within Wheat Canopies after Head Emergence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vertical profile of leaf water content (LWC) within wheat canopies after head emergence is vital significant for increasing crop yield. However, the estimation of vertical distribution of LWC from remote sensing data is still challenging due to the effects of wheat spikes and the efficacy of sensor measurement from the nadir direction. Using two-year field experiments with different growth stages after head emergence, N rates, wheat cultivars, we investigated the vertical distribution of LWC within canopies, the changes of canopy reflectance after spikes removal, the relationship between spectral indices and LWC in the upper-, middle- and bottom-layer. The interrelationship among vertical LWC were constructed, and four ratio of reflectance difference (RRD) type of indices were proposed based on the published WI and NDWSI indices to determine vertical distribution of LWC. The results indicated a bell shape distribution of LWC in wheat plants with the highest value appeared at the middle layer, and significant linear correlations between middle-LWC vs. upper-LWC and middle-LWC vs. bottom-LWC (r & GE; 0.92) were identified. The effects of wheat spikes on spectral reflectance mainly occurred in near infrared to shortwave infrared regions, which then decreased the accuracy of LWC estimation. Spectral indices at the middle layer outperformed the other two layers in LWC assessment and were less susceptible to wheat spikes effects, in particular, the newly proposed narrow-band WI-4 and NDWSI-4 indices exhibited great potential in tracking the changes of middle-LWC (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.84, respectively). By taking into account the effects of wheat spikes and the interrelationship of vertical LWC within canopies, an indirect induction strategy was developed for modeling the upper-LWC and bottom-LWC. It was found that the indirect induction models based on the WI-4 and NDWSI-4 indices were more effective than the models obtained from conventional direct estimation method, with R-2 of 0.78 and 0.81 for the upper-LWC estimation, and 0.75 and 0.74 for the bottom-LWC estimation, respectively.

TI  - Cancer of the corpus uteri: 2021 update
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in high- and middle-income countries. Although the overall prognosis is relatively good, high-grade endometrial cancers have a tendency to recur. Recurrence needs to be prevented since the prognosis for recurrent endometrial cancer is dismal. Treatment tailored to tumor biology is the optimal strategy to balance treatment efficacy against toxicity. Since The Cancer Genome Atlas defined four molecular subgroups of endometrial cancers, the molecular factors are increasingly used to define prognosis and treatment. Standard treatment consists of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Lymphadenectomy (and increasingly sentinel node biopsy) enables identification of lymph node-positive patients who need adjuvant treatment, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Adjuvant therapy is used for Stage I-II patients with high-risk factors and Stage III patients; chemotherapy is especially used in non-endometrioid cancers and those in the copy-number high molecular group characterized by TP53 mutation. In advanced disease, a combination of surgery to no residual disease and chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy results in the best outcome. Surgery for recurrent disease is only advocated in patients with a good performance status with a relatively long disease-free interval.

TI  - Phytoplankton Genera Structure Revealed from the Multispectral Vertical Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The composition of phytoplankton and the concentration of pigments in their cells make their absorption and specific absorption coefficients key parameters for bio-optical modeling. This study investigated whether the multispectral vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient of downward irradiance (K-d) gradients could be a good framework for accessing phytoplankton genera. In situ measurements of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), obtained in an Amazon Floodplain Lake (Lago Grande do Curuai), were used to invert K-d, focusing on Sentinel-3/Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor bands. After that, an analysis based on the organization of three-way tables (STATICO) was applied to evaluate the relationships between phytoplankton genera and K-d at different OLCI bands. Our results indicate that phytoplankton genera are organized according to their ability to use light intensity and different spectral ranges of visible light (400 to 700 nm). As the light availability changes seasonally, the structure of phytoplankton changes as well. Some genera, such as Microcystis, are adapted to low light intensity at 550-650 nm, therefore high values of K-d in this range would indicate the dominance of Microcysts. Other genera, such as Aulacoseira, are highly adapted to harvesting blue-green light with higher intensity and probably grow in lakes with lower concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter that highly absorbs blue light (405-498). These findings are an important step to describing phytoplankton communities using orbital data in tropical freshwater floodplains. Furthermore, this approach can be used with biodiversity indexes to access phytoplankton diversity in these environments.

TI  - Day-Night Monitoring of Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> and Ash Clouds for Aviation Avoidance at Northern Polar Latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe NASA's Applied Sciences Disasters Program, which is a collaborative project between the Direct Readout Laboratory (DRL), ozone processing team, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Geographic Information Network of Alaska (GINA), and Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), to expedite the processing and delivery of direct readout (DR) volcanic ash and sulfur dioxide (SO2) satellite data. We developed low-latency quantitative retrievals of SO2 column density from the solar backscattered ultraviolet (UV) measurements using the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) spectrometers as well as the thermal infrared (TIR) SO2 and ash indices using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments, all flying aboard US polar-orbiting meteorological satellites. The VIIRS TIR indices were developed to address the critical need for nighttime coverage over northern polar regions. Our UV and TIR SO2 and ash software packages were designed for the DRL's International Planetary Observation Processing Package (IPOPP); IPOPP runs operationally at GINA and FMI stations in Fairbanks, Alaska, and Sodankyla, Finland. The data are produced within 30 min of satellite overpasses and are distributed to the Alaska Volcano Observatory and Anchorage Volcanic Ash Advisory Center. FMI receives DR data from GINA and posts composite Arctic maps for ozone, volcanic SO2, and UV aerosol index (UVAI, proxy for ash or smoke) on its public website and provides DR data to EUMETCast users. The IPOPP-based software packages are available through DRL to a broad DR user community worldwide.

TI  - Mapping Global Urban Impervious Surface and Green Space Fractions Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban impervious surfaces area (ISA) and green space (GS), two primary components of urban environment, are pivotal in detecting urban environmental quality and addressing global environmental change issues. However, the current global mapping of ISA and GS is not effective enough to accurately delineate in urban areas due to the mosaicked and complex structure. To address the issue, the hierarchical architecture principle and subpixel metric method were applied to map 30 m global urban ISA and GS fractions for the years 2015 and circa 2020. We use random forest algorithms for retrieval of the Normalized Settlement Density Index and Normalized Green Space Index from Landsat images using Google Earth Engine. The correlation coefficients of global urban ISA and GS fractions were all higher than 0.9 for 2015 and circa 2020. Our results show global urban ISA and GS areas in circa 2020 were 31.19 x 10(4) km(2) and 17.16 x 10(4) km(2), respectively. The novel ISA and GS fractions product can show potential applications in assessing the effects of urbanization on climate, ecology, and urban sustainability.

T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION AND IMAGE ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The scattering and absorption characteristics of different clouds may vary due to regional, seasonal, altitude and physical properties of the clouds. Spatial techniques have been employed which has failed to perform adequately in all the required environments. Whereas the present work focuses on detection of convective clouds using the state-of-the-art normalized split window method (near 3.9 and 11.3 mu m) called normalized difference cloud index (NDCI) from National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration (NOAA) data. Convective clouds have been examined in different regions of India using NDCI method from NOAA images. It has been reported that index values of convective clouds differ in different seasons. These extracted cloud data have been then compared with supervised classification of the same data in ERDAS imagine software and the overall accuracy has significantly improved.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we developed technology which can exclude effect of clouds to perform remote waterbody detection based on Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery to calculate the area of ungauged reservoirs and applied to the Hwanggang dam reservoir, a representative ungauged reservoir, to verify usability. The remote waterbody detection technology calculates the cloud blocking ratio by comparing the cloud boundary in the Sentinel-2 imagery and the reservoir boundary first. Next, it selects data whose cloud blocking ratio does not exceed a specific value and calculates NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) with selected imagery. In last, it calculates the area of the reservoir by counting the number of grids which have NDWI value considered as waterbody within the boundary of the target reservoir and correcting with cloud blocking ratio. To determine cloud blocking ratio threshold for selecting image, we performed the area calculation of Hwanggang dam reservoir from July 2018 to October 2021. As a result, when the cloud blocking ratio threshold was set 10%, we confirmed that the result with large error due to clouds were filtered well and obtained 114 results that can show changes in Hwanggang dam reservoir area among 220 images.

TI  - Towards Robust Calculation of Interannual CO<sub>2</sub> Growth Signal from TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The CO2 growth rate is one of the key geophysical quantities reflecting the dynamics of climate change as atmospheric CO2 growth is the primary driver of global warming. As recent studies have shown that TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network) measurement footprints embrace quasi-global coverage, we examined the sensitivity of TCCON to the global CO2 growth. To this end, we used the aggregated TCCON observations (2006-2019) to retrieve Annual Growth Rate of CO2 (AGR) at global scales. The global AGR estimates from TCCON (AGRTCCON) are robust and independent, from (a) the station-wise seasonality, from (b) the differences in time series across the TCCON stations, and from (c) the type of TCCON stations used in the calculation ("background" or "contaminated" by neighboring CO2 sources). The AGRTCCON potential error, due to the irregular data sampling is relatively low (2.4-17.9%). In 2006-2019, global AGRTCCON ranged from the minimum of 1.59 +/- 2.27 ppm (2009) to the maximum of 3.27 +/- 0.82 ppm (2016), whereas the uncertainties express sub-annual variability and the data gap effects. The global AGRTCCON magnitude is similar to the reference AGR from satellite data (AGRSAT = 1.57-2.94 ppm) and the surface-based estimates of Global Carbon Budget (AGRGCB = 1.57-2.85). The highest global CO2 growth rate (2015/2016), caused by the record El Nino, was nearly perfectly reproduced by the TCCON (AGRTCCON = 3.27 +/- 0.82 ppm vs. AGRSAT = 3.23 +/- 0.50 ppm). The overall agreement between global AGRTCCON with the AGR references was yet weakened (r = 0.37 for TCCON vs. SAT; r = 0.50 for TCCON vs. GCB) due to two years (2008, 2015). We identified the drivers of this disagreement; in 2008, when only few stations were available worldwide, the AGRTCCON uncertainties were excessively high (AGRTCCON = 2.64 ppm with 3.92 ppm or 148% uncertainty). Moreover, in 2008 and 2015, the ENSO-driven bias between global AGRTCCON and the AGR references were detected. TCCON-to-reference agreement is dramatically increased if the years with ENSOrelated biases (2008, 2015) are forfeited (r = 0.67 for TCCON vs. SAT, r = 0.82 for TCCON vs. GCB). To conclude, this is the first study that showed promising ability of aggregated TCCON signal to capture global CO2 growth. As the TCCON coverage is expanding, and new versions of TCCON data are being published, multiple data sampling strategies, dynamically changing TCCON global measurement footprint, and the irregular sensitivity of AGRTCCON to strong ENSO events; all should be analyzed to transform the current efforts into a first operational algorithm for retrieving global CO2 growth from TCCON data.

TI  - System Calibration Including Time Delay Estimation for GNSS/INS-Assisted Pushbroom Scanners Onboard UAV Platforms
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with imaging sensors and integrated global navigation satellite system/inertial navigation system (GNSS/INS) units are used for numerous applications. Deriving reliable 3D coordinates from such UAVs is contingent on accurate geometric calibration, which encompasses the estimation of mounting parameters and synchronization errors. Through a rigorous impact analysis of such systematic errors, this article proposes a direct approach for spatial and temporal calibration (estimating system parameters through a bundle adjustment procedure) of a GNSS/INS-assisted pushbroom scanner onboard a UAV platform. The calibration results show that the horizontal and vertical accuracies are within the ground sampling distance of the sensor. Unlike for frame camera systems, this article also shows that the indirect approach is not a feasible solution for pushbroom scanners due to their limited ability for decoupling system parameters. This finding provides further support that the direct approach is recommended for spatial and temporal calibration of UAV pushbroom scanner systems.

TI  - Spatial prediction of soil depth using environmental covariates by quantile regression forest model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of soil depth for larger areas provides primary information on soil depth and its spatial distribution that becomes vital for land resource management, crop, nutrient, and ecosystem modeling. The present study assessed the spatial distribution of soil depth over 160,205 km(2) of Andhra Pradesh, India, using 20 covariables by quantile regression forest (QRF). An aggregate of 2854 soil datasets compiled from various physiographic units were randomly partitioned into 80:20 ratio for calibration (2283 samples) and validation (571 samples). Landsat imagery, terrain datasets (8), and bioclimatic factors (11) were utilized as covariates. The QRF model outputs signified that precipitation, multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness (MrVBF), mean diurnal range, isothermality, and elevation were the most important variables influencing soil depth variability across the landscape. Spatial prediction of soil depth by QRF model yielded a ME of - 1.81 cm, RMSE of 34 cm, PICP of 90.2, and a R-2 value of 42% as compared to ordinary kriging which results in a ME of - 0.14 cm, a RMSE of 37 cm, and a R-2 value of 32%. As soil depth is spatially dynamic and has significant correlation with terrain and environmental covariates, better prediction was possible by the QRF model. However, high-density bioclimatic variables could be utilized along with high-resolution terrain variables to improve the predictive accuracy.

TI  - Detection of Forest Fire Damage from Sentinel-1 SAR Data through the Synergistic Use of Principal Component Analysis and K-means Clustering
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire poses a significant threat to the environment and society, affecting carbon cycle and surface energy balance, and resulting in socioeconomic losses. Widely used multi-spectral satellite image-based approaches for burned area detection have a problem in that they do not work under cloudy conditions. Therefore, in this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Europe Space Agency, which can be collected in all weather conditions, were used to identify forest fire damaged area based on a series of processes including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. Four forest fire cases, which occurred in Gangneung. Donghae and Goseong.Sokcho in Gangwon-do of South Korea and two areas in North Korea on April 4, 2019, were examined. The estimated burned areas were evaluated using fire reference data provided by the National Institute of Forest Science (NIFOS) for two forest fire cases in South Korea, and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) for all four cases. The average accuracy using the NIFOS reference data was 86% for the Gangneung . Donghae and Goseong . Sokcho fires. Evaluation using dNBR showed an average accuracy of 84% for all four forest fire cases. It was also confirmed that the stronger the burned intensity, the higher detection the accuracy, and vice versa. Given the advantage of SAR remote sensing, the proposed statistical processing and K-means clustering-based approach can be used to quickly identify forest fire damaged area across the Korean Peninsula, where a cloud cover rate is high and small-scale forest fires frequently occur.

TI  - A Study on the Possibility of Short-term Monitoring of Coastal Topography Changes Using GOCI-II
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intertidal zone, which is a transitional zone between the ocean and the land, requires continuous monitoring as various changes occur rapidly due to artificial activity and natural disturbance. Monitoring of coastal topography changes using remote sensing method is evaluated to be effective in overcoming the limitations of intertidal zone accessibility and observing long-term topographic changes in intertidal zone. Most of the existing coastal topographic monitoring studies using remote sensing were conducted through high spatial resolution images such as Landsat and Sentinel. This study extracted the waterline using the NDWI from the GOCI-II (Geostationary Ocean Color Satellite-II) data, identified the changes in the intertidal area in Gyeonggi Bay according to various tidal heights, and examined the utility of DEM generation and topography altitude change observation over a short period of time. GOCIII (249 scenes), Sentinel-2A/B (39 scenes), Landsat 8 OLI (7 scenes) images were obtained around Gyeonggi Bay from October 8, 2020 to August 16, 2021. If generating intertidal area DEM, Sentinel and Landsat images required at least 3 months to 1 year of data collection, but the GOCI-II satellite was able to generate intertidal area DEM in Gyeonggi Bay using only one day of data according to tidal heights, and the topography altitude was also observed through exposure frequency. When observing coastal topography changes using the GOCI-II satellite, it would be a good idea to detect topography changes early through a short cycle and to accurately interpolate and utilize insufficient spatial resolutions using multi-remote sensing data of high resolution. Based on the above results, it is expected that it will be possible to quickly provide information necessary for the latest topographic map and coastal management of the Korean Peninsula by expanding the research area and developing technologies that can be automatically analyzed and detected.

TI  - A Study of Establishment and application Algorithm of Artificial Intelligence Training Data on Land use/cover Using Aerial Photograph and Satellite Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine ways to increase efficiency in constructing and verifying artificial intelligence learning data on land cover using aerial and satellite images, and in applying the data to AI learning algorithms. To this end, multi-resolution datasets of 0.51 m and 10 m each for 8 categories of land cover were constructed using high-resolution aerial images and satellite images obtained from Sentinel-2 satellites. Furthermore, fine data (a total of 17,000 pieces) and coarse data (a total of 33,000 pieces) were simultaneously constructed to achieve the following two goals: precise detection of land cover changes and the establishment of large-scale learning datasets. To secure the accuracy of the learning data, the verification was performed in three steps, which included data refining, annotation, and sampling. The learning data that was finally verified was applied to the semantic segmentation algorithms U-Net and DeeplabV3+, and the results were analyzed. Based on the analysis, the average accuracy for land cover based on aerial imagery was 77.8% for U-Net and 76.3% for DeeplabV3+, while for land cover based on satellite imagery it was 91.4% for U-Net and 85.8% for DeeplabV3+. The artificial intelligence learning datasets on land cover constructed using high-resolution aerial and satellite images in this study can be used as reference data to help classify land cover and identify relevant changes. Therefore, it is expected that this study's findings can be used in the future in various fields of artificial intelligence studying land cover in constructing an artificial intelligence learning dataset on land cover of the whole of Korea.

TI  - Lymphedema in Endometrial Cancer Survivor: A Nationwide Cohort Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in developed countries. Treatment-related lymphedema negatively affects the quality of life and function of patients. This study investigated the cumulative incidence and risk factors of, and utilization of health care resources for, lymphedema in patients with endometrial cancer. Methods: We conducted a nationwide, retrospective cohort study of women with endometrial cancer who underwent cancer-direct treatment using the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database. Patients were categorized by age, region, income, and treatment modality. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the incidence and risk factors of lymphedema. We also analyzed utilization of health care resources for lymphedema using diagnostic and treatment claim codes. Results: A total of 19,027 patients with endometrial cancer were evaluated between January 2004 and December 2017. Among them, 2493 (13.1%) developed lymphedema. Age (<40 years, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1 vs. 40-59 years, aOR = 1.413; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.203-1.66 vs. 60+ years, aOR = 1.472; 95% CI 1.239-1.748) and multimodal treatment (surgery only, aOR = 1 vs. surgery + radiation + chemotherapy, aOR = 2.571; 95% CI 2.27-2.912) are considered to be possible risk factors for lymphedema in patients with endometrial cancer (p < 0.001). The utilization of health care resources for the treatment of lymphedema has increased over the years. Conclusions: Lymphedema is a common complication affecting women with endometrial cancer and leads to an increase in national healthcare costs. Post-treatment surveillance of lymphedema, especially in high-risk groups, is needed.

TI  - Analysis of Surface Urban Heat Island and Land Surface Temperature Using Deep Learning Based Local Climate Zone Classification: A Case Study of Suwon and Daegu, Korea
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization increases the amount of impervious surface and artificial heat emission, resulting in urban heat island (UHI) effect. Local climate zones (LCZ) are a classification scheme for urban areas considering urban land cover characteristics and the geometry and structure of buildings, which can be used for analyzing urban heat island effect in detail. This study aimed to examine the UHI effect by urban structure in Suwon and Daegu using the LCZ scheme. First, the LCZ maps were generated using Landsat 8 images and convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning over the two cities. Then, Surface UHI (SUHI), which indicates the land surface temperature (LST) difference between urban and rural areas, was analyzed by LCZ class. The results showed that the overall accuracies of the CNN models for LCZ classification were relatively high 87.9% and 81.7% for Suwon and Daegu, respectively. In general, Daegu had higher LST for all LCZ classes than Suwon. For both cities, LST tended to increase with increasing building density with relatively low building height. For both cities, the intensity of SUHI was very high in summer regardless of LCZ classes and was also relatively high except for a few classes in spring and fall. In winter the SUHI intensity was low, resulting in negative values for many LCZ classes. This implies that UHI is very strong in summer, and some urban areas often are colder than rural areas in winter. The research findings demonstrated the applicability of the LCZ data for SUHI analysis and can provide a basis for establishing timely strategies to respond urban on-going climate change over urban areas.

TI  - Nationwide Social Distancing and the Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections
T2  - YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing) are recommended to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses. However, few epidemiological studies have assessed whether social distancing in actual settings reduces the disease burden of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) in the general population. Accordingly, we aimed to assess associations between nationwide social distancing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-COVID-19 SARIs. We collected data on SARI epidemiologic characteristics recorded from January 2018 through December 2020 from the nationwide sentinel SARI surveillance data maintained by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The number of SARIs per 1000 hospitalized patients decreased significantly to 18.61, 18.15, and 6.25 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (p<0.001), respectively, during the surveillance period of 3 years. The number of intensive care unit admissions associated with SARIs per 1000 hospitalized patients was 0.83, 0.69, and 0.54 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (p< 0.001), respectively, and the number of SARI-associated mortalities per 1000 patients was 0.42, 0.29, and 0.27 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (p<0.001), respectively. Moreover, SARIs had two peak seasons in 2 years of the surveillance period (2018 and 2019). However, seasonality was not observed since social distancing was initiated. Our sentinel surveillance data demonstrated a remarkable reduction in SARI disease burden and a change in seasonality following the implementation of nationwide social distancing. Accordingly, we suggest that social distancing could be effective in forthcoming seasonal epidemics of non-COVID-19 origin, although the impact thereof on other aspects of society needs to be carefully considered.

TI  - Coastal Retreat Due to Thermodenudation on the Yugorsky Peninsula, Russia during the Last Decade, Update since 2001-2010
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermodenudation on the Kara seacoast, the Yugorsky Peninsula, Russia, is studied by analyzing remote-sensing data. Landforms resulting from the thaw of tabular ground ice, referred to as thermocirques, are formed due to polycyclic retrogressive thaw slumps, during the last decade 2010-2020. We calculate the retreat rate of the thermocirque edge using various statistical approaches. We compared thermocirque outlines by the end of each time interval defined by the dates of available very-high-resolution imagery. Six thermocirques within two key sites on the Yugorsky peninsula are monitored. We correlate each of the thermocirque edge's retreat rates to various climatic parameters obtained at the Amderma weather station to understand the interrelation patterns better. As a result, we find a very low correlation between the retreat rate of each thermocirque and summer warmth, rainfall, and wave action. In general, the activity of thermodenudation decreases in time from the previous decade (2001-2010) to 2010-2020, and from 2010 towards 2020, although the summer warmth trend increases dramatically. A single thermocirque or series of thermocirques expand in response to environmental and geological factors in coastal retreat caused by thermodenudation.</p>

TI  - Gender parity in international organizations: discourses v numbers
T2  - RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the history of contemporary feminism, women's presence in the public sphere has been a perennial issue, demanding all sorts of strategies to promote women's inclusion in the economic and political arenas. Starting in the 1980s, feminist scholars in International Relations have questioned the absence of women in the international arena, alongside the pervasive gender hierarchies of the international system. Not only was it that women had been systematically excluded from politics, but the scholarship in IR had largely ignored feminist claims about the gendering of international politics. Largely animated by feminist movements and the nascent feminist debates in IR, the World Conferences on Women (1975, 1980, 1985, and 1995) stressed the paramount need for taking women's demands seriously. Such demands encompassed social, economic, and political domains, echoing decades of feminist struggles in the first, second and third worlds. The United Nations played a crucial role in fostering an agenda of gender equality and women's rights as human rights, which have been a quintessential part of the Millennium Development Goals and, more recently, the Sustainable Development Goals.Furthermore, gender-oriented policies have been promoted in myriad UN agencies and international organisations, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Despite all these efforts purporting to raise awareness about gender equality and women's rights, as well as about the need for more inclusive policies for women in the international arena, women's presence in international fora as leaders has been remarkably low. As for the United Nations,until now no woman has been elected to the organisation's highest post, that of secretary general, and only recently the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have had female managing directors. These sobering results show a different picture of international organisations that promote gender equality as their political and social commitment, whilst failing to comply with the very same discourse when it comes to women's leadership in their formal structures. In this context, the present article aims to assess quantitatively and qualitatively women's presence in leadership roles at the United Nations and international economic organisations (namely, the IMF,WB and World Trade Organisation). It departs from the following research question: What is the current state of affairs of women's participation in the highest posts of the United Nations and the international organizations of the global economic system? Methodologically, we resort to descriptive statistical data of women's presence at various agencies of the United Nations and the aforementioned economic institutions from 1990-2018. Of greatest concern will be those occupying the posts of presidency and vice-presidency.Counting women is a traditional approach in feminist studies in IR, and it is a paramount step in making women count. The second goal of our paper, thus, derives directly from the data: by mapping the few women occupying positions of leadership in international organisations, we can assess the gender structures operating to the disadvantage of women. In order to do so, we resort to feminist theories as developed in political science and IR, for they provide the conceptual tools to provide data with meaning. We focus primarily on how gendered institutions confine women to specific gendered roles that emanate from the private sphere of domesticity. This means that women suffer from various exclusionary dynamics: firstly, they are excluded from leadership roles for the fact of being women; secondly, the few who manage to break through the glass ceiling of a masculine international arena are assigned positions that mimic the elements of the private sphere. Frequently, female leaders are responsible for social issues,childhood, food security, education, and culture, all of which are labeled as soft issues, or belonging to the domain of low politics.Feminist IR scholars have extensively denounced these gendered structures as part of how men preserve their privileges under the framework of hegemonic masculinity. Therefore,we draw on the work of several IR feminists who are concerned with the theoretical questioning and empirical unravelling of such gender hierarchies to interpret our data beyond the mere counting of women. We contend that women in leadership roles in the United Nations and international economic organisations more frequently occupy portfolios that are seen as soft issues or low politics. Likewise, these roles are often associated with the care for others, which reinforces gender roles and hierarchies. Women are more likely to occupy the presidencies and vice-presidencies of agencies such as UNICEF, UNESCO,WFP, and OHCHR, all of which deal with issues associated with childhood, education, culture, food security and human rights. We conclude that an apparent glass ceiling the invisible barrier that prevents women from reaching higher and more prestigious posts in their professional careers - still remains in international institutions,limiting the participation of women in decision-making fora. The few female leaders who manage to reach the highest posts in the international arena are more likely to be exceptions of a pervasive phenomenon of gender inequality and lack of representativeness. The discourses embraced by the United Nations and international economic organisations fail to meet the minimal criteria for gender parity within these organizations' structures, and even where women have been assigned leadership roles, gender stereotypes still prevail. Further evidence revealed in our research refers to the regional representativeness of the few female leaders in these international organisations: about 55% of them come from Western Europe and North America. Latin American and African women are strongly underrepresented in the United Nations system, as well as in the Bretton Woods institutions, which is itself problematic because the particular perspectives of women from the Global South are also excluded from debates in these international fora.Therefore, international organisations also face the challenge of fostering the diversity of feminist perspectives by developing strategies to include Global South women in their formal structure, ideally as leaders. In this sense, our paper draws attention to the importance of pluralism not only in terms of gender parity, but also of a feminist worldview. In order to make women count in the international arena, the United Nations and international economic organisations have to fully commit themselves to concrete policies for women's inclusion, not only as heads of the institutions, but also in lower hierarchies where policies are designed. Only by acknowledging that women's perspectives matter, can we achieve the goals of gender equality.

TI  - Fetal Heart Rate Nadir During Bradycardia and Umbilical Artery Acidemia at Birth
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Although rare, fetal bradycardia caused by cord prolapse, placental abruption, or uterine rupture is associated with sudden and prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate. When this occurs, there is an association between the bradycardia-to-delivery interval and umbilical artery pH at birth. In the absence of such sentinel events, the bradycardia-to-delivery interval has not been clearly and consistently associated with umbilical artery pH <7.00 at birth. Although expedited delivery is indicated if the fetal heart rate does not return to baseline within 10 minutes, there are limited data on the neonatal prognosis in these situations. The aim of this study is to determine whether the depth of bradycardia without a sentinel event increased the risk of acidemia at birth.This was a retrospective study based on the obstetric records of mothers and infants at an academic hospital in Paris between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018. Included were at-term, singleton infants who were delivered via cesarean delivery for bradycardia. Excluded were infants whose bradycardia was associated with a sentinel event, including cord prolapse, placental abruption, or uterine rupture. The infants were divided into 2 groups for comparison: those with an umbilical artery pH <7.00 (acidosis group) and those with umbilical artery pH >= 7.00 (nonacidosis group).A total of 111 infants were included in the analysis, 32 in the acidosis group and 79 in the nonacidosis group. The median nadir of bradycardia was 60 beats per minute (bpm) in the acidosis group compared with 70 bpm in the nonacidosis group (with interquartile range [IQR], 56-65 and 60-76, respectively; P < 0.01). The optimal threshold to predict acidemia was a bradycardia nadir <60 bpm, with sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of 89.8%, 28.1%, 1.3, and 0.4, respectively. This threshold was met more frequently in the acidosis group versus the nonacidosis group (10 [31%] vs 10 [13%]; odds ratio, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.10-9.04). In addition, the median bradycardia-to-delivery intervals in the acidosis group and nonacidosis group were 22 minutes and 24 minutes, respectively (IQR, 19-25 and 22-28, respectively; P < 0.01). The median intervals between the decision to perform a cesarean delivery to delivery were 11 minutes and 12 minutes, respectively (IQR, 19-25 and 22-28, P < 0.02). There was no association between the bradycardia nadir and either the bradycardia-to-delivery interval (P = 0.23) or decision-to-delivery interval (P = 0.09).In cases of fetal bradycardia not caused by cord prolapse, placental abruption, or uterine rupture, bradycardia nadir <60 bpm was associated with 3 times the risk of acidemia at birth.

TI  - Highly anomalous fire emissions from the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - While it is widely recognized that extreme fires have been increasing under warming and drying climate, knowledge regarding the magnitude and intensity of extreme fires is very limited. Moreover, fire emissions reported by existing emissions inventories show large discrepancies due to different approaches and parameters. In this study, we analyzed the fire intensity and emissions magnitude of the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires using fire observations from multiple satellites. The results show that the bushfires were extreme in both their number and intensity, which were higher by a factor of 25 and 19, respectively, compared to the past two-decade seasonal mean. The 2019-2020 bushfires burned a total of 112.3 Tg biomass and released 178.6 +/- 13.6 Tg CO2 (carbon dioxide), 1.71 +/- 1.28 Tg PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter mu m), and 0.061 +/- 0.04 Tg BC (black carbon) across eastern and southern Australia. The CO2 emissions are 35% of Australia's greenhouse emissions from all sectors combined in 2020. Furthermore, the extreme fires in the most severe day and hour released 10% and 1.4% of the entire seasonal emissions, respectively. Our findings provide quantitative information for investigating the impacts of smoke emissions on air quality, ecosystem, and climate.

TI  - Fine-Scale NDVI Reconstruction Back to 1906 from Tree-Rings in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and related disturbances, such as drought, water, and heat stress, are causing forest decline resulting in regime shifts. Conventional studies have combined tree-ring width (TRW) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to reconstruct NDVI values and ignored the influences of mixed land covers. We built an integrated TRW-NDVI model and reconstructed the annual NDVI maps by using 622 Landsat satellite images and tree cores from 15 plots using point-by-point regression. Our model performed well in the study area, as demonstrated by significant reconstructions for 71.14% (p < 0.05) of the area with the exclusion of water and barren areas. The error rate between the reconstructed NDVI using the conventional approach and our approach could reach 10.36%. The 30 m resolution reconstructed NDVI images in the recent 100 years clearly displayed a decrease in vegetation density and detected decades-long regime shifts from 1906 to 2015. Our study site experienced five regime shifts, markedly the 1930s and 1950s, which were megadroughts across North America. With fine resolution maps, regime shifts could be observed annually at the centennial scale. They can also be used to understand how the Yellowstone ecosystem has gradually changed with its ecological legacies in the last century.

TI  - PolSAR Ship Detection with Optimal Polarimetric Rotation Domain Features and SVM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) can obtain fully polarimetric information, which provides chances to better understand target scattering mechanisms. Ship detection is an important application of PolSAR and a number of scattering mechanism-based ship detection approaches have been established. However, the backscattering of manmade targets including ships is sensitive to the relative geometry between target orientation and radar line of sight, which makes ship detection still challenging. This work aims at mitigating this issue by target scattering diversity mining and utilization in polarimetric rotation domain with the interpretation tools of polarimetric coherence and correlation pattern techniques. The core idea is to find an optimal combination of polarimetric rotation domain features which shows the best potential to discriminate ship target and sea clutter pixel candidates. With the Relief method, six polarimetric rotation domain features derived from the polarimetric coherence and correlation patterns are selected. Then, a novel ship detection method is developed thereafter with these optimal features and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The underlying physics is that ship detection is equivalent to ship and sea clutter classification after the ocean and land partition. Four kinds of spaceborne PolSAR datasets from Radarsat-2 and GF-3 are used for comparison experiments. The superiority of the proposed detection methodology is clearly demonstrated. The proposed method achieves the highest figure of merit (FoM) of 99.26% and 100% for two Radarsat-2 datasets, and of 95.45% and 99.96% for two GF-3 datasets. Specially, the proposed method shows better performance to detect inshore dense ships and reserve the ship structure.

TI  - Greening vs browning? Surface water cover mediates how tundra and boreal ecosystems respond to climate warming
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming in northern high latitudes has progressed twice as fast as the global average, leading to prominent but puzzling changes in vegetation structure and functioning of tundra and boreal ecosystems. While some regions are becoming greener, others have lost or shifted vegetation condition as indicated by a browning signal. The mechanisms underlying this 'greening or browning enigma' remain poorly understood. Here we use multi-sourced time-series of satellite-derived vegetation indices to reveal that spectral greening is associated with reductions in surface water cover (i.e. fraction of surface water bodies), whereas spectral browning is linked to increases in surface water cover. These patterns are consistently observed from both 30 m resolution Landsat data and 250 m resolution MODIS data on the basis of grid cells sized of 1, 2 and 4 km. Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first biome-scale demonstration that interactions between vegetation condition and water cover change can explain the contrasting trajectories of ecosystem dynamics across the northern high latitudes in response to climate warming. These divergent trajectories we identified have major implications for ecosystem functioning, carbon sequestration and feedbacks to the climate system. Further unraveling the interaction between vegetation and surface water will be essential if we are to understand the fate of tundra and boreal biomes in a warming climate.

TI  - Detecting High-Rise Buildings from Sentinel-2 Data Based on Deep Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-rise buildings (HRBs) as a modern and visually distinctive land use play an important role in urbanization. Large-scale monitoring of HRBs is valuable in urban planning and environmental protection and so on. Due to the complex 3D structure and seasonal dynamic image features of HRBs, it is still challenging to monitor large-scale HRBs in a routine way. This paper extends our previous work on the use of the Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) model to extract HRBs from Sentinel-2 data by studying the influence of seasonal and spatial factors on the performance of the FCN model. 16 Sentinel-2 subset images covering four diverse regions in four seasons were selected for training and validation. Our results indicate the performance of the FCN-based method at the extraction of HRBs from Sentinel-2 data fluctuates among seasons and regions. The seasonal change of accuracy is larger than that of the regional change. If an optimal season can be chosen to get a yearly best result, F1 score of detected HRBs can reach above 0.75 for all regions with most errors located on the boundary of HRBs. FCN model can be trained on seasonally and regionally combined samples to achieve similar or even better overall accuracy than that of the model trained on an optimal combination of season and region. Uncertainties exist on the boundary of detected results and may be relieved by revising the definition of HRBs in a more rigorous way. On the whole, the FCN based method can be largely effective at the extraction of HRBs from Sentinel-2 data in regions with a large diversity in culture, latitude, and landscape. Our results support the possibility to build a powerful FCN model on a larger size of training samples for operational monitoring HRBs at the regional level or even on a country scale.

TI  - An Improved Eutrophication Assessment Algorithm of Estuaries and Coastal Waters in Liaodong Bay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is considered to be a significant threat to estuaries and coastal waters. Various localized studies on the world's oceans have recognized and confirmed that the Forel-Ule Color Index (FUI) or optical measurements are proportional to several water quality variables based on the relatively clear Chl-a-based waters. However, the application potential of FUI in the turbid estuary with complex optics has not been explored. In this study, we selected the coastal waters in the northern Liaodong Bay as the study area, using the field hyperspectral reflectances (R-rs) collected in 2018 to correct the hue angle and verify the Sentinel-2 images algorithm of FUI by in situ FUI in 2019-2020. The results show that there is a good agreement (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 1.32, MAPE = 1.25%). Trophic Level Index (TLI) was used to evaluate the eutrophication status. The relationship between the in situ FUI and TLI collected in 2018 was discussed based on the difference in the dominant components of waters, while a number of non-algae suspended solids in the estuaries and coastal waters led to the overestimation of eutrophication based on FUI. The R(560)-R(704) (when FUI is between 11 and 15) and R(665)/R(704) (when FUI is between 19 and 21) was employed to distinguish total suspended matter (TSM)-dominated systems in the FUI-based eutrophication assessment. Based on the analysis, a new approach to assessing the eutrophication of coastal waters in Liaodong Bay was developed, which proved to have good accuracy by the field data in 2019 and 2020 (accuracy is 79%). Finally, we used Sentinel-2 images from Google Earth from 2019 to 2020 and locally processed data from 2018 to analyze the FUI spatial distribution and spatial and temporal statistics of the trophic status in the northern Liaodong Bay. The results show that the northern Liaodong Bay always presented the distribution characteristics of high inshore and low outside, high in the southeast and low in the northwest. The nutrient status is the worst in spring and summer.

TI  - Reliability Evaluation of the Joint Observation of Cloud Top Height by FY-4A and HIMAWARI-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that the measurement of cloud top height (CTH) is important, and a geostationary satellite is an important measurement method. However, it is difficult for a single geostationary satellite to observe the global CTH, so joint observation by multiple satellites is imperative. We used both active and passive sensors to evaluate the reliability of joint observation of geostationary satellites, which includes consistency and accuracy. We analyzed the error of CTH of FY-4A and HIMAWARI-8 and the consistency between the two satellites and conducted research on the problem of missing measurement (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) has CTH data, but FY-4A/HIMAWARI-8 does not) of the two satellites. The results show that FY-4A and HIMAWARI-8 have good consistency and can be jointly observed, but the measurement of CTH of FY-4A and HIMAWARI-8 has large errors, and the error of FY-4A is greater than that of HIMAWIRI-8. The error of CTH is affected by the CTH, cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud type, and the consistency between the two satellites is mainly affected by the cloud type. FY-4A and HIMAWARI-8 have the problem of missing measurement. The missing rate of HIMAWARI-8 is greater than that of FY-4A, and the missing rate is not affected by the CTH, COT and surface type. Therefore, although FY-4A and HIMAWARI-8 have good consistency, the error of CTH and the problem of missing measurement still limit the reliability of their joint observation.

TI  - Generating 1 km Spatially Seamless and Temporally Continuous Air Temperature Based on Deep Learning over Yangtze River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature is one of the most essential variables in understanding global warming as well as variations of climate, hydrology, and eco-systems. However, current products and assimilation approaches alone can provide temperature data with high resolution, high spatio-temporal continuity, and high accuracy simultaneously (refer to 3H data). To explore this kind of potential, we proposed an integrated temperature downscaling framework by fusing multiple remotely sent, model-based, and in-situ datasets, which was inspired by point-surface data fusion and deep learning. First, all of the predictor variables were processed to maintain spatial seamlessness and temporal continuity. Then, a deep belief neural network was applied to downscale temperature with a spatial resolution of 1 km. To further enhance the model performance, calibration techniques were adopted by integrating station-based data. The results of the validation over the Yangtze River Basin indicated that the average Pearson correlation coefficient, RMSE, and MAE of downscaled temperature achieved 0.983, 1.96 degrees C, and 1.57 degrees C, respectively. After calibration, the RMSE and MAE were further decreased by similar to 20%. In general, the results and comparative analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the framework for generating 3H temperature datasets, which would be valuable for earth science studies.

TI  - Upscaling Evapotranspiration from a Single-Site to Satellite Pixel Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance for the validation of remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) products to solve the spatial-scale mismatch between site observations and remote sensing estimations. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework for obtaining the ground truth ET at the satellite pixel scale (1 x 1 km resolution in MODIS satellite imagery). The main idea of this framework is to first quantitatively evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface, then combine the eddy covariance (EC)-observed ET (ET_EC) to be able to compare and optimize the upscaling methods (among five data-driven and three mechanism-driven methods) through direct validation and cross-validation, and finally use the optimal method to obtain the ground truth ET at the satellite pixel scale. The results showed that the ET_EC was superior over homogeneous underlying surfaces with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.34 mm/d. Over moderately and highly heterogeneous underlying surfaces, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) method performed better (the RMSEs were 0.51 mm/d and 0.60 mm/d, respectively). Finally, an integrated method (namely, using the ET_EC for homogeneous surfaces and the GPR method for moderately and highly heterogeneous underlying surfaces) was proposed to obtain the ground truth ET over fifteen typical underlying surfaces in the Heihe River Basin. Furthermore, the uncertainty of ground truth ET was quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that the ground truth ET at the satellite pixel scale is relatively reliable with an uncertainty of 0.02-0.41 mm/d. The upscaling framework proposed in this paper can be used to obtain the ground truth ET at the satellite pixel scale and its uncertainty, and it has great potential to be applied in more regions around the globe for remotely senseyyyd ET products' validation.

TI  - A Novel Method for Estimating Spatial Distribution of Forest Above-Ground Biomass Based on Multispectral Fusion Data and Ensemble Learning Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing technology has been widely used in forest resources inventory. Due to the influence of satellite orbits, sensor parameters, sensor errors, and atmospheric effects, there are great differences in vegetation spectral information captured by different satellite sensor images. Spectral fusion technology can couple the advantages of different multispectral sensor images to produce new multispectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution, it has great potential for improving the spectral sensitivity of forest vegetation and alleviating the spectral saturation. However, how to quickly and effectively select the multi-spectral fusion data suitable for forest above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation is a very critical issue. This study proposes a scheme (RF-S) to comprehensively evaluate multispectral fused images and develop the appropriate model for forest AGB estimation, on the basis of random forest (RF) and the stacking ensemble algorithm. First, four classic fusion methods are used to fuse the preprocessed GaoFen-2 (GF-2) multispectral image with Sentinel-2 image to generate 12 fused Sentinel-like images. Secondly, we apply a comprehensive evaluation method to quickly select the optimal fused image for the follow-up research. Subsequently, two feature combination optimization methods are used to select feature variables from the three feature sets. Finally, the stacking ensemble algorithm based on model dynamic integration and hyperparameter automatic optimization, as well as some classic machine learners, are used to construct the forest AGB estimation model. The results show that the fused image NND_B3 (based on nearest neighbor diffusion pan sharpening method and Band3_Red) selected by the evaluation method proposed in this study has the best performance in AGB estimation. Using the stacking ensemble method and NND_B3 image, we get the highest estimation accuracy, with the adjusted R-2 and relative root mean square error (RMSEr) of 0.6306 and 15.53%, respectively. The AGB estimation RMSEr of NND_B3 is 19.95% and 24.90% lower than those of GF-2 and Sentinel-2, respectively. We also found that the multi-window texture factor has better performance in the area with low AGB, and it can suppress the overestimation significantly. The AGB spatial distribution estimated using the NND_B3 image matches the field observations well, indicating that the multispectral fusion image combined with the Stacking algorithm can increase the accuracy and saturation of the AGB estimates.

TI  - Different Temporal Stability and Responses to Droughts between Needleleaf Forests and Broadleaf Forests in North China during 2001-2018
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts can affect the physiological activity of trees, damage tissues, and even trigger mortality, yet the response of different forest types to drought at the decadal time scale remains uncertain. In this study, we used two remote sensing-based vegetation products, the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP), to explore the temporal stability of deciduous needleleaf forests (DNFs) and deciduous broadleaf forests (DBFs) in droughts and their legacy effects in North China from 2001 to 2018. The results of both products showed that the temporal stability of DBFs was consistently much higher than that of DNFs, even though the DBFs experienced extreme droughts and the DNFs did not. The DBFs also exhibited similar patterns in their legacy effects from droughts, with these effects extending up to 4 years after the droughts. These results indicate that DBFs have been better acclimated to drought events in North China. Furthermore, the results suggest that the GPP was more sensitive to water variability than EVI. These findings will be helpful for forest modeling, management, and conservation.

TI  - Influence of Varying Solar Zenith Angles on Land Surface Phenology Derived from Vegetation Indices: A Case Study in the Harvard Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices are widely used to derive land surface phenology (LSP). However, due to inconsistent illumination geometries, reflectance varies with solar zenith angles (SZA), which in turn affects the vegetation indices, and thus the derived LSP. To examine the SZA effect on LSP, the MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) product and a BRDF model were employed to derive LSPs under several constant SZAs (i.e., 0 & DEG;, 15 & DEG;, 30 & DEG;, 45 & DEG;, and 60 & DEG;) in the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. The LSPs derived under varying SZAs from the MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) and MODIS vegetation index products were used as baselines. The results show that with increasing SZA, NDVI increases but EVI decreases. The magnitude of SZA-induced NDVI/EVI changes suggests that EVI is more sensitive to varying SZAs than NDVI. NDVI and EVI are comparable in deriving the start of season (SOS), but EVI is more accurate when deriving the end of season (EOS). Specifically, NDVI/EVI-derived SOSs are relatively close to those derived from ground measurements, with an absolute mean difference of 8.01 days for NDVI-derived SOSs and 9.07 days for EVI-derived SOSs over ten years. However, a considerable lag exists for EOSs derived from vegetation indices, especially from the NDVI time series, with an absolute mean difference of 14.67 days relative to that derived from ground measurements. The SOSs derived from NDVI time series are generally earlier, while those from EVI time series are delayed. In contrast, the EOSs derived from NDVI time series are delayed; those derived from the simulated EVI time series under a fixed illumination geometry are also delayed, but those derived from the products with varying illumination geometries (i.e., MODIS NBAR product and MODIS vegetation index product) are advanced. LSPs derived from varying illumination geometries could lead to a difference spanning from a few days to a month in this case study, which highlights the importance of normalizing the illumination geometry when deriving LSP from NDVI/EVI time series.</p>

TI  - Phase-Based GLRT Detection of Moving Targets with Pixel Tracking in Low-Resolution SAR Image Sequences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide ground area monitoring with large coverage. However, achieving a wide observation scope comes at the cost of resolution reduction owing to the trade-off between these parameters in conventional SAR. In low-resolution imaging, the moving target appears unresolved, weakly scattered, and slow moving in the image sequence, which can be generated by the subaperture technique. This article proposes a novel moving target detection method. First, interferometric phase statistics are combined with the generalized likelihood ratio test detector. A pixel tracking strategy is further exploited to determine whether a motion signal is present. These methods rely on the approximation of both clutter and noise statistics using Gaussian distributions in a low-resolution scenario. In addition, the motion signals are imaged with a subpixel offset. The proposed method is primarily validated using four real image sequences from TerraSAR-X data, which represent two types of homogeneous areas. The results reveal that moving targets can be detected in nearby areas using this strategy. The method is compared with the stack averaged coherence change detection and particle-filter-based tracking strategies.
